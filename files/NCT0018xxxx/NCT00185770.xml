      Randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of reducing television, videotape and video&#xD;
      game use to prevent obesity, increase physical activity, improve physical fitness, and&#xD;
      decrease dietary fat and calorie intake among third grade children in twelve&#xD;
      ethnically-diverse elementary schools.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The United States has experienced dramatic increases in obesity among both children and&#xD;
      adults. Population-based primary prevention may hold the greatest promise. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      obesity prevention programs that have specifically attempted to reduce fat and calorie intake&#xD;
      and increase physical activity have been relatively ineffective at reducing body fatness. As&#xD;
      a result, there is a pressing need for innovative interventions to prevent obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children spend more time watching television and videotapes and playing video games than in&#xD;
      any other activity except sleeping. As a result, there has been widespread speculation that&#xD;
      television viewing might be one of the most easily modifiable causes of obesity among&#xD;
      children. This hypothesis has broad appeal, but has been difficult to validate.&#xD;
      Epidemiological studies have consistently found weak associations between media use and&#xD;
      childhood obesity, and additional epidemiological studies are unlikely to help clarify these&#xD;
      relationships.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose an innovative experimental model. In the current environment, in which television&#xD;
      viewing is already so prevalent, the question of greatest clinical, practical and policy&#xD;
      importance is: Will reducing television, videotape and video game use prevent childhood&#xD;
      obesity? As a foundation for this proposal, we have completed two pilot studies that&#xD;
      demonstrate (1) it is possible to significantly reduce children's television, videotape and&#xD;
      video game use and (2) that a school-based intervention to reduce children's television,&#xD;
      videotape and video game use may result in clinically significant decreases in adiposity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a school-based randomized controlled trial involving 12 ethnically- and&#xD;
      socioeconomically-diverse elementary schools and approximately 900 third graders. Six schools&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to receive an intervention to reduce television, videotape and&#xD;
      video game use and the other six schools will receive an attention-placebo control&#xD;
      intervention, to minimize the potential for compensatory rivalry or resentful demoralization.&#xD;
      Our proposed intervention model is derived directly from principles of Bandura's social&#xD;
      cognitive theory and includes a classroom curriculum and parent newsletters. The primary&#xD;
      intervention will be delivered throughout the third grade school year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey and physical assessments of all children will occur at baseline, at the end of 3rd&#xD;
      grade (post-test) and at the beginning and end of 4th grade (4 month and one year follow-ups,&#xD;
      respectively). A subsample of children will participate in 4 days of activity monitoring and&#xD;
      three 24-hour dietary recalls at baseline, post-test and one-year follow-up. Parents will be&#xD;
      interviewed by phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS: Compared to controls, third grade children exposed to a school-based&#xD;
      intervention to reduce time spent watching television and videotapes and playing video games,&#xD;
      will significantly reduce their body mass index (BMI, kg/m2). In addition, triceps skinfold&#xD;
      thickness and waist and hip ratio will be measured to further characterize changes in obesity&#xD;
      resulting from the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY HYPOTHESES: Children attending intervention schools will significantly decrease the&#xD;
      amount of time they spend watching television, watching videotapes and playing video games;&#xD;
      Children attending intervention schools will significantly increase their levels of moderate&#xD;
      to vigorous physical activity and total physical activity; Children attending intervention&#xD;
      schools will significantly improve their physical fitness; Children attending intervention&#xD;
      schools will significantly reduce their fat intakes and total calorie intakes; Children&#xD;
      attending intervention schools will significantly reduce the number of meals and snacks they&#xD;
      eat while watching television and videotapes or playing video games.&#xD;
