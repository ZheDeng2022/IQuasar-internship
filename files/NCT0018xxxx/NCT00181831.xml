  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to use proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy to look at&#xD;
      myo-Inositol containing compounds (Ino) and creatine + phosphocreatine (Cr) in the anterior&#xD;
      cingulate of 20 children with bipolar disorder between the ages of 6-17 years old free of&#xD;
      risperidone treatment and 20 children with bipolar disorder after an eight-week or longer&#xD;
      treatment with risperidone. For comparison, results will also be obtained from 20 controls&#xD;
      (without bipolar disorder or ADHD) of the same age and gender as well as from 20 children or&#xD;
      adolescents with a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      Ino/Cr levels in the anterior cingulate will correlate positively with manic symptoms using&#xD;
      the Young mania rating scale (YMRS). Ino/Cr levels in the anterior cingulate in the anterior&#xD;
      cingular gyrus will be lower in subjects who have received eight weeks or longer of&#xD;
      risperidone&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Choline containing compound (Cho) and creatine + phosphocreatine (Cr) have been found to be&#xD;
      greater in the orbitofrontal cortex of depressed adolescents. In addition, Cho/Cr has been&#xD;
      found to increase in the anterior cingulate in depressed patients with bipolar affective&#xD;
      disorder (BPD) compared with comparison subjects. Also, BPD subjects not taking&#xD;
      antidepressants had a significantly higher anterior cingulate Cho/Cr compared with subjects&#xD;
      taking antidepressants or comparison subjects. Therefore it would appear the frontal lobe&#xD;
      Cho/Cr is increased in depression. Given these findings, we are interested in looking at&#xD;
      subjects with mania to investigate if there may also be a biological marker for mania and&#xD;
      drug response. Mania measured using the YMRS have been associated with an increase in the&#xD;
      anterior cingulate Ino/Cr in manic children, adolescents, and adults with bipolar affective&#xD;
      disorder. In addition, children and adolescents who were responsive to lithium showed a&#xD;
      decrease in Ino/Cr levels after acute lithium treatment. We will test whether Ino/Cr levels&#xD;
      will correlate positively with manic symptoms using the YMRS, as well as whether overall&#xD;
      Ino/Cr levels will be lower for children and adolescents receiving risperidone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to use proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy to look at&#xD;
      myo-Inositol containing compounds (Ino) and creatine + phosphocreatine (Cr) in the anterior&#xD;
      cingulate of 20 children with bipolar disorder between the ages of 6-17 years old free of&#xD;
      risperidone treatment and 20 children with bipolar disorder after an eight-week or longer&#xD;
      treatment with risperidone. For comparison, results will also be obtained from 20 controls&#xD;
      (without bipolar disorder or ADHD) of the same age and gender as well as from 20 children or&#xD;
      adolescents with a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      Ino/Cr levels in the anterior cingulate will correlate positively with manic symptoms using&#xD;
      the Young mania rating scale (YMRS). Ino/Cr levels in the anterior cingulate in the anterior&#xD;
      cingular gyrus will be lower in subjects who have received eight weeks or longer of&#xD;
      risperidone&#xD;
