  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients who have been treated with surgical removal of the testes or&#xD;
      hormone therapy (Lupron or Zoladex) and whose prostate cancer has worsened despite this&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PS 341 is a type of drug known as a &quot;proteasome inhibitor.&quot; By inhibiting the &quot;proteasome&quot; in&#xD;
      cancer cells, PS-341 alters the way those cells divide). We hope to learn whether this&#xD;
      combination chemotherapy decreases cancer symptoms and tests (prostate specific antigen, also&#xD;
      called PSA), and to determine how frequently serious side effects might occur with this&#xD;
      treatment for this stage of prostate cancer.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have had a histological or cytological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of&#xD;
             prostate and currently must have metastatic disease (stage TxNxM1) that is&#xD;
             unresponsive or refractory to hormone therapy. Patients must have metastatic prostate&#xD;
             cancer deemed to be hormone refractory by one or more of the following (despite&#xD;
             androgen ablation and anti-androgen withdrawal where applicable):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Progression of measurable disease assessed within 28 days prior to registration. OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Progression of non-measurable (i.e. bone scan or PET scan) disease assessed within 42&#xD;
             days prior to registration. AND&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Rising PSA - defined as at least 2 consecutive rises in PSA documented over a&#xD;
             reference value (measure 1). The first rising PSA (measure 2) should be taken at least&#xD;
             7 days after the reference value. A third confirmatory PSA measure is required (2nd&#xD;
             beyond the reference level) to be greater then the second measure and it must be&#xD;
             obtained at least 7 days after the 2nd measure. Patient must have a PSA concentration&#xD;
             of at least 5 ng/ml in addition to increasing PSA to be eligible Note: The PSA result&#xD;
             (done within 28 days prior to registration) need not be elevated for inclusion&#xD;
             provided other criteria for progression are met and the serum PSA is at least 2 ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have received prior hormonal therapy and have a castrate level of testosterone&#xD;
             (less than 100ng/ml within 90 days of entry to the study). Patients treated with&#xD;
             orchiectomy are eligible. If patients have been treated with non-steroidal&#xD;
             anti-androgens, the patients must have ceased taking flutamide or nilutamide at least&#xD;
             28 days prior to enrollment and at least 42 days prior to enrollment for biclutamide.&#xD;
             Either method of castration can have been supplemented with nonsteroidal antiandrogen&#xD;
             (e.g. flutamide, biclutamide, nilutamide). Patients may have been treated with&#xD;
             &quot;second-line&quot; hormonal therapy such as ketoconazole, aminoglutethimide and/or estrogen&#xD;
             therapies but these must have ceased at least 7 days prior to commencement of study&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  May have received at most one prior chemotherapy for hormone refractory prostate&#xD;
             cancer provided they have not received docetaxel or Bortezomib for that indication or&#xD;
             otherwise within 2 years of trial entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiation therapy is allowed but it must have been to less than 25% of total&#xD;
             body bone marrow. This includes prior use of samarium, but patients can not have&#xD;
             received strontium. (&gt;10 days must have elapsed since completion of RT with recovery&#xD;
             from side effects. Soft tissue disease irradiated in the prior 2 months is not and may&#xD;
             not be designated as measurable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5x the institutional upper limit of normal (within&#xD;
             28 days prior to registration)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hepatic function Total Bilirubin less than or equal to ULN AST and ALT and Alkaline&#xD;
             Phosphatase must be within the range allowing for eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In determining eligibility the more abnormal of the two values (AST or ALT) should be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate bone marrow function. Complete blood count with differential must be done&#xD;
             within 14 days prior to registration Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal&#xD;

             or equal to 100,000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0-3. (For patients with PS of 3, cause must be due to pain&#xD;
             secondary to bone metastases to be eligible)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should (for good medical practice) have stabilization of their analgesic&#xD;
             medications for at least one week prior to receiving study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No other chemotherapy, biological response modifiers, RT, radioisotope therapy (e.g.&#xD;
             samarium or strontium), corticosteroid, or concomitant hormonal therapy may be given&#xD;
             during protocol treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bisphosphonate therapy is permitted provided it commences prior to study entry and is&#xD;
             maintained at recommended dosing intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;

             registration. The nurse or CRA must complete MPQ and PML cover sheet for baseline&#xD;
             assessment prior to registration. If unable to complete questionnaires in English or&#xD;
             Spanish, patient can be registered without contributing to QOL study).&#xD;

             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that have been treated with curative intent can be&#xD;
             accrued to this trial 30 days after treatment. Solar keratoses treated topically do&#xD;
             not preclude entry).&#xD;
