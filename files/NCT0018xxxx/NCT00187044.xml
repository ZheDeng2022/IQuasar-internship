    <textblock>
      This is a research study to evaluate the safety of a vaccine to protect people from HIV&#xD;
      infection. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is the cause of AIDS (Acquired Immune&#xD;
      Deficiency Syndrome). AIDS is one of the most serious viral infections of our time. It is&#xD;
      believed that all persons who contract HIV will eventually develop AIDS. Because of this, we&#xD;
      are trying to develop new ways to prevent infection with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaccine that will be tested in this study has been prepared from a small part of the HIV.&#xD;
      The part of the HIV used in this vaccine is the &quot;envelope&quot; or coating part of the virus. In&#xD;
      this study, researchers will evaluate how well the vaccine is tolerated, how much vaccine&#xD;
      should be given, and determine if any side effects occur in response to the vaccination.&#xD;

      This is a research study to evaluate the safety of a vaccine to protect people from HIV&#xD;
      infection. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is the cause of AIDS (Acquired Immune&#xD;
      Deficiency Syndrome). AIDS is one of the most serious viral infections of our time. It is&#xD;
      believed that all persons who contract HIV will eventually develop AIDS. Because of this, we&#xD;
      are trying to develop new ways to prevent infection with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccines have been very successful in preventing or decreasing the symptoms of a number of&#xD;
      other viral infections such as hepatitis B, polio, and measles. Viral vaccines work by&#xD;
      causing a person's immune system to make antibodies and immune cells against the virus or to&#xD;
      &quot;respond&quot; to the virus. Because of the success with other viral infections, scientists are&#xD;
      trying to develop a successful vaccine for HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaccine that will be tested in this study has been prepared from a small part of the HIV.&#xD;
      The part of the HIV used in this vaccine is the &quot;envelope&quot; or coating part of the virus.&#xD;
      Because only this one part of the virus is used in the vaccine, the vaccine cannot cause HIV&#xD;
      infection. The &quot;envelope&quot; part of HIV has been put into another virus, the vaccinia virus.&#xD;
      The vaccinia virus has been used as a vaccine for many decades in millions of people and is&#xD;
      the vaccine that eliminated the disease known as smallpox (i.e. smallpox vaccine). The&#xD;
      smallpox vaccine is a licensed and effective vaccine. Making a new vaccine by putting part of&#xD;
      a different virus into the smallpox vaccine (also known as vaccinia virus) is called a&#xD;
      &quot;recombinant&quot; vaccinia virus vaccine. Our new recombinant vaccine product is called PolyEnv1.&#xD;
      In this study, researchers will evaluate how well the vaccine is tolerated, how much vaccine&#xD;
      should be given, and determine if any side effects occur in response to the vaccination.&#xD;
