  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we try to increase the radiation dose, while reducing or keeping the radiation&#xD;
      schedule below 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that it is feasible to administer hyperfractionated accelerated&#xD;
      radiotherapy to patients with inoperable or locally advanced non small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-small cell lung cancer is still the most common cancer and the main cause of cancer&#xD;
      death. Treatment of choice for these patients is often radiotherapy, which results in an&#xD;
      overall 5-year survival rate between 5 and 10%. The addition of chemotherapy improves&#xD;
      survival by a few percentages and is therefore considered standard treatment for patients&#xD;
      with stage III disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, several factors have been identified that have an impact on the local control but&#xD;
      also on survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. There is a dose-effect relationship. A higher dose results in a better survival rate.&#xD;
           However, higher radiation doses are currently not delivered with conventional radiation&#xD;
           due to the tolerance of normal tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The time factor plays an important role in radiotherapy. Prolonging the overall&#xD;
           treatment time decreases the outcome of radiotherapy. Radiobiological modelling of data&#xD;
           shows that the overall treatmetn time (OTT) should be kept below 4 weeks. Results from&#xD;
           studies support this conclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, probably the best results will be achieved when a very high radiation dose can be&#xD;
      delivered within 4 weeks, without severally damaging normal tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to achieve this goal, an hyperfractionated accelerated treatment regimen together&#xD;
      with a technically very advanced radiation technique to avoid as much normal tissue as&#xD;
      possible, will be used in this study.&#xD;
