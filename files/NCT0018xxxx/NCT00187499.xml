  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone)&#xD;
      alters the expression of any gene expressed in the lining of the airways of asthmatics. The&#xD;
      study uses high density gene chips which allow the study investigators to measures all gene&#xD;
      in the human genome. We hypothesize that this approach will identify novel genes that are&#xD;
      affected by steroids in asthmatics.&#xD;

      This is a 10 week, randomized, double blind, prospective study comparing the effects of&#xD;
      inhaled fluticasone or inhaled placebo on measures of airway function, airway remodeling and&#xD;
      airway gene expression in asthmatic subjects. Enrollment has been completed as have all study&#xD;
      visits. We are now in the data analysis phase. The study design was as follows: Following a&#xD;
      one-week run-in/characterization period, subjects were randomized to receive 2 puffs BID of&#xD;
      fluticasone (250µg/puff) or matching placebo for 8 weeks. Beginning with the run-in period,&#xD;
      subjects recordes in a daily diary their peak flow measurements twice daily, (symptoms of&#xD;
      cough, sputum production, wheeze, dyspnea, and chest tightness. They visited the laboratory&#xD;
      for an interval diary review and spirometry and for medication dispensing. Bronchoscopy was&#xD;
      performed at baseline (week 1 of the run-in), and 1 week after starting the study drug Weekly&#xD;
      telephone contact will be made during the treatment period to monitor subject well being and&#xD;
      to ensure compliance with study medication. There was a one-week run-out to allow monitoring&#xD;
      of subjects after discontinuation of the study drug.&#xD;
