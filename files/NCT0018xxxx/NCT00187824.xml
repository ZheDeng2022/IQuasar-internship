  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that bioenergetic failure in human sepsis, related to&#xD;
      endocrine, metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction, is a major determinant of defective host&#xD;
      immune responses, increasing disease severity and risk of death. The objectives of this study&#xD;
      are to examine the relationship between the severity of illness, and temporal changes in the&#xD;
      activity of endocrine, metabolic and bioenergetic pathways, and consequent immune dysfunction&#xD;
      in critically ill patients with sepsis and multiple organ failure in the Intensive Care Unit.&#xD;

      The objectives of this study are to examine the relationship between the severity of illness,&#xD;
      and temporal changes in the activity of endocrine, metabolic and bioenergetic pathways, and&#xD;
      consequent immune dysfunction in critically ill patients with sepsis and multiple organ&#xD;
      failure in the Intensive Care Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be undertaken using sequential blood sampling (until ICU discharge) and&#xD;
      muscle biopsies (to a maximum of 5) in critically ill patients (a) with or (b) without sepsis&#xD;
      plus a comparator group undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery. A variety of hormonal,&#xD;
      cytokine, immune and mitochondrial measures wil lbe then made to assess whether any&#xD;
      relationship exists between alterations in these different pathways, and whether eventual&#xD;
      survivors and non-survivors can be distinguished.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Group 1: healthy control patients Patients undergoing elective total hip replacement&#xD;
             will be eligible for enrollment in Group 1 after written informed consent has been&#xD;
             obtained. Only 1 blood sample and 1 fat and muscle biopsy will be taken&#xD;
             intra-operatively&#xD;
&#xD;
        Group 2: non-septic, critically ill patients Patients requiring intensive care within 48&#xD;
        hours of admission to hospital from home, for a non-septic/non-inflammatory pathology will&#xD;
        be eligible for enrollment in the study after informed agreement has been obtained from the&#xD;
        closest family member (see Consent below). At enrolment, Group 2 patients must have&#xD;
        received mechanical ventilation commencing within 48 hours of admission to intensive care,&#xD;
        should be likely to require mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hours, and must not&#xD;
        fulfil the 2001 International Sepsis Definition Conference criteria for severe sepsis or&#xD;
        septic shock&#xD;
&#xD;
        Group 3: patients with severe sepsis or septic shock Patients requiring intensive care&#xD;
        within 48 hours of admission to hospital from home, and evidence of severe sepsis (organ&#xD;
        dysfunction due to infection) or septic shock as defined by the 2001 International Sepsis&#xD;
        Definition Conference criteria, will be eligible for enrollment in the study after informed&#xD;
        agreement has been obtained from their next-of-kin. Patients with underlying chronic liver&#xD;
        disease are excluded from this group, and will be enrolled separately into Group 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Group 4: patients with severe sepsis and underlying chronic liver disease Patients&#xD;
        requiring intensive care admission, with underlying Child-Pugh Class A or B, biopsy-proven&#xD;
        liver cirrhosis, within 24 h of the onset of severe sepsis (organ dysfunction due to&#xD;
        infection) or septic shock as defined by the 2001 International Sepsis Definition&#xD;
        Conference criteria), will be eligible for enrollment in the study after informed agreement&#xD;
        has been obtained from their next-of-kin&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Age &lt;18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        Child-Pugh Class C liver disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        Chronic dialysis-dependent renal failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hepatitis B or C infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        Immunosuppression (e.g. haematological malignancy, neutropenia, HIV infection)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Immunosuppressive drug therapy within past 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient receiving oral or IV steroid therapy for greater than 1 week, within 6 months prior&#xD;
        to ICU admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        Muscle biopsy contraindicated in presence of coagulopathy (INR &gt;2, platelet count &lt;&#xD;
        30,000)*&#xD;
&#xD;
        Next-of-kin declines agreement / patient declines consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient receiving thyroid hormone therapy prior to ICU admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        *This does not exclude enrolment into the study, particularly in the case of Group 4&#xD;
        patients who frequently develop a coagulopathy as part of their underlying liver&#xD;
        dysfunction&#xD;
