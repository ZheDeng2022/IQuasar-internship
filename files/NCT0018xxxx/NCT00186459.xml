  <brief_summary>

      The goal of the study is to define the roles played by resistance to insulin-mediated glucose&#xD;
      disposal (insulin resistance) and circulating plasma insulin concentrations in: 1) ability to&#xD;
      lose weight; 2) reduction of risk for coronary heart disease as a result of weight loss. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that in the setting of caloric restriction, manipulating endogenous insulin&#xD;
      concentrations will not alter ability of subjects to lose weight, but will lead to different&#xD;
      reduction in CHD risk factors. To test this hypothesis, two parallel studs will be performed.&#xD;
      First, obese insulin-resistant individuals will be randomized to one of two&#xD;
      equally-hypocaloric diets that vary moderately in proportion of carbohydrate and&#xD;
      mono/polyunsaturated fats (lower carbohydrate diet will be associated with greater reduction&#xD;
      in endogenous insulin secretion). Second, diabetics treated with insulin secretagogues will&#xD;
      be compared to diabetics treated with insulin sensitizers with respect to the same outcomes&#xD;
      (secretagogues increase insulin secretion and insulin sensitizers decrease insulin&#xD;
      concentrations). Endpoints include weight loss, change in insulin resistance, blood pressure,&#xD;
      lipid and lipoproteins, markers of endothelial function, daylong insulin and glucose&#xD;
      concentrations: these will be compared, in each of the parallel studies, between the group&#xD;
      with insulin-stimulating intervention vs the group with the insulin-sparing intervention.&#xD;

      While obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes are highly associated, it is not clear&#xD;
      whether insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia play important roles in the&#xD;
      tendency to gain weight and/or inability to lose weight. The role of hyperinsulinemia in&#xD;
      coronary heart disease (CHD)is also unclear. The specific aims of the proposed research are&#xD;
      as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare insulin resistant versus insulin sensitive nondiabetic overweight individuals&#xD;
           with respect to their ability to lose weight on a low calorie diet. CHD risk factors&#xD;
           before and after weight loss will also be assessed to determine the degree to which&#xD;
           insulin resistance is associated with CHD risk, as well as the impact that differences&#xD;
           in insulin resistance have on the metabolic benefits of weight loss&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if weight loss and its associated metabolic benefits vary as a function of&#xD;
           the relative amounts of dietary fat and carbohydrate in hypocaloric diets. Because high&#xD;
           carbohydrate diets increase insulin secretion, the relationship between dietary&#xD;
           composition and change in circulating insulin concentrations will be analyzed with&#xD;
           respect to both weight loss and CHD risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To quantify and compare the improvement in glycemic control and CHD risk factors&#xD;
           associated with weight loss in obese type 2 diabetics, while being treated with 1) an&#xD;
           insulin secretagogue (sulfonylurea) or 2) an insulin sensitizer (thiazolidinedione).&#xD;
           Manipulation of plasma insulin concentrations with these medications will provide a&#xD;
           mechanism by which to evaluate the impact of circulating insulin concentrations on the&#xD;
           described outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A subgroup of overweight/obese premenopausal women with PCOS will be studied using two&#xD;
           diets in crossover design with regard to macronutrient effects on endogenous&#xD;
           hyperinsulinism. For this subgroup age range will be 18-50 years, BMI 25-50 kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. In order to increase our data and therefore increase our better understanding of fat&#xD;
           cells and insulin resistance and changes in fat cells with weight loss we would like to&#xD;
           increase our participant enrollment to 550 all to be enrolled at Stanford University&#xD;
           Medical Center recruiting Bariatric participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age for Bariatric patients 30-65 men and women BMI 27-no upper limit Currently we have&#xD;
      completed all participants except the bariatric and post bariatric population and those with&#xD;
      hypoglycemia following bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ethnic background of subjects reflects Stanford's patient population.&#xD;
