    <textblock>
      Two( 2) or three (3) instead of four vaccinations before the age of 6 months with&#xD;
      pneumococcal conjugate vaccine are presumed to protect children against invasive pneumococcal&#xD;
      disease like meningitis, at least on the short term till 18-24 months of age. The current&#xD;
      hypothesis in this study is 2 or 3 vaccinations will protect against IPD but will not alter&#xD;
      pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage in infants, and consequently not change pneumococcal&#xD;
      transmission and induce no herd-immunity. Furthermore, antibody development and memory may&#xD;
      benefit from carriage of vaccine type S. pneumoniae&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Two(2 and 4 months) and three vaccinations (2,4 and 11 months) with 7-valent pneumococcal&#xD;
      conjugate vaccine Prevnar in infants are presumed to provide about 90% protection against&#xD;
      invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) for vaccine type pneumococci, at least until 18-24 months&#xD;
      of age. Licensure of the vaccine however is based on studies with 3 vaccinations before 6&#xD;
      months and a booster vaccination half a year later (3+1 scheme). Cost-effectiveness in&#xD;
      national infant vaccination programs (NIPs)is much improved by high herd-immunity effects,as&#xD;
      observed in the USA after licensure of Prevnar in 2000, both for IPD and AOM. However,&#xD;
      overall pneumococcal carriage reduction (and nasopharyngeal replacement) has not been&#xD;
      assessed in studies with reduced doses. With reduced carriage reduction, effects on&#xD;
      respiratory tract infections and herd immunity may be significantly less.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the current study is to compare effect of 2-doses (at ages 2 and 4 months)&#xD;
      with a 3-doses scheme(2+1, at 2, 4 and 11 months) on nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage and&#xD;
      replacement and family transmission(sibs and caregivers), in order to allow modelling for&#xD;
      herd-immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim is to determine the effect of a reduced doses scheme on serum&#xD;
      antipneumococcal antibody levels at the age of 12 and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third aim is to determine antipneumococcal antibody levels and memory B-cell development&#xD;
      after booster vaccination at 24 months of age, after 2 or 2+1 doses and compare these with a&#xD;
      first vaccination at 24 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opportunities are the determination of nasopharyngeal colonizing pneumococci in unvaccinated&#xD;
      infants in the Netherlands before implementation of Prevnar in the NIP, evaluation of&#xD;
      replacing pneumococci in the nasopharynx after vaccinations and analysis of effects on other&#xD;
      colonizing bacteria like H.influenzae, M. catarrhalis and S.aureus. Furthermore, the relation&#xD;
      between colonizing pneumococci and serotypes causing IPD in the Netherlands can be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods : 1000 infants and families will be included in a randomized,controlled study with 3&#xD;
      interventions groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prevnar at 2 and 4 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prevnar at 2, 4 and 11 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Prevnar at 24 months (controls)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children will be followed until 2 years of age with nasopharyngeal swabs for bacterial&#xD;
      culture before the first vaccination, at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months of age. One sibling and one&#xD;
      parent/caregiver will be swabbed when the infant is 12 and 24 months. Blood for antibody&#xD;
      determination will be obtained from 80 children of groups 1 and 2, and from 30 children in&#xD;
      the control group. Questionnaires on health and respiratory infections and antibiotic&#xD;
      prescription for RTI will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 24 months of age, all children of groups 1 and 2 will be offered a booster vaccination.&#xD;
      Antibody levels will be measured before and 4 weeks after this vaccination at 2 years of age&#xD;
      in a subset of 80 children per group and compared with 80 children who received a first&#xD;
      vaccination at 24 months of age.&#xD;
