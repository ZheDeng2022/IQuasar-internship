      Blood clots in the leg veins, known as deep vein thrombosis, are important because they may&#xD;
      travel to the lung (known as pulmonary embolism) and cause death. Blood clots are treated&#xD;
      with blood thinners, or anticoagulants. The preferred treatment is an anticoagulant known as&#xD;
      low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). LMWH is given by an injection under the skin, which is&#xD;
      convenient for patients because they can self-administer this medication at home, and no&#xD;
      blood testing is required. However, LMWH is cleared from the body through the kidneys, so&#xD;
      patients who have kidney failure are generally not treated with LMWH because they may be at a&#xD;
      higher risk of bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One type of LMWH, known as tinzaparin, may be less dependent on the kidneys for clearance and&#xD;
      may not increase in patients with kidney failure. The investigators would like to use&#xD;
      tinzaparin to treat patients who have deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and who&#xD;
      also have kidney failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the blood thinning effects of tinzaparin&#xD;
      build up, or accumulate, in patients with varying degrees of kidney failure compared to&#xD;
      patients without kidney failure. The blood thinning effects will be measured using a blood&#xD;
      test known as an anti-Xa level. Patients will be followed over the time they receive&#xD;
      tinzaparin and those patients who are found to have potentially high levels of tinzaparin&#xD;
      (based on the anti-Xa level) will have their tinzaparin dose adjusted. The investigators&#xD;
      believe that the levels of tinzaparin will not accumulate to potentially dangerous levels in&#xD;
      a significant number of patients with kidney failure.&#xD;

      Background and rationale. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an important clinical problem&#xD;
      because it is common, preventable, contributes to morbidity and mortality, and is costly. Low&#xD;
      molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is the preferred anticoagulant for VTE treatment, but is&#xD;
      renally excreted. Consequently, LMWH use in patients with renal insufficiency may result in&#xD;
      accumulation of the anticoagulant effects and the potential for avoidable bleeding&#xD;
      complications. As a result, most patients with renal insufficiency who also have VTE are&#xD;
      unable to benefit from LMWH treatment. These patients are therefore generally treated in&#xD;
      hospital using unfractionated heparin (UFH), since it is eliminated by extra-renal&#xD;
      mechanisms. In addition to those patients with known renal insufficiency, many elderly&#xD;
      patients have previously unrecognized renal insufficiency and treatment of these patients&#xD;
      with LMWH can be associated with accumulation of the anticoagulant effect and avoidable&#xD;
      bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tinzaparin, relative to other LMWHs, has a higher molecular weight and greater negative&#xD;
      charge: both biochemical features that favour non-renal clearance. There is limited evidence&#xD;
      to support the hypothesis that tinzaparin, unlike other LMWHs, does not accumulate in&#xD;
      patients with renal insufficiency. 1) Observational studies demonstrated no increase in&#xD;
      anti-Xa levels (i.e., no accumulation) when tinzaparin was used for VTE treatment in elderly&#xD;
      patients with renal insufficiency. 2) One study showed undetectable LMWH anticoagulant&#xD;
      activity by 24 hours after dosing in hemodialysis patients. 3) A systematic review and&#xD;
      meta-analysis of the literature in this area performed by our research group found no&#xD;
      difference in bleeding and thrombosis complication rates when LMWH (compared to UFH) was used&#xD;
      to maintain dialysis circuit patency in patients on hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current factors which limit the use of tinzaparin in the treatment of patients with VTE&#xD;
      and renal insufficiency are: 1) the true risk of accumulation is unknown in a spectrum of&#xD;
      patients with varying renal function, and 2) the bleeding risk associated with tinzaparin use&#xD;
      is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis. We hypothesize that accumulation during a 5-day course of tinzaparin will not be&#xD;
      related to the degree of renal insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and methods. We will perform a prospective cohort study of 200 patients with&#xD;
      acute VTE, stratified into 4 equal-sized groups by renal function, who will receive initial&#xD;
      anticoagulation with tinzaparin for 5 days concurrent with oral anticoagulants. The LMWH&#xD;
      anticoagulant effect will be assessed at days 3 and 5 (+/- 1) using trough anti-Xa heparin&#xD;
      levels. If accumulation occurs, defined as a trough anti-Xa level &gt; 0.5 IU/mL, the tinzaparin&#xD;
      dose will be adjusted according to a nomogram. Patients with an anti-Xa level â‰¤ 0.5 IU/mL&#xD;
      will have no dose adjustment; patients with levels &gt; 0.5 IU/mL will have their tinzaparin&#xD;
      dose reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this study is the proportion of patients in each renal function group&#xD;
      with accumulation on or before day 5. We will follow the patients for 48 hours after their&#xD;
      final tinzaparin injection. Secondary outcomes are bleeding, recurrent thrombosis,&#xD;
      accumulation by day 3, and trough anti-Xa levels &gt; 1.0 IU/mL at any point in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance. We hypothesize that tinzaparin does not accumulate in patients with renal&#xD;
      insufficiency. However, if accumulation occurs, we hypothesize that dose adjustment according&#xD;
      to our novel nomogram will prevent potentially-dangerous levels occurring by day 5. In either&#xD;
      case, we will be able to proceed to the next stage in our research plan: an application for&#xD;
      funding for a large simple randomized controlled trial examining the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      tinzaparin compared with UFH in patients with renal insufficiency. If accumulation occurs&#xD;
      despite the use of the nomogram, then this surrogate outcome suggests that the use of&#xD;
      therapeutic-dose tinzaparin is unlikely to be safe in patients with renal insufficiency, a&#xD;
      finding which will limit the need to expend further resources on this line of research.&#xD;
