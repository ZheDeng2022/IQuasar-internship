  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer of the anus occurs at very high rates in young men with HIV and is caused by a virus&#xD;
      called human papillomavirus (HPV). Anal cancer has increased during the HIV epidemic despite&#xD;
      effective therapies for HIV. Unfortunately, anal cancer presents at a late stage because&#xD;
      there is no screening program to find it at an early stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rates of other cancers such as cervical cancer have been reduced through the use of Pap&#xD;
      smears. The researchers' plan is to do the same type of screening for anal cancer as has been&#xD;
      done for cervical cancer. If abnormalities are found then treatment can be started. The&#xD;
      researchers hope that this approach will help to prevent anal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing for HPV will also be done to see if this helps to detect early cancer and to see how&#xD;
      accurate different tests, pathologists and clinical examiners are at detecting and agreeing&#xD;
      on any abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome is the presence of any pre-cancerous or early cancer changes as determined&#xD;
      by high resolution anoscopy (HRA). HRA involves looking through a microscope into the anus&#xD;
      and this allows very tiny changes to be identified. Pieces of tissue can then be taken to&#xD;
      make a definite diagnosis.&#xD;

      Anal cancer occurs at a rate which is 163-fold greater in young men with HIV. It is caused by&#xD;
      another virus, HPV. The incidence has doubled during the HIV epidemic and is not decreasing&#xD;
      despite effective antiretroviral therapy. It is important to have an anal cancer screening&#xD;
      program to detect precancerous lesions; this has been done for the prevention of cervical&#xD;
      cancer through the use of cervical Pap smears.We will do anal Pap smears, HPV testing and&#xD;
      perform high resolution anoscopy for a magnified and detailed view of the anus. Biopsies are&#xD;
      done and early treatment is initiated. It is anticipated that this approach will help to&#xD;
      prevent anal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the accuracy of pathology and human papillomavirus&#xD;
      (HPV) testing in identifying precancerous changes in HIV positive men. The primary question&#xD;
      is to determine how good the anal Pap smears are for detecting precancerous changes in the&#xD;
      anus. Secondary questions involve: (a) determination of the test characteristics of the anal&#xD;
      Pap smear, (b) assessment of agreement in visually detecting pre-cancers by the anoscopists&#xD;
      and, (c) a determination of the viral and patient characteristics that predict pre-cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cross-sectional survey of HIV positive men with a history of anal receptive&#xD;
      intercourse who are attending several Toronto HIV clinics. Relevant information is collected&#xD;
      as well as anal specimens for assessment. There is a multidisciplinary team who have the&#xD;
      appropriate expertise in these studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES and STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is the presence of pre-cancerous changes as determined by high&#xD;
      resolution anoscopy. We need to screen 425 subjects in order to find 100 patients with high&#xD;
      grade pre-cancerous changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome analyses include specificity, positive predictive value and negative&#xD;
      predictive value of cytology and HPV DNA testing to detect histologically confirmed&#xD;
      pre-cancerous changes or cancer.&#xD;
