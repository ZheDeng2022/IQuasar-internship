  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study to evaluate fatigue and cognitive function&#xD;
      in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) treated with chemotherapy, and in patients with the&#xD;
      same malignancy, that do not receive chemotherapy. A self-report questionnaire for fatigue&#xD;
      (the FACT-F), and validated tests of cognitive function, will be applied at predetermined&#xD;
      times before, during and after chemotherapy, to determine the incidence, severity and&#xD;
      duration of these symptoms. Comparisons will be made in changes in cognition for individuals,&#xD;
      as well as between the chemotherapy and the control group. Mechanisms that might lead to&#xD;
      fatigue and/or cognitive decline will be investigated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will undertake a prospective, longitudinal controlled study of fatigue and cognitive&#xD;
      function in 120 patients with localized CRC who receive 5FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy. Each&#xD;
      patient will be evaluated at baseline and at 6, 12 and 24 months for fatigue (using the&#xD;
      FACT-F questionnaire) and for cognitive function, using validated tests: these will comprise&#xD;
      both traditional neuropsychological tests and the computerised CANTAB™, a which is less&#xD;
      dependent on fluency in English. Results during and after chemotherapy will be compared with&#xD;
      the pre-chemotherapy assessment (so that each patient acts as their own control). Since&#xD;
      baseline evaluation may be confounded by the recent diagnosis and surgery we will include an&#xD;
      independent control group of 120 patients who have undergone surgery for CRC but who do not&#xD;
      receive chemotherapy. Patients found to have cognitive change will be offered further&#xD;
      comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. We will also evaluate quality of life (QOL)&#xD;
      using the FACT-G questionnaire and anxiety and depression using the General Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire (GHQ). Blood tests including hormone levels, cytokines, homocysteine,&#xD;
      procoagulants and apo-lipoprotein E-є4 allele status will evaluate possible mechanisms.&#xD;
      Finally, since chemotherapy for CRC is evolving to include the more toxic drugs oxaliplatin&#xD;
      and irinotecan, we will perform a parallel pilot study evaluating pts with early recurrent or&#xD;
      metastatic CRC who receive these drugs, using similar methods of evaluation.&#xD;
