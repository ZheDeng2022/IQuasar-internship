  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the safety of delivering arsenic trioxide (ATO) in combination with&#xD;
      stereotactic radiotherapy in recurrent malignant glioma by performing an open label, Phase I&#xD;
      dose escalation trial. Results from this study will provide a basis for further study of ATO&#xD;
      combined with radiation therapy as a radiosensitizer for malignant brain tumors in future&#xD;
      Phase II studies.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of recurrent disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients will have received previous conventional radiotherapy at least 3 weeks&#xD;
             prior to enrollment. Histologic verification of malignant glioma is required. If the&#xD;
             initial primary brain tumor was histologically malignant glioma and subsequent&#xD;
             contrast enhanced MRI imaging shows tumor consistent with recurrence, additional&#xD;
             biopsy or surgery is not required. However, if a low-grade neoplasm was the initial&#xD;
             histologic diagnosis, tissue confirmation of malignant glioma is required at the time&#xD;
             of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age: Patients must be &gt;18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky &gt;60%, and/or ECOG performance status &lt;2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an estimated life expectancy of greater than 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow functions as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Leukocytes &gt;3,000/¼l&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/¼l&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin &gt; 10 gm/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets &gt;100,000/¼l (transfusion independent)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) &lt;1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine clearance &gt;60mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above&#xD;
                  institutional normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum potassium* e 4.0mEq/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum magnesium* e 1.8mEq/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum calcium* within the institutional normal range (should be corrected if low&#xD;
                  normal)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Electrocardiogram Normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  electrocardiogram with a rate corrected QT interval (QTc) &lt;500 msec&#xD;
&#xD;
                  *Oral or intravenous supplementation may be used to normalize serum electrolytes&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Phase I ATO Stereotactic Radiotherapy for Recurrent Malignant Glioma 16 of 44&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Informed consent All patients or their legal guardians must sign a document of&#xD;
             informed consent indicating their understanding of the investigational nature of this&#xD;
             study and the risks involved prior to any protocol related are performed (which does&#xD;
             not include imaging and laboratory studies that help to establish eligibility).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:- Patients who have had chemotherapy or conventional radiotherapy within&#xD;
        3 weeks of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received prior radiosurgery or stereotactic radiotherapy within 10mm&#xD;
             of the current target tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who cannot undergo MRI or CT are not eligible as MRI will be used to confirm&#xD;
             the diagnosis and CT will be used for treatment planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to arsenic trioxide or other agents used in study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are taking substances known to prolong the QT interval, see Appendix B.&#xD;
             If the QT prolonging drug is discontinued and switched to an alternative agent, the&#xD;
             patients will be allowed to enroll into this protocol as long the agent has been&#xD;
             discontinued for a period of at least 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients currently taking Amphotericin B or related antifungal agents will be excluded&#xD;
             due to potential for increased renal electrolyte wasting during arsenic trioxide&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known second-degree heart block or other cardiac dysfunction. New York&#xD;
             Heart Association Class II or greater (see Appendix E)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illnesses including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or&#xD;
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirements. Phase I ATO Stereotactic Radiotherapy for Recurrent Malignant Glioma 17&#xD;
             of 44&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be pregnant or breast-feeding. All patients with the potential for&#xD;
             pregnancy should be counseled and requested to follow acceptable birth control methods&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation. Patients who are pregnant or breast-feeding will&#xD;
             be excluded because no information on this agent exists with regard to safety of&#xD;
             arsenic trioxide for a fetus or breast-feeding infant. Should a woman become pregnant&#xD;
             or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately.&#xD;
