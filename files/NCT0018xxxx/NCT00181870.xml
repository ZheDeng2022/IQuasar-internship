  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label pilot study of up to 1200 mg/day of carbamazepine ER (Equetro) in the&#xD;
      treatment of children who meet DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar I, Bipolar II, or Bipolar Spectrum&#xD;
      Disorder. The main goal of this study is to begin to address the void of information on&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and effectiveness of Equetro in the treatment of Pediatric Bipolar&#xD;
      Disorder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Initial clinical evidence suggests that carbamazepine (CBZ) may play a therapeutic role in&#xD;
      the management of pediatric bipolar disorder. A recent study found that nearly 50% of&#xD;
      patients taking immediate-release CBZ had side effects while only 20% of patients had&#xD;
      side-effects after switching to an extended release (ER) version of the drug, despite high&#xD;
      doses. In addition, with an ER formulation of CBZ there is a potential for decrease in&#xD;
      peak-related side effects and improved efficacy with higher blood levels. Thus, an ER&#xD;
      formulation of CBZ may improve effectiveness and adherence to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this pilot study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Equetro in the&#xD;
      treatment of bipolar I, bipolar II, and bipolar spectrum disorder in children ages 6-12 over&#xD;
      the course of 8-weeks. We propose that during this exploratory study there will be sufficient&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of Equetro in the treatment of Pediatric Bipolar&#xD;
      Disorder. The results of this study will be used to generate hypotheses for a larger&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical trial with explicit hypotheses and sufficient statistical&#xD;
      power.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female subjects, 6-12 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects must have a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar I, bipolar II disorder or bipolar&#xD;
             spectrum disorder and currently displaying manic, hypomanic, or mixed symptoms (with&#xD;
             or without psychotic features) according to the DSM-IV based on clinical assessment&#xD;
             and structured diagnostic interview (Kidd Schedule of Affective Disorders and&#xD;
             Schizophrenia Epidemiological Version)(Kaufman, Birmaher et al. 1997). Bipolar&#xD;
             Spectrum Disorder (or sub-threshold bipolar disorder) is operationalized as having&#xD;
             severe mood disturbance, which meets DSM-IV Criteria A for bipolar disorder but meet&#xD;
             fewer elements in criteria B (only require 2 items for elation category and 3 for&#xD;
             irritability).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects and their legal representative must have a level of understanding sufficient&#xD;
             to communicate intelligently with the investigator and study coordinator, and to&#xD;
             cooperate with all tests and examinations required by the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects and their legal representative must be considered reliable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Each subject and his/her authorized legal representative must understand the nature of&#xD;
             the study. The subject's authorized legal representative must sign an informed consent&#xD;
             document and the subject must sign an informed assent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects must have an initial score on the Y-MRS total score of at least 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject must be able to participate in mandatory blood draws.&#xD;

          9. Subjects with comorbid ADHD, ODD, CD, anxiety and depressive disorders will be allowed&#xD;
             to participate in the study provided they do not meet for any of the exclusionary&#xD;
             criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. For concomitant therapy used to treat ADHD, subjects must have been on a stable dose&#xD;
             of the medication for 1 month prior to study enrollment. The dose of the ADHD therapy&#xD;
             will not change throughout the duration of the study. Strattera will not be allowed.&#xD;
