      This is an 8-week open label study of bupropion SR in the treatment of youth with bipolar&#xD;
      depression with adequate mood stabilization. All youth will be closely monitored for&#xD;
      treatment emergent manic activation and drug-drug interactions with ongoing antimanic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of bupropion SR in&#xD;
      the treatment of bipolar depression in children and adolescents.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      While anti-manic agents can effectively control manic symptoms, bipolar patients frequently&#xD;
      continue to struggle with residual depressive symptomatology that can be associated with&#xD;
      severe morbidity and suicidality. Because antidepressants can activate manic symptoms in&#xD;
      bipolar patients with depression, the treatment of bipolar depression poses unique and&#xD;
      challenging therapeutic dilemmas Thus, the identification of appropriate safe and effective&#xD;
      treatment strategies for the management of depression in bipolar youth is particularly taxing&#xD;
      considering that pediatric mania is predominantly mixed with a strong depressive component. A&#xD;
      recent study in our program of bupropion SR in 30 adults with ADHD and Bipolar disorder,&#xD;
      treatment with bupropion SR was extremely well tolerated and was not associated with&#xD;
      activation of manic symptoms. Because bupropion has not been evaluated in the treatment of&#xD;
      bipolar depression in youth, there is a pressing need to evaluate its effectiveness and&#xD;
      safety in the context of a treatment protocol aimed at carefully evaluating this issue.&#xD;
