      The objectives of this study are to study the safety, effectiveness, tolerability and dosing&#xD;
      regimen of risperidone, and olanzapine, in the treatment of mania in Bipolar Disorder I and&#xD;
      Bipolar II Disorder in preschool children over an 8 week period. We hypothesize that these&#xD;
      atypical neuroleptics may be effective in treating pediatric mania, with a lower risk of&#xD;
      extrapyramidal side effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Risperidone and olanzapine are atypical neuroleptics marketed for the treatment of psychotic&#xD;
      disorders in adults. These medicines are called atypical neuroleptics because of their unique&#xD;
      pharmacological profile, which include both D2 and 5HT2 antagonistic effects. The combined&#xD;
      dopaminergic and serotonergic activity seems to be associated not only with antipsychotic&#xD;
      effects, but also with mood stabilizing, mood elevating and tardive dyskinesia. The&#xD;
      anti-climactic effects of this class of drugs led to the recent FDA approval of olanzapine as&#xD;
      monotherapy for adult bipolar disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of 8 week, open-label treatment period with random assignment to two&#xD;
      determined treatment arms, risperidone or olanzapine. We plan to enroll 5 subjects for each&#xD;
      arm. During the 8 weeks of treatment, patients will be seen at weekly intervals and receive&#xD;
      study medication. At each week, measures of safety and efficacy will be obtained. Two teams&#xD;
      of clinicians will see the patient at each visit. Team 1 will be the treating team, adjusting&#xD;
      medication dosages and determining the safety of continuation in the study for the patient.&#xD;
      Team 2 will be blind to the randomization status of the patient and will assess clinical&#xD;
      improvement using the efficacy measures. For patients who have completed the 8-week acute&#xD;
      phase without adverse event and have not responded to the medication they were assigned to&#xD;
      will be allowed to then take part in additional 8-week trial with the other medication. At&#xD;
      the end of the 8 weeks, patients who responded to their assigned treatment will be eligible&#xD;
      to be enrolled and invited to participate in a separate10 month continuation study.&#xD;
