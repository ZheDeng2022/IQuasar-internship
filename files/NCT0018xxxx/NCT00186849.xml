  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II pilot study of chemotherapy and surgery for children with advanced stage&#xD;
      high-risk neuroblastoma utilizing topotecan during an upfront window and other active agents&#xD;
      during induction and intensification phases. The primary purpose is to estimate the response&#xD;
      rate to an upfront window of two cycles of intravenous topotecan. We hypothesize that the&#xD;
      topotecan window will be an effective therapy in terms of the response rate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective phase II trial, topotecan is administered intravenously daily for 5 days&#xD;
      for each of 2 consecutive weeks for two cycles in an upfront treatment window. Patients&#xD;
      subsequently will receive standard treatment during induction and intensification phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this trial are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the response rate to an upfront window of two cycles of IV topotecan when&#xD;
           given in doses adjusted to attain a targeted systemic exposure in children with advanced&#xD;
           stage neuroblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the feasibility and toxicity of an intensification phase of high-dose&#xD;
           chemotherapy with topotecan and cyclophosphamide followed by autologous peripheral blood&#xD;
           stem cell transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the 3-year overall survival and progression-free survival in patients&#xD;
           treated with this approach&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the phenotype of neuroblastoma tumor cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the disposition of topotecan in previously untreated patients with&#xD;
           neuroblastoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details for chemotherapy intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Window Phase Topotecan description, window therapy-Topotecan given intravenously daily as a&#xD;
      30 minute infusion for five consecutive days, off two days, and then five consecutive days.&#xD;
      The dose for day 1 and 2 was 3.0 mg/m2 and subsequent doses were adjusted to attain a target&#xD;
      systemic exposure. A second course of Topotecan was given approximately 16 days from the end&#xD;
      of the first cycle, with the initial dose for the second course of Topotecan based on the&#xD;
      dose required in the preceding course to attain the target AUC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide, MESNA, Adriamycin, Cisplatin, Carboplatin, and Etoposide description,&#xD;
      Induction Phase (after completion of window) consists of 4 cycles of therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycle 1:Cyclophosphamide 1 gm/m2 daily x 2 I.V. day 1 and 2 Adriamycin 35 mg/m2 I.V. day 1&#xD;
      only, MESNA: 250 mg/m2 I.V. immediately following cyclophosphamide infusion and at 3 and 6&#xD;
      hours post-infusion, and Etoposide: 30 mg/m2 over 30 minutes, followed by 250 mg/m2/day x 3&#xD;
      days I.V. by continuous infusion (days 2-5) Cycles 2 and 4- Cisplatin 40 mg/m2/day x 5 I.V.&#xD;
      over 1 hour (days 1-5) Etoposide 200 mg/m2/day x 3 I.V. over 1 hour (days 2,3,4) Cycle 3:&#xD;
      Carboplatin: dose adapted from GFR on day 1. Dose in mg/m2 = 8 x [(0.93 GFR) + 15]&#xD;
      Ifosfamide: 2 gm/m2 I.V. over 1 hour daily x 3 (days 2, 3, 4) MESNA: 500 mg/m2 I.V.&#xD;
      immediately after ifosfamide and 3 and 6 hours later Etoposide: 100 mg/m2 IV daily x 3 over 1&#xD;
      hour (days 2, 3, 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensification Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topotecan, Cyclophosphamide, and MESNA- Intensification Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topotecan - targeted dose - daily x 5 days for two weeks. Cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 IV over&#xD;
      1 hour on days 8 through 12. MESNA 175 mg/m2 IV immediately after cyclophosphamide and 3 and&#xD;
      6 hours later. Infusion of previously collected peripheral blood stem cells on day 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects that do not respond to the Topotecan window will not receive topotecan during&#xD;
      intensification, but instead will receive the following intensification therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carboplatin 700 mg/m2/day IV, over one hour q.o.d. x 3 Etoposide 500 mg/m2/day IV, over 6&#xD;
      hours q.o.d. x 3. Infusion of previously collected peripheral blood stem cells on day 8&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details for Intervention: Procedure/Surgery: Surgery Surgical resection will be performed&#xD;
      after the window therapy in feasible subjects. If surgery was not possible after the&#xD;
      Topotecan window resection of the primary tumor mass and careful lymph node staging was done&#xD;
      after recovery from induction and re-evaluation of tumor status.&#xD;
