      The purpose of this study is to determine whether macrolide therapy is effective in treating&#xD;
      patients hospitalized with asthma exacerbations or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      (COPD)exacerbations. We hypothesize that compared to placebo, maintenance therapy with&#xD;
      macrolides, when added to usual care, a) improves respiratory symptoms, b) improves quality&#xD;
      of life, c) reduces airway inflammation, d) reduces airflow obstruction, and e) decreases the&#xD;
      rate of re-exacerbations.&#xD;

      Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are the two most common obstructive&#xD;
      lung diseases. Chronic airway inflammation and episodic worsening of respiratory symptoms and&#xD;
      airflow obstruction (exacerbations) occur in asthma and COPD. Despite major advances in the&#xD;
      development of therapies for these respiratory disorders, asthma and COPD exacerbations are&#xD;
      common and result in substantial morbidity and mortality. Moreover, patients hospitalized for&#xD;
      asthma or COPD exacerbations are at high risk for near fatal and fatal re-exacerbations after&#xD;
      discharge home. These observations highlight the need for novel therapies to prevent asthma&#xD;
      and COPD exacerbations. The role of macrolide antibiotics (e.g., azithromycin,&#xD;
      clarithromycin, erythromycin) in treating bacterial infections is well established. Recent&#xD;
      pre-clinical evidence also suggests that macrolides may posses distinct anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      properties and even anti-viral properties. These exciting observations have led to research&#xD;
      evaluating the use of maintenance therapy with macrolides in patients with asthma and COPD.&#xD;
      Small studies in clinically stable asthma or COPD suggest that maintenance macrolide therapy&#xD;
      (e.g., use for 6 weeks), when added to usual care, may attenuate airway inflammation, reduce&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms, and improve lung function. However, there are no studies that have&#xD;
      evaluated the potential benefits of initiating maintenance macrolide therapy during asthma or&#xD;
      COPD exacerbations. We hypothesize that initiating maintenance macrolide therapy in&#xD;
      hospitalized patients with asthma or COPD exacerbations will, when added to usual medical&#xD;
      care, accelerate the improvement in airflow obstruction, respiratory symptoms, and quality of&#xD;
      life and reduce the risk of re-exacerbations after discharge home. The objective of this&#xD;
      pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of the study protocol (recruitment, retention, and&#xD;
      adherence to study procedures and medications), as well as collect preliminary data about the&#xD;
      proportion of exacerbations due to bacterial or viral infections and estimate potential&#xD;
      effect sizes for clinically important outcomes (respiratory symptoms, quality of life,&#xD;
      airflow obstruction, airway inflammation, and rate of re-exacerbations). To achieve these&#xD;
      objectives, we propose a 48 week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover&#xD;
      clinical trial (24 weeks azithromycin, 24 weeks placebo) in adults hospitalized for asthma or&#xD;
      COPD exacerbations to the Johns Hopkins Hospital or Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center.&#xD;
