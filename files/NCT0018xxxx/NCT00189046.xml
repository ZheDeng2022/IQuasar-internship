  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been suggested that cognitive functioning is impaired in chronic pain patients. Since&#xD;
      most of these pain patients engage in daily activities including driving, it was hypothezised&#xD;
      that they may have an increased risk of becoming involved in traffic accidents.&#xD;

      Most chronic pain patients engage in daily activities including driving. Driving a car is a&#xD;
      complex task requiring mental alertness and a variety of cognitive functions such as&#xD;
      perception, attention, learning, memory and decision making.Several studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      cognitive impairments on laboratory tasks in patients with chronic pain, particularly on&#xD;
      measures assessing attentional capacity, processing speed and psychomotor speed. These&#xD;
      findings suggest that car driving performance might be impaired, and that chronic pain&#xD;
      patients may therefore have an increased traffic accident risk. Unfortunately, no studies&#xD;
      have investigated the impact of chronic pain on actual driving ability. The present study was&#xD;
      designed to investigate the effects of chronic pain on actual driving performance during&#xD;
      normal traffic. In addition to the on-the-road driving test, psychomotor, and memory tests&#xD;
      measuring driving-related skills were conducted in the laboratory. Moreover, effects of pain&#xD;
      on an attentional capacity test were tested using event-related potentials.&#xD;
