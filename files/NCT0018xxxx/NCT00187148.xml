  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol will evaluate the safety and tolerability of the vaccine EnvDNA in healthy&#xD;
      adults. DNA-based vaccines are being studied for the prevention of human immunodeficiency&#xD;
      virus (HIV), malaria and hepatitis. DNA vaccines have been well tolerated in human studies to&#xD;
      date. The vaccine that will be tested in this study was made from the information that the&#xD;
      virus uses to make a small part of the HIV. This small part is called the envelope or coating&#xD;
      around the virus. We hope the body will make an immune response against the HIV envelope&#xD;
      coat. Our potential HIV DNA envelope vaccine is called EnvDNA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a research (investigational) study to find out about the safety of a new potential&#xD;
      vaccine for HIV. This potential vaccine may eventually become a part of a sequence of three&#xD;
      experimental vaccines that will be studied to see if they can help to protect people from&#xD;
      HIV. HIV infection is the cause of AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). AIDS is one of&#xD;
      the most serious viral infections we know. This study is being done to help us find an HIV&#xD;
      vaccine that works.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaccine that will be tested in this study was made from the information that the virus&#xD;
      uses to make a small part of the HIV. This small part is called the envelope or coating&#xD;
      around the virus. Because only the information for this one part of the virus is used in the&#xD;
      vaccine, the vaccine cannot cause HIV infection. We make the vaccine in a test tube. The&#xD;
      vaccine is made up of DNA. DNA is like an instruction manual that cells use to make basic&#xD;
      building blocks called proteins. This DNA has the information that cells will use to make the&#xD;
      envelope coat of HIV. Once the DNA is injected intramuscularly, it should tell cells to make&#xD;
      the envelope protein. We hope the body will make an immune response against the HIV envelope&#xD;
      coat. Our potential HIV DNA envelope vaccine is called EnvDNA.&#xD;
