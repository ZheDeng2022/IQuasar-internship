      Objectives: This prospective investigation will compare premenopausal, perimenopausal and&#xD;
      postmenopausal women's response to antidepressant medication. The effects of the menstrual&#xD;
      cycle on the symptoms of depression and antidepressant response will also be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: Premenopausal women will show a significantly better response to a selective&#xD;
      serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) than peri- or postmenopausal women. Premenopausal women&#xD;
      during lower estrogen phases of the menstrual cycle will complain of increased depressive&#xD;
      symptoms despite treatment. Perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with irregular periods&#xD;
      and generally low estrogen levels will show less symptom variability over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Eighty-four women (28 premenopausal, 28 perimenopausal, 28 postmenopausal) meeting&#xD;
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for&#xD;
      major depressive disorder will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: All the subjects will be followed prospectively for 12 weeks and through 2&#xD;
      menstrual cycles while receiving treatment with a standard SSRI antidepressant agent. All&#xD;
      eligible women will have a structured clinical interview and will complete questionnaires&#xD;
      assessing their depressive symptoms. Blood samples will be collected to evaluate for&#xD;
      reproductive hormone levels during the late follicular, midluteal and late luteal phases of&#xD;
      the menstrual cycle for two consecutive cycles. Serum SSRI levels will also be collected at&#xD;
      these times. As the women in the perimenopausal and postmenopausal groups either have&#xD;
      irregular menstrual cycles or no longer cycle, they will have blood samples drawn at baseline&#xD;
      and on 6 other occasions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Implications: As the majority of psychiatric medication is prescribed to women,&#xD;
      understanding the interplay between the menstrual cycle and antidepressant medication will&#xD;
      ultimately translate into more diverse and improved patient care. The proposed study is one&#xD;
      within a developing research program, which will in part be further guided by this study.&#xD;

      Rationale: The lifetime prevalence of depression is twice as high in women as in men; this is&#xD;
      a robust and frequently replicated finding in cross national epidemiology studies. Women are&#xD;
      also more prone to various depressive disorders at certain stages of the life cycle yet the&#xD;
      etiologic mechanisms and therapeutic implications for these increased rates of depression&#xD;
      especially at certain life stages remain largely unknown. The hormonal milieu appears to have&#xD;
      an independent impact on the occurrence of depression and potentially on treatment response&#xD;
      as the disparity between the sexes only emerges after the onset of puberty and persists until&#xD;
      the age of 55.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is accumulating evidence suggesting differential antidepressant drug effects between&#xD;
      men and women and recent preliminary evidence that there may be some differences in treatment&#xD;
      response in women by age. Younger women with depression may be more responsive to&#xD;
      serotonergic antidepressants and this may relate to changes in menstrual status and estrogen&#xD;
      levels. Postmenopausal women have lower estrogen levels and may lack the enhancing effect of&#xD;
      estrogen on serotonergic mechanisms and, thus, may not be able to achieve the full&#xD;
      therapeutic potential of the serotonergic antidepressants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reported differences in response rates between premenopausal and postmenopausal women may&#xD;
      be related to the presence or absence of a menstrual cycle as well as lowered estrogen levels&#xD;
      found in postmenopausal women although this hypothesis has not been formally tested. A&#xD;
      prospective study is therefore proposed to primarily characterize the rates of response&#xD;
      following SSRI therapy in depressed women who meet criteria for Major Depressive Disorder&#xD;
      (MDD) and are treated for a current depressive episode. Menstrual status will be confirmed&#xD;
      based on reproductive hormone levels. Perimenopausal and postmenopausal women will be studied&#xD;
      separately because of their different hormonal profile. All women will rate their symptoms of&#xD;
      depression on a daily basis and in addition, independent raters will rate depressive symptoms&#xD;
      prospectively to determine the relationship between change in depressive symptoms and&#xD;
      antidepressant response across the menstrual cycle. All women will be treated with citalopram&#xD;
      and paroxetine will be the secondary alternative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To compare reduction in severity of depression in premenopausal,&#xD;
      perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: To assess the symptoms of depression and antidepressant response across&#xD;
      the menstrual cycle in premenopausal women with comparisons to peri- and postmenopausal&#xD;
      women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objective: To examine the relationship between estrogen and SSRI level across the&#xD;
      menstrual cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis: The mean reduction in HRSD scores following SSRI antidepressant therapy&#xD;
      will be significantly higher in premenopausal compared to peri-and postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Depression scores (based on HRSD and the Prospective Record of the Impact and Severity&#xD;
           of Menstrual Symptoms [PRISM] calendar) will be significantly higher during the lower&#xD;
           estrogen phases of the menstrual cycle than the higher estrogen phases in premenopausal&#xD;
           women who remain on constant doses of citalopram.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The above relationship will not be discernable in perimenopausal and postmenopausal&#xD;
           women over a comparable time period and during comparable antidepressant treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory hypothesis: There will be a positive correlation between estrogen levels and SSRI&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: This study takes an innovative approach to increasing our understanding of the&#xD;
      hormonal contribution to symptom severity and antidepressant treatment response. Since the&#xD;
      majority of psychotropic medication is prescribed to women, understanding the interactive&#xD;
      process between the menstrual cycle and antidepressant medication has the potential to change&#xD;
      clinical practice by allowing for more individualized pharmacological treatment within an&#xD;
      evidence based approach.&#xD;
