  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of the adminstration of celecoxib, a&#xD;
      cox2-inhibitor in patients with stage II-III non small cell lung cancer receiving radical&#xD;
      radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that celecoxib will increase the remission rate of radiotherapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is difficult, even with the best classical&#xD;
      radiation and chemotherapy schedule results remain disappointing. However, there is evidence&#xD;
      that increasing the local control rate by delivering radiotherapy either in a short period of&#xD;
      time or concomitantly with chemotherapy improves survival. Drawback of a higher radiation&#xD;
      dose or addition of chemotherapy is a higher incidence of toxicity. So radiation dose&#xD;
      escalation could lead to further improvements of prognosis, but the radiation dose is however&#xD;
      limited by radiation-induced lung and esophageal damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For NSCLC, non-toxic agents who both increase the effectiveness of radiotherapy and decrease&#xD;
      radiation induced lung and esophageal damage are needed. The cox-2-inhibitors seem to be&#xD;
      suitable for this purpose. In experimental mice tumor models, it was already shown that&#xD;
      COX-2-inhibitors both inhibit tumor growth and enhance the radio-response of the tumor.&#xD;
      Moreover, anti-inflammatory agents, such asCOX-2-inhibitors, also lowered the incidence of&#xD;
      radiation pneumonitis and esophagitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the simultaneous favourable effects of COX-2 inhibitors on tumor response and&#xD;
      radiation damage in human cancer patients will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised to receive Celecoxib or placebo. All patients will receive the&#xD;
      same radiotherapy treatment. Primary outcome measure is tumor response, assessed by a CT-scan&#xD;
      of the thorax, three months after radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tumor response rate of the experimental group will be compared to the tumor response rate&#xD;
      of the control group.&#xD;
