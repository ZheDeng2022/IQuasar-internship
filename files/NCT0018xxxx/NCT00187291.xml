  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ABCD clinical study is designed to determine if a T-Wave Alternans (TWA) test is&#xD;
      equivalent to an Electrophysiology Study (EPS) in predicting life-threatening heart rhythms&#xD;
      in patients with ischemic heart disease, left ventricular dysfunction, and non-sustained&#xD;
      tachycardia. Patients undergo both the TWA test and EP study and receive an Implantable&#xD;
      Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD)if either of the tests show the patient is at risk. The&#xD;
      patient is then followed for 2 years. The incidence of a ventricular tachyarrhythmia events&#xD;
      and total mortality are to be evaluated over the duration of the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that therapy directed primarily&#xD;
      by a T wave alternans (TWA) test, measured non-invasively during exercise, is equivalent to&#xD;
      therapy directed by an electrophysiological study (EPS) in predicting spontaneous ventricular&#xD;
      tachyarrhythmic events (VTEs) in patients with ischemic heart disease, left ventricular&#xD;
      dysfunction, and asymptomatic non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of any previous life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia (i.e., for primary&#xD;
      prevention), ICD implantation is currently indicated in patients with ischemic heart disease,&#xD;
      left ventricular dysfunction, asymptomatic non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, and a&#xD;
      positive EPS. The objective of this study is to demonstrate that a TWA test directed therapy&#xD;
      is equivalent to EPS directed therapy in guiding ICD implantation for the purpose of primary&#xD;
      prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in patients with ischemic heart disease, left&#xD;
      ventricular dysfunction, and asymptomatic non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, multi-center study to demonstrate the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS: a TWA test directed therapy is equivalent to EPS directed therapy in&#xD;
      predicting VTEs in patients with ischemic heart disease, LVEF less than 0.40, and&#xD;
      asymptomatic non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. The study will determine whether the&#xD;
      positive predictive value of TWA test directed therapy is equivalent to the positive&#xD;
      predictive value of EPS directed therapy. The study will also determine whether the negative&#xD;
      predictive value of TWA test directed therapy is equivalent to the negative predictive value&#xD;
      of EPS directed therapy. The positive groups under TWA test directed therapy will be compared&#xD;
      with the positive groups under EPS directed therapy, and the negative groups under TWA&#xD;
      directed therapy will be compared with the negative groups under EPS directed therapy.&#xD;
      SECONDARY HYPOTHESIS: The study will determine whether the positive predictive value of a TWA&#xD;
      test (not including indeterminates) is equivalent to the positive predictive value of an EPS&#xD;
      in predicting future VTEs. The study will also determine whether the negative predictive&#xD;
      value of a TWA test (not including indeterminates) is equivalent to the negative predictive&#xD;
      value of an EPS in predicting future VTEs. The TWA test positive groups will be compared with&#xD;
      the EPS positive groups, and the TWA test negative groups will be compared with the EPS&#xD;
      negative groups. The secondary hypothesis will also be tested against the primary endpoint&#xD;
      defined above.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with no previous history of life threatening ventricular arrhythmias or&#xD;
        symptomatic non-sustained VT, and who meet the following inclusion criteria may be enrolled&#xD;
        in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Ischemic heart disease as documented by any of the following: previous myocardial&#xD;
             infarction (documented by 2 out of 3 of the following: history, ECG, and/or cardiac&#xD;
             enzymes), prior PTCA or CABG; angina with a positive exercise or pharmacological&#xD;
             stress test; angina with a greater than 50% occlusion of any coronary artery, left&#xD;
             ventricular dysfunction that can be attributed to angiographically documented coronary&#xD;
             artery disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. LVEF less than 0.40 as determined by echocardiography, radionuclide or contrast&#xD;
             ventriculography within six months of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia within 6 months of enrollment, defined as&#xD;
             greater than 3 consecutive premature ventricular contractions having at least three&#xD;
             consecutive intervals with a cycle length at or below 550 ms, and with the entire&#xD;
             episode lasting less than 30 seconds. This episode should be associated with either no&#xD;
             symptoms, or palpitations alone. An episode of NSVT associated with any symptoms&#xD;
             (other than palpitations) does not satisfy inclusion criteria for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The patient is 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. In the judgement of the principal investigator, the patient is capable of undergoing a&#xD;
             sub-maximal treadmill exercise test to a heart rate of 120 bpm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The patient has signed the latest IRB approved informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients meeting any of the following exclusion criteria will not be eligible for&#xD;
        enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient is unable to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient is known to have had a cardiac arrest or sustained life threatening&#xD;
             ventricular arrhythmias, other than in the setting of an acutely reversible cause&#xD;
             (e.g., acute phase MI, drug intoxication).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The patient has had an EPS or TWA test at any time and for any reason prior to being&#xD;
             screened and consented for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The patient has unstable coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The patient has contraindications to ICD implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. A submaximal exercise test is contraindicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The patient has persistent atrial fibrillation or flutter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The patient is less than 28 days post MI, post CABG, or post coronary angioplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The patient has an LVEF 0.40, but no evidence of ischemic heart disease as defined by&#xD;
             section 4.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. The patient has NYHA functional Class IV congestive heart failure symptoms at the time&#xD;
             of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. The patient is on any class 1 or 3 antiarrhythmic drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. The patient is participating in a study of another investigational device or drug. If,&#xD;
             in the opinion of the investigator, this would not interfere with this study, the&#xD;
             eligibility of such a patient should be discussed with the primary investigators of&#xD;
             the ABCD trial, Drs. Rosenbaum or Costantini.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. The patient has any other significant medical condition or acute illness that in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator precludes participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. The patient has a previous history of syncope, unless the episode was clearly not&#xD;
             caused by a ventricular tachyarrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. The patient has a life expectancy of less than one year from any cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. The patient has a positive pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. The patient is not geographically stable or is unable to comply with the follow up&#xD;
             schedule.&#xD;
