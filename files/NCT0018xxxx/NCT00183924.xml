  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients with prostate cancer that is metastatic, progressive, and&#xD;
      resistant to hormonal manipulation and mitoxantrone chemotherapy.Patients have previously&#xD;
      been treated with surgical removal of the testes or hormone therapy, and subsequently with&#xD;
      chemotherapy that included the drug, mitoxantrone (Novantrone). Patients will have prostate&#xD;
      cancer that has worsened despite these treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope to learn whether the combination chemotherapy decreases cancer symptoms and tests,&#xD;
      and to determine how frequently serious side effects occur with acceptable toxicity from the&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have had a histological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of prostate and&#xD;
             currently must have metastatic disease (stage TxNxM1) that is unresponsive or&#xD;
             refractory to hormone therapy and mitoxantrone-based chemotherapeutic regimens.&#xD;
             Patients must have metastatic prostate cancer deemed to be hormone- and mitoxantrone&#xD;
             refractory by one or more of the following (despite androgen ablation, anti-androgen&#xD;
             withdrawal and mitoxantrone therapy where applicable):&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Progression of measurable disease assessed within 28 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Progression of non-measurable (i.e. bone scan or PET scan) disease assessed&#xD;
                  within 42 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Rising PSA - defined as at least 2 consecutive rises in PSA documented over a&#xD;
                  reference value (measure 1). The first rising PSA (measure 2) should be taken at&#xD;
                  least 7 days after the reference value. A third confirmatory PSA measure is&#xD;
                  required (2nd beyond the reference level) to be greater then the second measure&#xD;
                  and it must be obtained at least 7 days after the 2nd measure. Patient must have&#xD;
                  a PSA concentration of at least 10 ng/ml in addition to increasing PSA to be&#xD;
                  eligible based on PSA criteria alone. No minimum PSA is required for patients&#xD;
                  with measurable disease or non-PSA evaluable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have pre-study PSA (within 28 days prior to registration) Note: The PSA result&#xD;
             (done within 28 days prior to registration) need not be elevated for inclusion&#xD;
             provided other criteria for progression are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have received prior hormonal therapy and have a castrate level of testosterone.&#xD;
             Patients treated with orchiectomy are eligible. If they have been treated with&#xD;
             non-steroidal anti-androgens, the patients must have ceased taking flutamide or&#xD;
             nilutamide at least 28 days prior to enrollment and at least 42 days prior to&#xD;
             enrollment for bicalutamide, and patients must have demonstrated disease progression.&#xD;
             Either method of castration can have been supplemented with nonsteroidal antiandrogen&#xD;
             (e.g. flutamide, bicalutamide, nilutamide).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have received prior mitoxantrone therapy&#xD;
&#xD;

             body bone marrow (see Appendix 5). This includes prior use of samarium, but patients&#xD;
             cannot have received strontium. (&gt;28 days must have elapsed since completion of RT&#xD;
             with recovery from side effects. Soft tissue disease irradiated in the prior 2 months&#xD;
             is not and may not be designated as measurable disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  May have received prior surgery (21 days must have elapsed since completion of surgery&#xD;
             with recovery from side effects)&#xD;

             days prior to registration).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Liver enzymes: If alkaline phosphatase is less than or equal to 4 x institutional&#xD;
             upper limit of normal (ULN), then AST and ALT must be less than or equal to 2.0 x ULN.&#xD;
             If alkaline phosphatase is &gt; 4 x ULN in patients with bone metastases, then AST and&#xD;
             ALT must be &lt; 1.25 x ULN.&#xD;
