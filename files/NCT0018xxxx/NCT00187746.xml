      Healthy African American subjects with normal hepatic and renal function will be administered&#xD;
      10mg adefovir dipivoxil in a fasting state. Subjects will have blood and urine collections&#xD;
      over the following 24 hours for the measurement of adefovir renal clearance. To investigate&#xD;
      the role of age in renal adefovir elimination, 8 subjects will be enrolled from each of the&#xD;
      following age groups: 18-25 years and 48-55 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are two major routes of elimination for drugs - hepatic metabolism and renal&#xD;
      elimination. For small, hydrophilic molecules, the renal route predominates. The renal&#xD;
      function of patients taking these medications therefore determines the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      (and by extension the clinical response to) these medications. One of the most common causes&#xD;
      of reduced renal function is a decline with age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal drug elimination is comprised of passive drug filtration, active secretion, and&#xD;
      reabsorption (which can occur by both active and passive processes). The filtration function&#xD;
      of the kidney, approximated by the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) falls by 25-50% between&#xD;
      the ages of 20 and 90 [Turnheim 2003]. The decline in renal function with age has been&#xD;
      identified as a major cause of adverse drug reactions in the elderly population [Lindeman&#xD;
      1995; Mühlberg 1999]. To avoid overdosing and exaggerated responses from these medications,&#xD;
      algorithms have been established for dosing in patients with reduced renal function due to&#xD;
      changes in glomerular filtration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, in a previous study looking at the pharmacokinetics of a drug cleared only by the&#xD;
      renal route, we made an observation that appeared to contradict the &quot;renal clearance declines&#xD;
      with age&quot; dogma. In this study, Effect of Genetic Variation in the Renal Transporter, OAT1,&#xD;
      on the Renal Secretion of Adefovir), we identified individuals with genetic variants in OAT1,&#xD;
      a transporter that was believed to be involved in the active secretion of Adefovir. All OAT1&#xD;
      non-synonymous genetic variants we identified were in the African American population. We&#xD;
      administered 10mg Adefovir dipivoxil to 10 African American subjects between the ages of 19&#xD;
      and 49 (4 who had a genetic variant in OAT1, and six without one). These subjects were&#xD;
      identified from a parent study, called &quot;SOPHIE&quot; (NCT00187668). SOPHIE (Studies Of&#xD;
      Pharmacogenetics In Ethnically Diverse Individuals) is a study where DNA was collected from&#xD;
      Bay Area adults (18-40 years of age) for the testing of drug response genes. In addition to&#xD;
      DNA donation, subjects consent to be contacted for future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We collected blood and urine over 24 hours to calculate the total renal clearance and net&#xD;
      secretory clearance of adefovir. Although we saw no difference in the renal elimination of&#xD;
      adefovir in the subjects attributable to OAT1 variants, we found a correlation between the&#xD;
      age and renal clearance. Filtration (calculated from the measured creatinine clearance)&#xD;
      remained constant in this population (112 ml/min + 18 (SD)), and the clearance of Adefovir&#xD;
      increased with age. Both the total renal clearance and net secretory clearance increased with&#xD;
      age (p=0.017 and p=0.010, respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This incidental finding is interesting, as it may indicate an age-dependence of active drug&#xD;
      elimination mechanisms. However, the sample size in this previous study is small, and the&#xD;
      observation may not be accurate. We therefore have planned this confirmatory study, to expand&#xD;
      the study population. As the initial finding was made in African American subjects, we plan&#xD;
      to enroll an additional 16 African American subjects (8 each from the following age groups:&#xD;
      18-25 and 48-55). We will also genotype these individuals for variants in transporters and&#xD;
      other proteins that may play a role in adefovir renal elimination. If the unexpected finding&#xD;
      of an age-related increase of adefovir renal clearance is observed in this study, additional&#xD;
      follow-up studies will be planned to examine whether the same holds true for other ethnic&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
