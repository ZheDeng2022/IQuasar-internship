  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that duloxetine (Cymbalta), in doses of&#xD;
      60 or 120 mg/day, is an effective and tolerable treatment for adult outpatients suffering&#xD;
      from dysthymia. Dysthymia is chronic, mild depression characterized by feeling sad or low&#xD;
      more days than not for more than 2 years.&#xD;

      The purpose of this research is to obtain information on the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      duloxetine (Cymbalta) in the treatment of dysthymia. Duloxetine has been approved by the&#xD;
      federal Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of depression. The use of duloxetine&#xD;
      for treatment of dysthymia is considered experimental.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dysthymia is defined as chronic, low-grade depression, characterized by feeling low or&#xD;
      depressed, that lasts for two or more years. Additional symptoms may include: poor appetite&#xD;
      or overeating; insomnia or sleeping too much; low energy or fatigue; low self-esteem; poor&#xD;
      concentration or difficulty making decisions; and feelings of hopelessness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dysthymia affects 3-6% of the general population, but is an underdiagnosed and undertreated&#xD;
      disorder. In double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of antidepressant medications,&#xD;
      dysthymia response rates are around 60%, compared to an average placebo response rate of&#xD;
      about 30%. Duloxetine has not been studied in the treatment of dysthymia, but has shown&#xD;
      results in the treatment of major depression. In a 9-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      study of 257 patients with major depression, 65% responded to duloxetine 60mg/day, compared&#xD;
      to 43% to placebo. Based on these results, it is highly likely that duloxetine will be an&#xD;
      effective treatment for dysthymia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is being conducted at Stanford University Medical Center with a total of&#xD;
      24 patients, age 18 and above, with dysthymia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study, subjects will receive duloxetine for 12 weeks. This is an open-label study,&#xD;
      which means that every subject receives the study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, subjects are seen for 10 visits across 13 weeks. At each visit subjects' heart&#xD;
      rate, blood pressure and weight measurements will be obtained. At each visit study personnel&#xD;
      will interview subjects about their symptoms, monitor side effects and ask them to complete&#xD;
      study questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning at the second visit, subjects receive duloxetine 60 mg/day. If they experience side&#xD;
      effects, the dose can be decreased to 30 mg/day for several days, but will be increased back&#xD;
      to 60 mg/day by the end of the first week. If subjects are unable to tolerate a dose of 60&#xD;
      mg/day due to side effects, they will be withdrawn from the study. At the end of 6 weeks, if&#xD;
      they have not responded to the study medication (as determined by doctor ratings based on&#xD;
      subjects' reports), the dose of duloxetine will be increased to 120 mg/day, unless subjects&#xD;
      are experiencing troubling side effects. Subjects continue on the minimum dose that brings&#xD;
      about remission or the maximum tolerated dose for the remaining 6 weeks. Medication dosing&#xD;
      will be flexible and determined by tolerance (side effects) and therapeutic effect.&#xD;
