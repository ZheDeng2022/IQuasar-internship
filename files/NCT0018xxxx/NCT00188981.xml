      The Dutch Prediction of Psychosis Study (DUPS) is a prospective study of predictors of the&#xD;
      transition to psychosis in help-seeking adolescents at high risk for developing a first&#xD;
      psychotic episode. The aim of the project is supplemented by a systematic account of the&#xD;
      pathways to care, the disabilities and needs and the therapeutic interventions that are&#xD;
      currently used in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi-level assessment includes behavioral and cognitive variables as well as structural&#xD;
      brain imaging and neurophysiological data. Subjects will be followed up at regular intervals&#xD;
      during (at least) two years to monitor the development of their (psychotic) symptoms. This&#xD;
      will allow us to analyze the predictive validity of the variables.&#xD;

      The Dutch Prediction of Psychosis Study (DUPS) is a collaboration of the Academic Medical&#xD;
      Center in Amsterdam (AMC) and the University Medical Center in Utrecht (UMC). The main&#xD;
      objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pathways to care: the description of the ways subjects at risk for psychosis get access&#xD;
           to the health care system and the detection of obstacles to adequate treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prediction: the systematic multi-level assessment of predictors of the transition to a&#xD;
           first psychotic episode in subjects at risk for psychosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Disability: the description of disabilities, deficits and needs in prodromal individuals&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Intervention: the description of the therapeutic and preventive interventions applied to&#xD;
           prodromal individuals&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the same fundamental principles (e.g. inclusion criteria) are applied in both centers,&#xD;
      additional instruments or paradigms are added in the separate centers according to specific&#xD;
      interests, expertise and setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our specific interest is in the social cognition and social functioning of prepsychotic&#xD;
      individuals. Therefore, in addition to the subjects that are at high risk for psychosis&#xD;
      according to the DUPS inclusion/exclusion criteria we are including another group of subjects&#xD;
      that is at elevated risk for psychosis, namely subjects who have a Multiple Complex&#xD;
      Developmental Disorder (MCDD) which is a subtype of the pervasive developmental disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective longitudinal field-study with repeated measures to monitor&#xD;
      subjects at high risk for psychosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study sample in the UMC consists of adolescents who are already referred to adolescent&#xD;
      psychiatric outpatient's clinics because of mental problems. After informed consent they are&#xD;
      screened for the following inclusion and exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age between 12 and 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. No previous psychotic episode for more than one week&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Verbal IQ above 75&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Symptoms are not due to an organic mental disorder or substance abuse&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Belong to one or more of the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Basic symptoms: presence of self-perceived cognitive thought disturbances&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Familial risk plus reduced functioning: having a first- or second degree relative&#xD;
                with a history of any psychotic disorder in combination with a deterioration of&#xD;
                mental state and/or social functioning in the last year&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Attenuated psychotic symptoms: presence of psychotic symptoms at sub-clinical level&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Brief, limited or intermittent psychotic symptoms: having a history of psychotic&#xD;
                symptoms with a duration of less than one week and spontaneous remission&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Multiple Complex Developmental Disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. basic clinical assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. neuropsychological measures (attention, memory, executive functioning)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. social cognitive measures (facial emotion recognition, mentalizing, social attribution)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. measures of social cognition and behavior&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. EEG and Event Related Potentials (including smooth pursuit eye movement, auditory&#xD;
           mismatch negativity)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. structural MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some data will be collected retrospectively upon inclusion into the study, for example&#xD;
      symptom history and pathways to care. Outcome is assessed after 9, 18 and 24 months.&#xD;
