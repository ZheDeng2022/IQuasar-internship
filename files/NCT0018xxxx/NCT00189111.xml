  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if subjecting cardiac high risk patients to non&#xD;
      invasive cardiac imaging, followed by treatment will improve survival and quality of life&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common disease associated with a considerably&#xD;
      increased risk of future events and with a high prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD).&#xD;
      Improvement of the prognosis of this patient group is needed. Screening for CAD has become an&#xD;
      option with recent developments in CT-angiography and MR stress testing. It is unknown if&#xD;
      high-risk patient groups benefit from screening through non-invasive cardiac imaging.&#xD;
      Therefore we propose to study whether a cardiac imaging algorithm, using non-invasive imaging&#xD;
      techniques followed by evidence-based treatment will reduce the risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease in cardiac asymptomatic PAD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GROUND study is designed as a prospective, multi-center, randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
      Patients with peripheral arterial disease, but yet without a history of symptomatic cardiac&#xD;
      disease will be asked to participate. All patients receive a proper therapeutic advice before&#xD;
      randomization. Half of the recruited patients will enter the 'control group' and only receive&#xD;
      CT calcium scoring. The other half of the recruited patients (index group) will undergo the&#xD;
      non invasive cardiac imaging algorithm followed by evidence-based treatment. First patients&#xD;
      undergo CT calcium scoring and CT angiography. Patients with a left main (or equivalent)&#xD;
      coronary artery stenosis on CT angiography will be referred to a cardiologist without further&#xD;
      imaging. All other patients in this group will undergo Dobutamine Stress Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      (DSMR) testing. Patients with a DSMR positive for ischemia will also be referred to a&#xD;
      cardiologist. Most referred patients will very likely undergo conventional coronary artery&#xD;
      angiography and cardiac interventions (CABG or PCI) if indicated. All participants of the&#xD;
      trial will enter a 5 year follow up period for the occurrence of future cardiovascular&#xD;
      events. Interim analysis will take place and based on power calculations about 1200 patients&#xD;
      are needed to reach significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications The GROUND study will provide new insight into the question whether non-invasive&#xD;
      cardiac imaging reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with peripheral&#xD;
      arterial disease, but yet without symptoms of coronary artery disease as an example of a high&#xD;
      risk patient group.&#xD;
