      relieving pain associated with recurring plantar fasciosis and, secondarily, to determine&#xD;
      whether there may be additional potential benefits stemming from its use.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Severe recalcitrant heel pain, resulting from repetitive trauma to the plantar fascia, is a&#xD;
      relatively commonly observed phenomenon. Although this condition is frequently referred to as&#xD;
      'heel spurs', plantar fasciitis (acute inflammatory stage) and plantar fasciosis (chronic&#xD;
      degeneration) are currently accepted as the more accurate terms. Symptoms most often occur&#xD;
      during the first few steps in the morning but may also be effected during intense activity or&#xD;
      with prolonged standing. The source of pain symptoms, which are usually perceived as a&#xD;
      gradual onset of burning, is located at the origin of the plantar fascia at the calcaneous&#xD;
      (heel bone). Risk factors such as low or high arches or over-pronation of the foot, systemic&#xD;
      disease, or obesity may exacerbate pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than two million Americans receive treatment each year for plantar fasciitis and&#xD;
      fasciosis. Conservative treatment options for plantar fasciosis include rest, stretching,&#xD;
      strengthening, and massage, progressing to non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, steroid&#xD;
      injections or iontophoresis with continued recalcitrance. Orthotics, heel cups, night splints&#xD;
      and plantar strapping are other conservative options frequently recommended by treating&#xD;
      physicians. Patient outcomes and response to conservative measures are usually positive, with&#xD;
      non-responsive cases, approximately 10% of all presenting cases, receiving surgical care.&#xD;
      Extracorporeal shockwave treatment has recently been advocated for the recalcitrant cases and&#xD;
      has shown to be effective in 60-80 percent of the cases. Plantar fascia release, either&#xD;
      partial or complete, is commonly the surgical procedure of choice for treating plantar&#xD;
      fasciosis. However, this surgery has a risk of complications and is thought to alter the&#xD;
      biomechanics of the foot, which may be linked to post-operative lateral column pain and&#xD;
      long-term disability. Because of the potential postoperative sequelae with plantar fascia&#xD;
      release, it is valuable to examine less invasive surgical techniques for treating&#xD;
      recalcitrant plantar fasciosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concept of using a plasma RF-based microsurgical approach as a viable modality for&#xD;
      treating tendinosis, and now, recalcitrant plantar fasciosis, was originally drawn from the&#xD;
      research work conducted in patients treated for congestive heart failure using laser or&#xD;
      RF-based transmyocardial revascularization (TMR). The mechanism of action behind the clinical&#xD;
      success observed with laser and RF-based TMR was theorized to be associated with the&#xD;
      localized angiogenic healing response noted to occur following the procedure. Localized&#xD;
      angiogenesis had not been observed previously using mechanical devices for TMR, which were&#xD;
      also less successful clinically. To substantiate adopting a TMR-like approach for treating&#xD;
      tendinosis, the capability of plasma RF-based microsurgery for initiating an angiogenic&#xD;
      healing response was examined in vivo using histology and biochemical analysis. The sum of&#xD;
      several studies provides good evidence to suggest that plasma RF-based microsurgery can&#xD;
      promote an angiogenic healing response using an appropriate application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary clinical experience following plasma RF-based micro-tenotomy has demonstrated&#xD;
      excellent success in treating chronic, refractive tendinosis. The investigators reported that&#xD;
      this technique was technically simple to perform and was much less invasive than conventional&#xD;
      surgery. Patients had a rapid and uncomplicated recovery and reported minimal to no pain 7-10&#xD;
      days following the procedure; their pain relief persisted or improved through 24 months.&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging correlated well with clinical results. These promising clinical&#xD;
      findings, as well as the evidence from the basic research studies, led us to consider&#xD;
      evaluating this plasma RF-based approach for treating symptomatic, chronic, recalcitrant heel&#xD;
      pain resembling plantar fasciosis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;
      of Coblation-based fasciotomy for relieving pain associated with recalcitrant plantar&#xD;
      fasciosis and, secondarily, to determine whether there may be additional potential benefits&#xD;
      stemming from its use, such as reduced incidence of postoperative complications and improved&#xD;
      function, compared to conventional surgery.&#xD;
