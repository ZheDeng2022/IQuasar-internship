  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether aripiprazole (marketed dopamine stabilizer)&#xD;
      is effective in reducing of alcohol craving compared to placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-treatment seeking individuals meeting criteria for alcohol dependence (N=30) will be&#xD;
      recruited through advertisement and paid for their participation. Alcoholics, after baseline&#xD;
      evaluation, will be assigned through urn randomization to one of two experimental groups in&#xD;
      which they will receive either aripiprazole (up to 15 mg/day) or an identical placebo.&#xD;
      Subjects will take the study drug or placebo for 8 days (day 1-6 being the natural&#xD;
      observation period). After a minimum of 24 hours of abstinence from alcohol (day 7-8) they&#xD;
      will undergo an alcohol administration (priming dose) and motivated free choice drinking&#xD;
      procedure (on day 8). Alcoholic subjects will receive a brief counseling session at the end&#xD;
      of the study to enhance their awareness of problem drinking and to motivate them to seek&#xD;
      treatment. Referral for treatment will be offered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will undergo a functional MRI brain scan with cue stimulation on day 7, on the&#xD;
      evening before the alcohol administration paradigm. fMRI brain imaging technology will be&#xD;
      used to determine if alcoholics treated with aripiprazole differ in alcohol cue-induced&#xD;
      activity in the nucleus accumbens. It is hypothesized that aripiprazole will reduce nucleus&#xD;
      accumbens activation to alcohol cues compared to placebo.&#xD;
