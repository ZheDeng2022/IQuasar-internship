  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is for subjects with cancer of the kidney (also known as renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma) that cannot be treated with surgery. The purpose of this study is to see if the&#xD;
      combination of bevacizumab and bortezomib is safe and tolerable and can help people with&#xD;
      kidney cancer. The investigators would also like to find out what dose of the study drugs can&#xD;
      be used safely and effectively, whether the combination of these two drugs can decrease&#xD;
      cancer symptoms and stop tumor growth, and how frequently serious side effects might occur&#xD;
      with this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in two phases-Phase 1 and Phase 2. In Phase 1, subjects will be&#xD;
      assigned to a fixed dose of bevacizumab and different strengths of bortezomib given at 2&#xD;
      different schedules. Phase 2 will depend on how subjects tolerate the doses and schedules of&#xD;
      bortezomib in Phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bortezomib is a type of drug known as a &quot;proteasome inhibitor.&quot; By blocking the &quot;proteasome&quot;&#xD;
      in cancer cells, bortezomib affects the way these cells divide. Bevacizumab is an inhibitor&#xD;
      (blocker) of blood vessel formation. Tumors need blood vessels in order to continue to grow&#xD;
      and bevacizumab is thought to work by preventing new blood vessels from growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bortezomib (also called Velcade or PS-341) has been approved by the US Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) for the treatment of myeloma, but has not been approved for the&#xD;
      treatment of kidney cancer. Bevacizumab (also called Avastin) has been approved by the FDA&#xD;
      for the treatment of colon cancer, but has not been approved for the treatment of kidney&#xD;
      cancer. However, the FDA is permitting the combined use of bortezomib and bevacizumab in this&#xD;
      research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bevacizumab that will be given in this study is not a commercially marketed product.&#xD;
      Although it is expected to be very similar in safety and activity to the commercially&#xD;
      available drug, it is possible that some differences may exist. Because this is not a&#xD;
      commercially marketed drug, bevacizumab can only be administered to subjects enrolled in this&#xD;
      study and may only be administered under the direction of physicians who are investigators in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 40-52 subjects will take part in this study.&#xD;
