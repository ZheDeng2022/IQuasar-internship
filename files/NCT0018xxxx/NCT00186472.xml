  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infants born premature face numerous medical problems, causing significant anxiety for their&#xD;
      parents. Parents experience a range of negative emotions including concern for the health and&#xD;
      well being of their fragile infant, guilt, and disappointment. Research has indicated that&#xD;
      having an infant in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) is highly stressful for parents&#xD;
      and multiple studies have demonstrated that parents can develop significant psychological&#xD;
      reactions to this experience. Specifically, many parents develop clinically significant&#xD;
      anxiety disorders such as acute stress disorder (ASD) and posttraumatic stress disorder&#xD;
      (PTSD). This not only impacts the mental well-being of the parents, but also can lead to&#xD;
      problems with the parent-infant relationship, and, in turn, negatively impact the infant and&#xD;
      the family as a whole. Despite the reported negative effects parents experience due to the&#xD;
      stress of having an infant on the NICU, surprisingly little research has examined how to&#xD;
      reduce parents' symptoms of anxiety. Because parents play an essential role in the care of&#xD;
      their infant after discharge from the NICU, treating the parent's emotional distress is&#xD;
      highly important. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of a&#xD;
      cognitive-behaviorally based intervention in reducing parents' symptoms of anxiety associated&#xD;
      with having an infant on the NICU. This treatment is modeled after treatments that have&#xD;
      proven effective with parents of children with other types of medical problems, for example,&#xD;
      parents of children with cancer. It is the hope of the investigators that this intervention&#xD;
      will effectively reduce symptoms of anxiety of NICU parents as well as the likelihood of&#xD;
      developing subsequent psychological disorders.&#xD;
