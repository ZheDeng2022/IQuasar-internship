  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of Ziprasidone in the&#xD;
      treatment of mania in children and adolescents with Bipolar disorder over 8 weeks. This is an&#xD;
      exploratory, open-label study, which seeks to determine if there is evidence for efficacy.&#xD;
      The results of this study will be used to generate hypotheses for a larger study.&#xD;

      Initial clinical evidence suggests that atypical neuroleptics may play a unique therapeutic&#xD;
      role in the management of symptoms in youth with bipolar disorder. Ziprasidone is classed as&#xD;
      an atypical neuroleptic because of its unique pharmacological profile that includes both D2&#xD;
      and 5HT2 antagonistic effects. This combined dopaminergic and serotonergic activity seems to&#xD;
      be associated not only with antipsychotic effects but also with mood stabilizing, mood&#xD;
      elevating and anti-aggressive effects as well as a lower risk for extrapyramidal symptoms and&#xD;
      tardive dyskinesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ziprasidone in particular has been found to have a higher 5HT2A to D2 receptor affinity&#xD;
      ratio, which suggests that the likelihood of extrapyramidal symptoms and hyperprolactinemia&#xD;
      may be further decreased. This makes it an ideal candidate to treat mania in children, but&#xD;
      although it is used in clinical practice, adequate data has not been collected on its safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness. This study included 1) an 8-week acute period, during which participants&#xD;
      were observed during weekly visits, and up to a 10-month extension period, during which&#xD;
      participants saw a study clinician on a monthly basis, to document the response rate 2)&#xD;
      assessment of the impact of Ziprasidone on functional capacities (quality of life,&#xD;
      psychosocial function) and cognition, 3) careful assessment of safety and tolerability.&#xD;
