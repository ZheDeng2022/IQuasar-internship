  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to determine whether perioperative NMDA-receptor antagonism has&#xD;
      differential effects on postoperative pain, hyperalgesia and morbidity in younger and older&#xD;
      patients. In order to achieve this aim, the researchers propose to conduct the first&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study designed to investigate age differences in&#xD;
      the effects of perioperative oral administration of an NMDA-receptor antagonist (amantadine)&#xD;
      in men undergoing radical prostatectomy. In addition, age differences in psychosocial factors&#xD;
      and the pharmacological properties of amantadine and morphine will be measured to control&#xD;
      for, and clarify, their contribution to the differences found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives of the study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. investigate the effects of perioperative NMDA receptor blockade on postoperative&#xD;
           hyperalgesia, pain and analgesic consumption in young and elderly men&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. assess age differences in the intensity and course of secondary hyperalgesia after&#xD;
           surgery&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The immediate postoperative period is associated with spontaneous pain and hyperalgesia,&#xD;
      i.e., increased pain response (both intensity and duration) to normally painful stimuli&#xD;
      following tissue injury or damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development and maintenance of secondary hyperalgesia depend on complex plastic changes&#xD;
      in spinal cord dorsal horn cells after peripheral injury or damage. Afferent impulses&#xD;
      signaling the damage are carried to the dorsal horn by slowly conducting, unmyelinated&#xD;
      C-fibres. C-fibres release glutamate which acts at three receptor types: metabotropic,&#xD;
      kainate/AMPA and NMDA. NMDA receptor activation, through a complex cascade of intracellular&#xD;
      events, results in dorsal horn neuron hyperexcitability or central sensitization. These cells&#xD;
      have increased spontaneous activity, decreased threshold, increased response to afferent&#xD;
      input, prolonged afterdischarge to repeated stimulation, and an expansion of receptive&#xD;
      fields. Central sensitization is expressed behaviorally as secondary hyperalgesia and&#xD;
      contributes to prolonged postoperative pain. It also may trigger pathological reorganization&#xD;
      of neural circuitry leading to the development of chronic postsurgical pain. Through these&#xD;
      processes, tissue injury may have profound effects on the CNS that long outlast the injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In animal models of pain, NMDA agonists induce central sensitization and hyperalgesia whereas&#xD;
      antagonists decrease or prevent hyperalgesia. In humans, NMDA-receptor antagonism decreases&#xD;
      secondary hyperalgesia subsequent to experimentally-induced pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperative administration of NMDA antagonists, that is, before, during and after surgery,&#xD;
      may be the ideal intervention to block the initiation and maintenance of central&#xD;
      sensitization. Several studies have found that this intervention reduces postoperative&#xD;
      hyperalgesia, pain, and analgesic use; however, others have not found these effects. This is&#xD;
      not surprising given the variability across studies in factors such as surgical procedure,&#xD;
      extent and nature of tissue damage, duration of surgery, pharmacokinetics of the agent(s)&#xD;
      tested, and intraoperative and postoperative analgesia. Nonetheless, the weight of the&#xD;
      evidence suggests that preventing or minimizing central sensitization reduces pain and&#xD;
      analgesic requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-administration of NMDA antagonists and opioids has been advocated as an effective&#xD;
      approach. The combination of morphine and amantadine should reduce postoperative pain by&#xD;
      inducing analgesia through actions on opioid-mediated receptor systems and by reducing&#xD;
      hyperalgesia via NMDA receptor-mediated events . The combination also should produce fewer&#xD;
      opioid-related adverse effects due to the anticipated opioid-sparing effect. The present&#xD;
      proposal describes the first direct comparison of perioperative NMDA receptor blockade&#xD;
      coupled with intra- and post-operative opioid administration in young and elderly patients.&#xD;
      In order to minimize the influence of other perioperative factors on the outcome variables,&#xD;
      all patients will undergo the same surgical procedure and anesthetic protocol. Furthermore,&#xD;
      factors that cannot readily be standardized (e.g., surgical duration, mood) will be measured&#xD;
      and controlled for statistically. This increases the internal validity of the proposed study&#xD;
      and our ability to detect age and drug effects.&#xD;
