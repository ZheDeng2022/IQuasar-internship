    <textblock>
      This will be a 6-week, unblinded study using the medication Strattera for children and&#xD;
      adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) who failed to respond to an&#xD;
      adequate trial of stimulant treatment. Specific hypotheses are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: ADHD symptomatology in youth with ADHD will be responsive to Strattera&#xD;
      treatment in the short term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Strattera treatment (in doses of up to 120 mg/day or 1.2 mg/kg/day) in children&#xD;
      and adolescents with ADHD will be safe and well tolerated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Strattera (atomoxetine) is a non-stimulant presynaptic norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor&#xD;
      recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in child, adolescent and adult&#xD;
      patients with ADHD. Atomoxetine is a potent inhibitor of the presynaptic norepinephrine&#xD;
      transporter with minimal affinity for other noradrenergic receptors or for other&#xD;
      neurotransmitter transporters or receptors. Thus, Strattera could be a viable alternative&#xD;
      treatment for ADHD individuals who do not respond to stimulants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      Strattera in youth, ages 6-17 years with ADHD who failed to respond to an adequate trial of&#xD;
      stimulant treatment. If this initial study shows proof of the concept, we will follow-up the&#xD;
      study with a randomized clinical trial.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female outpatients 6-17 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with the diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), by the&#xD;
             Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), as&#xD;
             manifested in clinical evaluation and confirmed by structured interview.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a past history of depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder&#xD;
             (including obsessive compulsive disorder [OCD]) without current disorder for &gt; 3&#xD;
             months as ascertained through structured diagnostic interview and clinical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects treated for anxiety disorders and depression (with non-MAOI antidepressants&#xD;
             [e.g., SSRIs, bupropion, venlafaxine] or benzodiazepines) who are on a stable&#xD;
             medication regimen for at least three months, and who have a disorder specific&#xD;
             Clinical Global Impression (CGI)-severity score â‰¤ 3 (mildly ill) and who have a score&#xD;
             on the Hamilton-Depression and Hamilton-Anxiety Rating Scale below 15 (mild range)&#xD;
             will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a past or present history of tics will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a past history of substance use disorders but drug and alcohol free for&#xD;
             &gt; 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with mild cases of asthma and allergy will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potential subjects will have failed an adequate trial of a stimulant as defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects who had intolerable side effects on a stimulant, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Poor response (an ADHD CGI-I of &gt; 3) on at least 4 weeks of &gt; 1.0 mg/kg/day of a&#xD;
                  methylphenidate product; or &gt; 0.5 mg/kg/day of an amphetamine product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Only English-speaking subjects will be allowed into the study for the following&#xD;
             reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               3. psychiatric questionnaires and evaluations are taxing and adding the complexity&#xD;
                  of a translator has the potential to make the patient experience even more&#xD;
                  exhausting.&#xD;
