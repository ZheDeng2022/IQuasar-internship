      The DAVID II Clinical Study evaluates the hypothesis that, in patients needing an ICD but&#xD;
      without overt indications for pacing, AAI pacing with maximal concomitant drug therapy will&#xD;
      not increase the rate of the combined endpoint of mortality or hospitalization for new or&#xD;
      worsened heart failure as compared to patients with ventricular backup pacing.&#xD;

      The DAVID II Clinical Study evaluates the hypothesis that, in patients needing an ICD but&#xD;
      without overt indications for pacing, AAI pacing with maximal concomitant drug therapy will&#xD;
      not increase the rate of the combined endpoint of mortality or hospitalization for new or&#xD;
      worsened heart failure, compared to patients with ventricular backup pacing (VVI), and that&#xD;
      AAI pacing will result in a reduction of 0.425 years in median event-free survival compared&#xD;
      to VVI pacing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment and Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 600 patients have been enrolled and randomized. All patients previously enrolled&#xD;
      in the VVI arm of the DAVID Trial who were hemodynamically stable in the VVI-40 programmed&#xD;
      mode and willing to participate have been randomized in equal numbers into the study. New&#xD;
      patients (not previously randomized in DAVID) have also been enrolled and similarly&#xD;
      randomized. The randomization was stratified for investigational site, for previous&#xD;
      randomization in DAVID vs being newly-enrolled, for a history of CHF, and, among the new&#xD;
      enrollees, for primary versus preventive eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were enrolled with the same indications used in the DAVID Trial, including MADIT II&#xD;
      indications, with the exception that any patient in class III heart failure must have been on&#xD;
      optimal heart failure therapy for at least 3 months prior to enrollment and randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any planned cardiac surgery (ablation, endocardial resection, valve, aneurysmectomy,&#xD;
      revascularization) must have been completed before randomization. All patients have received&#xD;
      commercially available St. Jude dual chamber ICD systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients have not be told to which pacing mode, VVI or AAI they have been assigned (i.e.,&#xD;
      they will be blinded) in order to reduce the potential for patient generated bias in the&#xD;
      quality of life assessments which are part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crossover:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will remain in the study with the device programmed according to their&#xD;
      randomization assignment, from the point of randomization to the end of follow-up. No&#xD;
      crossover from one pacing mode to the other is permitted, even after a hospital admission for&#xD;
      congestive heart failure, until the reason for the requested crossover is reviewed and&#xD;
      permission is obtained from the University of Washington Clinical Trials Center to change&#xD;
      pacing mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimal CHF Pharmacologic Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimal CHF Pharmacologic Therapy in the study consists of digoxin, diuretics,&#xD;
      angiotensin-converting enzyme, (ACE) inhibitors , and beta-blockers. Treatment during the&#xD;
      study adheres to the Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) Practice Guidelines. Heart&#xD;
      Failure symptoms are treated by adjustment of both the rate and rate response of the&#xD;
      pacemaker and the medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is either death or CHF hospitalization. The determination of CHF&#xD;
      hospitalization will be made by an Events Committee based on review of the hospital records&#xD;
      blinded as to treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Appropriate ICD therapy--ICD shocks plus Antitachycardia Pacing(ATP)events;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inappropriate ICD therapy (any therapy deemed not related to Ventricular Tachycardia&#xD;
           (VT) or Ventricular Fibrillation (VF);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of Life (SF-36, MLHF, VAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed at 3-month intervals. The patients are also instructed to call&#xD;
      their investigational center any time they receive an ICD shock therapy delivery in order to&#xD;
      have an ICD interrogation/download of the device's memory performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Items Collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard demographics, clinical histories, and a QoL assessment were obtained at baseline.&#xD;
      During the follow-up phase, routine clinical data is obtained every 3 months. Quality of life&#xD;
      assessments are be repeated at 6 months. Events (adverse symptoms, hospitalization,&#xD;
      death)trigger more extensive data collection including, in particular: 1)all ICD printouts,&#xD;
      2)detailed hospital records for all CHF hospitalizations, and patient records for all deaths.&#xD;
