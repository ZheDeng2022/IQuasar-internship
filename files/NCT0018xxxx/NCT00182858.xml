  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The need to obtain human tissue for methods development and disease correlation is frequent&#xD;
      in Biomedical Research Center laboratories. This protocol is designed to create the&#xD;
      opportunity to obtain such tissue samples including: blood, urine, saliva, sweat, feces, hair&#xD;
      and nail clippings, nasal scraping, muscle, fat, skin and taste buds. It may also include&#xD;
      samples taken during a surgical procedure, including: fluid from around the spinal column,&#xD;
      heart, lungs and abdomen; fat, muscle, connective tissue and organs (liver, bladder, heart,&#xD;
      kidney and skin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information derived from such studies is for research purposes only and is not provided to&#xD;
      the participants or their health care provider. Samples will be coded (no names) and&#xD;
      identifying information linking the participant to the sample will be maintained in a secure&#xD;
      location by the P.I. and Study Coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be 18 years or older and have been identified by the investigator and/or&#xD;
      physician to have a condition of interest for exploratory studies related to the participant&#xD;
      s illness or other feature that offers the possibility of creating information that leads to&#xD;
      scientifically useful and important studies. Participants could also be healthy volunteers,&#xD;
      willing to provide their samples. These samples could be requested by an investigator to be&#xD;
      used as age, gender, race and/or ethnicity-matched controls or to calibrate or compare and&#xD;
      contrast across lab equipment. Participants will be excluded if obtaining the sample would be&#xD;
      over and above usual clinical care, would result in excessive blood loss, or the individual&#xD;
      is unable to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected outcome is to provide investigators with the opportunity to obtain tissues of&#xD;
      interest for laboratory evaluation.&#xD;
