  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-labeled study of Aripiprazole, testing its efficacy in the treatment of mania&#xD;
      in children and adolescents with Bipolar I, Bipolar II and Bipolar Spectrum Disorder over 8&#xD;
      weeks. This is an exploratory, pilot study, seeking to determine whether Aripiprazole is&#xD;
      efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of youth with pediatric bipolar and bipolar&#xD;
      spectrum disorder. The study results will be used to generate hypotheses for a larger&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical trial with explicit hypotheses and sufficient statistical&#xD;
      power.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Initial clinical evidence suggests that atypical neuroleptics may play a unique therapeutic&#xD;
      role in the management of pediatric bipolar disorder. Aripiprazole is a novel neuroleptic&#xD;
      recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of schizophrenia, and it has a unique&#xD;
      pharmacological profile believed to be fundamentally different from other available&#xD;
      antipsychotics. Many previous studies have reported increased efficacy of Aripiprazole&#xD;
      compared to placebo. Unfortunately, Aripiprazole has not been investigated in children and&#xD;
      adolescents, and as such, safety and efficacy has not been established for these populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an exploratory, pilot study, seeking to determine whether Aripiprazole is efficacious&#xD;
      and well tolerated in the treatment of youth with pediatric bipolar and bipolar spectrum&#xD;
      disorder. The study results, gathered from an 8 week open-label treatment period and&#xD;
      subsequent 10 month extension period, will be used to generate hypotheses for a larger&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical trial with explicit hypotheses and sufficient statistical&#xD;
      power.&#xD;
