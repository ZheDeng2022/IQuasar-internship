  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the role of dietary fibre in Irritable Bowel Syndrome&#xD;
      (IBS) treatment, in particular the role of increasing the content of soluble or insoluble&#xD;
      fibres in the daily diet. The primary objective is to compare soluble (psyllium) and&#xD;
      insoluble (bran) to placebo, administered over 12 weeks in patients with 'probable' or&#xD;
      'definite' Irritable Bowel Syndrome. The primary efficacy parameter is the responder rate&#xD;
      based on weekly assessment of adequate relief of IBS symptoms. Secondary efficacy parameters&#xD;
      include changes in IBS related symptoms (abdominal pain, bowel habits) and quality of life.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION: In daily practice, both patients and doctors consider dietary factors,&#xD;
      especially fibre and fluid intake, to play an important role in both the aetiology and the&#xD;
      persistence of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) symptoms. The majority of doctors provides&#xD;
      dietary lifestyle advice, targeted at increasing the fibre content of the daily diet by&#xD;
      adding insoluble fibre. In addition more than 50% of IBS patients receive pharmacotherapy,&#xD;
      frequently including bulking agents, in particular soluble fibres such as&#xD;
      psyllium-supplements. There is, however, limited evidence that fibre therapy may alleviate&#xD;
      IBS symptoms. In addition, there are indications that insoluble fibres may even worsen IBS&#xD;
      symptoms. Scientific evidence pertaining to the different effects of soluble and insoluble&#xD;
      fibres on IBS symptoms is very limited indeed, and methodologically sound RCTs in primary&#xD;
      care patients are lacking altogether. The latter is important since primary care IBS patients&#xD;
      differ in many aspects from secondary/tertiary care patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: A double blind parallel-group randomised controlled trial involving IBS&#xD;
      patients in primary care comparing 12-week intervention of psyllium fibres, bran, and&#xD;
      placebo. After the intervention, all patients will be followed for an additional 12-week&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION: Patients aged 18-65 years presenting to their General Practitioner (GP)&#xD;
      with either incident IBS symptoms or with a relapse of pre-existing IBS as well as patients&#xD;
      with a prior GP diagnosis of IBS and currently experiencing symptoms are eligible for the&#xD;
      study. Patients will be stratified in two equally large patients groups of (a) 'definite'&#xD;
      IBS, according to the Rome II diagnostic criteria, and (b) 'probable' IBS, pragmatically&#xD;
      diagnosed with IBS by their GP. Patients with alarm symptoms (i.e. abnormalities at physical&#xD;
      examination, fever, weight loss, rectal bleeding), with fibre intolerance, with acute&#xD;
      abdominal pain, patients with treatment for IBS by a specialist in the prior 48 months,&#xD;
      patients with an active psychiatric disorder requiring medication and patients unable to fill&#xD;
      out the questionnaires will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION: Patients will be randomly allocated to a 12-week treatment period with (a) 10&#xD;
      gram psyllium fibres, (b) 10 gram wheat bran or (c)10 gram identical placebo to be taken in 2&#xD;
      doses with the meal. In healthy subjects, the median intake is 20 gram fibre per day. When&#xD;
      focussing on increasing the amount of fibre in the daily diet in IBS treatment, addition of&#xD;
      10 gram fibre to the diet (bringing the total fibre content of the diet to 30 gram), is&#xD;
      usually considered adequate. This should be combined with sufficient intake of fluid. All&#xD;
      study medication will be filled in comparable pots. To prevent constipation, participants&#xD;
      will be instructed not to change dietary habits, and to take an additional 1 litre of fluids&#xD;
      daily. Other possible side effects are an unpleasant feeling in de upper gut and rarely&#xD;
      allergic reactions such as rash, rhinitis and conjunctivitis. Cellulose can possibly bind&#xD;
      glycosides, salicylates, coumarine derivates en nitrofuranto√Øne. Participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to take the fibre at least 2 hours after these medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: In line with previous conclusions on optimal outcome assessment in&#xD;
      trials on functional GI disease, the primary endpoint is the Adequate Relief question. This&#xD;
      measure addresses symptom improvement in IBS treatment with a single question (Did you have&#xD;
      adequate relief of IBS-related abdominal pain or discomfort in the past week?) scored on a&#xD;
      dichotomous scale. This instrument is a well validated simple outcome assessment for IBS&#xD;
      treatment. A positive response is defined as more than 2 weeks Adequate Relief per month.&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures include IBS symptoms, disease specific quality of life, fibre&#xD;
      intake, the number of doctor visits, and costs. IBS symptoms will be monitored using the IBS&#xD;
      symptom severity score (IBS SSS). This is a well- validated IBS symptom score, which&#xD;
      integrates five aspects of bowel dysfunctioning with the actual intensity of IBS symptoms,&#xD;
      using visual analogue scales. Disease-specific quality of life will be registrated with the&#xD;
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life scale (IBS QOL). This instrument includes 30 items&#xD;
      in nine subscales. It has been validated in different populations. Fibre intake will be&#xD;
      monitored every 4 weeks using a Food Frequency Questionnaire. Habitual fibre intake can be&#xD;
      calculated from the questionnaire data. This instrument is a self-administered food frequency&#xD;
      questionnaire and is validated for ranking subjects according to intake for dietary fibre.&#xD;
      After the active treatment period of 12 weeks, all patients will be followed up for an&#xD;
      additional period of 12 weeks to assess the sustainability of the effects of the&#xD;
      interventions. The primary outcome will be measured on a weekly basis. The secondary&#xD;
      endpoints will be recorded at 1, 2, 3 and 6 months after start of the intervention, during&#xD;
      follow-up visits to the general practitioner. All additional consultations, diagnostics&#xD;
      procedures, medication, and referrals during the intervention period will be recorded in the&#xD;
      electronic medical file in the practices. Compliance will be checked every visit by the&#xD;
      weighting of the contents of the trial medications and registration by a patient's diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REQUIRED SAMPLE SIZE: Ninety-five patients are required per treatment arm. Assuming a minimal&#xD;
      clinically relevant difference in the proportion of responders (i.e. more than 2 weeks of&#xD;
      Adequate Relief per month) between active and placebo treatment of 20%, a placebo response of&#xD;
      40%, a treatment effect of 60% is expected. Taking a type II error of 20% and a type I error&#xD;
      of 5% and allowing 10% of dropouts, totally 285 IBS patients are required. Assuming an&#xD;
      estimated mean incidence of IBS in primary care, of 8 per 1000 patient years (20 patients per&#xD;
      practice per year), an expected inclusion rate of 25%, we expect that 60 general&#xD;
      practitioners, each including 5 patients, will be able to include the required number of&#xD;
      patients in one year. GPs will be recruited from the Utrecht and Maastricht general&#xD;
      practitioners research networks. GPs in both networks have a tradition of participating in&#xD;
      academic research and have ample expertise in participating in clinical trials in primary&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS: Statistical analysis will be based on the intention-to-treat principle.&#xD;
      Adequate Relief, IBS Symptom Score and Quality of Life after the 12-week treatment period and&#xD;
      after the additional 12-week post-treatment period will be compared with the score at&#xD;
      baseline observation (t=0), using Student T-tests for repeated measurements and variance&#xD;
      analysis. Stability of the treatment effect in time will be assessed using one-factorial&#xD;
      ANOVA for repeated measures. The proportion of responders on the Adequate Relief question&#xD;
      (i.e. &gt; 2 weeks Adequate Relief per months) will be compared using chi-square tests. In case&#xD;
      of (unexpected) differences in relevant baseline characteristics between the three comparison&#xD;
      groups multiple regression analyses will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADMINISTRATION: The project will cover 24 months. The first 3 months of the study are&#xD;
      necessary to prepare the study. The inclusion period lasts 12 months, 6 additional months are&#xD;
      required to complete the follow-up and to perform the first statistical analyses and to&#xD;
      prepare the manuscripts. The last 3 months will be used for definitive data analyses and&#xD;
      finalisation of the reports.&#xD;
