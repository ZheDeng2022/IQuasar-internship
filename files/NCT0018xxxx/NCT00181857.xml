      The researchers plan to explore the validity of the category of ADHD NOS by identifying the&#xD;
      risk for ADHD in the children of ADHD NOS adult probands and identifying common correlates of&#xD;
      ADHD in these children. The researchers hypothesize that the rate of ADHD will be higher in&#xD;
      the children of the ADHD NOS probands than the rate of ADHD previously published for siblings&#xD;
      of proband children with ADHD; and ADHD children of ADHD NOS adults will have higher rates of&#xD;
      school failure (as measured by their rate of repeated grades, need for tutoring, and&#xD;
      placement in special classes) than their non-ADHD siblings.&#xD;

      We plan to explore the validity of the category of ADHD NOS by identifying the risk for ADHD&#xD;
      in the children of ADHD NOS adult probands and identifying common correlates of ADHD in these&#xD;
      children. We hypothesize the rate of ADHD will be higher in the children of the ADHD NOS&#xD;
      probands than the rate of ADHD previously published for siblings of proband children with&#xD;
      ADHD; and ADHD children of ADHD NOS adults will have higher rates of school failure (as&#xD;
      measured by their rate of repeated grades, need for tutoring, and placement in special&#xD;
      classes) than their non-ADHD siblings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study includes a one-time fifteen minute survey derived from the ADHD module of&#xD;
      the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders - Epidemiological Version (KSADS-E) with the&#xD;
      proband of an ADHD NOS study regarding his/her children, in order to assess possible ADHD&#xD;
      symptoms of that child. We also ask &quot;school questions&quot; regarding certain aspects of a child's&#xD;
      educational experience.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must be a biological child of an ADHD NOS proband. The proband must meet the following&#xD;
        criterion:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age: above 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Sex: male or female&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Intelligence quotient (IQ) above 80&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Met criteria for the diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder not&#xD;
             otherwise specified (ADHD NOS), by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental&#xD;
             Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), as manifested in clinical evaluation and confirmed&#xD;
             by structured interview. This is operationalized by either:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  having at least 6 out of 9 current DSM-IV items of either inattention or&#xD;
                  hyperactivity/impulsivity but &lt; 5 items from either list in childhood, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  having 5 out of 9 current DSM-IV items of either inattention or&#xD;
                  hyperactivity/impulsivity, but not having the 6 current symptoms in either&#xD;
                  category. This second category will be included independent of the presence or&#xD;
                  absence of ADHD symptoms in childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Had a Clinical Global Impression: ADHD score of 4 (moderately ill) or higher illness&#xD;
             severity at a clinical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has at least one biological offspring&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. No adequate informant is available to answer the survey questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Sensorimotor deficits. (These include deficits that would impede the survey process,&#xD;
             e.g. profound deafness, blindness, inadequate command of the English language, or&#xD;
             profound disorders of language.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Psychosis, autism, schizophrenia.&#xD;
