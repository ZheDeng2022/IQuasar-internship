    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and determine the effects of the hormone&#xD;
      prolactin on lactation (breast milk production).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will participate in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial&#xD;
      comparing breast pumping, alone, to breast pumping and r-hPRL. Subjects will have one week of&#xD;
      instruction with the breast pump alone. Subsequently, subjects will receive 2 weeks of r-hPRL&#xD;
      or placebo followed by 2 weeks of the alternate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 1: Study day 1, a baseline prolactin level will be obtained and subjects will be taught&#xD;
      to use an electrical, hospital grade breast pump by a designated lactation consultant.&#xD;
      Subjects will pump for 10 minutes at each breast. The total volume of milk will be recorded&#xD;
      in a diary throughout the study. Prolactin levels will be obtained every 10 minutes for 60&#xD;
      minutes after pumping begins, then every 30 minutes for a total of 3 hours. Subjects will&#xD;
      pump 3 times per day increasing to 8 times per day by the end of the first week and will&#xD;
      continue this regimen throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 2: One week after the initial visit, subjects will return to the GCRC for re-evaluation&#xD;
      of the pumping technique and the first dose of medication. Subjects will pump for 10 minutes&#xD;
      at each breast as on day 1 and prolactin levels will be obtained every 10 minutes for 60&#xD;
      minutes, then every 30 minutes for a total of 3 hours. At 3 hours, r-hPRL 60 mg/kg or placebo&#xD;
      will be administered SC. Blood will be drawn every 10 minutes for 60 minutes, every 30&#xD;
      minutes for 2 hours, then at 4, 6 and 8 hours to obtain a peak prolactin level. Vital signs&#xD;
      will be monitored every 15 minutes for the first hour, then every 2 hours for a total of 8&#xD;
      hours. Subjects will pump both breasts every 3 hours, starting after the r-hPRL or placebo&#xD;
      injection. Subjects will be taught to give themselves SC injections and will administer their&#xD;
      second dose of SC r-hPRL or placebo 12 hours after the first dose. Subjects will continue SC&#xD;
      r-hPRL or placebo administration every 12 hours for the next 14 days. They will continue to&#xD;
      pump daily, approximately every 3 hours, with a 5 hour break in the night to sleep. Subjects&#xD;
      will be asked to refrigerate all milk and bring it in to GCRC visits for prolactin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will return weekly for 4 additional visits (weeks 3, 4, 5, 6). At the weekly visits,&#xD;
      blood will be drawn at baseline for a prolactin level and r-hPRL or placebo will be&#xD;
      administered. Blood will then be drawn every 10 minutes for 60 minutes, then every 30 minutes&#xD;
      for 2 hours, then every 2 hours for a total of 8 hours after the injection. Vital signs will&#xD;
      be monitored as described above. At the week 4 visit, subjects will be switched to the&#xD;
      alternate treatment for weeks 4 and 5. Subjects will be seen 14 days after their final&#xD;
      injection. A baseline prolactin level will be drawn, then milk will be pumped, as previously.&#xD;
      Blood will be drawn every 10 minutes for 60 minutes, then every 30 minutes for a total of 3&#xD;
      hours. A 1 cc sample of the milk will also be obtained 14 days after the final injection for&#xD;
      analysis of composition. All side effects of r-hPRL will be recorded throughout the study.&#xD;
      All milk obtained during the study will be stored and the milk composition will be determined&#xD;
      before it is used. Infants receiving milk produced during the study will initially be&#xD;
      monitored in the GCRC under the supervision of a neonatologist.&#xD;
