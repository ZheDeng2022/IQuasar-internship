    <textblock>
      This study is for patients with recently diagnosed blood cancer, called acute lymphoblastic&#xD;
      leukemia (ALL). The standard treatment for this disease consists of many chemotherapy drugs&#xD;
      that are given in different combinations in several steps. Each step of treatment is called a&#xD;
      cycle. Patients will be treated with the chemotherapy drugs that are routinely used in ALL&#xD;
      and which are given in multiple treatment cycles over several months. All the chemotherapy&#xD;
      drugs that are used in this study have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the drugs, which is typically given to patients with ALL, is called Asparaginase. It&#xD;
      is given together with the other drugs throughout the different cycles of treatment. This&#xD;
      drug can be derived from several sources. The standard source is called E. coli Asparaginase,&#xD;
      which is associated with a risk of allergic reactions. This drug stays in the body for a very&#xD;
      short period of time; therefore, it has to be injected daily for 9-14 days in a cycle of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, a different form of Asparaginase will be used, called PEG-Asparaginase (also&#xD;
      called Oncospar), which remains in the body for about two weeks, therefore, it can be given&#xD;
      only once in a cycle of treatment and still maintains high blood levels of the drug.&#xD;
      PEG-Asparaginase has recently been approved by the FDA to treat ALL. Most of the experience&#xD;
      with the drug has been in children with ALL. In children it was found to be as safe as the&#xD;
      standard form of Asparaginase and with less allergic reaction. It was also found to have the&#xD;
      same effectiveness on ALL. The experience with this drug in adults has been more limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to find out what side effects occur in adults when&#xD;
      PEG-Asparaginase is given with other chemotherapy drugs and to see what effect it has on the&#xD;
      response to treatment of ALL. Another purpose is to find out if the allergic reactions are&#xD;
      reduced with PEG-Asparaginase. In children there is some early information that&#xD;
      PEG-Asparaginase produces fewer antibodies than E.coli Asparaginase. Therefore, another&#xD;
      purpose of the study is to see how many adult patients who receive PEG-Asparaginase develop&#xD;
      antibodies against the drug.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with previously untreated ALL subtypes L1 and L2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with de novo Philadelphia (Ph)+ ALL (i.e. excluding those that are after&#xD;
             blastic of CML) are eligible. However they will be referred to allogeneic&#xD;
             hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and will continue on the study until they are&#xD;
             ready to undergo the transplantation. At that time they will discontinue the study.&#xD;

             study.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Psychological or emotional disorders which will make a valid informed consent&#xD;
             impossible.&#xD;
