  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among all racial/ethnic groups, African Americans have the greatest risk of becoming ill or&#xD;
      dying from tobacco-related diseases. Because of this disproportionate disease burden, it is&#xD;
      particularly urgent that researchers focusing on tobacco control partner with African&#xD;
      American communities. Intervention strategies which hold the tobacco industry accountable for&#xD;
      its behavior are effective in changing views of tobacco use. In earlier work, the&#xD;
      investigators found that information from internal tobacco industry documents, when shown to&#xD;
      African American smokers, stimulated reflection about quitting and interest in disseminating&#xD;
      information about industry targeting behaviors to others. However, to date there have been no&#xD;
      attempts to utilize the information in industry documents as part of a smoking cessation&#xD;
      intervention. In this project, the investigators will test whether a community co-developed,&#xD;
      tailored quit-smoking program featuring exposures to African American-specific tobacco&#xD;
      industry documents and media exercises in addition to proven individual quitting strategies&#xD;
      can increase the number of people who quit smoking at six months and one year, as compared&#xD;
      with usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the project are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. test, using statistics, how well an innovative community-based, culturally tailored&#xD;
           quit-smoking program for African Americans works at 6 and 12 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. test selected variables for how well they predict who will return to smoking;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. use interviews to identify additional individual and/or community factors associated&#xD;
           with successful quitting or relapse; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. collect information to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the CARA project&#xD;
           collaborative efforts in developing and sustaining the project over time, enhancing&#xD;
           community awareness of tobacco issues, and creation or enhancement of community tobacco&#xD;
           control resources.&#xD;
