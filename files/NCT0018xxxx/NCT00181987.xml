    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the safety and effectiveness of Concerta in the&#xD;
      treatment of children (ages 5 to 17 years old) and adults (ages 18 to 55 years old) with&#xD;
      Bipolar I, Bipolar II and Bipolar Spectrum Disorder and comorbid ADHD over 8 weeks. This&#xD;
      study seeks to study the short-term effectiveness of a long acting formulation of&#xD;
      methylphenidate (Concerta) in the treatment of children and adults with bipolar disorder and&#xD;
      comorbid ADHD adequately stabilized on an acceptable and stable regimen of anti-mania agents.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A leading source of difficulty in treating youth with Bipolar Disorder is its comorbidity&#xD;
      with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Systematic studies of children and&#xD;
      adolescents show that rates of ADHD range from 60% to 90% in pediatric study participants&#xD;
      with mania. These findings could not be accounted for by the overlapping symptoms of&#xD;
      distractibility, talkativeness, and physical hyperactivity, suggesting that affected children&#xD;
      may suffer from both disorders, which was also consistent with findings of familial&#xD;
      co-transmission of these two conditions. Considering the well-documented morbidity and&#xD;
      dysfunction associated with ADHD, a comprehensive treatment approach to the management of the&#xD;
      bipolar child with comorbid ADHD requires the development of appropriate therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies for the treatment ADHD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to investigate the safety and effectiveness of Concerta in the&#xD;
      treatment of children (ages 5 to 17 years old) and adults (ages 18 to 55 years old) with&#xD;
      Bipolar I, Bipolar II and Bipolar Spectrum Disorder and comorbid ADHD over 8 weeks. This&#xD;
      study seeks to study the short-term effectiveness of a long acting formulation of&#xD;
      methylphenidate (Concerta) in the treatment of children and adults with bipolar disorder and&#xD;
      comorbid ADHD adequately stabilized on an acceptable and stable regimen of anti-mania agents.&#xD;
