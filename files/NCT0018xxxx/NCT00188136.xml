  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Karyotype is a major prognostic risk factor in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)&#xD;
      translating into unfavourable outcome in case of poor-risk cytogenetic aberrations. Several&#xD;
      studies have shown that allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after&#xD;
      myeloablative conditioning rather than autologous HSCT or consolidation chemotherapy result&#xD;
      in long-term disease control in this group of patients when achieving a first complete&#xD;
      remission. Nevertheless, the complete remission rate achievable is significantly lower than&#xD;
      in patients with a more favourable risk profile. In fact, only the minority of AML patients&#xD;
      with poor-risk cytogenetics, although having a suitable donor, proceed to HSCT due to&#xD;
      refractory disease or infectious complications during induction chemotherapy (IC). Further,&#xD;
      new data show that the course of therapy can be estimated as early as two weeks after the&#xD;
      initiation of the first course of IC with patients presenting with more than 10 % marrow&#xD;
      blasts doing significantly worse than those with a better clearance of blasts. As a result,&#xD;
      the chance to obtain a durable remission is considerably low and most patients with bad-risk&#xD;
      cytogenetics or failure to achieve blast clearance do not proceed to an allogeneic approach.&#xD;
      Together these data indicate that early treatment intensification is warranted in order to&#xD;
      provide the potential curative benefit of allogeneic HSCT to the majority of high-risk AML&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have shown that reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) followed by allogeneic PBSC applied&#xD;
      during aplasia after the first cycle of IC in newly-diagnosed high-risk AML patients is&#xD;
      feasible and can result in a sustained disease control. These data prompted us to further&#xD;
      evaluate in a prospective trial an early &quot;up-front HSCT&quot; in patients with newly-diagnosed&#xD;
      high-risk AML defined by karyotype and insufficient blast clearance after the first cycle of&#xD;
      IC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal was to provide an allogeneic HSCT as early as possible after diagnosis in AML&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Only patients with newly-diagnosed AML are eligible for this prospective study. An immediate&#xD;
      donor-search, either within the family or in volunteer donor registries, will be performed at&#xD;
      diagnosis irrespective of the expected risk profile. All patients will receiv at least one&#xD;
      cycle of IC. Inclusion criteria for early allogeneic transplantation are either poor risk&#xD;
      cytogenetics and/or bad response to the first cycle of IC defined by more than 10% marrow&#xD;
      blasts on day 15. If a patient meets one of those criteria they could enter the early&#xD;
      allogeneic HSCT trial after providing informed consent. DNA-based HLA-typing of donor and&#xD;
      recipient will be performed using high resolution (4 digits) for HLA - A, B, DRB1 and DQB1&#xD;
      and intermediate resolution (2 digits) for HLA- C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During IC-induced aplasia after the 1st or 2nd cycle a fludarabine-based reduced intensity&#xD;
      conditioning therapy will be started if a donor is available. All patients receive&#xD;
      fludarabine 30 mg/m2 i.v. daily for five days (day- 6 to -2) and melphalan 150 mg/m² on&#xD;
      day-2. Antithymocyte globulin (ATG Fresenius 10 mg/kg/day day -5 to -2, total dose 40 mg/kg,&#xD;
      Fresenius, Bad Homburg, Germany) will be applied after transplantation from unrelated or HLA&#xD;
      mismatched family donors. PBSC grafts will be preferred. As immunosuppression cyclosporin A&#xD;
      (CsA) is either administered intravenously at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day or given at an&#xD;
      bioequivalent amount of the oral formulation in two divided doses starting on the day before&#xD;
      blood stem cell infusion (day -1). The dose of CsA is adjusted to maintain blood levels&#xD;
      between 150 and 250 ng/ml. Starting on day 50, oral CsA administration will be tapered by 5%&#xD;
      weekly if GVHD was inactive. Acute and chronic GvHD will be treated with prednisone, CsA or&#xD;
      tacrolimus.&#xD;
