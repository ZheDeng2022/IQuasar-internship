  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of a moderate decrease in dietary zinc&#xD;
      on DNA strand breaks and other cellular zinc biomarkers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Assessing the zinc status of humans has proven to be difficult because of the unique&#xD;
      physiological features of zinc homeostasis. Animal and human studies show that a small,&#xD;
      vulnerable pool of cellular zinc is sensitive to changes in dietary zinc. The protein,&#xD;
      Metallothionein (MT), is made within cells to stabilize this transient zinc pool and to&#xD;
      provide a means to 'park' a small zinc reserve. The overall goal is to develop a new method&#xD;
      for measuring MT in cells and to assess other cellular responses to changes in small changes&#xD;
      in dietary zinc. Culture models of zinc deficiency and excess have been developed and used to&#xD;
      test the response of cellular MT levels and mineralization to changes in zinc availability.&#xD;
      In Phase II, the changes in the expression of leukocytic zinc transporters and the cellular&#xD;
      in vitro uptake of isotopic zinc will be measured. Healthy men will be recruited to&#xD;
      participate in a 6-week feeding trial to be followed by a 3-week recovery period. The results&#xD;
      of this study will determine if potential new cellular zinc biomarkers respond to changes in&#xD;
      zinc status when the men are fed an additional 4 mg zinc/d incorporated into a rice-based&#xD;
      meal. These findings will provide essential, new information for designing an efficacy trial&#xD;
      of biofortified rice and the zinc status of infants and young children.&#xD;
