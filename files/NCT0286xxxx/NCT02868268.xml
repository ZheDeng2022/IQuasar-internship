      This proposal sets forth the platform for a Precision Medicine clinical trial through the New&#xD;
      Approaches to Neuroblastoma Therapy (NANT) consortium. The plan is to utilize NANT's&#xD;
      established multi-institutional infrastructure and Translational Genomics Research Institute&#xD;
      GEM sequencing platform for acquisition and gene panel sequencing of relapsed biological&#xD;
      specimens in relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma (rNB) including those obtained from the bone,&#xD;
      bone marrow or soft tissue. Our primary aim is to identify subgroups of rNB patients who have&#xD;
      potentially targetable genetic (ALK, MAPK pathway, Metabolic-related genes) and/or&#xD;
      immunologic (tumor-associated macrophage infiltration and/or programmed death ligand [PD-L1]&#xD;
      expression) biomarkers in rNB. Additional potential novel biomarkers will also be evaluated&#xD;
      and reported in this cohort of patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood. High-risk NB is&#xD;
      highly lethal and responsible for over 15% of childhood cancer related deaths. The majority&#xD;
      of patients with metastatic NB respond to upfront cytotoxic chemotherapy, yet patients who&#xD;
      die of recurrent disease do so from tumor acquired resistance to treatment. Thus,&#xD;
      understanding the repertoire of tumor specific genomic alterations leading to tumor&#xD;
      progression and therapy resistance is critical to devising novel targeted therapy options for&#xD;
      patients with recurrent or refractory (r)NB. Limited data exists regarding the genetic and&#xD;
      immunologic predictive biomarkers in rNB, which can be used to direct targeted therapies.&#xD;
      Another barrier to clinical implementation of genetic testing of tumor samples from children&#xD;
      with rNB is obtaining sufficient number of tumor cells from bone marrow (BM) specimens, the&#xD;
      most easily accessible and common site of relapse. This proposal sets forth the platform for&#xD;
      a Precision Medicine clinical trial through the New Approaches to Neuroblastoma Therapy&#xD;
      (NANT) consortium. The plan is to utilize NANT's established multi-institutional&#xD;
      infrastructure and Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen) GEMTM sequencing platform&#xD;
      for acquisition and gene panel sequencing of relapsed biological specimens in rNB including&#xD;
      those obtained from the bone, bone marrow or soft tissue. Our primary aim is to identify&#xD;
      subgroups of rNB patients who have potentially targetable genetic (ALK, MAPK pathway,&#xD;
      Metabolic-related genes) and/or immunologic (tumor-associated macrophage infiltration and/or&#xD;
      PD-L1 expression) biomarkers in rNB. Additional potential novel biomarkers will also be&#xD;
      evaluated and reported in this cohort of patients. This aim has immediate impact on the lives&#xD;
      of children with rNB as it provides a clinical report to patients and their physicians&#xD;
      detailing observed mutations and rNB subgroups and information on clinical trials that best&#xD;
      match them. Our second aim will assess a novel method for enriching tumor cells from bone&#xD;
      marrow aspirates containing less than 30% tumor involvement so that next generation&#xD;
      sequencing can be performed. Our bone marrow (BM) enrichment protocol has both methodological&#xD;
      and patient significance; 1) BM enrichment will allow a much larger group of rNB patients&#xD;
      access to future personalized medicine trials and 2) Successful confirmation that BM&#xD;
      enrichment can produce quality DNA for genetic analysis serves as proof of principal that&#xD;
      this method can be used for genetic testing of BM with evidence of metastasis in other adult&#xD;
      or pediatric solid tumors. In summary, our proposal will define the genetic and immunologic&#xD;
      landscape of rNB and contribute to our understanding and ability to therapeutically target&#xD;
      the dynamic alterations in tumor biology of children with rNB.&#xD;
