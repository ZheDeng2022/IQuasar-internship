  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I trial studies the side effects of atezolizumab in treating patients with&#xD;
      cancer following adoptive cell transfer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety of atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) administration in patients who have&#xD;
      received adoptive cell transfer (ACT) prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the expansion of engrafted T cells following atezolizumab administration in&#xD;
      the peripheral blood and within the tumor microenvironment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the phenotype and function of engrafted T cells following atezolizumab&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. IV. To evaluate the response rate using&#xD;
      immune related Response Criteria (irRC) and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
      (RECIST) version (v)1.1, or other tumor-specific criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate survival outcomes and progression free survival using irRC and RECIST v1.1, or&#xD;
      other tumor-specific criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30- 60 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 21 days for a total of 17 doses over up to 12 months in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and then&#xD;
      every 3 months thereafter.&#xD;

             (fibrosis) is permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active tuberculosis (TB) are excluded&#xD;

             anticipation that such a live, attenuated vaccine will be required during the study&#xD;
             and up to 5 months after the last dose of atezolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Influenza vaccination should be given during influenza season only (approximately&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;

          -  Patients who have previously tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#xD;
             are NOT excluded from this study (please note: testing of all patients wishing to&#xD;

                  PCR-based tests&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because atezolizumab is PD-L1 blocking&#xD;
             agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with atezolizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
