      Moving one's joints through their full range of motion (ROM) is crucial for health and&#xD;
      wellbeing. Those who are unable to do so have difficulty carrying out simple activities like&#xD;
      walking or feeding themselves. Lost joint ROM is called a contracture. Osteoarthritis (OA) is&#xD;
      the most common form of arthritis. About a third of people with knee OA develop knee flexion&#xD;
      contractures (KFlCs), the inability to fully straighten the knee. Having a KFlC before a knee&#xD;
      replacement is a big risk factor for redeveloping one after the operation. Many people with a&#xD;
      KFlC in the knee for surgery also have a KFlC in the other knee. The investigators believe&#xD;
      that this non-surgical KFlC increases the risk of re-developing a KFlC in the surgical knee&#xD;
      after surgery by encouraging bending of the surgical knee to avoid one leg being shorter than&#xD;
      the other. No one has ever looked at whether fixing this leg length difference using a shoe&#xD;
      lift would prevent this problem and there is little information to help design such a study.&#xD;
      Here the investigators will see if testing shoe lift use for preventing KFlC is feasible. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesis is that a study evaluating the benefit of using a shoe lift to&#xD;
      correct leg length difference in the non-surgical knee is feasible.&#xD;

      Joint contractures are characterized by a restriction in the full passive range of motion&#xD;
      (ROM) of a joint and are a major burden on public health. They restrict mobility, have a&#xD;
      negative impact on quality of life, limit an individual's productivity and earning potential,&#xD;
      and can prevent basic activities of daily living such as dressing and eating. The geriatric&#xD;
      population is particularly vulnerable to contractures due to accumulated comorbidities&#xD;
      leading to restricted joint movement and permanent loss of ROM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A knee flexion contracture (KFlC) is a limitation in knee extension. Patients with KFlCs limp&#xD;
      and are afflicted with a constant enhanced energy demand on the quadriceps muscle, putting&#xD;
      them at higher risk for falls and injury. Walking is slow and abnormally tiring for those&#xD;
      with KFlC such that patients may choose to walk less or not at all. Murphy et al. identified&#xD;
      a significant increase in energy cost of walking with a KFlC of ≥15°. In addition, KFlCs&#xD;
      cause a functional shortening in the affected limb resulting in a leg length discrepancy&#xD;
      (LLD). LLDs contribute to even greater energy requirements for ambulation, worse pain due to&#xD;
      premature joint wear, and are associated with knee osteoarthritis progression. One study&#xD;
      identified shoe modification as a means of correcting this treatable risk factor. To the&#xD;
      investigators' knowledge, no study has examined the effect of shoe modification on KFlC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contractures are associated with many conditions including arthritis. In the setting of&#xD;
      osteoarthritis (OA), the most common arthritis and a world-leading cause of disability in the&#xD;
      elderly, contractures are highly prevalent: over one third of 3,400 patients with OA&#xD;
      presenting for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) had a KFlC. The burden of KFlC in OA is further&#xD;
      compounded by the pre-operative contracture putting the patient at a higher risk for&#xD;
      contracture, knee pain and poor outcome post-operatively. Loss of pre-operative ROM was found&#xD;
      to be the best predictor of lost post-operative ROM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During TKA, surgeons are often able to restore some or all knee ROM which transiently&#xD;
      eliminates the contracture in the immediate post-operative period. Unfortunately, full ROM is&#xD;
      lost over time in a notable proportion of patients. The overall incidence of KFlC following&#xD;
      TKA has been reported to be between 1 to 5%. In patients with pre-operative KFlC, this has&#xD;
      been reported as high as 15% with the resulting post-operative KFlCs still present at 3-year&#xD;
      follow-up4. Patients who develop post-operative KFlC report less satisfaction, poorer&#xD;
      function and more pain post-surgically. Post-operative loss of ROM has been described as one&#xD;
      of the most common causes of readmission within the first 90 days after surgery and was&#xD;
      identified as being the primary reason for nearly 20% of revision TKAs. These large&#xD;
      percentages represent a significant number considering that 719,000 replacements were&#xD;
      performed in the USA in 2010 and that the Ottawa hospital alone performs over 500 TKAs per&#xD;
      year. KFlCs therefore contribute to increased health care costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of KFlC includes aggressive physiotherapy, therapeutic modalities, continuous&#xD;
      passive ROM devices, bracing, manipulation under anesthesia, arthroscopy, open arthrolysis,&#xD;
      or TKA revision surgery. Despite these numerous and costly options however, treatment is&#xD;
      often unrewarding. Overall, contractures draw heavily on health care resources because of&#xD;
      their chronic nature and poor response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous study, the investigators' group examined factors associated with KFlC in&#xD;
      patients with end-stage OA going for TKA. By comparing those with contracture to those&#xD;
      without, the investigators found that having a KFlC in the knee scheduled for TKA (the&#xD;
      surgical knee) was associated with having a KFlC in the other (non-surgical) knee1. Once the&#xD;
      surgical KFlC was corrected intra-operatively, these patients would suffer from a&#xD;
      functionally shorter limb on the unoperated side. Given the disadvantages of walking on limbs&#xD;
      of unequal length, patients may inadvertently flex the surgical knee when walking in order to&#xD;
      equalize the limb lengths. By not accessing the full range of extension in the surgical knee,&#xD;
      this could, over time, result in the re-development of a KFlC in the surgical knee. In this&#xD;
      study the investigators propose to correct the LLD using a shoe lift for the unoperated knee&#xD;
      with KFlC. The investigators believe this will reduce the likelihood of re-developing KFlC&#xD;
      after TKA in the surgical knee. This simple, relatively inexpensive, intervention could&#xD;
      reduce post-surgical morbidity, TKA revision rate and long-term costs to the healthcare&#xD;
      system. Unfortunately, there is little data in the literature outlining the benefits of shoe&#xD;
      lifts post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation: The investigators will use a simple inexpensive intervention (a shoe lift) to&#xD;
      correct leg length shortening in the non-surgical limb in patients with OA and bilateral knee&#xD;
      flexion contractures who have had a unilateral total knee replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Determining the feasibility of studying the effects of shoe lift treatment on&#xD;
      post-arthroplasty range of motion in the surgical knee in patients with bilateral&#xD;
      pre-operative knee flexion contractures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Post-operative KFlCs cause pain, and reduce function and patient satisfaction.&#xD;
      They are a common cause of chronic disability and are costly and difficult to treat.&#xD;
      Prevention of post-operative KFlC would therefore be beneficial to patients and the health&#xD;
      care system. The investigators believe that providing a shoe lift to the non-surgical knee&#xD;
      will reduce the incidence of developing post-operative KFlC in the surgical knee in patients&#xD;
      with pre-operative KFlC. To the investigators knowledge, there is presently insufficient data&#xD;
      in the literature upon which to design a study testing this hypothesis, either in terms of&#xD;
      power analysis or outcome measures. By completing this Objective the investigators will&#xD;
      accomplish 3 goals: (1) determine data variance for a power analysis for a future study, (2)&#xD;
      determine if either of two validated pain and functional outcome measures are sensitive to&#xD;
      differences in knee ROM, and (3) determine the number of subjects that the investigators are&#xD;
      able to recruit within the timeframe of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this Objective, the investigators will recruit subjects and randomly allocate them to 1 of&#xD;
      2 groups, both having 1° knee OA with bilateral KFlCs who are scheduled for TKA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Leg length discrepancy (LLD) 2° to KFlC in the non-operated limb will be corrected&#xD;
      using a shoe lift after TKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: &quot;Sham&quot; shoe modification that does not correct LLD in the non-surgical limb after&#xD;
      TKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: It is feasible to design a larger randomized control trial to evaluate the pain&#xD;
      and functional outcome benefits of using a shoe lift for the non-surgical knee&#xD;
      post-operatively in patients with OA and bilateral pre-operative KFlCs. These benefits can be&#xD;
      detected using a validated OA outcome tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During their post-operative inpatient stay, participants will have both their anatomic leg&#xD;
      lengths measured (ASIS to medial malleolus) and will then be referred to be fitted with the&#xD;
      appropriate shoe adjustment.&#xD;
