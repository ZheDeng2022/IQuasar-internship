  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to define the safety and the biochemical-physiological response&#xD;
      of prolonged exposure to a normobaric low-oxygen environment in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary endpoint of this research study is to prove safety in healthy subjects breathing&#xD;
      humidified hypoxic inspiratory gas mixture for 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoint of our study is to describe the physiological and biochemical changes&#xD;
      during the 5-day hypoxic period and the 2 days after return to normoxia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: To provide a safe, controlled setting for prolonged exposure of monitored healthy&#xD;
      adults to a normobaric, low-oxygen environment for five days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: To carry out a seven-days long pilot safety-study in twelve healthy young subjects by&#xD;
      inducing hypoxia with a humidified normobaric gas mixture containing oxygen (O2) content as&#xD;
      low as 11% to reach a peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) between 80%-85%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening will consist of a physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram, cardiac&#xD;
      echocardiography, sickle cell screening test, and current (within 12 weeks of clearance exam&#xD;
      with no intervening medical treatment) routine blood and urine analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women using oral, subdermal or injectable contraceptives, and those using other means of&#xD;
      birth control may participate. A urine pregnancy test will be conducted as part of the&#xD;
      screening process for study participation no more than 7 days before starting the study and&#xD;
      it will be repeated on the day of enrollment. The test result will be read by a female staff&#xD;
      member who will keep the result confidential. If a woman declines to have a pregnancy test,&#xD;
      she will not be able to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will be done in three ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Broadcast MGH: Research Studies In Need of Volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Enrollment in the Research Study Volunteer Program (RSVP) for Health of Massachusetts&#xD;
           General Hospital (MGH) and Brigham Women Hospital (BWH)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Advertising at the Partners clinical trials Potential study subjects will be able to&#xD;
           contact study investigators by phone or email to verify eligibility according to the&#xD;
           inclusion/exclusion criteria and to set up the first visit, at which point the study&#xD;
           will be explained in detail and they will be asked to provide informed consent. Subjects&#xD;
           may contact the study investigators at any time to withdraw from the study.&#xD;
           Confidentiality will be preserved to the fullest extent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be explained to each volunteer in detail. Signing of an Informed Consent Form&#xD;
      will be requested for participation in the study. Volunteers will sign the informed consent&#xD;
      at the beginning of the study. The Principal Investigator (PI) and/or Co-PIs of the study&#xD;
      will be available to answer any questions the volunteer may have. Consent can be withdrawn at&#xD;
      any time. The investigators will access personal Medical Information (PMI) for study&#xD;
      purposes. There is no randomization in this interventional physiological study. All patients&#xD;
      will receive the same procedures in the same order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biostatistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A de-identified code will be assigned to the patient and registered on a dedicated enrollment&#xD;
      log. The baseline study volunteer data (vital signs and biochemical measurements) will be&#xD;
      collected from the MGH electronic medical chart (EPIC). Prospective collection of patient&#xD;
      data will include specific data sheet. Data will be expressed as means ± standard deviation&#xD;
      (SD) or median/interquartile range (IQR) as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: this research-project is aimed to study 12 healthy subjects for the entire 7-day&#xD;
      study period. To account for possible dropouts and missing data, up to 18 healthy volunteers&#xD;
      will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation: This is an intra-hospital safety trial with the purpose of testing&#xD;
      methods to re-create a safe hypoxic environment for possible future studies in patients with&#xD;
      mitochondrial dysfunction. While 2 or 3 subjects would likely be sufficient to test our&#xD;
      methods to reliably delivery humidified nitrogen (N2) and (O2) in predetermined&#xD;
      concentrations, this method will be tested in 12 healthy subjects to reproduce our methods&#xD;
      and obtain feedback from the volunteers. To account for possible dropouts, up to 18 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk and discomforts&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Complications of surgical and non-surgical procedures, etc. Participants in the study&#xD;
           will undergo 3 procedures during the study: hypoxic gas administration, phlebotomy, and&#xD;
           echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Facemask.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. Claustrophobia is one of the exclusion criteria. If a subject develops&#xD;
                     claustrophobia, he/she may leave the trial at any point.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. The most common side effects of facemask are pressure related, such as&#xD;
                     redness, irritation over the mask's borders. To decrease possible skin&#xD;
                     irritation and abrasions, subjects will be using a tent during the night and&#xD;
                     high flow nasal cannula during the day for breakfast, lunch and dinner.&#xD;
                     Additionally they will be able to choose whether to use high-flow nasal&#xD;
                     cannula or the facemask during the day at any time as an alternative to the&#xD;
                     facemask.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Tent. Risks associated with use of tents include unintended hypoxia, hypercarbia,&#xD;
                and claustrophobia. These tents are made at the MGH shop and routinely used on the&#xD;
                burn unit to maintain elevated temperature (80-90 °F) and humidification in&#xD;
                critically ill patients. Our subjects will be continuously monitored for hypoxia&#xD;
                and clinical condition to limit risk of unintended hypoxia or hypercarbia.&#xD;
                Claustrophobia will be handled as described previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Nasal cannula and non-invasive high flow humidified gas. All participants will wear&#xD;
                non-invasive high flow humidified gas for part of study period. Unlike masks, high&#xD;
                flow nasal cannula is well tolerated in hospitalized patients and warm humidified&#xD;
                air alleviates discomfort of the high flow. In order to avoid abrasions, we will&#xD;
                inspect subjects' nasal mucosa in the morning and evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Intravenous (IV) punctures and phlebotomy. Risks related to phlebotomy include&#xD;
                bruising, hematoma formation, cellulitis, superficial thrombosis, bleeding and&#xD;
                phlebitis. An IV nurse or an anesthesiologist will perform phlebotomy to minimize&#xD;
                subject discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Trans-thoracic echocardiography. Echocardiography will be performed on daily basis:&#xD;
                Echocardiographic assessment of pulmonary artery pressure and cardiac output is a&#xD;
                noninvasive and painless maneuver. It is commonly used in clinical practice, has&#xD;
                been used in the field under hypoxic conditions, and is safe for the study&#xD;
                subjects. If the echocardiographic study reveals any unexpected cardiac disease the&#xD;
                subjects will be informed and also their primary care physician (PCP) will be&#xD;
                informed. If the subject does not have a PCP, we will provide information about&#xD;
                choosing a PCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In presence of an abnormal physical exam and/or additional abnormal laboratory results&#xD;
           (including a positive pregnancy test), subjects will be informed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Drug side effects and toxicities&#xD;
&#xD;
           A gas mixture enriched with nitrogen will be tested. It is expected that subjects may&#xD;
           suffer to a certain degree of acute mountain sickness. Symptoms may include: headache,&#xD;
           dizziness, poor sleep, poor appetite and fatigue that are related to hypoxia. These&#xD;
           symptoms are well described in mountain climbers and will not require interruption of&#xD;
           the study, unless the subject requests exiting the study. Furthermore, in this proposed&#xD;
           model of normobaric hypoxia, the risk of acute mountain sickness symptoms has been&#xD;
           reported to be lower than hypobaric hypoxia (simulated altitude). The following risks&#xD;
           might also occur:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Risks Associated with Hypoxia: Severe hypoxemia (SpO2 ≤ 70%), especially with&#xD;
                decreased respiratory rate can ensue. Since the fraction of inspired of oxygen can&#xD;
                be quickly increased, there is no risk of developing prolonged hypoxia events. If&#xD;
                SpO2 ≤ 70% decreases for more than one continuous minute, nitrogen administration&#xD;
                will be stopped and the fraction of inspired of oxygen will be increased to 50%.&#xD;
                The study will be stopped. Symptoms of hypoxia (light headedness, dizziness)&#xD;
                typically resolve immediately upon return to a normal range of SpO2. If hypoxia&#xD;
                symptoms are present, subjects will exit the study only after all symptoms of&#xD;
                light-headedness or dizziness are resolved, and headache or nausea is absent.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Acute mountain sickness can very rarely progress to high altitude pulmonary edema&#xD;
                (HAPE) or high altitude cerebral edema (HACE) and would be case reportable were&#xD;
                either to occur in normobaria at the limited hypoxic challenge we will be&#xD;
                employing. Though HAPE is very unlikely to occur, we will provide daily monitoring&#xD;
                by echocardiography, clinical exam (auscultation for rales and unusual dyspnea at&#xD;
                rest solicited), and pulse oximetry. If HAPE does occur, the study will stop and&#xD;
                the subject treated with oxygen until resolution of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  HACE is also a very unlikely potential risk in this study. If a subject develops&#xD;
                any evidence of ataxia or altered mental status, they will be immediately withdrawn&#xD;
                from the study. FiO2 will be increased to 50%, dexamethasone 8 mg IV will be&#xD;
                administered, and head computed tomography (CT) will be performed to rule out other&#xD;
                much more common sources (e.g. spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage) of these&#xD;
                complaints. If no CT abnormalities are noted, a brain magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
                (MRI) will be obtained to assess for cerebral edema and characteristic T2 weighted&#xD;
                signal change in the corpus callosum consistent with HAPE..&#xD;
&#xD;
           Any study subject who experiences side effects sufficient to prompt premature&#xD;
           termination of the study will not be allowed to continue in the protocol. He or she will&#xD;
           be monitored until vital signs normalize and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) shows&#xD;
           normal right heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Device complications/malfunctions Nitrogen generator: If the nitrogen generator is&#xD;
           malfunctioning, air will be enriched with nitrogen from nitrogen-tanks. The manufacturer&#xD;
           will be contacted (Higher Peak LLC, Winchester, Massachusetts (MA) 01890) in order to&#xD;
           deliver a new nitrogen generator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Psychosocial (non-medical) risks Psychosocial risks include prolonged indoor exposure&#xD;
           and perceived isolation from a subject's daily routine, family and friends. Subjects&#xD;
           will have ready access to their personal communication devices (e.g. smart phone for&#xD;
           voice/ social media use) during times when they are not actively participating in&#xD;
           testing procedures. Subjects may be visited in person on the study floor. We do not&#xD;
           anticipate any other psychosocial risks to the study subjects from participation in this&#xD;
           protocol. Strict confidentiality will be maintained by the research team at all times,&#xD;
           including keeping all data in a secure, locked cabinet with limited access. All&#xD;
           specimens will be coded after they are obtained and the code key kept in a locked&#xD;
           cabinet. All electronic data will be stored in a Partners encrypted laptop. Samples&#xD;
           given to parties outside of MGH for analysis will be coded to maintain confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring and Quality Insurance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the small size of the study, no independent monitoring is deemed necessary. The PI&#xD;
      himself will be responsible for the monitoring of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI and co-Is will be responsible for the monitoring of the study. Dr. Lorenzo Berra is&#xD;
      the Principal Investigator and he is an Anesthesiologist and Intensivist at MGH and Assistant&#xD;
      Professor at Harvard Medical School.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping rules&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal investigator and co-investigators will perform the review and decision&#xD;
      regarding altering or stopping the protocol. Mild or moderate adverse events will be&#xD;
      presented in progress reports at continuing reviews. Protocol exit criteria will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Desaturation: SpO2&lt;70% for more than 1 minute not immediately responsive to oxygen&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest pain with evidence of ischemia on electrocardiography (EKG) (e.g., T-wave&#xD;
           inversions, ST segment changes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signs and symptoms of acute pulmonary edema:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Rapidly progressive, severe shortness of breath at rest..&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Severe dyspnea, or a feeling of suffocating or drowning despite return to normoxia.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Wheezing or gasping accompanied with anxiety, restlessness or a sense of&#xD;
                apprehension.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A cough that produces frothy sputum that may be tinged with blood&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signs and symptoms of acute cerebral edema:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  acute ataxia or altered mental status&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  any focal neurologic deficit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increase in systolic pulmonary artery pressure of 15 mmHg from baseline (first&#xD;
           trans-echocardiography in ambient air)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Syncope.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Febrile illness (&gt; 100.4 on two contiguous assays 1 hour apart)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject may voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time.&#xD;
