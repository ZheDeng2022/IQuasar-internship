  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II prospective, randomized, multi-center, double-masked, vehicle-controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of corneal collagen cross-linking the&#xD;
      keratoprosthesis carrier tissue in subjects who are candidates for high-risk keratoprosthesis&#xD;
      implantation but because of a history of corneal melts or autoimmune diseases are not&#xD;
      candidate for a traditional corneal transplant.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multi-center, parallel, randomized, double-blinded study with subsequent&#xD;
      follow-up period of two years. Eight-four subjects across twelve sites will be randomized 1:1&#xD;
      to receive either a corneal tissue that have been cross-linked or not cross-linked (No UVA&#xD;
      light source). Cross-linking is a term that refers to the linking of polymers (long chain)&#xD;
      molecules by chemical bonds. It is believed that cross-linking the cornea will make the&#xD;
      cornea stronger and more resistant to degradation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CorneaGen (formerly Keralink International) (Baltimore site) will supply the donor tissue and&#xD;
      Avedro Inc (Waltham MA) will supply the riboflavin and the UV light source. Staff at&#xD;
      CorneaGenwill administer the riboflavin with dextran solution and perform the cross-linking&#xD;
      procedure according to one of randomization groups before shipping the masked donor cornea to&#xD;
      study sites for Boston Keratoprosthesis (B-KPro) implantation.&#xD;
