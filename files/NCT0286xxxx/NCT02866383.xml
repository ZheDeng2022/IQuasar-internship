    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, open-label phase 2 study in patients with metastatic PC or&#xD;
      BTC refractory or intolerant to at least one line of prior systemic chemotherapy with&#xD;
      gemcitabine or platinum-containing regimens to determine the efficacy and safety of nivolumab&#xD;
      or nivolumab plus ipilimumab administered concurrently with high dose RT. Patients with&#xD;
      metastatic PC or BTC who are feasible candidates for radiation and biopsy of primary and/or&#xD;
      metastatic lesions will be included.&#xD;

             be accessible for image-guided percutaneous biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There is no upper limit on the number of prior chemotherapy regimens received.&#xD;
             Patients must have received and failed or intolerance to at least one line of prior&#xD;
             systemic chemotherapy with gemcitabine or platinum-containing regimens for&#xD;
             unresectable and/or metastatic PC or BTC&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 years and older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy greater than 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG/WHO Performance Status (PS) 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  White blood cell count (WBC) ≥ 2 x 10⁹/L&#xD;

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10⁹/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 5,6 mmol/l&#xD;

             must have a total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ASAT/ALAT ≤ 3 x ULN ( &lt; 5 x ULN if known liver metastasis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PP ≥ 40 or INR ≤ 1.5&#xD;

          -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or CrCl ≥ 40 mL/min (using the Cockcroft-Gault formula)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use method(s) of contraception as&#xD;
             indicated per protocol. For a teratogenic study drug and/or when there is insufficient&#xD;
             information to assess teratogenicity (preclinical studies have not been done), a&#xD;
             highly effective method(s) of contraception (failure rate of less than 1% per year) is&#xD;
             required. The individual methods of contraception and duration should be determined in&#xD;
             consultation with the investigator. WOCBP must follow instructions for birth control&#xD;
             when the half-life of the investigational drug is greater than 24 hours, contraception&#xD;
             should be continued for a period of 30 days plus the time required for the&#xD;
             investigational drug to undergo five half-lives. The half-life of nivolumab and&#xD;
             ipilimumab is up to 25 days and 18 days, respectively. WOCBP should therefore use an&#xD;
             adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks (30 days plus the time required for&#xD;
             nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L&#xD;
             or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the start of nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women must not be breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a&#xD;
             failure rate of less than 1% per year The investigator shall review contraception&#xD;
             methods and the time period that contraception must be followed. Men that are sexually&#xD;
             active with WOCBP must follow instructions for birth control when the half-life of the&#xD;
             investigational drug is greater than 24 hours, contraception should be continued for a&#xD;
             period of 90 days plus the time required for the investigational drug to undergo five&#xD;
             half-lives. The half-life of nivolumab and ipilimumab is up to 25 days and 18 days,&#xD;
             respectively. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must continue contraception for&#xD;
             31 weeks (90 days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half lives)&#xD;
             after the last dose of investigational drug. Women who are not of childbearing&#xD;
             potential (ie, who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men&#xD;
             do not require contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have signed and dated a BIOPAC IRB/IEC approved written informed consent&#xD;
             form and patients with BTC must have signed and dated a CHOCA in accordance with&#xD;
             regulatory and institutional guidelines. This must be obtained before the performance&#xD;
             of any protocol related procedures that are not part of normal subject care&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Malignant ascites that is clinically detectable by physical examination or is&#xD;

             are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As there is potential for hepatic toxicity with nivolumab or nivolumab/ipilimumab&#xD;
             combinations, drugs with a predisposition to hepatoxicity should be used with caution&#xD;
             in patients treated with nivolumab- and ipilimumab containing regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should be excluded if they have known history of testing positive for human&#xD;

             [lowest minimum is 4 weeks or more] after treatment is complete and within 28 days&#xD;
             prior to the first dose of nivolumab administration. There must also be no requirement&#xD;
             for immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg/day prednisone&#xD;
