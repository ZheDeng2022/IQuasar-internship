  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe a safe and consistent technique for neck&#xD;
      rejuvenation using botulinum toxin. This study will also evaluate the efficiency of the&#xD;
      intervention and determine the patients that would benefit most.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The abobotulinumtoxinA will be used for the Nefertiti lift The abobotulinumtoxinA will be&#xD;
      prepared by adding 2.5 cc of normal saline to a 500-unit DysportÂ© (Ipsen Ltd, Berks, UK) vial&#xD;
      Preinjection frontal, oblique and lateral patient pictures will be taken (at rest and with&#xD;
      contraction)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injection points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A series of 4 injection points 1-2 cm apart on a horizontal line under the mandible&#xD;
           posterior to the hypothetical line were the nasolabial fold meets the mandible&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If present, injection of each platysmal band every 2 cm with 2 to 4 injection points per&#xD;
           band (Injection of platysmal band will be done by holding the band between 2 fingers and&#xD;
           injecting intramuscularly) For all injection points 5 units per point of&#xD;
           abobotulinumtoxinA will be used&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 125 units of abobotulinumtoxinA will be allowed for the global neck treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up will be done at 15 days for retouching or for post op pictures if no retouching is&#xD;
      needed. if retouching is needed post injection pictures will be taken 10 days post retouching&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retouching: each residual platysmal band will be reinjected every 2 cm with 2 to 4 injection&#xD;
      points per band (Injection of platysmal band will be done by holding the band between 2&#xD;
      fingers and injecting intramuscularly) (5 units per point of abobotulinumtoxinA will be used)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 30 patients will be recruited&#xD;

    <description>Improvement in Overall appearance (global neck, jowls, skin laxity, platysmal bands, mandibular contour), as assessed by the investigators using the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS).

Very Much Improved: optimal cosmetic results&#xD;
Much Improved: marked improvement in appearance from initial condition but not completely optimal&#xD;
Improved: obvious improvement in appearance from initial condition but additional treatments are advised&#xD;
