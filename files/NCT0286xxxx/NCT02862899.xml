  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator will study the possibility of in situ heating of the liquid containing the&#xD;
      chemotherapy, so as to avoid the need for an external pumping system with its complexity, and&#xD;
      its associated risks and costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of a heating cable (prototype hereinafter called Thermowire, made by the company EFS,&#xD;
      which is in charge of its development) was patented and tested in pigs in two studies that&#xD;
      included 15 animals altogether (in 7 of which the heating cable was used). The aim of the&#xD;
      first study was the purely safety aspects, while the efficacy to obtain hyperthermia, the&#xD;
      quality and the homogeneity of the hyperthermia and its effect on the tissue penetration of&#xD;
      the chemotherapy were evaluated in a second study. The results obtained justify transfer to&#xD;
      use in humans in the context of a clinical trial so as to obtain CE certification.&#xD;
