  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ACC is rare and represent approximately 25% of salivary gland carcinomas. The standard&#xD;
      treatment is surgical excision followed by radiotherapy in selected cases. The disease is&#xD;
      characterized by a progressive course with local and distant recurrences. First-line&#xD;
      treatment is palliative chemotherapy that had modest results. Expression of the epidermal&#xD;
      growth factor receptor in ACC of salivary origin has been reported. Several papers report&#xD;
      that a high percentage of ACCs carries a chromosome translocation that results in the&#xD;
      overexpression of the oncogene MYB, which is involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis,&#xD;
      differentiation and in upregulation of several growth and angiogenetic factors contributing&#xD;
      to the autocrine activation of the FGFR and VEGFR-mediated angiogenesis. Recently two whole&#xD;
      genome sequencing of several ACC tumor/normal pairs have found mutations in genes involved in&#xD;
      the FGF/IGF/PI3K pathway corroborating the hypothesis that this subset might benefit from&#xD;
      inhibitors of this pathway. Based on these premises several antiangiogenic drugs and FGFR&#xD;
      inhibitors are currently under investigation and a response rate of 11% was observed in ACC.&#xD;
      Lenvatinib is an oral multiple RTK inhibitor targeting VEGFR-1-3, FGFR-1-4, RET, c-KIT, and&#xD;
      PDGFR. On February 13, 2015 the drug has been approved by FDA for the treatment of patients&#xD;
      with locally recurrent or metastatic, radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid&#xD;
      cancer. Based on preclinical and clinical data, the investigators believe that targeting&#xD;
      angiogenesis, FGFR pathway and tumor microenvironment might represent a rational basis to&#xD;
      test Lenvatinib in patients with relapsed and/or metastatic ACC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Carcinomas of the salivary glands (SGCs) are rare, (less than 1% of all cancers of the head&#xD;
      and neck and include more than 20 malignant histotypes. They can occur both in major and&#xD;
      minor salivary glands, are locally aggressive, demonstrating invasiveness that leads to&#xD;
      involvement of the facial nerve, skin, bone and surrounding soft tissue. The standard&#xD;
      treatment is surgical excision, followed by radiotherapy in selected cases such as high-grade&#xD;
      histotypes, advanced disease and neck nodes diffusion. Loco-regional recurrence occurs in 16%&#xD;
      to 85%, it can be managed in very selected cases with further surgery and/or radiotherapy,&#xD;
      although the prognosis of these patients remains poor. Adenoid cystic cancer (ACC) is the&#xD;
      most common SGC histotype observed in metastatic subjects (60%) and distant metastases are&#xD;
      the principal cause of failure, being diagnosed in 25-55% of the patients. First-line&#xD;
      treatment is palliative chemotherapy that is typically not associated with any benefit&#xD;
      neither in response rate nor in outcome. In preclinical models, VEGF seems to contribute to&#xD;
      tumor aggressiveness as well as to distant metastasization, in particular in ACC. Moreover,&#xD;
      about 80% of ACC are characterized by MYB-NFIB fusion gene. Deregulation of MYB involves&#xD;
      several genes including those associated with apoptosis, cell cycle control and angiogenesis.&#xD;
      Clinical evidences support the use of antiangiogenic compounds in ACC. Sorafenib a&#xD;
      multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) (VEGFR1-3; PDGFR, RET, cKIT FLT3) and axitinib a potent&#xD;
      TKI anti VEGFR1-3 have been tested in advanced ACC, obtaining a 1% of response rate,&#xD;
      suggesting some activity agents of this class of drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently two whole genome sequencing of ACC tumor/normal pairs have found mutations in genes&#xD;
      involved in the FGF/IGF/PI3K pathway (up to 30% of the cases) corroborating the hypothesis&#xD;
      that this subset might benefit from agents targeting this pathway. Dovitinib, a small&#xD;
      molecule that inhibits FGFR, is currently under investigation. Preliminary results indicate&#xD;
      that the drug produces objective partial responses and prolonged tumor stabilization in&#xD;
      patients with progressive ACCs. Lenvatinib has a stronger antiangiogenic effect compared to&#xD;
      sorafenib and axitinib and has also a higher potency with regard to inhibition of FGFR-1,&#xD;
      offering a potential opportunity to block one of the well known mechanisms of resistance to&#xD;
      VEGF/VEGFR inhibitors. Lenvatinib also has a direct oncogenic effect of controlling tumor&#xD;
      cell proliferation by inhibiting RET, c-KIT, and PDGFR beta, as well as an effect on the&#xD;
      tumor microenvironment by blocking FGFR and PDGFR beta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenvatinib has been investigated in thyroid cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (phase III&#xD;
      trials) and in other malignancies, showing high rates of activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on preclinical and clinical data, the investigators believe that targeting&#xD;
      angiogenesis, FGFR pathway and tumor microenvironment might represent a rational basis to&#xD;
      test lenvatinib in patients with relapsed and/or metastatic ACC.&#xD;
