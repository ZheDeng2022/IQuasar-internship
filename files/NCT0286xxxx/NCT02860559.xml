  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of stem cell transplantation with TBX-1400 in pediatric subjects with severe&#xD;
      combined immunodeficiency (SCID).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The donor cells are exposed to a protein that has been shown in the laboratory to improve the&#xD;
      ability of the donor cells to make blood and immune cells after transplant. Exposure of the&#xD;
      donor cells to this protein does not modify the genes in the cells in any way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has two goals. The first goal is to find out if transplant with TBX-1400 is safe.&#xD;
      The second goal is to find out what effects TBX-1400 stem cells have on time to engraftment&#xD;
      in pediatric subjects with SCID. The study hypothesis is that TBX-1400 cells will shorten the&#xD;
      time to immune reconstitution after transplant.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consent of the subject's legally authorized representative (in most&#xD;
             cases, this will be the parent or parents),&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 1 month to 4 years,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SCID, leaky SCID with &lt;100 TRECs, or Omenn syndrome requiring stem cell transplant&#xD;
             with conditioning therapy (patients with decreased T-cell numbers by flow cytometry,&#xD;
             decreased TREC, and decreased in vitro responses to T cell mitogens will be eligible&#xD;
             regardless of B-cell and/or natural killer (NK) cell function),&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Identified donor (9 or 10/10 Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-matched unrelated or&#xD;
             haplocompatible relative),&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible patients must have adequate physical function to tolerate the conditioning&#xD;
             regimen and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), as measured by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Renal function: serum creatinine ≤3x upper limit of normal for age,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hepatic function: adequate synthetic function as indicated by a serum fibrinogen&#xD;
                  at or above the normal limit for the child's age,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cardiac function: fractional shortening ≥30% as determined by echocardiography.&#xD;
                  (For subjects with a fractional shortening value of exactly 30%, if conditioning&#xD;
                  is delayed for any reason, a repeat echocardiogram is to be performed before the&#xD;
                  conditioning regimen is initiated to confirm the subject's continued eligibility&#xD;
                  for participation in the study.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lack of investigational review board (IRB) approval of the study at the treating&#xD;
             institution,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lack of consent by the child's legal guardians (Israeli law requires consent by both&#xD;
             parents),&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a brother/sister who is a matching and available donor and who was&#xD;
             approved to be a donor in accordance with the law and regulations,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  End-stage organ failure that precludes ability to tolerate the transplant procedure or&#xD;
             conditioning,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine &gt;3 times upper limit of normal for age,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inadequate cardiac function, i.e., fractional shortening ≥30% as determined by&#xD;
             echocardiography (for subjects with a fractional shortening value of exactly 30%, if&#xD;
             conditioning is delayed for any reason, a repeat echocardiogram must be performed to&#xD;
             confirm the subject's eligibility for participation in the study),&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inadequate hepatic synthetic function indicated by serum fibrinogen below normal for&#xD;
             the child's age or signs of hepatic failure,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major congenital abnormalities that adversely affect survival,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Expected survival &lt;4 weeks despite transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following are NOT exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The administration of supplemental oxygen,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The presence of infection per se, because patients with SCID frequently have&#xD;
             infections with routine pathogens as well as opportunistic infections. Antibiotic,&#xD;
             antifungal and antiviral prophylaxis therapy will be used as clinically indicated.&#xD;
             Because transplantation is required for control of infections, subjects may be&#xD;
             enrolled in the study even though infection is present although acute infections&#xD;
             should be controlled prior to initiating transplant conditioning. Adjudication of&#xD;
             controlled infection will be performed by the physician(s) treating the patient&#xD;
             together with the clinical Principal Investigator of the study.&#xD;
