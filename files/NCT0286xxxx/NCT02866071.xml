      STUDY SYNOPSIS Objectives The primary objective is to estimate the proportion of subjects who&#xD;
      report clinically important reductions in pain score (defined as 2 points on a 0-10 verbal&#xD;
      numerical rating scale) after receiving a single dose of fentanyl (per local standard) with&#xD;
      or without intranasal (IN) ketamine (50mg) prior to hospital arrival for the treatment of&#xD;
      acute traumatic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Outcomes This protocol describes two linked studies conducted as a prospective,&#xD;
      randomized, placebo-controlled single-site clinical trial. The primary study has a primary&#xD;
      outcome variable of reduction of reported pain of at least 2 points (on the 0-10 Verbal&#xD;
      Numerical Rating Scale1,2) when comparing the pretreatment pain score to the pain score&#xD;
      obtained upon reassessment 30 minutes after medication administration; secondary outcomes of&#xD;
      the primary trial include reduction of reported pain at Emergency Department (ED) arrival;&#xD;
      the incidence of adverse events; additional opiate requirements prior to ED arrival and in&#xD;
      the first three hours of ED care. The secondary study explores secondary outcomes including:&#xD;
      development of chronic pain (measured by the Brief Pain Inventory,3) or post-traumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder (measured by the PTSD Checklist for DSM-54) and overall satisfaction with life&#xD;
      (measured by the Satisfaction With Life Scale5) at 90-days after injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions and Duration Adult men who qualify for prehospital pain treatment under&#xD;
      paramedic standing orders will be screened for inclusion and will undergo informed consent&#xD;
      for the primary trial. After ED arrival, subjects who consented for the primary trial will be&#xD;
      approached for inclusion in the secondary trial. Prehospital consent for primary trial&#xD;
      enrollment and study drug administration will occur concurrent with receiving a single dose&#xD;
      of fentanyl (IV, IM or IN per current standard practice). Consenting subjects will be 1:1&#xD;
      randomized to receive either 50mg IN ketamine or IN saline placebo. Pain will be rated on a&#xD;
      0-10 scale by the subject prior to treatment and at 30 minutes following treatment and will&#xD;
      receive further pain assessments at 30 minute intervals for the first three hours of their ED&#xD;
      care. Additional pain medications given prior to hospital arrival and within the first three&#xD;
      hours of ED care will also be recorded. The primary outcome of the primary trial will be&#xD;
      reduction in baseline pain between the pretreatment measurement and 30 minutes after&#xD;
      medication administration. Consent for the secondary trial will be obtained for the&#xD;
      additional baseline assessments for secondary outcomes and at 90-day follow-up. Overall&#xD;
      satisfaction with life and symptoms of PTSD and chronic pain will be assessed before hospital&#xD;
      disposition (in-person) and via phone follow-up at 90-days (+/- 14 days) after injury.The&#xD;
      subject will have the option to complete the 90-day follow-up assessments in-person if it&#xD;
      coincides with a clinical appointment on the medical campus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and Power We consider a 2-point reduction in pain to be clinically significant,&#xD;
      and thus our primary outcome for the primary trial will compare the proportion of subjects&#xD;
      achieving a 2-point reduction in pain at 30 minutes post-medication administration between&#xD;
      the treatment group and the control group. Sample size considerations are based on this&#xD;
      primary analysis. To test the hypothesis that the proportion of those treated with fentanyl&#xD;
      alone that have at least a 2-point reduction in their pain will be lower than the proportion&#xD;
      of those treated with the combination of fentanyl and single-dose ketamine who have a 2-point&#xD;
      reduction in their pain, we will use a chi-square test (or the Fisher's Exact Test if&#xD;
      appropriate). An intent to treat approach will be used. We expect the response rate in the&#xD;
      two groups to be 40% and 60%, respectively. These estimates are based on the response rates&#xD;
      in a study comparing pain management efficacy between subjects treated with morphine alone&#xD;
      and morphine plus ketamine.6 With this magnitude of effect, a sample size of 97 per group&#xD;
      will have 80% power to detect the difference between the two groups when the critical level&#xD;
      of significance is set to 5%. To allow for subject drop-out, protocol deviations, and missing&#xD;
      outcome data, we plan to enroll an additional 15% in each arm, for a total of 224 subjects.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Adult males with acute traumatic pain that are eligible to receive pain medication prior to&#xD;
        hospital arrival under current practice will be screened for enrollment in the primary&#xD;
        trial. The inclusion and exclusion criteria mirror this existing protocol (Appendix 1:&#xD;
        Prehospital Protocols).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria of Primary Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be experiencing pain due to acute trauma (i.e. extremity deformity,&#xD;
             tourniquet placement, or severe burns).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A Verbal Numerical Rating Scale pain score ≥7 prior to any pain medication&#xD;
             administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age: ≥18 through 65 years (i.e. subjects must have had their 18th birthday, but not&#xD;
             had their 66th birthday).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systolic blood pressure ≥100mmHg and &lt;180mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Transported directly from the scene of injury to the Emergency Department at&#xD;
             University of Cincinnati Medical Center by a participating EMS agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  English-speaking.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving fentanyl IV/IM/IN as part of standard care. Exclusion Criteria of Primary&#xD;
             Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject reported allergy to morphine, fentanyl, or ketamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EMS treatment with ketamine (any), morphine (any), or more than one dose of fentanyl&#xD;
             prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inter-facility transfers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prisoners or those in police custody.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Paramedic clinical concern of acute agitation or psychosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pain medication not needed in judgment of prehospital provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Altered level of consciousness, mental status change, or suspected head injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Paramedic clinical concern of circulatory shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to provide Verbal Numerical Rating Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Facial injury or suspicion of nasal bone fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Paramedic judgment that subject cannot consent due to underlying cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systolic blood pressure ≥180mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
        Justification for Exclusions Medications are generally withheld if there is a reported drug&#xD;
        allergy. This is a study of acute pain management, and pretreatment with additional&#xD;
        medications may bias results. EMS does not routinely provide inter-facility (between&#xD;
        hospital) transfers, and these subjects will likely be transferred several hours after&#xD;
        injury and should have received pain medications from the original hospital. Prisoners or&#xD;
        those in police custody represent a protected population. Ketamine is pregnancy class N&#xD;
        (unknown); while frequently used in developing countries for analgesia/sedation for&#xD;
        Cesarean sections, 73-75 obtaining a serum or urine pregnancy test is not possible in the&#xD;
        prehospital setting. Breast feeding women and women of childbearing age will be excluded.&#xD;
        To avoid introducing bias from a partially included population, all women will be excluded.&#xD;
        Ketamine may cause psychomotor agitation in some subjects (even though ketamine is&#xD;
        frequently used as treatment of excited delirium76). Pre-existing agitation or mental&#xD;
        status changes and inability to provide VNRS prevent outcomes assessments. Current&#xD;
        prehospital protocols do not allow pain medications for patients with circulatory shock.&#xD;
        Nasal trauma may interfere with medication delivery or absorption. Previous trials have&#xD;
        excluded patients with a systolic blood pressure ≥180mmHg.6,38,49&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria for Secondary Trial Subjects enrolled in the primary trial will be&#xD;
        approached for participation in the secondary trial. Enrollment in the secondary trial will&#xD;
        involve a second and separate consent process (further described below). Participation in&#xD;
        the secondary trial is not required to participate in the primary trial.&#xD;
