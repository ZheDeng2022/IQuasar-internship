  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma are frequent. The chemoradiotherapy protocols are part&#xD;
      of the reference treatment of locally advanced stage tumors. Diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI)&#xD;
      is a non radiating imaging, not requiring injection of gadolinium, giving informations on&#xD;
      tumor activity, based on the brownian motion of water molecules. The differences in motion&#xD;
      are expressed by the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). The ADC variations reflect changes&#xD;
      in water molecules motion and redistribution between the intra- and extracellular&#xD;
      compartments. Several studies have shown that malignant lesions have an ADC coefficient&#xD;
      lowered as compared to benign lesions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      study the diagnostic performance of diffusion MRI performed in early post treatment, notably&#xD;
      changes in the ADC factor, in the onset of tumor recurrence or progression in patients&#xD;
      showing no residual tumor at the end a treatment by chemoradiotherapy for squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma of head and neck seat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      compare the characteristics of diffusion MRI, such as ADC coefficient, between patients with&#xD;
      residual tumor and patients with no residual tumor after chemoradiotherapy for squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma of head and neck location.&#xD;
