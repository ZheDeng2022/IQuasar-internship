  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive behavior therapy is the most effective treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder.&#xD;
      However, the majority of treated patients remain symptomatic. The metacognitive therapy by&#xD;
      Wells (1997) could achieve substantial gains in first pilot studies. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to investigate this approach with a randomized controlled trial by comparing&#xD;
      metacognitive therapy with exposure and response prevention for obsessive-compulsive&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;
