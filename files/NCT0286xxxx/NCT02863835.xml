    <textblock>
      Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is non-invasive and provides functional imaging of the&#xD;
      lung and it could be a useful tool to diagnose chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) and&#xD;
      specially Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS). Hence, for this study, the investigators&#xD;
      aim to show that EIT would provide an accurate diagnostic CLAD with an ability to to&#xD;
      distinguish BOS from Restrictive Allograft Syndrome (RAS) and to stage BOS accurately when&#xD;
      compared to FEV1 the current gold standard. The investigators are also aiming to provide&#xD;
      physiological data in lung transplant recipients with chronic rejection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung transplantation is the only treatment option available for patients affected by&#xD;
      end-stage lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis&#xD;
      or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, not responding to maximal medical therapy. Despite the&#xD;
      advance in the surgical techniques, immunosuppression treatment and prevention of acute&#xD;
      cellular rejection episodes as well as opportunistic infections, the long terms outcomes&#xD;
      following lung transplant remain unsatisfactory. Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) is&#xD;
      the first cause of long term mortality in lung transplant recipients responsible of 5 years&#xD;
      mortality post-surgery of 50%. CLAD can lead to chronic respiratory failure and can presents&#xD;
      in two different phenotypes: Restrictive forms of CLAD were all lung volumes are decreased&#xD;
      (commonly called RAS, Restrictive Allograft Syndrome) that has been recently associated with&#xD;
      antibodies mediated rejection. A more common form of obstructive CLAD has been identified as&#xD;
      the well-known and defined Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS). In patients with BOS, the&#xD;
      progressive obliteration and a narrowing of the distal airways result in breathlessness,&#xD;
      airflow obstruction and air trapping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, Forced Expiratory Volume at 1 second (FEV1) measurement is the gold standard to&#xD;
      assess BOS severity. This test is non invasive and easily performed at bedside. Thus, it only&#xD;
      gives a broad idea of the regional consequences of BOS as may be influenced by large airway&#xD;
      obstructions. Chest computed tomography (CT) gives more detailed imaging of the regional&#xD;
      consequences of BOS but is time-consuming and expose patients to radiations. Others imaging&#xD;
      techniques such as ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy have been studied but cannot be&#xD;
      performed at bedside.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As to date there is no curative treatment for BOS, preventive treatments such as long term&#xD;
      azithromycin, bronchodilators, inhaled steroids or plasmapheresis have to be started at early&#xD;
      stage of the disease to improve outcomes for the recipients Electrical impedance tomography&#xD;
      (EIT) is a new technology that involves wearing a belt of sensors around the chest that&#xD;
      provides information on how well the lungs are being filled with air by the ventilator. It&#xD;
      allows the assessment of these differences, which previously required the use of invasive&#xD;
      equipment to obtain. Information is gained by repeatedly injecting small alternating electric&#xD;
      currents (usually 5 mA) at high frequency of 50 - 80 kHz through a system of skin electrodes&#xD;
      (usually 16) applied circumferentially around the thorax in a single plane between the 4th&#xD;
      and 6th intercostal space. While an adjacent pair of electrodes 'injects' the current&#xD;
      ('adjacent drive configuration'), all the remaining adjacent passive electrode pairs measure&#xD;
      the differences in electric potential. A resistivity (impedance) image is reconstructed from&#xD;
      this data by a mathematical algorithm using a two dimensional model and a simplified shape to&#xD;
      represent the thoracic cross-section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resulting image possesses a high temporal and functional resolution making it possible to&#xD;
      monitor dynamic physiological phenomena (e.g. delay in regional inflation or recruitment) on&#xD;
      a breath by breath basis. It is important to realize that the EIT images are based on image&#xD;
      reconstruction techniques that require at least one measurement on a well-defined reference&#xD;
      state. All quantitative data are related to this reference and can only indirectly quantify&#xD;
      (relative) changes in local lung impedance (but not absolute).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EIT can be used in mechanically ventilated patients to assess recruitment and to optimise&#xD;
      ventilator settings to reduce risk of iatrogenic ventilator associated lung injury. To date,&#xD;
      EIT has never been used in lung transplant recipients.&#xD;
