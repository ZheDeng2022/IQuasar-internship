  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, sham controlled, masked clinical trial of 60 study participants with&#xD;
      glaucoma. Participants with a qualifying study eye will be randomized after screening and&#xD;
      baseline evaluations to receive the NT-501 encapsulated cell therapy (ECT) implant or a sham&#xD;
      surgery (control arm), and no explant will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An examination for safety will occur one day and one week following implant and periodically&#xD;
      thereafter for 24 months post-implant. Based on the primary analysis of data at 6 months,&#xD;
      patients in the control arm may be offered the NT-501 ECT implant at the 12 month time point.&#xD;

    <description>To maintain masking, participants randomized to this group receive sham surgery and will be followed for 12 months. Following analysis of the 6 month data, if the open label extension (OLE) is not triggered, patients in the control group will continue on the original study schedule timeline trough month 24. If OLE is triggered participants will be offered the NT-501 ECT investigational product and will followed for additional 12 months.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must meet all of the following criteria to join the study (all eligibility&#xD;
        criteria must be met at the screening and baseline visits unless otherwise noted):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participant must be medically able to undergo the testing required in the schedule of&#xD;
             events (SOE).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participant's clinical diagnosis must be consistent with glaucoma 1. characterized by&#xD;
             the following features:&#xD;
&#xD;
             a) Clinical evidence of progressive retinal ganglion cell (RGC) dysfunction and&#xD;
             degeneration using both visual field and at least one structural modality as&#xD;
             established by: i. Glaucomatous visual field abnormality. ii. Mean deviation (MD) of&#xD;
             -3 to -15 dB. iii. Minimum average retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness of 60 μm&#xD;
             and maximum average RNFL of 90 μm.&#xD;
&#xD;
             b) Residual visual field preservation including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)&#xD;
             better than 20/200 in both eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             c) Two visual field tests of adequate quality with a maximum visual field index (VFI)&#xD;
             variability of ± 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participant's glaucoma must be clinically stable, with intraocular pressure (IOP) &lt;&#xD;
             21.&#xD;

             by visual field index (VFI) will be deemed includable. If both eyes qualify and have&#xD;
             the same VFI, a randomization procedure will assign one eye to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participant must understand and sign the informed consent. If the participant's vision&#xD;
             is impaired to the point where he/she cannot read the informed consent document, the&#xD;
             document will be read to the participant in its entirety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Females of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective form of birth&#xD;
             control.&#xD;
