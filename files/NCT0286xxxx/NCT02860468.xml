      The compliance of participants in cranberry related clinical trial is poor due to the&#xD;
      bitterness and astringency of cranberry products. There is a pressing need for an effective&#xD;
      approach to verify participant compliance. The PLS-DA (Partial Least Squares Discriminant&#xD;
      Analysis) /OPLS-DA (Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis) models&#xD;
      established from the investigator's previous study provide an opportunity to identify&#xD;
      cranberry juice consumers. In this blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over study,&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the established statistical models of PLS-DA (Partial least&#xD;
      squares discriminant analysis) /OPLS-DA (Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant&#xD;
      analysis) can identify cranberry juice consumers and non-consumers by analyzing the&#xD;
      metabolomic changes in blood and urine among young women. In order to further explore the&#xD;
      function of cranberry, microbiome profile will also be compared between cranberry juice&#xD;
      consumption and placebo consumption after long-term treatment. Another comparison of&#xD;
      metabolomic changes between short-term treatment and long-term treatment will be made to&#xD;
      further identify candidate biomarkers of cranberry consumption and explore the correlation&#xD;
      between acute effects and chronic effects of cranberry.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consumption of cranberry juice has been related to the prevention of urinary tract infection.&#xD;
      However, due to the bitterness and astringency of cranberry products, the compliance of&#xD;
      participants in cranberry related clinical trial is poor, which makes it difficult to further&#xD;
      study the function of cranberry juice. Accordingly, there is a pressing need for an effective&#xD;
      approach to verify participant compliance. In the previous study, plasma and urinary&#xD;
      metabolome in young women following cranberry juice consumption have been investigated using&#xD;
      a global UHPLC (Ultra high-performance liquid chromatography) -Q-Orbitrap-HRMS&#xD;
      (High-resolution mass spectrometry) approach. PLS-DA (Partial least squares discriminant&#xD;
      analysis) analyses showed that both plasma and urinary metabolome in young women were altered&#xD;
      following cranberry consumption compared to baseline and apple juice consumption. Cranberry&#xD;
      juice consumption caused a greater excretion of both exogenous and endogenous metabolites.&#xD;
      These metabolites have been identified as candidate biomarkers for cranberry juice&#xD;
      consumption. The established PLS-DA (Partial least squares discriminant analysis) /OPLS-DA&#xD;
      (Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis) models provide an opportunity to&#xD;
      identify cranberry juice consumers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is unknown whether cranberry juice consumption influences gut microbiota profile in human.&#xD;
      But several studies suggested that a polyphenol-rich diet improves gut microbiota profile.&#xD;
      The previous in vitro study with human gut microbiota indicated that microbial catabolism of&#xD;
      A-type cranberry procyanidins produced metabolites with different profiles and structures&#xD;
      compared with those from B-type procyanidins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding microbiome change in human gut will enable the investigators to correlate and&#xD;
      explain metabolome changes in the urine and blood, and also will explain the health benefits&#xD;
      of cranberries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With all the samples will be collected in this study, the metabolomics changes between&#xD;
      short-term cranberry juice treatment (3days) and long-term treatment (21days) can be&#xD;
      compared. Since the urinary tract protection effects of cranberry juices are often associated&#xD;
      with chronic consumption, more metabolomic changes are expected to be identified by a&#xD;
      long-term study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim 1: Twenty (20) healthy female college students aged 18-29 with normal BMI (Body&#xD;
      mass index) (18.5-25) and at least 110 pounds in weight will be recruited on UF (University&#xD;
      of Florida) campus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advertisement will be in the form of flyers. Contact information of investigators will be&#xD;
      included in the flyer. Questionnaire will be used to obtain information about subjects for&#xD;
      prescreen. All participants will be received written and oral information regarding the&#xD;
      natural and potential risks of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be advised to avoid proanthocyanidins-rich foods including cranberries,&#xD;
      blueberries, strawberries plum, raspberries, apple, grapes, grape seed extract, pycnogenol,&#xD;
      red wine, tea, chocolate and other cocoa products or other cranberry based supplements from&#xD;
      the beginning of 10-day (1st-9th ) run in period to the end of the study. Participants will&#xD;
      be suggested to consume orange, watermelon, honey dew, cantaloupe for replacement. Urine and&#xD;
      stool sample collection kits will be distributed to all participants and participants will be&#xD;
      trained to use the collection kits. One fecal sample will be collected by participants during&#xD;
      any day from the 7th to 9th day. On the 10th day morning, overnight fast urine sample will be&#xD;
      self-collected and subjects will have blood sample drawn (2 tubes, 30mL total). Breakfast&#xD;
      will be provided for participants after fasting blood sample collection. A trained and&#xD;
      certified phlebotomist will be hired to draw blood. After blood drawn, each participant will&#xD;
      consume 1 bottle (250mL) of cranberry or placebo juice and another 5 bottles of cranberry or&#xD;
      placebo juice will be given to each subject to consume in the evening of the 10th day and in&#xD;
      the morning and evening of the 11th and12th day. One fecal sample will also be collected&#xD;
      during the 12th- 4th day. All subjects will return to the clinical unit in the morning of the&#xD;
      13th day with a self-collected overnight fast urine sample and blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected 30-60min after participants consume 1 bottle of cranberry or placebo juice.&#xD;
      Cranberry or placebo juice will be distributed to each of the subjects to consume in the&#xD;
      evening of the 13th day and in the morning and evening during the 14th- 29th day. Appointment&#xD;
      will be scheduled weekly or upon the request of participants during the 14th to 29th day. One&#xD;
      fecal sample will be collected during the 29th to 31st day. In the morning of the 30th day,&#xD;
      overnight fast urine sample will be self-collected and subjects will have blood sample drawn&#xD;
      after consume cranberry juice or placebo. After 14-days washout period, participants will&#xD;
      switch to the alternative regimen and repeat the protocol. All samples collected will be&#xD;
      aliquoted and kept in -80Â°C. It's unlikely to happen, but if any subject has any serious&#xD;
      adverse effect after juice consumption, participant will be removed from the study depending&#xD;
      on her situation for safety concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of urine and plasma sample collected at the13th, 48th day (3 days later after&#xD;
      cranberry juice/placebo consumption) will follow established protocols. LC-HRMS (Liquid&#xD;
      chromatography - High-resolution mass spectrometry) data will be normalized and imported to&#xD;
      SIMCA (Version 13.0.3, Umetrics, Umea, Sweden) to use previously established PLS-DA (Partial&#xD;
      least squares discriminant analysis) /OPLS-DA (Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant&#xD;
      analysis) models to blindly identify cranberry juice consumers. Results will be sent to Ocean&#xD;
      Spray for verification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline fecal samples and fecal sample collected around the 30th, 65th day (21 days&#xD;
      later after cranberry juice/placebo consumption) will be analyzed for microbiome composition.&#xD;
      Genomic microbial DNA will be extracted from stool samples using MoBlo Power soil DNA&#xD;
      isolation kits.. Microbiota change in the gut will be correlated with metabolome changes in&#xD;
      the urine using redundancy and discriminant analysis. Fecal mucin and IgA (Immunoglobulin A,&#xD;
      indicators of intestinal barrier), short chain fatty acids and ammonia in the stool samples&#xD;
      will be analyzed using specific assay kits or HPLC (High-performance liquid chromatography)&#xD;
      method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of urine and plasma sample collected at the 30th, 65th day (21 days later after&#xD;
      cranberry juice/placebo consumption) will follow established protocols. UHPLC (Ultra&#xD;
      high-performance liquid chromatography) -Q-Orbitrap-HRMS (High-resolution mass spectrometry)&#xD;
      analyses, Multivariate data processing and statistical analysis will be the same as the&#xD;
      experiment process discussed in Specific aim 2.&#xD;
