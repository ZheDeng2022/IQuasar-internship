      The primary objective of this clinical trial is to determine if treatment with ubiquinol, a&#xD;
      form of coenzyme Q10, improves the physical function of men and women Veterans suffering from&#xD;
      Gulf War Illness (GWI). The primary outcome measure is a change from baseline on the Short&#xD;
      Form Health Survey 36-item (SF-36), with respect to physical functioning and symptoms.&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures include changes from baseline levels on GWI-associated biomarkers&#xD;
      in peripheral blood and GWI-associated symptoms of chronic pain, fatigue, insomnia, activity&#xD;
      level, and cognitive and mental functioning.&#xD;

      As many as a third of the nearly 700,000 military personnel deployed during Desert Shield and&#xD;
      Desert Storm (Aug 2, 1990 to July 31, 1991) in the Kuwaiti Theater of Operations are&#xD;
      suffering from Gulf War Illness (GWI), an unexplained chronic illness characterized by&#xD;
      multiple symptoms. Gulf War Veterans experienced environmental exposures that are known to be&#xD;
      oxidative stressors which contribute to cell injury, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction&#xD;
      Exploratory studies using interventions that support cell functioning and prevent or repair&#xD;
      stress mediators suggest a role for these targeted interventions, such as Coenzyme Q10. The&#xD;
      goal of this clinical trial is to determine if Coenzyme Q10 is effective in increasing&#xD;
      physical functioning for Veterans with Gulf War Illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, two group, double blind, placebo controlled, Phase III clinical trial.&#xD;
      The treatment group will receive a (2x200 mg for 2 months and 1x200 mg for 4 months) once a&#xD;
      day of ubiquinol for 6 months. The placebo group will receive matching placebo (2x200 mg for&#xD;
      2 months and 1x200 mg for 4 months) once a day of ubiquinol for 6 months. The primary outcome&#xD;
      measure for this clinical trial is a change from baseline of SF-36, with respect to physical&#xD;
      functioning and symptoms. The secondary outcome measures include changes from baseline of&#xD;
      peripheral blood levels of biomarkers, and of GWI-associated symptoms of chronic pain,&#xD;
      fatigue, sleep issues, and cognitive impairment.&#xD;
