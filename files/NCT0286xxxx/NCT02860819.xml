  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a proof-of-concept study to define efficacy of gemcitabine, carboplatin and VELIPARIB&#xD;
      (ABT-888) in patients with refractory germ cell tumors (GCTs). PARP proteins are involved in&#xD;
      base excision repair (BER), one of the major DNA repair system in cells and PARP is&#xD;
      overexpressed in testicular GCTs (TGCTs) compared to normal testis and data suggest that PARP&#xD;
      overexpression is early event in TGCTs development. Patients with low PARP expression in&#xD;
      primary tumour had non-significantly better OS compared to patients with high PARP expression&#xD;
      (5-year OS 89.2% vs 78.7%; HR=0.50, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.17, p=0.12). The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate PARP inhibitor VELIPARIB in combination with gemcitabine, carboplatin in patients&#xD;
      with refractory germ cell tumors (GCTs).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PARP proteins are involved in base excision repair (BER), one of the major DNA repair system&#xD;
      in cells. Recently, it was showed that PARP inhibitors have striking efficacy in patients&#xD;
      with BRCA1 deficient or triple negative breast cancer in monotherapy or in combination with&#xD;
      cisplatin based chemotherapy, without increased systemic toxicity. Pertubations affecting&#xD;
      homologous recombination (HR) involved in DNA repair are associated with higher probability&#xD;
      of response to PARP inhibitors. Inactivation of PTEN, tumor suppressor protein, is associated&#xD;
      with defects in HR and response to PARP inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, PARP expression was evaluated in TGCTs. It was showed that PARP is overexpressed in&#xD;
      testicular germ cell tumours compared to normal testis and PARP overexpression is early event&#xD;
      in TGCTs development. Patients with low PARP expression in primary tumour had&#xD;
      non-significantly better OS compared to patients with high PARP expression (5-year OS 89.2%&#xD;
      vs 78.7%; HR=0.50, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.17, p=0.12).Loss of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN marks&#xD;
      the transition from intratubular germ cell neoplasias (ITGCN) to invasive germ cell tumors.&#xD;
      In the testis, PTEN was abundantly expressed in germ cells whereas it was virtually absent&#xD;
      from 56% of seminomas as well as from 86% of embryonal carcinomas and virtually all&#xD;
      teratomas. On the contrary, ITGCN intensely expressed PTEN, indicating that loss of PTEN&#xD;
      expression is not in early event in testicular tumor development, but is associated with&#xD;
      progression of disease. Previously, it was showed, that testicular germ cell tumors cell&#xD;
      lines have low activity of proteins involved in nuclear excision repair (NER) and it is&#xD;
      assumed that low NER activity is related to the favorable response of testis tumors to&#xD;
      cisplatin-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gemcitabine and carboplatin showed activity in refractory TGCTs. Recently, maximal tolerated&#xD;
      dose of Veliparib (ABT-888) with gemcitabine and carboplatin was established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on aforementioned data, there is strong rationale to inhibit PARP in TGCT. Inactivation&#xD;
      of PARP by Veliparib along with defects of homologous recombination due to PTEN inactivation&#xD;
      in GCTs and low activity of nucleotide excision repair system will dramatically increase&#xD;
      antitumor effect gemcitabine and carboplatin in patients with progressing or relapsing germ&#xD;
      cell cancer.&#xD;
