    <textblock>
      Human IL-21 is present in gingival crevicular fluid in periodontal health, gingivitis and&#xD;
      chronic periodontitis. A significant increase in the concentration of IL-21 in gingival&#xD;
      crevicular fluid is observed with an increase in the amount of periodontal destruction. Non-&#xD;
      surgical periodontal therapy aided in decrease of GCF IL-21 levels in clinical gingivitis and&#xD;
      chronic periodontitis&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal disease is a poly-microbial disease that affects tooth-supporting tissues.&#xD;
      Integral part of periodontal disease involves destruction of periodontal tissues that results&#xD;
      from stimulation of the bacterial challenge to host immune-inflammatory response. Chronic&#xD;
      periodontitis is the most common form of periodontal disease in adult population. The&#xD;
      bacterial plaque biofilm is the primitive factor for periodontitis, but the majority of&#xD;
      destruction of the periodontal tissues would eventually conclude from a sequence of&#xD;
      immune-inflammatory reactions. As a result of cellular activation, inflammatory mediators&#xD;
      include cytokines, chemokines etc. collectively contribute to tissue destruction and bone&#xD;
      resorption. Cytokines can be grouped as Th1, Th2, Th17 and T regulatory (Treg) based on their&#xD;
      expression pattern and effects on target cells or tissues.5 Classically, periodontal disease&#xD;
      has been explained by Th1/Th2 pathway. Th1 cells are more frequently detected in the early&#xD;
      stage of periodontal lesions suggesting that Th1 cells are associated with a protective&#xD;
      response against bacterial infection whereas Th2 cells predominate in the later and advanced&#xD;
      period of the disease, having a role in the destruction and progression of periodontal&#xD;
      lesions. Alternative type of host response to pathogenic bacteria has been described by the&#xD;
      IL-23/IL-17 pathway. This alternative pathway occurs when bacteria induce synthesis of&#xD;
      IL-23/17 rather than IL-12, which plays a pivotal role in initiation and maintenance of&#xD;
      inflammatory response. IL-23/17 pathway as compared to classical Th1/Th2 pathway is a much&#xD;
      fine tuned cellular immune response that has a multitude of functions that bridges the innate&#xD;
      and adaptive arm of the immune response.9 Th17 cytokines (IL-17, IL-21, IL-22, IL-6, Tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor {TNF}-a, etc.)8 participate in periodontal disease, but whether their&#xD;
      dominant role is host-protective or destructive is questionable. These cytokines have not&#xD;
      been elucidated at different inflammatory status in periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IL-21 is a type-I cytokine, structurally it appears similar to IL-2, IL-4, and IL-15&#xD;
      proteins. IL-21 is principally composed by activated T cells, but it directs a vast spectrum&#xD;
      of myeloid and lymphoid cells of the immune system, which facilitate IL-21 to modulate the&#xD;
      acquired and innate immunity.10 IL-21 compete in the immunity against tumor cells11 and&#xD;
      chronic viral infections,12 however, enormous accomplishment of IL-21 has been correlated&#xD;
      with the advancement of immune inflammatory diseases in various organs.13 IL-21 is heighten&#xD;
      in dermatological conditions like skin biopsies14 of patients with systemic lupus&#xD;
      erythematosus, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis. In addition, IL-21 interpretation correspond&#xD;
      with the presence of Th17 cells in synovial fluid and peripheral blood of rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Role of IL-21 in inflammation has been extensively studied; the treatment aspect on its&#xD;
      levels in periodontal diseases needs to be further explored. Therefore, in the light of the&#xD;
      above findings, the investigators determine the levels of interleukin-21 (IL-21) in GCF from&#xD;
      chronic gingivitis, chronic periodontitis and control patients before and after non-surgical&#xD;
      periodontal therapy along with the co-relation of clinical parameters of periodontal tissues&#xD;
      destruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty four patients (19 males and 15 females, aged 20-60 years) were consecutively enrolled&#xD;
      over a six month period (April 2014 to September 2014) from the outpatient department of&#xD;
      periodontology, Krishnadevaraya College of Dental Sciences, Bangalore, and Karnataka. Ethical&#xD;
      clearance for the study was obtained from the institutional ethical committee&#xD;
      (02-D012-36773). The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles described&#xD;
      in the Declaration of Helsinki 2008. Procedure of the study was explained and informed&#xD;
      written consent was obtained from all the participants before their inclusion in the study.&#xD;
      Among them, 24 patients having diseased periodontium were grouped into 12 chronic gingivitis&#xD;
      and 12 chronic periodontitis patients whereas 10 healthy individuals were included as&#xD;
      control. Inclusion criteria were: patients having more than or equal to 14 functional teeth,&#xD;
      systemically healthy patients who had not received any form of surgical and non surgical&#xD;
      periodontal therapy or received antibiotics or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy within&#xD;
      the past 6 months of the study. Chronic gingivitis was defined as having probing depth (PD)&#xD;
      less than or equal to 4mm and more than to 25% sites with gingival bleeding present (BOP).15&#xD;
      Chronic periodontitis was defined as having probing depth more than or equal to 5mm, RAL more&#xD;
      than or equal to 8mm, with more than or equal to 10% sites with BOP positive and evidence of&#xD;
      bone loss determined radiographically.16 Patients who volunteered with no evidence of&#xD;
      periodontal disease determined by the absence of increased PD or AL were considered as&#xD;
      healthy control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical parameters were measured and evaluated for all the teeth excluding 3rd molars, at&#xD;
      all the six sites for each tooth (mesio-buccal, disto-buccal, disto-lingual, mid-lingual and&#xD;
      mesiolingual). These parameters consisted of pocket depth (PD), assessment of gingival&#xD;
      bleeding i.e gingival index (GI), dichotomous measurement of supragingival plaque&#xD;
      accumulation i.e plaque index (PI), and bleeding on probing (BOP) to the base of the crevice.&#xD;
      One calibrated examiner (MN) performed all the patient evaluations and measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GCF samples collection and analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all three groups, GCF samples were collected at baseline and 6 weeks post treatment. Site&#xD;
      selection was based on the highest score recorded for single site in the oral cavity. A&#xD;
      single site in each subject that showed worst inflammatory manifestations (chronic&#xD;
      gingivitis) and the highest RAL level (chronic periodontitis) was selected for gingival&#xD;
      crevicular fluid collection. In our study, we selected a single site in each subject to avoid&#xD;
      pooling of samples from multiple sites, as periodontitis is a site specific disease. Prior to&#xD;
      the collection of GCF samples supragingival plaque was removed with cotton pellets avoiding&#xD;
      contact with marginal gingiva. Standard paperstrips were carefully inserted to a depth of&#xD;
      approximately 2mm, into the sulcus/pocket for 30 seconds for collection of GCF. Blood&#xD;
      contaminated strips were discarded and alternative site was used to obtain replacement&#xD;
      samples. In chronic gingivitis patients, alternative sample wre collected with the next&#xD;
      highest GI scores and in chronic periodontitis patients the next deepest Probing pocket depth&#xD;
      {PPD} was selected for the alternative sample site. A calibrated appliance was used to&#xD;
      quantify the GCF sample volume and reading were converted to actual volume (μL) by reference&#xD;
      to a standard curve, prepared using the periotron reading of volume of fluid (μL) distilled&#xD;
      water in perio-col strips. A blank gingival fluid collection (perio-col) strip was placed&#xD;
      between the periotron fluid meta sensors and the instrument was adjusted to display a reading&#xD;
      of zero. A microlitre syringe was used to accurately deliver 0.25-1.25 μL fluid (distilled&#xD;
      water) to perio-col strip. The strips were immediately placed between the periotron sensors.&#xD;
      The periotron score volume displayed the known volume of fluid recorded. This step was&#xD;
      repeated three more time with 0.25 μL of test fluid and the average score recorded. The above&#xD;
      step was repeated using volume of 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25 μL, and in every instance the mean&#xD;
      periotron value calculated and recorded. Once all the score were obtained, a standard curve&#xD;
      was computed with known fluid volume (X-axis) and periotron score (Y-axis). In a similar way&#xD;
      GCF volumes (from health, chronic gingivitis, chronic periodontitis) from study patients were&#xD;
      obtained automatically with periotron score. The interpolation from standard calibration&#xD;
      graph gave volume of fluid. After measurement of volume, the strips from the selected sites&#xD;
      were placed immediately into individual microcentrifuge tubes containing 200 μL of phosphate&#xD;
      buffer solution. The samples were stored at -80 °C until further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELISA&#xD;
&#xD;
      The levels of IL-21 in the GCF were determined using ELISA according to the manufactures&#xD;
      instruction. To elute the proteins, the tube containing the periopaper strips were vortexed&#xD;
      and homogenized for 30 seconds and then centrifuged at 12,500 rpm at 4°C for 5 minutes. The&#xD;
      kit used monoclonal antibody MT 21.3 biotin and human recombinant IL-21 standard (captured&#xD;
      antibody). Samples were run in triplicate to authenticate the sensitivity of ELISA and all&#xD;
      the samples were found to be within the detection limit of ELISA. An ELISA reader (spectramax&#xD;
      190 Ab sorbance microplate reader; molecular devices; Sunnyvale, CA, USA) with 450 nm as&#xD;
      elementary wavelength was used to measure the absorbance of the substrate. Conversion of the&#xD;
      absorbance readings obtained, into definite volume (pg/mL) were performed using standard&#xD;
      reference curve. The protein concentration at each site (pg/mL) were determined by dividing&#xD;
      the total amount of IL-21 (pg) by gingival crevicular fluid volume (μL) and subsequently the&#xD;
      (pg/μL) values were converted into (pg/mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal treatment protocols:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, clinical parameters and collection of GCF samples for all patients was done. All&#xD;
      patients received a thorough oral hygiene instructions, a full mouth supragingival&#xD;
      subgingival scaling along with root planing. Non-surgical periodontal therapy for group III&#xD;
      was performed in 2-3 appointments. A single calibrated examiner (MN) provided treatment to&#xD;
      all study patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The power of study and sample size calculation was determined on the basis of change in GCF&#xD;
      IL-21 level. Current estimates as a pilot study which included 12 patients in each test group&#xD;
      and 10 in control group with total sample size of 34 patients. Type II error level of β =&#xD;
      0.20 (80% power) and type I error level of α=0.05 (5% probability) was calculated. The&#xD;
      distribution of the samples with respective values of PI, GI, BOP, PD, RAL and IL-21 levels&#xD;
      of pre-operatively and post-operatively was analyzed statistically. Data was entered in&#xD;
      Microsoft excel and analysed using SPSS {statistical package for social science}, ver.10.05)&#xD;
      package. Proportions were compared using Chi-square test (χ2) test of significance. Normality&#xD;
      of data was tested using Shapiro-Wilk test. A student t-test was performed to determine pre&#xD;
      and post treatment difference values. One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test&#xD;
      the difference between the groups. Comparison of the biochemical and clinical parameters were&#xD;
      performed using Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test. P&lt;0.05 was considered statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
