      This study will evaluate the safety and feasibility of the WhiteSwell System for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients hospitalized with acutely decompensated heart failure. Subjects who&#xD;
      have been admitted to the hospital less than 72 hours for ADHF will be evaluated for&#xD;
      inclusion into the study.&#xD;
