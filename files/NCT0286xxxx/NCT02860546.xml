  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single arm, safety lead-in, Phase 2 study, using Simon's 2 stage&#xD;
      design evaluating the safety and efficacy of TAS-102 plus nivolumab in participants with&#xD;
      Microsatellite-stable refractory metastatic colorectal cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1: Participants will be enrolled and after Cycle 1 treatment, they will be evaluated&#xD;
      for the safety and tolerability of the combination therapy. Assuming a tolerated dose is&#xD;
      confirmed additional participants evaluable for response will be enrolled and followed for a&#xD;
      minimum of 6 months and there will be an interim analysis to assess the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      to determine whether the second stage will open for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: Additional participant evaluable for response assessment will be enrolled and&#xD;
      followed for a minimum of 6 months.&#xD;

        <title>Disease Control Rate (DCR) Based on irRC Criteria</title>
        <description>DCR was defined as the percentage of participants with objective evidence of radiologic complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) and was based on the overall best response from each participant as determined from investigator response assessments and following irRC criteria. Per irRC criteria, CR was defined as the disappearance of all tumor lesions (measurable or not, and no new lesions). PR was defined as a decrease in the sum of the products of the two largest perpendicular diameters by 50% or greater by a consecutive assessment at least 4 weeks after first documentation. SD was defined as the failure to meet criteria for irCR or irPR in absence of in absence of irPD.</description>
        <time_frame>From first dose of study treatment up to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment (up to 53 weeks)</time_frame>
        <population>Efficacy population included all participants in the safety population who completed at least 6 months of tumor follow-up, unless the participant progressed or died before the 6-month follow-up.</population>

        <description>DCR was defined as the percentage of participants with objective evidence of radiologic CR, PR, or SD and was based on the overall best response from each participant as determined from investigator response assessments and following RECIST Criteria version 1.1. Per RECIST Criteria CR defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Reduction in any pathological lymph nodes in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of the target lesions, taking as a reference the baseline sum diameters. SD defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as a reference the smallest sum diameters during study.</description>
