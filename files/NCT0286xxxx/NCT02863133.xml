  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, multicenter, multinational study to assess the safety and&#xD;
      performance of the Easyx (trade name) Antia Liquid Embolic during embolization of&#xD;
      intracranial malformations and fistulas. The clinical trial will include patients already&#xD;
      scheduled for neuroradiological interventions. It is estimated that up to 8 sites will be&#xD;
      required to collect the safety and performance data of the study material. Up to 65 patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the study to achieve 53 evaluable patients. Each study centre will be&#xD;
      required to treat 5 patients with a Dural arteriovenous fistula - DAVF before they can treat&#xD;
      brain arteriovenous malformations - AVMs or brain tumours. Only experienced neuroradiologists&#xD;
      will be invited to participate in this study.&#xD;

      Study Procedures Once the subject has agreed to participate in the study and has signed the&#xD;
      consent form, the baseline visit can be performed. A full medical history will be taken and a&#xD;
      physical exam will be done as per local routine practice for an embolization procedure. The&#xD;
      Cognard scale will be performed to assess the grade of a DAVF and the Spetzler Martin grade&#xD;
      will be assessed if a brain AVM is to be treated; these are standard scoring systems for&#xD;
      brain DAVFs and AVMs. A neurological exam will be done and any abnormalities will be&#xD;
      documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure Embolization of the DAVF or BAVM or tumor will be done as per routine practice but&#xD;
      using the Easyx product. The procedure to treat a BAVM or a tumor may be staged and complex&#xD;
      DAVFs may require a second treatment to fully occlude the fistula. The plan for treatment&#xD;
      will be noted at the procedure visit and subsequent planned interventions will not be classed&#xD;
      as adverse events. All interventions up to the 12 month follow up visit will be recorded in&#xD;
      the Case Report Forms - CRFs. If the preliminary angiogram immediately prior to treatment&#xD;
      shows that the target area can no longer be treated with an embolic product, the patient will&#xD;
      be withdrawn from the study at this point and alternative treatment as per routine practice&#xD;
      will be planned. Procedure details will be noted and feedback from the treating&#xD;
      interventionalist will be collected, to determine the ease of handling of the product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the DAVF occlusion is complete, an assessment of where occlusion has been performed will&#xD;
      be noted. If the DAVF or BAVM occlusion or blockage of the supply to a tumor is incomplete,&#xD;
      the reason for incomplete occlusion will be given. The subject will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      visual analog scale immediately after the procedure to report on any pain. A neurological&#xD;
      exam will be done post treatment to assess for any changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discharge The subject's condition will be recorded at discharge. Adverse events will be&#xD;
      reported as well as any subsequent imaging or interventions that occurred following the&#xD;
      initial treatment. A neurological exam will be done and any changes will be recorded. The&#xD;
      Rankin score will only be done if there has been a hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke; this is a&#xD;
      well known stroke scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One Month Follow up A follow up visit will be done at the clinic one month after the initial&#xD;
      treatment. Adverse events will be reported and any subsequent imaging or interventions that&#xD;
      occurred following the initial treatment. A neurological exam will be done and any changes&#xD;
      will be recorded. The Rankin score will only be done if there has been a hemorrhagic or&#xD;
      ischemic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three - Six Months Follow up A control cerebral imaging will be done as per local routine&#xD;
      practice for an embolization procedure. This may include dynamic Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      MR-Angiography, CT or catheter angiography. Adverse events will also be reported. The Cognard&#xD;
      score and the Martin Spetzler grade will be documented and a neurological exam will be done.&#xD;
      The Rankin score will only be done if there has been a hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve Months Follow up A final follow up visit will be done at 12 months to determine if any&#xD;
      adverse events have occurred. A neurological exam will be done and any changes will be&#xD;
      recorded. The Rankin score will only be done if there has been a hemorrhagic or ischemic&#xD;
      stroke. Subjects may be brought back as late as 14 months post procedure, to fit in with&#xD;
      routine follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical risks associated with the use of of Easyxâ„¢ and the procedure to place the device&#xD;
      are the same as any other marketed embolic product. These risks of the procedure include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Headache&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Too much blood sugar&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bleeding from access point for delivery catheter&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bleeding in the brain or a blood clot in the brain leading to stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Low or high blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inability to get to the area to be treated&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Difficulty to remove the delivery catheter, entrapment of the catheter, rupture of the&#xD;
           catheter&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rupture of a blood vessel due to mishandling of the catheter or due to an attempt to&#xD;
           free a catheter that has become stuck to the embolic agent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abnormal heart rhythm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A tear in the wall of the blood vessel&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiratory failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Seizures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spasm of the blood vessels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fainting&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific risks associated with the delivery of the embolic product itself are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inability to clearly see the embolized area&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allergic reaction related to placement of the embolic product&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spasm of the blood vessels due to the solvent in the embolic product&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Low platelet count&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reflux or migration of the embolic product&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bleeding events related to product delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain after the procedure, related to product delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks associated with the delivery system include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Catheter entrapment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Catheter clogging&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Catheter rupture&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks associated with the delivery of the embolic product into the incorrect target area&#xD;
      are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Damage to the function of the cranial nerve vessels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptoms of stroke associated with product being in the wrong brain vessels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissue damage in the surrounding area of the embolic product&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incorrect placement in the venous system&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits The liquid embolic EasyxTM has proved to be feasible and safe for endovascular&#xD;
      embolization in animal AVM and hypervascular animal models. The main advantages of the&#xD;
      material are its even consistency, strongly bound iodine providing high visibility under&#xD;
      x-ray, the non stick properties in relation to the delivery catheter and the adhesive&#xD;
      properties in relation to easy placement of the product in the target vessel. Also, the&#xD;
      product is ready to use and so does not need any preparation prior to placement in the target&#xD;
      vessel. These advantages show that Easyx is easy to use in comparison to other products&#xD;
      already on the market. EasyxTM has been shown to be biocompatible. The solvent is quickly&#xD;
      dispersed in the surrounding tissue allowing the embolic product to quickly precipitate in&#xD;
      situ and provide a solid cast in a target vessel lumen.&#xD;
