      In the present study, by evaluating the efficacy and safety of low intensity ultrasonic on&#xD;
      ASO, to explore the noninvasive auxiliary treatment of ASO. 90 patients were randomly divided&#xD;
      into 2 groups: A)control group, patients were given Conventional conservative treatment;&#xD;
      B）treatment group, patients were given Conventional conservative treatment and low intensity&#xD;
      ultrasonic treatment ; Treatments last for 4 weeks, three times a week, stimulation was given&#xD;
      8 minutes every time, location of treatment were lower limb ischemia area and its surrounding&#xD;
      tissues; outcome indicators were recorded Before and 4 weeks after the trial, The Walking&#xD;
      Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ), ankle brachial ratio, the farthest distance Walking,&#xD;
      percutaneous tissue oxygen tension, tissue oxygenation index recovery time, local skin&#xD;
      temperature, ultrasonic blood vessels, and muscle enzymes, hepatic and kidney function.&#xD;

      Ultrasound is a form of sound whose frequency is higher than the natural audible range for&#xD;
      humans (&gt; 20 kHz) and ultrasonography has been widely used as diagnostic devices for several&#xD;
      decades. In addition to diagnostic purposes, ultrasound is clinically used for therapeutic&#xD;
      applications, including tumor ablation, thrombolysis, bone regeneration, and facilitated drug&#xD;
      delivery. Recently, therapeutic angiogenic effects of low-intensity ultrasound have been&#xD;
      reported in endothelial cells, chick chorioallantoic membrane, and a rat model of hind limb&#xD;
      ischemia. the investigators hypothesis low-intensity ultrasound can improve the ailment of&#xD;
      ASO. In the present study, by evaluating the efficacy and safety of low intensity ultrasonic&#xD;
      on ASO, to explore the noninvasive auxiliary treatment of ASO. 90 patients were randomly&#xD;
      divided into 2 groups: A)control group，patients were given Conventional conservative&#xD;
      treatment: B）treatment group，patients were given Conventional conservative treatment and low&#xD;
      intensity ultrasonic treatment; Treatments last for 4 weeks, three times a week, stimulation&#xD;
      was given 8 minutes every time, location of treatment were lower limb ischemia area and its&#xD;
      surrounding tissues；outcome indicators were recorded Before and 4 weeks after the trial, The&#xD;
      Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ), ankle brachial ratio, the farthest distance Walking,&#xD;
      percutaneous tissue oxygen tension, tissue oxygenation index recovery time, local skin&#xD;
      temperature, ultrasonic blood vessels, and muscle enzymes, hepatic and kidney function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigators speculate after 4 weeks of Low intensity ultrasonic treatment, all the&#xD;
      observation index of ASO patients can be improved; meanwhile, creatine kinase, liver and&#xD;
      kidney function, blood in urine routine, electrocardiogram (ecg) has no obvious change.&#xD;
