  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is examine whether invasive pulmonary artery pressure (PAP)&#xD;
      monitoring could be beneficial for the patients in dialysis treatment. Ten implantable&#xD;
      pressure sensors (CardioMEMS ®) will be implanted and the PAPs of the individual participants&#xD;
      are recorded during and in between the routine dialysis treatment sessions. This is an&#xD;
      exploratory pilot study, where major interest lies in the values and changes in PAP in&#xD;
      relation to other hemodynamic parameters among patients in dialysis treatment. Implanted&#xD;
      device is only monitoring the patient without any effect on the actual treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dialysis treatment is hemodynamically problematic in up to one third of the patients.&#xD;
      Particularly, estimation of the adequate fluid removal during the dialysis can be difficult.&#xD;
      Removing too much fluid can lead to dehydration, hypotension and dizziness, and insufficient&#xD;
      removals can lead to fluid accumulation and worsening of possible heart failure. Both under-&#xD;
      and overestimation of the fluid removal have been connected to increased mortality. Balancing&#xD;
      the fluid balance is especially challenging in patients with simultaneous heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several measures are made and precautions taken during the dialysis to optimize the&#xD;
      ultrafiltration individually for each patient. The key question in the estimation of the&#xD;
      right amount of ultrafiltration is, how much and at what speed fluid can be safely removed&#xD;
      from the patient without critically lowering the filling and preload of the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the CHAMPION trial show that therapy guided by PAP is superior to conventional&#xD;
      way in estimating the optimal fluid balance among heart failure patients. Compared to the&#xD;
      heart failure patients in the CHAMPION trial, the ESRD patients share some similarities. In&#xD;
      both groups, estimating the fluid balance is crucial, but difficult. The changes in fluid&#xD;
      balance among ESRD patients are much larger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study the investigators aim to evaluate the potential of invasive measured PAP&#xD;
      in the context of dialysis treatment for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the implantation the basic medical history is taken, echocardiography is made, and&#xD;
      their laboratory measurements are recorded. Participants are then monitored during their&#xD;
      routine dialysis treatment twice a week over the period of 1 month. In addition twice a day&#xD;
      measurement is recorded in home during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PAP measures and its changes are then compared to all the haemodynamical data available&#xD;
      including blood volume, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, hematocrit&#xD;
      measures and bioimpedance measurement during the dialysis treatment.&#xD;

        Ten patients receiving hemodialysis treatment will be recruited for the implantation of the&#xD;
        CardioMEMS HF System. Five of them will be patients with ESRD caused by polycystic kidney&#xD;
        disease or glomerulonephritis with no evidence of cardiovascular disease. The other five&#xD;
        will be patients with ESRD and hemodynamical instability during and in between dialysis&#xD;
        treatments, defined as ultrafiltration rate minimum of 800 ml/hour and dialysis&#xD;
        hypotension.&#xD;
