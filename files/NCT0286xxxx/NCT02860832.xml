      Background and significance: Though the problem of bullying among adolescents is evidently&#xD;
      increasing and of a serious social concern, it is often undetected until serious outcomes&#xD;
      have surfaced. In recent years, along with the rapid expansion of the Internet, social&#xD;
      network services (SNS) and smart phones, &quot;cyber-bullying&quot; has been growing. Compared to the&#xD;
      traditional bullying, cyberbullying is unique in nature and potentially more hazardous in&#xD;
      terms of invisibility, lack of control, where it enables communication with a broad range of&#xD;
      people at any time and place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore deeper understanding of the magnitude and the impact of the bullying among&#xD;
      adolescents in Taiwan to inform public policy and future health intervention programs may be&#xD;
      beneficial not only to Taiwan but also to Asia as a whole. Many Asian countries now suffer&#xD;
      the similar problems of bullying among adolescents, since these countries share similar&#xD;
      characteristics of development (spread of internet, SNSs and smart phones).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal and objectives: This study aims to explore Taiwanese adolescents' experiences,&#xD;
      perceptions, opinions and mental health regarding cyberbullying and traditional bullying to&#xD;
      inform the development of questionnaire in the quantitative phase of mixed methods study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A qualitative study design with in depth interviews will be adopted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target population and study setting: Senior high school students will be recruited from&#xD;
      Taipei city, Taiwan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and sampling method: Participants will be sampled by convenience sampling until&#xD;
      thematic saturation is attained, probably around 50 students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: Face-to-face in-depth interview with semi-structured questionnaire will be&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: All interviews will be voice-recorded, transcribed, analyzed by thematic&#xD;
      analysis procedure. Analysis process will include familiarization, coding, searching for&#xD;
      themes, reviewing the themes, defining, naming themes and writing up or weaving the analytic&#xD;
      narrative. Triangulation and supervision will also ensure credibility and balance in the&#xD;
      process.&#xD;

      Background and significance: Though the problem of bullying among adolescents is evidently&#xD;
      increasing and of a serious social concern, it is often undetected, overlooked and noticeable&#xD;
      only after serious outcomes have surfaced. In the recent years, along with the rapid&#xD;
      expansion of internet, social network services (SNS) and smart phones, bullying through such&#xD;
      electronic means, &quot;cyber-bullying&quot;, has been growing. Compared to the traditional bullying&#xD;
      cyberbullying is unique in nature and potentially more hazardous in terms of invisibility,&#xD;
      lack of control, where it enables communication with a broad range of people at any time and&#xD;
      at any place. This study is based on mixed methods study. The investigators hope that the&#xD;
      investigators study could contribute to the deeper understanding of the magnitude and impact&#xD;
      of the bullying among adolescents in Taiwan and to inform public policy and future health&#xD;
      intervention programs which may be beneficial not only to the Taiwan but to Asia, as a whole,&#xD;
      as many Asian countries now suffer the similar problems of bullying among adolescents as the&#xD;
      countries share similar characteristics of development (spread of internet, SNSs and smart&#xD;
      phones) having resembling lifestyle and values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the prevalence of traditional&#xD;
      bullying and cyberbullying and the association between cyber-bullying and traditional&#xD;
      bullying with mental health among Taiwanese adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A mixed methods research design with qualitative study followed by quantitative&#xD;
      study will be used in this research. Senior high school students will be included in Taiwan.&#xD;
      For qualitative phase of this study, purposive sampling will be used to recruit students. For&#xD;
      the quantitative phase of the study, sampling will be conducted by probability proportionate&#xD;
      to size sampling procedure. For the qualitative phase of this study, in depth interview will&#xD;
      be used to develop the quantitative questionnaire. An anonymous questionnaire developed from&#xD;
      qualitative will be used to measure the variable of self-esteem, depression, suicidal&#xD;
      ideation, traditional bullying and cyberbullying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: For qualitative study, all interviews will be voice-recorded, transcribed,&#xD;
      analyzed by thematic analysis procedure. Quantitative data will be statistically analyzed by&#xD;
      using SAS software. Descriptive data will be calculated for all variables. Multiple&#xD;
      regressions will be performed to understand the relationship between socio-demographic&#xD;
      variables, cyberbullying, traditional bullying, self-esteem, depression and suicidal ideation&#xD;
      which separated by gender.&#xD;
