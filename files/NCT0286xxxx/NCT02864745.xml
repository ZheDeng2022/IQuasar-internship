      ICU acquired weakness contributes (ICUAW) to poor functional outcome in survivors of critical&#xD;
      care. Most damage occurs during the first week of critical illness when patients are unable&#xD;
      to cooperate with conventional active rehabilitation. Functional electrical&#xD;
      stimulation-assisted cycle ergometry (FES-CE) may improve muscle function and long-term&#xD;
      outcome. Methods: Assessor-blinded pragmatic single-centre randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
      Adults (n=150) mechanically ventilated for &lt; 48 hours from 4 ICUs who are estimated to need&#xD;
      &gt;7 days of critical care will be randomized to receive either FES-CE-based intensified&#xD;
      rehabilitation or routine care, which will continue until ICU discharge. Primary outcome:&#xD;
      Quality of life as measured by SF-36 score at 6 months. Secondary outcomes: functional&#xD;
      performance at ICU discharge, cross sectional muscle diameter and nitrogen balance, and&#xD;
      muscle power. In a subgroup we will assess insulin sensitivity and perform skeletal muscle&#xD;
      biopsies to look at mitochondrial function, fibre typing and regulatory protein expression in&#xD;
      response to FES-CE.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background. Functional disability, a natural consequence of weakness, is a frequent and&#xD;
      long-lasting complication in survivors of critical illness. Over recent decades, mortality&#xD;
      from acute critical illness has decreased with a consequent increasing number of ICU&#xD;
      survivors. Understanding the post-ICU morbidity experienced by these survivors has become&#xD;
      increasingly important. The greatest burdens that survivors of critical illness face are&#xD;
      related to neuromuscular dysfunction and neuropsychological maladjustment. In particular,&#xD;
      neuromuscular abnormalities during critical illness are common, with a median prevalence of&#xD;
      57%. In both patients with chronic critical illness and survivors of severe critical illness,&#xD;
      neuromuscular weakness may be substantial and persistent, resulting in important decrements&#xD;
      in physical function and quality of life for years after discharge. In the past, routine&#xD;
      features of general care provided in the ICU included liberal use of sedation and&#xD;
      immobilization of the patient, which were thought to be necessary for facilitating&#xD;
      interventions to normalise physiological function by artificial means. Recently, there has&#xD;
      been a paradigm shift away from this approach towards a more conservative treatment&#xD;
      philosophy for patients in the ICU. This paradigm shift is consistent with the observation&#xD;
      that long-term physical problems in survivors of critical illness, particularly those with&#xD;
      respiratory failure, may result from the protracted ICU stay and period of immobilization&#xD;
      during which the patient is receiving organ support that is essential for survival. In line,&#xD;
      daily interruption of sedation policy has been widely adopted and proven to be beneficial and&#xD;
      early mobilization culture is spreading quickly across ICUs. Indeed, these strategies,&#xD;
      together with early physical therapy are the only safe and effective interventions in the&#xD;
      prevention of long-term neuromuscular disability in survivors of intensive care. It should be&#xD;
      stressed that in these studies, early rehabilitation is defined as starting between day 2-5&#xD;
      of ICU stay or as an activity beginning before ICU discharge. Standard early rehabilitation&#xD;
      cannot be started early enough, and functional electrical stimulation-assisted cycle&#xD;
      ergometry may be a solution to this dilemma.The first week on the ICU is critical as muscle&#xD;
      mass and function is lost quickly. Immobility-associated muscle loss is evident as early as&#xD;
      within18-48 hours of onset of acute critical illness or severe injury and is greatest during&#xD;
      the first 2 to 3 weeks of critical illness. Up to 40% loss of muscle strength can occur&#xD;
      within the first week of immobilization, with a daily rate of strength loss between 1.0% and&#xD;
      5.5% A 10-14% decrease in cross-sectional measurements of the rectus femoris muscle has been&#xD;
      observed within the first week of ICU stay. Conventional rehabilitation during the first few&#xD;
      days in the ICU is indeed limited in patients who are sedated and mechanically ventilated,&#xD;
      and typically consists of passive limb movements, with or without the use of stretch reflex&#xD;
      provided the earliest (within 48 hours of intubation) and largest dose of rehabilitation&#xD;
      (26Â±14 min a day for patients on mechanical ventilation) and reported improvements of&#xD;
      physical function at hospital discharge, but no measurements beyond. Active rehabilitation is&#xD;
      delayed until the neurological condition of the patient improves enough to facilitate&#xD;
      participation. In the sickest patients, who are at particular risk of developing ICUAW,&#xD;
      sedation and immobility may be prolonged well beyond first week, when established damage to&#xD;
      the muscle has already occurred. In order to achieve maximum efficacy, passive cycling and&#xD;
      neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) can be delivered simultaneously and synchronised&#xD;
      to produce a coordinated pattern of movements. The technique is called FES-CE (functional&#xD;
      electrical stimulation-assisted cycle ergometry). There is a large body of experience with&#xD;
      these methods in the rehabilitation of patients with stroke and spinal cord injuries. The&#xD;
      method is effective in preventing the loss of muscle mass and has been shown to improve&#xD;
      anabolic resistance and insulin sensitivity in quadriplegic patients. In critical illness,&#xD;
      pilot studies have shown NMES itself (without synchronization and the use of bicycle) to be&#xD;
      safe, feasible and effective in maintaining muscle strength and mass. The only study of&#xD;
      FES-CE in critically illness is the pilot trial of Parry et al., where the feasibility and&#xD;
      safety of FES-CE was demonstrated in a small cohort of critically ill patients (8 patients&#xD;
      received the FES-CE intervention, versus 8 controls). Patients in the intervention group&#xD;
      showed significant improvements in the Physical Function in Intensive Care Test and a faster&#xD;
      recovery of functional milestones (e.g. time to stand from lying, and walking on the spot).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses H1: As most of the damage to the structure and function of skeletal muscle occurs&#xD;
      during the first week, intensified rehabilitation, which includes FES-CE and starts within 48&#xD;
      hours after ICU admission, improves functional outcome of ICU survivors at 6 months when&#xD;
      compared to the routine standard of care. H2: Intensified early rehabilitation compared to&#xD;
      routine standard of care, shall preserve muscle mass and improve muscle power at ICU&#xD;
      discharge. H3:Intensified early rehabilitation compared to routine standard of care shall&#xD;
      increase insulin-mediated whole-body oxidative glucose disposal and mitochondrial functional&#xD;
      indices. Sample size calculation:In studies of critical illness outcome at 6-months using&#xD;
      36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) scores, the standard deviation varied between 10-13&#xD;
      points. In order to have 80% power to detect 5 point difference in SF-36 score between&#xD;
      control and intervention at the level of significance p&lt;0.05 in the population with standard&#xD;
      deviation (SD) of 13, we would need 108 subjects (54 in each arm). In order to allow for&#xD;
      deaths and dropouts, the plan is to randomize 150 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization. As soon as possible, but always within 48 hours of admission, participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either standard care or the intervention using&#xD;
      offsite-independent randomization protocols (www.randomization.com). Randomization will be&#xD;
      stratified according to presence or absence of sepsis and the availability of a biopsy at&#xD;
      baseline. Concealed allocation will be performed using sequentially numbered opaque sealed&#xD;
      envelopes only accessible by research personnel with no involvement in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once consent/assent is obtained, and prior to randomisation; participants will be referred to&#xD;
      a study physiotherapist who will administer baseline testing of muscle mass/cross-sectional&#xD;
      area (CSA) using diagnostic ultrasound (US), and baseline blood samples will be taken Both&#xD;
      groups will receive usual best medical and nursing care in the ICU, which include daily&#xD;
      sedation holds when applicable and delirium management as usual in the routine practice.&#xD;
      Respiratory physiotherapy will also be delivered without alterations. The routine standard&#xD;
      care arm will undergo mobilisation/rehabilitation delivered by personnel not involved in the&#xD;
      study in a usual, routine way. Details of physiotherapy treatment will be recorded but not&#xD;
      protocolled in the standard care arm. Intervention group In the intervention arm, early&#xD;
      rehabilitation is protocolled according to patients' condition and degree of cooperation and&#xD;
      there will be pre-defined safety criteria, which are in accordance with current&#xD;
      recommendations for active rehabilitation of critically ill ventilated adults. Whilst the&#xD;
      safety criteria are binding for the study physiotherapist, the rehabilitation protocol is not&#xD;
      and the delivery of physical exercise can be altered according to actual patient's condition.&#xD;
      However, any alteration and the reason for it will be recorded. The intervention will start&#xD;
      as soon as possible and always within 48 h of ICU admission, continuing until ICU discharge.&#xD;
      Supine cycling will be delivered as per protocol on supine cycloergometer attached to a&#xD;
      neuromuscular stimulator Surface electrodes will be applied to the gluteal, hamstrings,&#xD;
      quadriceps and calf muscles on both legs. The intensity of muscle stimulation will be&#xD;
      delivered at a level able to cause visible contractions (confirmed by palpation if uncertain)&#xD;
      in all muscle groups without causing undue pain or discomfort to the participant, according&#xD;
      to a regime specified by Parry, 2012. Once the patient is more alert, and able to&#xD;
      participate, they will be provided with standardized encouragement to engage in therapy. To&#xD;
      increase the intervention workload, resistance will be increased incrementally and cycling&#xD;
      cadence. If a participant is readmitted to intensive care, the intervention will be&#xD;
      re-initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures The ICUs are paperless and fully computerized, so vital functions and other&#xD;
      physiological parameters are monitored and data is routinely stored to secure hospital data&#xD;
      bases via a protected dedicated network. This includes data about nutritional intake and&#xD;
      urinary output. Urine samples will be collected daily, surfaced with toluene and stored in a&#xD;
      deep freeze facility for later determination of nitrogen content and 3-methyl histidine&#xD;
      levels (to calculate muscle catabolism rate and nitrogen balance). In addition, all study&#xD;
      patients will undergo an assessment by a study physiotherapist, which includes a measurement&#xD;
      of rectus muscle cross-sectional area on both legs and whenever the patient regains&#xD;
      consciousness, also muscle power by Medical Research Concil (MRC) score (standardized testing&#xD;
      of muscle power [0-5] on 12 muscle groups on all 4 limbs, giving the score 0-60 (60&#xD;
      suggesting normal muscle power). Blood will be taken, plasma separated and frozen at -80 C&#xD;
      for later analysis of cytokines and hormone levels. This assessment will be repeated at 7-day&#xD;
      intervals and at ICU discharge. At ICU discharge, the patients and relatives will be asked to&#xD;
      provide contact details for follow up. After 6 months, the patient or family will be&#xD;
      contacted for structured interview as required for SF-36 questionnaire, and collected using&#xD;
      Research and Development Organization (RAND) methodology. Whilst participants and&#xD;
      intervention physiotherapist cannot be blinded to group allocation, research staff assessing&#xD;
      outcome will be from separate clinical departments and thus remain blinded to treatment&#xD;
      allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complementary Studies: Insulin resistance and mitochondrial function These studies will be&#xD;
      performed in addition to other study procedures in a subgroup of patients, who give specific&#xD;
      consent to it. First measurement will be performed at baseline prior to randomization,&#xD;
      ideally the next morning after admission. Second measurement on day 7 of ICU stay, i.e. after&#xD;
      at least 5 days of intervention. Muscle biopsy. Will be performed from vastus lateralis&#xD;
      muscle by needle biopsy technique. The sample will be separated into three parts (50-100mg&#xD;
      each). One part will be immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for analysis of protein/DNA&#xD;
      ratio and protein expression studies. The second part will be frozen in liquid&#xD;
      nitrogen-cooled isopentane for muscle fibre typing and immunohistochemistry analysis. The&#xD;
      third part put into culture media on ice for the preparation of homogenates and measurement&#xD;
      of citrate-synthase activity, spectrophotometric analysis of the activity of respiratory&#xD;
      complexes I-IV and western blot analysis of respiratory complexes. In the fresh muscle&#xD;
      homogenates, the investigators will use high-resolution respirometry to determine the&#xD;
      function of individual respiratory complexes in the cytosolic context and measure basic&#xD;
      functional metabolic indices. the investigators will specifically look at the degree of&#xD;
      mitochondrial uncoupling, respiratory chain capacity and the function of individual&#xD;
      complexes, including glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle. Frozen muscle samples will be stored at&#xD;
      deeply frozen for analysis of DNA/protein ratio, messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and&#xD;
      proteins involved in the regulation of proteolysis, substrate oxidation and anabolic pathways&#xD;
      of skeletal muscle as well as immunohistochemistry and typing of muscle fibres. In addition,&#xD;
      the investigators will look at the change of these indices after seven days of critical&#xD;
      illness and the influence of the intervention vs. standard of care. the investigators will&#xD;
      look at correlation of these parameters with muscle power (i.e. compare bioenergetics profile&#xD;
      of skeletal muscle in those who develop ICUAW and in those who do not) and insulin&#xD;
      resistance. Insulin sensitivity and substrate oxidation will be measured after overnight&#xD;
      fasting by hyperinsulinaemic euglycemic clamp.&#xD;
