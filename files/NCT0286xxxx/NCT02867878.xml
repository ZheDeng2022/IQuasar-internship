      The investigators will randomize patients admitted to hospital with Takotsubo diagnosis to&#xD;
      systematic high-dose adenosine infusion for 3 minutes (in addition to standard of care) vs.&#xD;
      standard of care. The primary aim of the study is to demonstrate that adenosine infusion is&#xD;
      associated with a larger and more rapid recovery of left ventricle function.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Takotsubo syndrome is a heart condition that is characterized by the rapid onset of left&#xD;
      ventricular dysfunction, usually reversible, and meeting the following diagnostic criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transient alterations of regional contractility of the myocardial wall of the right or&#xD;
           left ventricle, which are frequently, but not always, preceded by a stressful event&#xD;
           (emotional or physical).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The regional changes in contractility of the myocardial wall, often extend beyond the&#xD;
           distribution of a single coronary vessel, and often result in a circumferential&#xD;
           ventricular dysfunction of the involved segments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of a culprit coronary lesion (eg. Of atherosclerotic plaque rupture, thrombus&#xD;
           formation, coronary dissection) or other pathological conditions that may explain the&#xD;
           regional changes in contractility of the myocardial wall (eg. Hypertrophic&#xD;
           cardiomyopathy, viral myocarditis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reversible electrocardiographic abnormalities of the EKG (ST-T segment elevation or&#xD;
           depression, new onset of left bundle branch block, inversion of t wave and / or QTc&#xD;
           elongation) during the acute phase (3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significant increase in serum natriuretic peptide (BNP or NT-proBNP) during the acute&#xD;
           phase&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Troponin significant increase, but relatively small, (disparity between the degree of&#xD;
           left ventricular dysfunction and the value of troponin).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The recovery of left ventricular function during follow-up (3-6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiology Since the Takotsubo syndrome has been described for the first time in 1991, its&#xD;
      incidence, with the passing of years has been increasing, thanks to the possibility with&#xD;
      networks for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, to have a early access to coronary&#xD;
      angiography study. Currently this syndrome accounts for 2% of all acute coronary syndromes&#xD;
      who are undergoing coronary angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathophysiology The pathophysiology of Takotsubo syndrome is complex, and not fully&#xD;
      clarified. There are several causes have been suggested over the years to explain the&#xD;
      occurrence of this syndrome (vascular and / or myocardial). One of the mechanisms suggested&#xD;
      is that there is a systemic response, by the body, to a severe stress which causes a sudden&#xD;
      increase of catecholamines endogenous and exogenous; this increase has an effect on the&#xD;
      cardiovascular system leading to acute heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stress is one of the most common causes behind the onset of this syndrome, and emotional&#xD;
      stress (eg. Mourning,quarrel, etc.) and physical (eg. Surgical emergencies, obstetric or&#xD;
      psychiatric), but it is not always a present condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent case reports and clinical studies have shown that patients with this syndrome may&#xD;
      experience a reversible damage of the coronary microcirculation, which could be the basis of&#xD;
      the important ventricular dysfunction that is observed in these patients. This characteristic&#xD;
      may play a significant role in the management of these patients. In fact any targeted&#xD;
      therapies to the rapid recovery of the coronary microcirculation function with subsequent&#xD;
      improvement in left ventricular function could reduce or prevent the complications related to&#xD;
      this case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications During the acute phase of Takotsubo Syndrome the incidence of complications is&#xD;
      frequent (18-34% involvement of the right ventricle; obstruction of left ventricular outflow&#xD;
      12-54%; mitral regurgitation 14-25%, 9-20% cardiogenic shock, ventricular thrombus 2-8%,&#xD;
      5-15% atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmias 4-9%, 2-5% bradycardia-asystole) and these&#xD;
      complications are often the consequence of left ventricular dysfunction. In fact, the&#xD;
      presence of major depression of the ejection fraction (EF) is the main cause of complications&#xD;
      in patients with Takotsubo and that the slow pace of recovery of normal EF is closely&#xD;
      connected to this risk of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis Takotsubo syndrome diagnosis requires, as basic examinations, coronary angiography&#xD;
      (allows us to exclude the coronary artery diseases and to highlight the presence of the&#xD;
      typical pattern &quot;apical balloon&quot; to the ventriculography) and the echocardiogram ( allow us&#xD;
      to highlight the regional alterations of left ventricular kinetics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk Stratification Patients in whom the diagnosis of Takotsubo syndrome is made, they have&#xD;
      to be stratified according to their risk profile in patients at high and low risk&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy Recently the European Society of Cardiology has prepared a document in which it is&#xD;
      suggested therapy to be performed in patients with Takotsubo syndrome according to risk&#xD;
      stratification and clinical and echocardiographic data, based on a consensus among the&#xD;
      authors in the absence of current randomized clinical studies in support of this strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mortality The data available report an in-hospital (1-4.5%) and 5 years (3-17%) mortality&#xD;
      non-negligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up A recovery of ventricular function is shown at 3-6 months from acute event&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale of the study In patients with symptomatic Takotsubo, therapeutic strategies&#xD;
      currently used are designed to address, not the pathophysiological mechanism underlying this&#xD;
      event, but the complications faced by patients (ie acute heart failure, arrhythmias and&#xD;
      hyperkinetic left ventricular thrombosis). No data are currently available about targeted&#xD;
      therapies to the treatment of Takotsubo syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adenosine is an extracellular signaling molecule that plays a fundamental role in human&#xD;
      physiology. Its main effects are: vascular vasodilation, regulation of the activity of the&#xD;
      sympathetic nervous system, antithrombotic and regulating blood pressure and heart rate. One&#xD;
      of the main uses of adenosine in the cardiovascular field is the production of vasodilation&#xD;
      of the coronary microcirculation to produce hyperemia, as for example in the assessment of&#xD;
      intermediate coronary stenoses using fractional flow reserve (FFR). It also finds use even in&#xD;
      the course of acute myocardial infarction in reducing the phenomenon of slow-flow in the&#xD;
      course of primary angioplasty, even if the results of the studies currently available are not&#xD;
      unambiguous interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Galiuto et al. have demonstrated that, regardless of the underlying etiology, in patients&#xD;
      with Takotsubo syndrome, it shows the presence of an acute and reversible vasoconstriction of&#xD;
      the coronary microcirculation, which may represent a common pathophysiologic mechanism in&#xD;
      these patients. In the study the investigators underline also as the use of a systemic&#xD;
      infusion of adenosine at a dose of 140 micrograms / kg / min for 90 seconds determines an&#xD;
      initial improvement, statistically significant, of the left ventricular function in these&#xD;
      patients. The study was observational, and have not been taken into consideration clinical&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous studies performed in patients with STEMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial&#xD;
      infarction) have shown that the adenosine infusion systems, although at high doses, causes&#xD;
      only mild adverse effects (es. dyspnea, chest pain, transient ventricular atrium block,&#xD;
      hypotension ) and all quick resolution with the suspension of the infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the study The objective of this study is to demonstrate that in patients with&#xD;
      Takotsubo syndrome diagnosis, the use of adenosine infusion at high doses, immediately after&#xD;
      the diagnosis of disease, and the absence of documentation of coronary artery disease, it is&#xD;
      able to enhance the EF of these patients to 48 hours after diagnosis, compared with standard&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design It is an multicenter, randomized, single-blind study, phase IIa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once coronary angiography demonstrated the absence of coronary artery disease and confirmed&#xD;
      the diagnosis of Takotsubo syndrome patients will undergo a baseline echocardiography and&#xD;
      then randomized, using a randomization system electronic, 1: 1 to receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systemic infusion of adenosine to 140μg / kg / min for 3 minutes + standard therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo (saline to 3 minutes) + standard therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified by the following variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  gender (male vs. female)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  age (&lt;65 years vs. ≥65 years) The standard therapy, will be allocated based on the risk&#xD;
           stratification of patients enrolled. Patients will then be assessed by echocardiography&#xD;
           at 24 hours, 48 hours and 1 month according to the parameters given in the&#xD;
           echocardiographic analysis section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed up with clinical follow-up up to one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRESPECIFIED SUBSTUDY As has been shown in previous studies, patients with Takotsubo syndrome&#xD;
      have reversible coronary microvascular damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of our study is to assess whether the infusion of high-dose adenosine e.v favors&#xD;
      the improvement of left ventricular ejection function quickly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this sub-study we want to evaluate, also, if there is also in our series a damage of the&#xD;
      coronary microcirculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients participating in the sub-study, randomized in the Adenosine arm, the evaluation of&#xD;
      coronary microcirculation will be performed by calculating the IMR (microcirculatory&#xD;
      resistance index) during the infusion of adenosine required by randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IMR is a validated method for measuring the function of the coronary microcirculation. By&#xD;
      using a previously positioned guide pressure on the left anterior descendent (LAD) coronary&#xD;
      artery, IMR is evaluated by the thermodilution technique analyzing the transit time of a&#xD;
      predetermined quantity (3 ml) of saline at room temperature injected into the coronary&#xD;
      artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 consecutive injection of 3 mL of saline solution are performed at baseline, and evaluated&#xD;
      the average transit time for resting (Tmn). Later, during maximal hyperemia induced by&#xD;
      systemic infusion of Adenosine a140μg / kg / min, 3 new injections of saline at room&#xD;
      temperature are performed, and the mean transit temple during hyperemia (Tmnhyp) is measured.&#xD;
      Tmnhyp multiplying by the average value of distal coronary pressure (Pd) registered during&#xD;
      maximal hyperemia, get the IMR value (IMR: Tmnhyp x Pd) which is considered in the normal&#xD;
      range if less than 25. A value above 25 indicates the presence of a damage of the coronary&#xD;
      microcirculation.&#xD;
