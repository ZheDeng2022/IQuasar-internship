  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this proposed investigation is to evaluate blood ropivacaine&#xD;
      concentrations in infants and toddlers following the initiation of, and over the course of,&#xD;
      continuous paravertebral nerve blockade using ropivacaine infusion for postoperative pain&#xD;
      control following esophageal atresia repair procedures that include posterior tracheopexy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous unilateral chest wall nerve blockade (CUCWNB) using ropivacaine is the current&#xD;
      standard of practice for this surgical population at the investigators' institution and, as&#xD;
      such, this study does not aim to alter the current standard clinical care received by&#xD;
      participants but rather evaluate the blood concentrations of ropivacaine as it is routinely&#xD;
      used.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-surgical pain management is often suboptimal in pediatric patients, especially in those&#xD;
      with complex past medical and past surgical histories. Physicians generally, and physicians&#xD;
      at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH), in particular, are employing regional anesthetic&#xD;
      techniques as either primary or adjunct measures for perioperative pain control. One of the&#xD;
      benefits of regional anesthesia is the avoidance, or at least limitation of, opioid and&#xD;
      benzodiazepine exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CUCWNB is a regional anesthesia technique that uses an indwelling catheter, placed under&#xD;
      ultrasound guidance, which terminates in the paravertebral space for a paravertebral nerve&#xD;
      block or at the base of the erector spinae muscle complex immediately lateral to the&#xD;
      paravertebral space for an erector spinae nerve block. Introduction of local anesthetic&#xD;
      through this catheter produces ipsilateral somatic and sympathetic nerve blockade in multiple&#xD;
      contiguous dermatomes. The technique provides effective analgesia for unilateral thoracic and&#xD;
      abdominal surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CUCWNB using ropivacaine is used regularly at this institution for patients of all ages as a&#xD;
      part of various multimodal intra- and post-operative pain management strategies. The success&#xD;
      of CUCWNB implementation for infants and toddlers undergoing thoracotomies has been so marked&#xD;
      that this technique has become essentially a de facto standard of care for this population at&#xD;
      BCH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, even as of today, studies demonstrating the pharmacokinetic profile of&#xD;
      ropivacaine CUCWNB in infants and toddlers are not available. A few studies have examined&#xD;
      plasma levels of ropivacaine after single injection paravertebral nerve blocks in adult&#xD;
      patients. For example, a single bolus injection of 2mg/kg was well tolerated, not exceeding&#xD;
      peak plasma concentrations of 2.5 Âµg/ml, well below the concentration considered a threshold&#xD;
      for ropivacaine local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST). However, it is unclear how&#xD;
      applicable this data is to our complex pediatric surgical patients at BCH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to more fully understand plasma ropivacaine concentrations during CUCWNB, and&#xD;
      particularly how these concentrations relate to known thresholds for ropivacaine-induced&#xD;
      systemic local anesthetic toxicity, the investigators plan to measure plasma concentrations&#xD;
      of ropivacaine at various time points following initiation of CUCWNB in infant and toddler&#xD;
      patients having just undergone esophageal atresia repair with posterior tracheopexy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study does not aim to alter the current standard clinical care received by participants.&#xD;
      No additional treatments will be provided as part of the study. Continuous ropivacaine&#xD;
      infusion via paravertebral nerve block catheter, the standard practice for this surgical&#xD;
      population at the investigators' institution, will be administered to enrolled (and&#xD;
      non-enrolled) patients undergoing esophageal atresia repair with posterior tracheopexy.&#xD;
      Paravertebral ropivacaine infusion is directed by BCH Pain Treatment Service, using existing&#xD;
      dosage and management protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' goal is to better understand plasma ropivacaine levels during continuous&#xD;
      infusion and how they relate to currently understood thresholds for induced systemic local&#xD;
      anesthetic toxicity in infants and toddlers, so as to develop evidence-based safety&#xD;
      guidelines for ropivacaine infusion in infants and toddlers undergoing CUCWNB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect to describe the pharmacokinetics of ropivacaine via CUCWNB for&#xD;
      postoperative pain management of infants and toddlers following thoracotomies. Knowledge of&#xD;
      the systemic absorption of ropivacaine delivered by CUCWNB may provide new insights into&#xD;
      appropriate dosing in order to prevent LAST. This is of particular interest in the subgroup&#xD;
      of infants for whom rates of metabolism and elimination of local anesthetic drugs are poorly&#xD;
      understood.&#xD;
