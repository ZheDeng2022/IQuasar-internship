      This study is designed to test the efficacy and safety of total neoadjuvant induction and&#xD;
      consolidation CapeOX plus neoadjuvant intensity modulated radiotherapy with concurrent&#xD;
      capecitabine for MRI defined high-risk rectal cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying the efficacy and safety of total neoadjuvant treatment for&#xD;
      MRI defined high-risk locally advanced rectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI imaging features as mrT3c/T3d/T4a/T4b, threatening circumferential resection margin, mrN2&#xD;
      disease or extramural vascular invasion are defined as high-risk factor and proved to&#xD;
      associated with unfavorable oncological outcome, especially for distant metastasis. Induction&#xD;
      and consolidation chemotherapy plus radiation may increase both systemic and local control.&#xD;
      Total neoadjuvant treatment schedule also has advantages as improved patient tolerance, early&#xD;
      closure of defunctioning ileostomy etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients with MRI defined high-risk rectal cancer will receive 3 cycles&#xD;
      induction CapeOX, intensity modulated radiotherapy with concurrent capecitabine and 2 cycles&#xD;
      consolidation CapeOX and Total mesorectal excision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The induction chemotherapy related G3-4 toxicity occurred in 42% of patients in GCR-3 trial&#xD;
      (23% during RT, 19% during induction chemotherapy). It is hypothesized that the neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy related G3-4 toxicity rate of the present regimen will be lower than 25% (10%&#xD;
      during IMRT, 15% during induction/consolidation chemotherapy). A sample size of 67 achieves&#xD;
      80% power to detect a difference (△P =17%, P1=25%, P0=42%) using a one-sided binomial test.&#xD;
      (α= 0.05). If the number of G3-4 toxic event is 21 or less, the hypothesis that P1&gt;= 42% is&#xD;
      rejected. About 10 % loss to follow-up was anticipated, so an additional eight patients will&#xD;
      be recruited. The study requires 75 subjects in all.&#xD;

    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 (Aaronson et al., 1993). The questionnaire assesses health status and quality of life of cancer patients using 30 items grouped in one global scale, five multi-item functioning scales, three symptom scales and six single symptom items.&#xD;
The items are scored on a four-point Likert scale with higher scores indicating a better level of functioning or a higher level of symptoms. The validity and reliability of the Mandarin versions of the questionnaire have been established.</description>

    <description>Patients with MRI defined high-risk rectal cancer will receive chemotherapy before and after chemoradiation, and will not receive adjuvant treatment. This arm is called total neoadjuvant treatment (TNT). The neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen is designed as 3 cycles of CapeOX (Capecitabine+Oxaliplatin) over a period of approximately 8 weeks. Tumor response will be evaluated after chemotherapy. Then patients will undergo 22f-IMRT (Intensity modulated radiotherapy) with capecitabine. Patients will receive two more cycles of consolidation CapeOX if tolerable when there was no progressed disease in induction CapeOX.&#xD;
Finally, patients will receive TME (Total mesorectal excision) following TNT if no metastasis occurs.</description>
