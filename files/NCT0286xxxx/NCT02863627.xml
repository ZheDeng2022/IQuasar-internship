      This study will evaluate the course of care of newborns, to understand why some newborns have&#xD;
      improper care pathways, particularly as regards the first medical consultation at the exit of&#xD;
      motherhood. It is also to organize a better quality care network to hospital discharge to&#xD;
      avoid unnecessary use of pediatric emergencies, which represents a real public health&#xD;
      problem.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2014, newborns represented 1.57% of passages (or 906 newborns) of Emergency Pediatric&#xD;
      Hospitals CHU de Nice-Lenval. This proportion is significant and steadily increasing (2013:&#xD;
      820 newborns or 1.46% of passes). The experienced team of pediatric emergency is that the&#xD;
      majority of consultations respite care and child care could well be managed city. The&#xD;
      bibliographic data confirms this feeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But no study has examined the course of care of the newborn during its first month of life.&#xD;
      In 2014, in its recommendations for good practice for the release of motherhood after giving&#xD;
      birth, the HAS recommends a medical examination by a pediatrician (or a general practitioner&#xD;
      with experience of pathologies of the newborn) between 6 and 10 days of life. Other&#xD;
      consultations (midwife, health visitor in PMI) is not required. Moreover, in its brochure to&#xD;
      mothers, prompt medical attention is recommended in certain situations (fever, vomiting ...)&#xD;
      but without specifying the organization. The pediatric emergency therefore no place, except&#xD;
      for emergencies, in the course of care of newborns. But the care pathway proposed by the HAS&#xD;
      is it feasible? And it reduces unnecessary use of pediatric emergency?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the course of care of newborns consultant&#xD;
      pediatric emergency looks to the recommendations of the 2014 HAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify factors associated with abnormal care course and / or consultation with&#xD;
           appropriate non emergencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the reasons why parents of newborns to consult pediatric emergency first-line&#xD;
           concern and before / after the emergency department visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the information received by parents on maternity or during medical&#xD;
           consultations or previous paramedical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the assessment of the course of care of newborns consultant pediatric&#xD;
      emergencies of appropriately (that is to say addressed newborn and / or implementation of&#xD;
      additional tests and / or hospitalization) or not adapted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Description of clinical and demographic characteristics of the newborn, the social&#xD;
           characteristics of the parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Description of the consultation to pediatric emergencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Information Evaluation received by parents on the time of the first medical consultation&#xD;
           at the exit of motherhood and the reason for consultation to pediatric emergencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a biomedical intervention study Routine care, single-center prospective,&#xD;
      non-randomized. Will be included all newborns (that is to say, child ≤ 28 days of life)&#xD;
      consultant to hospital emergency NICE-Lenval Hospital, and after obtaining the non-opposition&#xD;
      of the two parents. The number of patients needed is 280 newborns. The duration of inclusion&#xD;
      is one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following consultation with the pediatric emergency, parents will be contacted 2 times:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2-7 days after the consultation: clinical and demographic characteristics of the&#xD;
           newborn, social characteristics of parents, information received by parents, whether (s)&#xD;
           consultation (s) Medical (s) or paramedic (s) already completed and anxiety parents&#xD;
           before / after the emergency department visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the week following the first month of life the child complete the child care course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data on emergency department visit (which made additional tests and fate of the child)&#xD;
      will be collected from the host software pediatric emergencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the course of care of newborns, to understand why some newborns have&#xD;
      improper care pathways, particularly as regards the first medical consultation at the exit of&#xD;
      motherhood.&#xD;
