      Purpose: To determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of human recombinant decorin&#xD;
      protein, a transforming growth factor ß (TGFß) inhibitor in preventing proliferative&#xD;
      vitreoretinopathy (PVR) in patients with perforating globe injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a prospective, single-center, open-label, interventional case series. A&#xD;
      single intravitreal injection of decorin 200ug (n=4) and 400ug (n=8) was given within 24&#xD;
      hours of injury. Pars plana vitrectomy with silicone oil injection was done if indicated. ERG&#xD;
      was done before injections, at day 10, and 3 months. Serial plasma decorin levels were&#xD;
      assessed before injections, day 3, 5, and 10 post-injection. Clinical assessment included&#xD;
      globe survival, retinal attachment rate, and PVR evaluation.&#xD;

      This is prospective, single-center, open-label, interventional case series. Twelve patients&#xD;
      with open globe injuries presenting to the causality department at Kasr Al Ainy Teaching&#xD;
      Hospital, Cairo University, were enrolled in our study. Those patients were assigned to&#xD;
      Ocular Trauma Score category 1 or 2 in which the visual prognosis after treatment is poor&#xD;
      (Category 1 prognosis: 74% no light perception, 15% light perception to hand movements,&#xD;
      Category 2 prognosis: 27% no light perception, 26% light perception to hand movements) (31).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An informed consent was obtained from the participant prior to the conduct of any study&#xD;
      procedure. The participant was adequately informed about the study, understood risks,&#xD;
      benefits and alternative treatments, and voluntarily agreed to participate in the study. He /&#xD;
      She was given ample time to consider participation and had his / her questions addressed in a&#xD;
      satisfactory manner before agreeing to participate and signing the informed consent form.&#xD;
      Participants were free to choose to withdraw from the study at any time without any&#xD;
      responsibility, even if the study has not been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative Evaluation: 1. Baseline systemic examination: including clinical evaluation,&#xD;
      complete blood picture, liver function tests and kidney function tests. 2. Full ocular&#xD;
      examination: All patients were subjected to complete ophthalmological examination including:&#xD;
      Best corrected visual acuity (according to the Snellen VA chart). Slit lamp examination. 3.&#xD;
      CT scan (Sytec and BrightSpeed; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wis): Unenhanced CT of the orbits&#xD;
      was performed; axial, coronal and sagittal views with contiguous 2-mm-thick sections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Full Field ERG using a full field flash Ganzfeld stimulator (Roland Consult,&#xD;
      Electrophysiologic Diagnostic Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany): The ISCEV-ERG GF program was used&#xD;
      to record standard ERGs. All responses were differentially amplified, displayed on an&#xD;
      oscilloscope, digitized and stored on a compact disc. An adjustable voltage window was used&#xD;
      to reject records contaminated by artifacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dark adapted ERG responses were obtained after a minimum of 30 minutes of dark adaptation and&#xD;
      included an isolated rod, standard flash (maximal) response, and oscillatory potentials.&#xD;
      Light adapted responses included a single white flash and 30-Hz flicker. ERG amplitudes and&#xD;
      implicit time values were measured according to recommendations by the International Society&#xD;
      for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time interval between the time of injury and the time of primary repair was recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decorin Injection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One dose of 200 µg/0.1ml or 400 µg/0.1ml Recombinant Human Decorin (R&amp;D Systems, Inc.,&#xD;
      Minneapolis, MN, USA) are to be evaluated in this study and is to be injected intravitreally.&#xD;
      Those doses were reported to be effective and safe in a rabbit model of traumatic PVR.&#xD;
      Considering the difference of the vitreous volume between human and rabbits; three times&#xD;
      larger in the former; the dose was expected to be tolerable in human. The drug was injected&#xD;
      within 48 hours after the trauma taking all the safety measures for intravitreal drug&#xD;
      injections according to the The Royal College of Ophthalmologist guidelines of intravitreal&#xD;
      injections procedure 2009.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery is done in two steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step I: Primary repair:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial repair of the globe is to be done at the time of presentation. The globe is explored&#xD;
      for injuries. The severity of the trauma is evaluated and documented to insure that the case&#xD;
      fulfill the inclusion criteria of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step II: Secondary intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delayed vitrectomy at the tenth day after the injury was done with silicon oil temponade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary repair: General anaesthesia. Sterilization with betadine 10% for the eye lids.&#xD;
      Application of sterile drapes and wire speculum. Conjunctival dissection and removal of any&#xD;
      tenon tissue at edges of the inlet scleral wound. Rectus muscle is hooked and cut whenever&#xD;
      needed for proper exposure of the wound. Vitrectomy was done for any prolapsed vitreous from&#xD;
      the wound. Scleral wound was sutured using 7/0 vicryl suture on reverse cutting needle.&#xD;
      Conjunctiva was closed with inverted knot using 7/0 vicryl suture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post Primary Repair Follow Up: 1. Systemic follow up: including clinical evaluation, complete&#xD;
      blood picture, liver function tests and kidney function tests at the tenth day. 2. Ocular&#xD;
      examination follow up: Slit lamp examination accessing; Sutured wound. Anterior chamber cells&#xD;
      and flare; Intraocular pressure. Follow up ERG: at tenth day. Measuring plasma Decorin level&#xD;
      at third, fifth, eighth and tenth day. Ocular Ultrasound: to detect site of exist, presence&#xD;
      of retinal detachment, state of posterior hyaloid, suprachoroidal hemorrhage, subretinal&#xD;
      hemorrhage and presence of intraocular foreign body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pars Plana Vitrectomy: General anaesthesia. Sterilization with betadine 10% for the eye lids&#xD;
      and betadine eye drops 5% for the surface of the globe. Application of sterile drapes and&#xD;
      wire speculum. 23G vitrectomy system was used. Using one step technique, the 23G cannulas&#xD;
      were inserted obliquely after minimal displacement of the intact conjunctiva using a pressure&#xD;
      plate for globe fixation and as a measure. The infusion line was inserted into the&#xD;
      infero-temporal cannula. Before opening the infusion, a vitreous sample was taken by&#xD;
      vitrectomy cutter with the aspiration line plugged to a 5ml syringe to measure vitreous&#xD;
      Decorin level. Hemorrhagic anterior hyaloid behind the posterior capsule was removed,&#xD;
      utilizing light from operating microscope, taking care not to injure posterior capsule.&#xD;
      Infusion cannula was verified that it was in vitreous cavity not in the suprachoriod space.&#xD;
      Non-contact wide-angle viewing system binocular indirect ophthalmomicroscope (BIOM) was used&#xD;
      for visualization. Hemorrhagic vitreous gel was excised, layer by layer, taking care not to&#xD;
      injure the retina especially in cases associated with retinal detachment. The hemorrhagic&#xD;
      tissue over the posterior exist wound was trimmed by the vitrectomy probe. The vitrectomy&#xD;
      probe, with the vacuum mode, was used to look for adherent posterior cortical vitreous. The&#xD;
      probe was placed just above the optic disc with the aspiration port directed away from the&#xD;
      macular area. Vacuum was gradually increased until the cortical vitreous was engaged in the&#xD;
      aspiration port. The probe was withdrawn anteriorly while gradually increasing the vacuum&#xD;
      until the posterior hyaloid was detached and elevated from the posterior pole. This was&#xD;
      assured by observing the circular wave spreading peripherally. Next, the detached posterior&#xD;
      hyaloid engaged in the aspiration port, was peeled from posterior to anterior. The&#xD;
      vitreoretinal interface during surgical posterior hyaloid peeling was closely observed, so&#xD;
      that peeling was stopped once strong attachments were encountered for fear of creating&#xD;
      retinal tear. Whenever possible, peeling was continued till the posterior border of vitreous&#xD;
      base. To ensure complete detachment of the posterior hyaloid, triamcinolone acetinoide was&#xD;
      injected gently into the mid vitreous cavity. Posterior cortical vitreous still adherent to&#xD;
      the retinal became highlighted. The later was removed using vacuum generated at the probe&#xD;
      aspiration port, soft tip back-flush flute needle or by using Tano's scrapper. If there is&#xD;
      retinal detachment, PFCL was injected gently through a small bored blunt cannula directed&#xD;
      towards optic disc, while lowering the intraocular pressure, to flatten the already mobilized&#xD;
      retina over the posterior pole. Subretinal fluid was drained through existing retinal breaks&#xD;
      or retinotomies when necessary. Vitrectomy for the vitreous base was performed meticulously&#xD;
      360 degrees with scleral indentation accomplished by the assistant. The IOP was lowered&#xD;
      during base vitrectomy to reduce counter-resistance and allow easy depression of the sclera.&#xD;
      The vitreous cutter was set at 5,000 cuts per minute and the suction was adjusted with the&#xD;
      foot pedal. The sclera was depressed gently with the narrow shaft of the scleral depressor&#xD;
      while the suction was increased. Both hands were used to remove the vitreous base; vitrectomy&#xD;
      at the vitreous base from the 6- to 12-o'clock position was performed with the vitreous&#xD;
      cutter held with the right hand, and that from the 12- to 6-o'clock position was performed&#xD;
      with the left hand. Endolaser photocoagulation was applied around posterior exist site, 360&#xD;
      degrees and to all retinal breaks. Silicone oil was injected through the infusion cannula.&#xD;
      Closure of two sclerotomies. Removal of the infusion cannula and closure of the third&#xD;
      sclerotomy. Eye patching. Adjuvant scleral buckling was not performed in any case. Patients&#xD;
      were instructed to maintain the appropriate position for 1 week following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative follow-up: Full ophthalmological examination was done on the first day&#xD;
      post-operatively then at 1st week and 1st month. Examination included: Best corrected visual&#xD;
      acuity (according to the Snellen VA chart). Slit lamp examination. Assessment of IOP. Dilated&#xD;
      fundus examination with binocular indirect slit-lamp biomicroscopy using (Super Field lens;&#xD;
      VOLK, Mentor, Ohio, USA).After 3 months, silicone oil was removed. The retinal status was&#xD;
      evaluated again, after silicone removal, with binocular indirect slit-lamp biomicroscopy&#xD;
      using (Super Field lens; VOLK, Mentor, Ohio, USA). Furthur assessment of the retina was done,&#xD;
      functionally by ERG and anatomically by sweept source OCT. SS-OCT (DRI OCT-1, Topcon, Japan)&#xD;
      using radial and raster scans was done over the macula and the edge of the posterior exist&#xD;
      scar (Figure 31). The investigators evaluated the presence or absence of any epi or sub&#xD;
      retinal membranes, vitreoretinal interface abnormalities, intra-retinal fluid, subretinal&#xD;
      fluid, the status of the IS/OS junction and ELM.&#xD;
