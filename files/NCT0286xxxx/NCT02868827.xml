      The purpose of the research study is to determine whether a single high dose of vitamin D is&#xD;
      helpful in reducing critical illness related complications in intensive care patients who are&#xD;
      having sever vitamin D deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D deficiency is quite common in critically ill patients ranging from 81.5% to 99%. A&#xD;
      number of scientific studies have documented a strong correlation between low levels of vit.D&#xD;
      and increased rate of adverse outcomes including infection, acute kidney injury and mortality&#xD;
      in ICU patients. A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) has demonstrated a 50% reduction&#xD;
      in hospital mortality in severe vit.D deficient patients following a single high dose of&#xD;
      cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3). However, the role of Vit.D supplementation to boost up host&#xD;
      immune system and eventually reduction of mortality has yet to be determined by large&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials in humans. Hence the study aims to run a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT) in order to study the role of Vitamin D in critically ill patients.&#xD;

      DETAILED DESCRIPTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction: Vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin and it affects multiple systems of our body.&#xD;
      It not only plays a key role in musculoskeletal system but also works on our immune and&#xD;
      cardiovascular systems. Because of its wide range of anti-inflammatory and metabolic&#xD;
      properties, vitamin D, recently, has gained an immense importance among the intensivists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the critically ill patients have vitamin D deficiency and are at high risk of&#xD;
      complications ranging from systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, septic&#xD;
      shock, multi-organ dysfunction, multi-organ failure and finally death. Immune system&#xD;
      dysregulation has been thought to play a pivotal role in the development of sepsis. Onset and&#xD;
      progression of sepsis are dependent upon a fine balance between pro-inflammatory and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory mediators of the immune system. Massive and uncontrolled release of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines leads to widespread tissue damage and multi-organ failure. It has&#xD;
      been found that the cells of the immune system (both innate and acquired) express receptors&#xD;
      for vitamin D. Low levels of it renders the immune system regulatory cells dysfunctional and&#xD;
      in turn, increases the risk of infections and other adverse outcomes. It has been estimated&#xD;
      that even with optimal treatment anywhere from 16% to more than 80% of patients with sepsis&#xD;
      don't survive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve the survival of critically ill patients, several research studies have been&#xD;
      focused on the identification of various biomarkers and their correlation with disease&#xD;
      severity. Timely supplementation of cholecalciferol has been demonstrated as one of the&#xD;
      mortality reduction interventions. In recent studies, vitamin D has been identified as an&#xD;
      important regulator of our immune system and its deficiency is quite common in ICU patients&#xD;
      ranging from 81.5% to 99%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of scientific studies have documented a strong correlation between low levels of&#xD;
      vit.D and increased rate of adverse outcomes including infection with multi drug resistant&#xD;
      organisms, acute kidney injury, decreased left ventricular ejection fraction and mortality in&#xD;
      ICU patients. It has been found that the emergence of acinetobacter baumannii infections in&#xD;
      significantly more common in vit D deficient critically ill patients and vit D deficiency is&#xD;
      an independent risk factor for the development of Acinetobacter baumannii infections in&#xD;
      intensive care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent RCT has demonstrated 50% reduction in hospital mortality in patients with severe&#xD;
      vit.D deficiency following a single high dose of cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3). However, the&#xD;
      role of Vit.D supplementation to boost up host immune system and eventually reduction of&#xD;
      mortality has yet to be determined by large randomized controlled trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with severe vitamin D deficiency, gastrointestinal absorption of vit.D, after&#xD;
      enteral supplementation could be variable depending upon the patient's gastrointestinal&#xD;
      functions, critical illness and the activity of hepatic cytochrome P 450 system. In order to&#xD;
      restore optimal vit.D level in critically ill patients (possibly within first 48 hours), a&#xD;
      single high dose of it has been suggested on admission to ICU. As in critically ill patients,&#xD;
      it is highly unlikely to restore Vitamin D within a reasonable period of time by&#xD;
      supplementing 400-4000 international units/day (recommended daily allowance). Moreover, a&#xD;
      single large dose of vit.D through the enteral route is highly unlikely to cause vit.D&#xD;
      toxicity. The acutely toxic level of vit.D is considered to be more than 150 ng/ml.&#xD;
      Furthermore, this high loading dose of cholecalciferol has been justified based on the safety&#xD;
      findings of previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, during a pilot study followed by a large randomized controlled trial conducted&#xD;
      by Karen A et al, no serious adverse events were noted with a single high dose (540,000 I.U)&#xD;
      of cholecalciferol. The highest 25-hydroxyvitamin D level measured was 107 ng/ml which is far&#xD;
      below the currently suggested toxic level of vit.D (that is more than 150 ng/ml). Moreover,&#xD;
      one patient in vitamin D3 group was found to have a total serum calcium level of 12 mg/dl and&#xD;
      an ionized serum calcium level of 6 mg/dl but that patient had primary hyperparathyroidism&#xD;
      (although normocalcemic at study inclusion). However, the incidence of falls and fracture was&#xD;
      similar in vitamin D3 and placebo groups for a follow-up period of six months. So a single&#xD;
      high dose of cholecalciferol is less likely to increase the incidence of hypocalcemia,&#xD;
      hypercalciuria, falls and fractures which have been found to be increased with annual high&#xD;
      doses of vitamin D3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence the investigator intends to use a single high dose of cholecalciferol in order to&#xD;
      restore it deficiency quickly, hopefully within 1 to 2 days in order to give maximum benefits&#xD;
      to our critically ill patients right from the start of their illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our RCT is to study the role of Vit.D supplementation in critically ill patients.&#xD;
      By boosting up the already struggling immune system of critically ill patients, the&#xD;
      investigator assumes a significant reduction in mortality and other adverse outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: A single high dose of cholecalciferol supplementation improves survival in&#xD;
      critically ill patients with severe vitamin D deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null Hypothesis: A single high dose of Cholecalciferol supplementation in critically ill&#xD;
      patients will not reduce the mortality and adverse outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and randomization: Patients or their surrogates will be contacted on admission to&#xD;
      ICU and study information will be provided to them by the research staff members. Consented&#xD;
      patients will be randomized. Randomization list will be prepared by King Abdullah Medical&#xD;
      City (KAMC) research center. The list will be used to prepare sealed envelopes each&#xD;
      containing the assigned treatment. These envelopes will be stored in the pharmacy and opened&#xD;
      up by the research pharmacist who will prepare medication/placebo for the randomized&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding: Blinding will be done by research pharmacist in KAMC pharmacy. Fresh milk will be&#xD;
      used as a placebo. The study medication (a white-colored, powdered form of cellulose based&#xD;
      vit.D) will be dissolved in fresh milk so that both interventional drug and placebo will have&#xD;
      the same color, odor, consistency, taste, and amount as that of interventional medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all vit. D deficient patients, supplement 50,000 IU of cholecalciferol per week through&#xD;
      the enteral route as a part of routine ICU treatment plan. As our recruited patients will be&#xD;
      having severe vitamin D deficiency (Vit. D level below 12ng/ml) so both interventional and&#xD;
      placebo group patients will receive our routine treatment for vit.D deficiency which is&#xD;
      50,000 IU of cholecalciferol through enteral route per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Patients randomized to vitamin D group will receive 400,000 IU of&#xD;
      cholecalciferol dissolved in 45 ml of fresh milk through orogastric tube/nasogastric&#xD;
      tube/Oral within 1st 24 hours of ICU admission. This high dose is in addition to our routine&#xD;
      treatment for vitamin D deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-recruitment retention strategies: the study will follow our patients for 30 days or as&#xD;
      long as they stay in ICU after supplementation of a single high dose of vitamin D or placebo.&#xD;
      As the investigators are working with critically ill patients, expecting at least a few weeks&#xD;
      of hospital stay. However, the patient having early and quick recovery will be discharged&#xD;
      home and will be followed up by one of the assigned research team members who will be&#xD;
      contacting them by phone and inquire about any complications related to the research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: the investigator will complete a randomized controlled trial by supplementing&#xD;
      cholecalciferol 400,000 IU versus placebo within 24 hours of ICU admission that would be&#xD;
      added to our routine treatment for vit.D deficiency. Safety of this high dose of vit D has&#xD;
      been validated in previous studies. This trial will employ block randomization and intention&#xD;
      to treat protocol. This single-center study would be completed over a period of 2 complete&#xD;
      years here in KAMC Intensive care Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Measurements: Blood samples will be obtained at baseline (day 0) and days 1, 3, 7,&#xD;
      and 28 to assess serum parathyroid hormone, total and bioavailable 25-hydroxyvitamin D&#xD;
      levels, phosphate, procalcitonin, leukocytic count, hemoglobin, creatinine, bilirubin, beta&#xD;
      natriuretic peptide (BNP), blood glucose and albumin levels. In addition, the investigator&#xD;
      will also measure urinary calcium and urinary creatinine levels&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection: Patients will be followed up (1 month) closely for the development of&#xD;
      study-drug related complications if any, for example, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria,&#xD;
      fractures, etc. Data elements to be collected will include, but not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - Date and time of admission to hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Mode of admission (Emergency Room or in-patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - Date and time of ICU admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. - 25 - hydroxyl vitamin D level on admission to ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. - Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. - Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Index (APACHI) Score 7-Patient's co-morbidities&#xD;
           (Diabetes, Hypertension, Chronic kidney disease, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,&#xD;
           Ischemic Heart Disease, Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting, Cerebrovascular accident,&#xD;
           Arrhythmias, Anemias, smoking, obesity, cancer)&#xD;
&#xD;
      8 - Mode of Oxygen delivery to the patient 9 - Previous positive cultures and antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy within the last 3 months 10 - Empirical antibiotic therapy on admission to hospital&#xD;
      and ICU 11 - Baseline clinically relevant investigation, for example, Echo,&#xD;
      Electrocardiography, Ultrasound Doppler for Deep venous thrombosis, CT brain/chest/abdomen,&#xD;
      12 - Endo/bronchoscopic findings if any 13 - Vasopressors and ionotropic support duration 14&#xD;
      - Central venous catheter, arterial line, pigtail, chest tube (site, date and time of&#xD;
      insertion) 15 - Evidence of acute or acute on chronic kidney injury on admission to ICU. 16 -&#xD;
      Surgeries - previous and recent surgeries and any post-op complications 17 - Previous&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapies for example chemo/radio/glucocorticoid therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation: A recent RCT demonstrated almost 50% reduction in hospital mortality&#xD;
      (46.1% in placebo versus 28.6% in Vit D group) by supplementing 540,000 IU of Vit D3 to&#xD;
      critically ill patients having severe vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D level ≤ 12&#xD;
      ng/ml). With an alpha = 5% (two tailed test), power = 95%, baseline mortality control group&#xD;
      30% and test group mortality 15%, the sample size required would be 195 patients per group.&#xD;
      To account for losses to follow up of around 10%, the study aims to recruit 215 patients in&#xD;
      each group. So the total number of patients required for both the groups would be 430 in 2&#xD;
      full years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: the investigator will use an intention to treat approach to avoid the&#xD;
      effects of crossover and dropout. Standard statistical analysis will include normally or near&#xD;
      normally distributed variables reported as means and non-normally distributed variables as&#xD;
      medians. Means will be compared by using student's t-test and medians by using Mann-Whitney U&#xD;
      test. Differences in proportions among categorical data will be assessed using Fisher's exact&#xD;
      test. A p-value of less than 0.05 will be considered to represent statistical significance&#xD;
      for all comparisons.&#xD;
