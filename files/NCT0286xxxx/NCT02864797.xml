  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gynecologic cancers (cancers of cervix, endometrium, ovary, vagina, and vulva) represent an&#xD;
      important part of the female cancer in France with more than 15 000 new cases in 2012. As&#xD;
      considerable progress have been made in diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, an important&#xD;
      part of the gynecologic cancers are diagnosed at an early stage and globally, the after&#xD;
      treatment overall survival rate is estimated to more than 80% at five years. Thus, it is of&#xD;
      evident interest to study health related Quality of Life (QoL) among these patients who will&#xD;
      continue to live after their cancer and to consider QoL as a primary end-point, beyond&#xD;
      overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GYNEQOL (health related Quality Of Life of women with GYNEcologic cancer) group is a&#xD;
      working group initiated in Besançon and whose goal is to investigate QoL of gynecologic&#xD;
      cancers' patients. It gathers several entities from the hospital of Besançon, namely the&#xD;
      Methodology and Quality of Life in Oncology Unit, the Gynecologic Unit and the Oncology Unit.&#xD;
      The GYNEQOL study is a project of a prospective cohort study, in a pragmatic clinical&#xD;
      practice, with the main objective of longitudinally collecting and analyzing QoL data of&#xD;
      these women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot phase, GYNEQOL-Pilot, restricted to the hospital of Besançon, has started in&#xD;
      September 2015 with the goal of assessing the feasibility of the cohort. The feature of this&#xD;
      study is that patients answer to QoL questionnaires using tablets computer and the&#xD;
      Computer-based Health Evaluation System software (CHES). Indeed, use of electronic solutions&#xD;
      to collect patient reported outcomes is drastically increasing those last years. It has been&#xD;
      underlined that routinely collecting symptoms could increase both QoL and survival among&#xD;
      cancer patients. It enables to use these data in real-time in routine practice by presenting&#xD;
      QoL scores to physicians in simple graphical histograms for both transversal and longitudinal&#xD;
      measurements and it ensures a reliable data collection.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Objectives The main objective is to collect and analyse QoL of gynecologic cancer patients in&#xD;
      a prospective and pragmatic cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be QoL assessed by the European Organization for Research and&#xD;
      Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 (Core Quality of Life Questionnaire), for the following&#xD;
      targeted dimensions : global health, emotional, social and functional roles and fatigue&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to assess those endpoints :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the participation rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the acceptability of the use of the CHES and tablets computer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  use of the QoL results by the physicians&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  occurence and type of missing data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  attrition&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population All adult patients with gynecologic cancers (ovarian, endometrial and&#xD;
      cervical cancers), treated in the University hospital of Besançon, and who gave their&#xD;
      informed consent, are prospectively included. Patients who do not well understand French, who&#xD;
      have cognitive impairment or who do not have social insurance are not included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Socio-demographic, socio-economic (occupational group, attained education,&#xD;
      income), behavioural (physical activity), previous history and familial history of cancer,&#xD;
      clinical, medical data, biomarkers, therapeutic strategies, toxicities and QoL will be&#xD;
      prospectively collected at inclusion and throughout the follow-up. As we are in the context&#xD;
      of pragmatic clinical practice, visits are based on the usual follow-up of gynecologic cancer&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QoL will be assessed using EORCT QLQ-C30 questionnaire and the specific modules QLQ-CX24&#xD;
      (cervix), QLQ-OV28 (ovaries) and QLQ-EN24 (endometrium), using a time-driven design. These&#xD;
      auto-questionnaires will be administrated with the CHES and the help of an clinical research&#xD;
      associate at inclusion, before treatment, 3 weeks after treatment and at each &quot;routine&quot;&#xD;
      follow-up visit during at least 6 months. If patients do not want to use tablet computer,&#xD;
      &quot;pen-paper questionnaire&quot; will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses Usual statistical methods will be used for description of&#xD;
      socio-demographic, socio-professional, clinical of patients at inclusion and of QoL&#xD;
      throughout the follow-up. Those characteristics will be described considering cancer&#xD;
      localizations and stages and used therapeutics/surgeries. We will also described the&#xD;
      participation rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The acceptability of the use of the CHES and tablets computer and the use of the QoL results&#xD;
      by the physicians will be qualitatively described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data will be described by assessing profile of patients with missing data, occurence&#xD;
      of missing data for each QoL item, incomplete QoL questionnaire rate and type of missing data&#xD;
      (missing at random, missing completely at random, missing not at random).&#xD;
