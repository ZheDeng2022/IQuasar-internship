    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ibrutinib works in treating patients after a donor stem&#xD;
      cell transplant for lymphoma that is not responding to treatment or has come back. Ibrutinib&#xD;
      may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To study the use of ibrutinib starting between day 60 and day 90 after allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) until 12 months post hematopoietic cell transplant to&#xD;
      improve the progression-free survival (PFS) at 12 months post hematopoietic cell transplant&#xD;
      by 25% compared to historical controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To increase the incidence of successful outcome (defined as lack of requirement of second&#xD;
      line therapy for acute graft-versus-host disease, lack of National Institutes of Health [NIH]&#xD;
      severe chronic graft-versus-host disease, lack of progression or relapse of chronic&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukemia/mantle cell lymphoma [MCL], lack of death from disease or non-relapse&#xD;
      causes) to at least 60% at 1 year post hematopoietic cell transplant. (Cohort A) II. To study&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of ibrutinib post hematopoietic cell transplant in patients with&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin lymphoma. (Cohort A and B combined) III. To study the&#xD;
      incidence of grade 3-4 acute graft-versus-host disease in the first 6 months post&#xD;
      hematopoietic cell transplant in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;
      (Cohort A and B combined) IV. To study the incidence of second line therapy (systemic only)&#xD;
      for acute graft-versus-host disease in the first 6 months post hematopoietic cell transplant&#xD;
      in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. (Cohort A and B combined) V. To&#xD;
      study the incidence of recurrent acute graft-versus-host disease in the first 6 months post&#xD;
      hematopoietic cell transplant in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;
      (Cohort A and B combined) VI. To study the incidence and severity of chronic&#xD;
      graft-versus-host disease in the first 12 months post hematopoietic cell transplant in&#xD;
      patients with not-Hodgkin lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. (Cohort A and B combined) VII. To&#xD;
      study the incidence of lung involvement with graft-versus-host disease in the first 12 months&#xD;
      post hematopoietic cell transplant in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Hodgkin&#xD;
      lymphoma. (Cohort A and B combined) VIII. To study the incidence of sclerotic skin chronic&#xD;
      graft-versus-host disease in the first 12 months post hematopoietic cell transplant in&#xD;
      patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. (Cohort A and B combined) IX. To&#xD;
      study the incidence of infectious deaths not related to graft-versus-host disease in patients&#xD;
      with non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphoma. (Cohort A and B combined)&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To study the association of minimal residual disease (MRD) as detected by immunoglobulin&#xD;
      heavy chain (IgH) sequencing prior to starting ibrutinib and compare to post ibrutinib at&#xD;
      month 6, 9 and 12 after HCT. (Cohort A)&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To study the impact of onset of new acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease on minimal&#xD;
      residual disease. (Cohort A)&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To study the association of T-cell clonality by T cell receptor (TCR) Vb sequencing&#xD;
      prior to starting ibrutinib and compare to post ibrutinib at month 6, 9 and 12 after&#xD;
      hematopoietic cell transplant. (Cohort A)&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To study the impact of onset of new acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease on T cell&#xD;
      receptor sequencing. (Cohort A)&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To study the association of B cell receptor signaling pathways and immune function with&#xD;
      response by single cell mass cytometry prior to starting ibrutinib and compare to post&#xD;
      ibrutinib at month 6, 9 and 12 after hematopoietic cell transplant. (Cohort A)&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To study the association of single cell mass cytometry that investigates B cell receptor&#xD;
      signaling and its association with new acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease on B-cell&#xD;
      receptor (BCR) signaling. (Cohort A)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning between 60-90 days post donor stem cell transplant, patients receive ibrutinib&#xD;
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) until 1 year post donor stem cell transplant in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.&#xD;
