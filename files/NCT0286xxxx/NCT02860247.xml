      This study aims at determining within a short time (&lt;3h) the susceptibility to clinical&#xD;
      isolates of E. coli to the major antibiotics directly from positive blood cultures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The resistance to antibiotic is a concern for the great majority of pathogenic bacteria. The&#xD;
      proportion of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is particularly high in hospital settings. The&#xD;
      accumulation of resistance mechanisms can lead to multidrug resistance, therapeutic impasses&#xD;
      and a subsequent higher mortality of infected patients. The use of antibiotics in humans and&#xD;
      animals creates a selection pressure that favors the dissemination of antibiotic resistant&#xD;
      strains. It's necessary to optimize antibiotic consumption to limit the spread of these&#xD;
      bacteria. It requires both the fast bacterial identification and the fast determination of&#xD;
      their resistance profile in order to use narrower-spectrum compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usually antibiotic susceptibility testing usually takes 18-24 hours. Mass Spectrometry type&#xD;
      Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-Of-Flight (MALDI-TOF MS) has become a&#xD;
      valuable tool in clinical laboratories for pathogen identification. Preliminary data showed&#xD;
      that susceptible and resistant bacteria can be differentiated within 1 or 2 hours with a new&#xD;
      technology called 'MS-ASTRA' based on a lower global peak intensity in the presence of the&#xD;
      antibiotic of interest (at a concentration corresponding to the susceptibility breakpoint&#xD;
      defined by the EUCAST) than in its absence. The objective of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      performances of this new MALDI-TOF MS method on a panel of wild-type and resistant clinical&#xD;
      isolates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to determine the resistance of Escherichia coli isolates to cefotaxime,&#xD;
      piperacillin-tazobactam, amoxicillin and to implement the method to positive blood cultures.&#xD;
      Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations will be determined the standard agar dilution method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results and full analyze are deliverable within 2 years. The data obtained with the MS-ASTRA&#xD;
      technique will be compared with the resistance status of the clinical isolates. The shortest&#xD;
      incubation time (1 or 2 hours) that gives the more accurate result will be evaluate.The&#xD;
      antibiotic savings that the implementation of this new method could have allowed will be&#xD;
      evaluate.&#xD;
