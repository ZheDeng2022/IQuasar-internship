    <textblock>
      Dental procedures often require the use of local anesthesia. The effects of the anesthesia&#xD;
      usually linger for some time after the dental procedure is completed which can lead to&#xD;
      discomfort and occasionally injury from lip/tongue biting. Clinical trials have shown&#xD;
      phentolamine mesylate (OraVerse) to be effective at reducing the amount of time to reversal&#xD;
      of local anesthesia compared to sham injections. However, no trials have been conducted&#xD;
      comparing phentolamine mesylate to a true control injection. Such trials are needed in order&#xD;
      to definitively show that it is the phentolamine mesylate itself that is causing the&#xD;
      reduction in anesthesia rather than a dilution effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the proposed research is to conduct a pilot-scale randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      evaluating the difference in time required to the return of normal soft-tissue sensation and&#xD;
      function in participants who had received an inferior alveolar nerve block (using 2%&#xD;
      Lidocaine 1:100,000 epinephrine), followed by an injection with either 1) OraVerse&#xD;
      (phentolamine mesylate) or 2) sterile physiological water (control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will comprise dentistry and dental hygiene students of the second year&#xD;
      classes at Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada. This study population has been chosen&#xD;
      because these students usually practice dental anesthesia on each other as a part of a course&#xD;
      on local anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed pilot scale study will be a double-blind controlled trial using parallel&#xD;
      groups. As part of their usual anaesthesia course, the dental and dental hygiene students&#xD;
      will be practicing their inferior alveolar nerve injections on one another using 2% Lidocaine&#xD;
      1:100,000 epinephrine. Students who decide to participate in the study will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of two groups: Group 1 will receive an injection of OraVerse (treatment&#xD;
      group), while Group 2 will receive an injection of sterile physiological water (control&#xD;
      group). The time required to the return of soft-tissue sensation and function will be&#xD;
      assessed using a questionnaire.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The research will be conducted at the Dalhousie University Dental Clinic. As part of their&#xD;
      anaesthesia clinical course, students enrolled in the second year of the dentistry and dental&#xD;
      hygiene programs practice different anesthesia techniques on each other during a planned&#xD;
      hands-on training activity. The research study will take place during the same day.&#xD;
      Participants who meet the eligibility criteria and consent to participate will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of two groups. Following anesthesia obtained as a part of their hands-on&#xD;
      training session, subjects allocated to Group 1 will receive 1ml of phentolamine mesylate&#xD;
      following anesthesia, while subjects allocated to Group 2 will receive 1ml of sterile&#xD;
      physiological water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1, Both Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects will be trained to use the Assessment of Anesthesia questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Following training, subjects will perform baseline assessments of their lip and tongue&#xD;
           numbness (should be normal).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Prior to anaesthesia is given, vital signs will be recorded. Blood pressure, respiratory&#xD;
           rate and pulse will all be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Topical anesthetic, 20% benzocaine, will be applied to the injection site for 3 minutes.&#xD;
           Subjects will be given a standard inferior alveolar nerve block injection, with&#xD;
           aspiration before injection, using 1ml of 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine from&#xD;
           the student they are teamed with. This step is not part of the study; it is done as part&#xD;
           of their clinical anesthesia course.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Soft tissue anaesthesia will be self-assessed, by using finger tapping and palpation, to&#xD;
           ensure profound anesthesia. The second phase (OraVerse or water) will not take place&#xD;
           before profound anesthesia has been achieved. The anesthetic outcome will be considered&#xD;
           a failure if the participant does not report anesthesia of the lower lip within 10&#xD;
           minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. If profound anesthesia is achieved within 10 minutes, subjects will proceed to phase 2.&#xD;
           If profound anesthesia is not achieved within 10 minutes subjects will be withdrawn from&#xD;
           the study. Subjects who are withdrawn from the study will continue with their standard&#xD;
           training protocol which is to receive a re-injection of anesthetic. A withdrawal form&#xD;
           will be used by Dr. Flood to record the occurrence of anesthesia failures. This form&#xD;
           will also record reasons for withdrawals, should any occur for different reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 Group 1: Phentolamine Mesylate After anesthesia is confirmed, subjects in Group 1&#xD;
      will receive an injection of 1ml of a solution containing 0.24mg of phentolamine mesylate in&#xD;
      the same site previously injected with anaesthetic solution. Dr. Brittany Flood will give the&#xD;
      injection to ensure consistency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Water After anesthesia is confirmed, subjects in Group 2 will receive an injection&#xD;
      of 1ml of sterile physiological water in the same site previously injected with anesthetic&#xD;
      solution. Dr. Brittany Flood will give the injection to ensure consistency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 Vital signs will be taken immediately after injection, by their student partner, and&#xD;
      all students will be monitored for 30 minutes. During the monitoring period, the participants&#xD;
      will self-assess their anesthesia, using the Assessment Of Anesthesia questionnaire. This&#xD;
      self-assessment will be done every ten minutes until soft-tissues revert to their normal&#xD;
      state. After the 30 minute monitoring period participants will be free to leave the clinic,&#xD;
      taking the questionnaire with them but will continue to check for anesthesia every 10 minutes&#xD;
      until tissue sensation and function return to normal. Students will be instructed to return&#xD;
      the forms to the office of the Research Development Officer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Case Report Forms will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment Of Anesthesia questionnaire: self-assessment of state of soft-tissue&#xD;
           anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject Eligibility Checklist: inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant Identification allocation Log (centrally kept): Participant study ID and&#xD;
           chart number&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Group Allocation Log (centrally kept): Participant study ID and treatment&#xD;
           group ('A' or 'B')&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Withdrawal information&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse Event form&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and reversal injections will be done by Dr. Brittany Flood, who is a licensed&#xD;
      dentist currently enrolled as a student in the Masters of Periodontics program at Dalhousie&#xD;
      University Faculty of Dentistry. Dr. Pierre-Luc Michaud who is a dentist and full-time&#xD;
      assistant professor at Dalhousie Dentistry will supervise the project and perform data&#xD;
      analysis. He will not be involved in recruitment and will not be present during the clinical&#xD;
      phase of the study. Dr. Brittany Flood is not in a position of authority with the dental or&#xD;
      dental hygiene students and will therefore be the only research member working directly with&#xD;
      the participants. She will be the only research team member aware of who has volunteered to&#xD;
      be in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two weeks before the anesthesia session, the potential participants will be given a thirty&#xD;
      minute presentation, followed by a question and answer session. On the evening of the&#xD;
      anesthesia course session, the initial numbness assessment (2 minutes) and reversal injection&#xD;
      (5 minutes) will be the only clinical time required from participants in the study, as the&#xD;
      other manipulations (vital signs monitoring and 30 minutes post-injection waiting-time period&#xD;
      before leaving) are a standard part of their course. Following the clinical portion,&#xD;
      participants will be free to leave the clinic but will continue to check for anesthesia every&#xD;
      10 minutes and then fill out a short questionnaire when sensation and function return to&#xD;
      normal (to record duration of soft-tissue anesthesia). The duration of anesthesia could take&#xD;
      between 1 and 2.5 hours, depending in which group the participant is.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized double-blind study. The Research Development Officer of the&#xD;
      Faculty of Dentistry will be responsible for the randomization procedure. A computerized&#xD;
      random number generator will be used to generate six randomly permuted blocks, with a block&#xD;
      size of six. Within each block, an equal number of subjects will be allocated to the two&#xD;
      treatment groups ('A' or 'B'). These will refer to either OraVerse group or Control group,&#xD;
      but the Research Development Officer will withhold the information until the statistical&#xD;
      analyses are completed. She will however give a copy to the supervisor of the anesthesia&#xD;
      training session (who is not involved in the study) so that the information on what was&#xD;
      injected could be quickly accessed during the hands-on if required and to appropriately fill&#xD;
      participants' clinical chart. The allocations will be placed in sequentially numbered (01&#xD;
      through 36), opaque, sealed envelopes (referring to participants' ID) to be opened at the&#xD;
      time of participant's reversal injection. The treatment group (A or B) randomly assigned for&#xD;
      each participant will be recorded in the Treatment Group Allocation Log. The syringes will be&#xD;
      marked as 'A' or 'B'; the person injecting (Dr. Brittany Flood) will not know which contains&#xD;
      OraVerse (PM) and which contains water. As previously discussed, the anesthetic course&#xD;
      supervisor will however have the information as a safety measure and to appropriate fill the&#xD;
      patients' chart. To ensure continuous blinding of allocation, the randomization code will be&#xD;
      kept secret by the Research Development Officer until after data analysis. Only the&#xD;
      participant study ID will be used to label the subject's case report forms. Only the&#xD;
      Participant Identification allocation Log could associate the participant ID with the&#xD;
      patients' chart number, but this file will be kept centrally during the study time.&#xD;
