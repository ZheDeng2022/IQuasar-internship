  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is increasing and associated with obesity, diabetes and&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia in recent years. Aerobic exercise indeed reduces adipose, hepatic insulin&#xD;
      resistance and hepatic fat. However, diaphragmatic breathing improves cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      function, the oxygen content of the body and therefore reduces inflammation of cells. The aim&#xD;
      of this study is to ameliorate hepatic inflammation by using diaphragmatic breathing&#xD;
      exercises instead of aerobic exercise to reduce the fat in liver inflammation.&#xD;

      The non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is increasing and associated with obesity, diabetes and&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia in recent years. Aerobic exercise indeed reduces adipose, hepatic insulin&#xD;
      resistance and hepatic fat. However, diaphragmatic breathing improves cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      function, the oxygen content of the body and therefore reduces inflammation of cells. The aim&#xD;
      of this study is to ameliorate hepatic inflammation by using diaphragmatic breathing&#xD;
      exercises instead of aerobic exercise to reduce the fat in liver inflammation. The project&#xD;
      intends to be accomplished within three years because of the ideal exercise leaves an&#xD;
      uncertain question for curing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Hence, with the literature&#xD;
      and empirical data analysis to review and identify the strength of patients' motion and&#xD;
      duration, carry out a pilot observational study by including 20 patients, then teach&#xD;
      diaphragmatic breathing exercises in the first year of the project. Observe the initial&#xD;
      correlation measurement, the variables of the following one month and three months. For the&#xD;
      second year, develop the training of diaphragmatic breathing process with assisting device&#xD;
      (Diaphragmatic breathing-facilitated exercise device). Use diaphragmatic breathing exercise&#xD;
      assisting device in a 12-week program of diaphragmatic breathing on randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial, verifying the impact of this item interventions on patients' metabolism indicators in&#xD;
      the final year.The project includes people who are over 20 years old without the&#xD;
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Taking liver function, body mass index, the thickness of&#xD;
      subcutaneous fat, heart rate variability, metabolism indicators are mainly study measured&#xD;
      variables. Regression Analysis helps understand the correlation between breathing exercise&#xD;
      and indicators related to the disease. With the intervention of diaphragmatic breathing&#xD;
      assist device, the program extensions to the two-factor analysis of variance (two-way ANOVA)&#xD;
      as the results of verification. The study results can provide a reference for clinicians,&#xD;
      thereby improving the prognosis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease people.&#xD;
