  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optical guidance for percutaneous tracheotomy in intensive care is usually performed by&#xD;
      bronchoscopy. Recently, an endotracheal tube with a camera mounted at its tip (VivaSight-SL)&#xD;
      has been introduced that allows for endotracheal visualization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For feasibility evaluation, ten patients in intensive care receive percutaneous tracheotomy&#xD;
      with optical guidance by the VivaSight-SL tube. If this part is completed with satisfactory&#xD;
      results, patients are randomized to receive optical guidance by bronchoscopy or by&#xD;
      VivaSight-SL tube. The primary end point is the visualization through the tube camera of&#xD;
      endotracheal landmark structures for tracheotomy and visualization of the needle insertion&#xD;
      (according to score, see detailed description).&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term ventilated critically ill patients often receive a tracheotomy to facilitate&#xD;
      weaning from the ventilator and for prevention of secondary complications by the endotracheal&#xD;
      tube [1]. Besides surgical tracheotomy in which a muco-cutaneous fistula is prepared between&#xD;
      trachea and outer skin, percutaneous tracheotomy (PDT) has been introduced, in which a&#xD;
      cannula is being inserted into the trachea. After introduction of a guidewire, the trachea is&#xD;
      then dilated [2]. This intervention should be led by optical guidance, i. e. to verify the&#xD;
      correct point of tracheal cannulation between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage and to&#xD;
      minimize the risk for accidental injury to the membranous part of the trachea [3]. Usually,&#xD;
      optical guidance is performed by bronchoscopy [4]. During bronchoscopy in ventilated&#xD;
      patients, a drop in minute ventilation or an increase of carbon dioxide partial pressure with&#xD;
      a consecutive respiratory acidosis may occur. Recently, an endotracheal tube with an&#xD;
      integrated camera at its tip has been introduced that permits a continuous visualization of&#xD;
      the trachea on a monitor connected to the camera (VivaSightTM-SL, ETView Ltd., Misgav,&#xD;
      Israel) [5]. This tube has been CE and FDA certified (http://www.etview.com/products/&#xD;
      vivasight-sl).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, it is being evaluated whether the optical guidance during PDT can be performed&#xD;
      by the VivaSightTM-SL tube. Without the need for bronchoscopy during intervention, patients'&#xD;
      ventilation during the procedure may be optimized with a lesser increase of the arterial and&#xD;
      the end-expiratory carbon dioxide partial pressures. Furthermore, the procedure itself would&#xD;
      be simpler without the need for a bronchoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the investigators' institution, the VivaSightTM-SL tube has already been used in two&#xD;
      patients together with bronchoscopic guidance for percutaneous tracheotomy. According to the&#xD;
      investigators' experience, it seems to be possible to perform the procedure without a&#xD;
      bronchoscopy. Therefore, the feasibility of PDT with guidance by the VivaSightTM-SL tube&#xD;
      alone without bronchoscopy is tested. After a positive result in the first part of this&#xD;
      study, non-inferiority of the VivaSightTM-SL tube in comparison to bronchoscopy is tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of Study / No. of Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      part 1: observational study, 10 consecutive patients part 2: randomized, prospective study,&#xD;
      46 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a sample size of 46 (randomized 1:1 in 2 groups of 23 each) a difference of 35% on a&#xD;
      visualization score [6] may be seen with an α-error of 0,05 and a β-error of 1-0,8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  screening of for study inclusion according to inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  changing of the endotracheal tube to the VivaSightTM-SL tube&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  percutaneous tracheotomy with Ciaglia Blue Rhino technique [2, 7, 8]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  arterial blood gas sampling (BGA): baseline value from patients' records, prior to skin&#xD;
           incision, immediately after insertion of tracheal tube&#xD;
&#xD;
      study inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients being treated in the Dept. of Intensive Care Medicine receiving percutaneous&#xD;
      tracheotomy due to long term ventilation are screened according to inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of study-procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intubation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Intubation with the VivaSightTM-SL endotracheal tube does not differ from an intubation&#xD;
      with a conventional tube that is done with respect to the standard operating procedure (SOP)&#xD;
      of the Dept. for Intensive Care Medicine. During the intubation, vital parameters are&#xD;
      monitored with respect to the underlying disease and patients' therapy is continuously&#xD;
      adjusted. According to the SOP, two physicians are present of which at least one is a fellow&#xD;
      or an attending physician with experience in intensive care medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      bronchoscopy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bronchoscopy for percutaneous tracheotomy is done according to the SOP of the Dept. for&#xD;
      Intensive Care Medicine. Furthermore, during this study the bronchoscopy is done by a&#xD;
      physician with an experience of more that 200 bronchoscopies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      percutaneous tracheotomy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tracheotomy is performed according to the Ciaglia Blue Rhino method [2, 7, 8] (Ciaglia&#xD;
      Blue Rhino® G2, Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, USA). After skin incision and an optional&#xD;
      blunt dissection of the subcutaneous tissue, the trachea is cannulated between the 2nd and&#xD;
      3rd tracheal cartilage. Visualization is provided by either the VivaSightTM-SL tube or by&#xD;
      conventional bronchoscopy. Should visualization be insufficient (one item of score ≥ 3, see&#xD;
      below), a bronchoscope is available as a back-up. The tracheotomy is performed by an&#xD;
      experienced fellow or attending physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      rating of visualization of tracheal structures and ventilation during percutaneous&#xD;
      dilatational tracheostomy (mod. after [6]):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rating (each item 1 to 4 points)&#xD;

      circumference; 3 Only small parts of trachea; 4 No vision on tracheal structures&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) Monitoring puncture: midline + level below 1st or 2nd tracheal cartilage&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 Reliable identification; 2 Midline sure Level uncertain, but below the 1st tracheal&#xD;
      cartilage; 3 Level of puncture uncertain; 4 No vision on tracheal structures&#xD;
&#xD;

      identification; 2 P.m. only; 3 Only small parts of trachea visible, no control of P.m.; 4 No&#xD;
      vision on tracheal structures&#xD;
&#xD;
      E) Quality of Ventilation Before puncture and worst ventilation during PDT, respectively&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 Minute ventilation (MV) as before starting tracheotomy; 2 MV &lt; 2 L/min or oxygen saturation&#xD;
      (SO2) 80-90% (&gt;2minutes); 3 MV &lt; 0,5l /min or SO2 70 - 79% (&gt; 2 minutes); 4 MV = 0 or SO2 &lt;&#xD;
      70% (&gt; 2 minutes)&#xD;
