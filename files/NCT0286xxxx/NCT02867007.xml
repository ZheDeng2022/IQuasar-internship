      The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, and determine the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the highest protocol-defined dose, in the absence of&#xD;
      exceeding the MTD, of KHK2455 administered orally in combination with mogamulizumab to&#xD;
      subjects with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;

      The study is designed as a 2-part, multicenter, open-label, Phase 1, dose-escalation,&#xD;
      cohort-expansion study of KHK2455 as a monotherapy run-in (Cycle 0) followed by combination&#xD;
      therapy with the anti-CCR4 antibody mogamulizumab (Cycle 1 and beyond).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 will identify the MTD or the highest protocol-defined dose, in the absence of&#xD;
      exceeding the MTD, for the KHK2455 monotherapy run-in and for the combination regimen&#xD;
      (KHK2455 monotherapy [Cycle 0] followed by KHK2455 + mogamulizumab combination [Cycle 1]).&#xD;
      The dose escalation phase (Part 1) will enroll up to approximately 36 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2, the cohort-expansion phase, will further explore the safety, tolerability, PK, PD,&#xD;
      pharmacogenomics (PGx), and preliminary anti-tumor activity of KHK2455 administered as&#xD;
      monotherapy and in combination with mogamulizumab in subjects with one cohort-specific tumor&#xD;
      type. In Part 2, approximately 15 subjects with a selected tumor type will be enrolled and&#xD;
      treated with the recommended KHK2455 dose established in Part 1 in combination with&#xD;
      mogamulizumab.&#xD;
