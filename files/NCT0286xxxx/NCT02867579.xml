  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Described in the 1970's, pregnancy denial occurs as the un-consciousness of being pregnant&#xD;
      for several months or throughout the entire period. Body transformations are most of the time&#xD;
      not clearly noticeable. The prevalence of this symptom could represent 2 or 3 births over&#xD;
      1000. The definition of pregnancy denial remains unclear due to the different nosological&#xD;
      classifications used. There is no international consensus. Encountered terminologies are&#xD;
      different from on author to another: pregnancy denial, pregnancy negation. The difficulties&#xD;
      to define properly pregnancy denial accurately reflect the clinic heterogeneity of our&#xD;
      patients when practicing on a daily basis. As a result, it is difficult to find predictive&#xD;
      factors: any women of childbearing age, regardless her age, parity or social professional&#xD;
      category, can be subjected to pregnancy denial. Several publications report observations of&#xD;
      case of denial of pregnancy, few retrospective studies were realized, only two studies were&#xD;
      interested in the future of the child, and no prospective study was interested in the future&#xD;
      of the relation mother - child. The denial of pregnancy questions the maternal psychic&#xD;
      functioning. No link between psychiatric disorder and denial of pregnancy was until then&#xD;
      established. Our various clinical meetings, with mothers having presented a denial of&#xD;
      pregnancy and reporting a difficult personal history with many breaks and events susceptibly&#xD;
      traumatic, brought us to emit the following hypothesis: an insecure attachment of the mother&#xD;
      would participate or at least would facilitate in the construction of a denial of pregnancy.&#xD;
      These mothers would have a difficult access, even impossible for the infantile experiences,&#xD;
      the essential experiences in the psychic reorganizations of the pregnancy that prepare the&#xD;
      woman to accept her new functions of mother. The investigators hypothesize that the&#xD;
      attachment and the development of the child, as well as interactions mothers-babies are&#xD;
      disturbed when the woman presents a denial of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will compare the maternal functioning in both constituted groups (group denial&#xD;
      of pregnancy versus groups control), by estimating the type of maternal attachment, without&#xD;
      omitting to look for a possible psychiatric pathology, and a personality problem at the&#xD;
      mother.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the questioning on the psychodynamic considerations of the denial of pregnancy, and also&#xD;
      on the future of the dyade mother-baby, the investigators construct a national program of&#xD;
      clinical research called &quot;Attachment and pregnancy denial&quot;, with the participation of 13&#xD;
      centers in France. This research is a prospective cohort examination with main objectives:&#xD;
      study the impact of the denial of pregnancy on the pattern of attachment of the child, on the&#xD;
      interactions of dyads mother-child and on the early development of the child with a 20-month&#xD;
      follow-up. It's a multicenter case-control study with 13 centers (Reims, Strasbourg,&#xD;
      Besançon, Nancy, Toulouse, Amiens, Troyes, Toulon, Limoges, Ile-de-France, Lille, Bordeaux,&#xD;
      Paris 18ème), to find the maternal risks factors associated to pregnancy denial (secondary&#xD;
      objectives).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of this study are: (i) studying the relationship between pregnancy denial&#xD;
      and the attachment pattern of the child; (ii) studying the relationship between pregnancy&#xD;
      denial and the early interactions of mother-infant dyads; (iii) studying the relationship&#xD;
      between pregnancy denial and the early development of the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are: (i) studying the relationship between the&#xD;
      duration period from the pregnancy announcement to the delivery and the early development of&#xD;
      a child, including the attachment pattern of a child, the early interactions of mother-infant&#xD;
      dyads, (ii) looking for the risk factors associated to pregnancy denial, including the type&#xD;
      of attachment, the existence of a personality disorders and/or a psychiatric pathology&#xD;

      The follow-up of the cases and the witnesses will be identically and carried out according to&#xD;
      the following process: First visit (post-delivery, at the maternity): reception of the&#xD;
      informed consent, collection of demographic data (age, marital status, level of education,&#xD;
      financial resources), social data (life form, socio-economic data of the child father,&#xD;
      developmental data of the child siblings) and medical records (gestation and parity,&#xD;
      pregnancy records, medical surgical and psychiatric history). During the first examination:&#xD;
      evaluation by perceived social support self-questionnaire (QSSP) and MNI (Psychiatric&#xD;
      disorders Axis I). Second visit (during the mandatory post-natal consultation, 6 to 8 weeks&#xD;
      after delivery): Evaluation by self-questionnaires of depression (BDI and EPDS), maternal&#xD;
      anxiety (STAI), and personality disorders (screening IPDE) and evaluation of maternal&#xD;
      attachment pattern (AAN). Third visit (when the child is 6 months old, at the mother's home):&#xD;
      video recording to evaluate the interactions during a meal (CIB), self-questionnaires of the&#xD;
      child temperament (QT6) and maternal depression (EPDS), evaluation of the child development&#xD;
      (Denver scale), evaluation of a relational retreat behaviour of the child (ADBB),&#xD;
      semi-structured interview for the personality disorders (IPDE). Fourth visit (when the child&#xD;
      is 12 months old, at the mother's home): maternal self-questionnaires (BDI, STAI, QSSP,&#xD;
      EPDS), video recording to evaluate the interactions during a meal (CIB), evaluation of the&#xD;
      child development (Denver scale), evaluation of a relational retreat behaviour of the child&#xD;
      (ADBB). Fifth visit (when the child is 18 months old, in a room equipped with video&#xD;
      recording): evaluation of the child quality attachment (&quot;Strange situation&quot;), evaluation of&#xD;
      the child development (Denver scale). Sixth visit (when the child is 20 months old, at the&#xD;
      mother home): open conversation with the mother.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of participation of a patient is of 20 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will be analysed in this study, the impact of pregnancy denial as well as the duration period&#xD;
      from the pregnancy announcement to the delivery on: (i) The attachment pattern of the child,&#xD;
      evaluated by the &quot;Strange Situation&quot;. A mother and a child are under observation in a&#xD;
      laboratory. The observer notes the child reactions during 8 episodes of 3 minutes involving&#xD;
      the separations and reunions between the mother and the child, as well as the introduction of&#xD;
      a stranger. The situation is observed behind a two-way mirror and recorded in video. This&#xD;
      procedure of evaluation of the attachment was organized according to the Mary Ainsworth's&#xD;
      works. The coding system of interactive behaviours allows a categorization into 4 attachment&#xD;
      patterns: &quot;secure&quot;, &quot;anxious-avoidant insecure&quot; &quot;anxious-ambivalent resistant insecure&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;disorganized/disoriented and insecure&quot; (Regrouped into two categories: &quot;Secure&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;Insecure&quot;). (ii) The quality of early interactions between the mother and the child&#xD;
      evaluated by the Coding Interactive Behaviour (CIB - Feldman) (10), the CIB includes 42 items&#xD;
      (21 concerning the mother, 16 concerning the child and 5 concerning the dyad). Each item is&#xD;
      evaluated on a 5 points scale. The scale consists of 2 segmentations of 15 minutes&#xD;
      interactions: one episode of game and one episode of feeding. (iii) The infant's temperament&#xD;
      characteristics evaluated by the QT6 (Infant Characteristics Questionnaire, Bates), specific&#xD;
      questions will be asked to parents about the &quot;difficult&quot; temperament of the child. The&#xD;
      filling lasts approximately 10 minutes, the questionnaire account 26 questions. It was&#xD;
      validated in France with 794 mothers of old children from 6 to 9 months, by the team of the&#xD;
      Dr B. Larroque. (iiii) The child's development evaluated by the Denver scale (DSST - Denver&#xD;
      Developmental Screening Test), the child is accessed in different areas such as gross motor&#xD;
      skills, language, fine motor skills, and social contact, and by the ADBB scale. This scale&#xD;
      includes 8 items concerning facial expression, eye contact, body activity, self-simulation&#xD;
      gestures and fingers activities, level of vocal expression, liveliness of a response to&#xD;
      stimulation, ability to connect with someone else and attractiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research for factors potentially associated to the occurrence of a denial of pregnancy: (i)&#xD;
      Pattern of mother's attachment evaluated by the AAN (Adult Attachment Narratives), it allows&#xD;
      studying the representations of the attachment at the adult through the analysis of 4&#xD;
      narratives (2 referring in the relations over adults, and 2 in the relations mother - child)&#xD;
      built by the subject. He is asked to use 12 words by narrative presented in writing by the&#xD;
      examiner (these words establishing the weft of the history). These narratives are blind&#xD;
      recorded and analyzed by professionals trained and validated in the scale, every narrative&#xD;
      receives a note of 1 in 7 reflecting the secure base of the script in connection with the&#xD;
      pattern of attachment of the subject. The average obtained in these 4 narratives estimates&#xD;
      the security of attachment of the subject and allows the categorization in 2 groups notes =&#xD;
      3: pattern of attachment insecure, notes &gt; 3 pattern of attachment secure). The interview&#xD;
      lasts approximately 1/2 the hour. The entire interview is transcribed verbatim to allow the&#xD;
      quotation. (ii) Mother's personality evaluated with the IPDE (International Personality&#xD;
      Disorders Examination) is a semi-structured diagnosis interview allowing the evaluation of&#xD;
      personality disorders described in the CIM 10. It contains 67 items. The criteria of&#xD;
      personality are grouped in six domains: work, personal, interpersonal relations, affects,&#xD;
      apprehension of the reality and the control of the impulses. The administration of the&#xD;
      instrument varies between 60 and 90 minutes. (iii) Mother's psychiatric trouble assesses with&#xD;
      the MINI (Mini International Neurospychiatric Interview) is a structured diagnostic&#xD;
      maintenance, exploring the main psychiatric disorders of the axis I of the CIM 10. It&#xD;
      contains 120 questions and is divided into 16 modules, each corresponding in a diagnosis&#xD;
      category: A. Major depressive disorder, B. Dysthymia, C. Suicidal risk, D. Mania (hypomania)&#xD;
      episode, E. Panic disorder, F. Agoraphobia, G. Social phobia, F. Obsessive-compulsive&#xD;
      disorder, I. Post-traumatic stress disorder, J. Alcohol (dependence / abuse), K. Drugs&#xD;
      (dependence / abuse), L. Psychotic disorders, M. Anorexia nervosa, N. Bulimia nervosa, O.&#xD;
      Generalized anxiety disorder, and P. Antisocial personality Disorder. For each of the&#xD;
      disorders(confusions), two in four questions-filters are presented at the beginning of every&#xD;
      module, allowing the screening. The signing of the MINI is brief, on average 19 minutes. The&#xD;
      MINI was simultaneously developed in French and in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To neutralize the identified biases, we also assess maternal comorbidities: (i) Postnatal&#xD;
      depression screened with the EPDS (Edinburgh Post-natal Depression Scale), a&#xD;
      self-questionnaire of screening of the postnatal depression. EPDS is a quick&#xD;
      self-questionnaire used in Anglo-Saxon countries since its elaboration by John Cox in 1987,&#xD;
      validated by a number of studies, translated and validated for France by Nicole Guedeney in&#xD;
      1995. The formulation is simple and its easy use. We consider a known postnatal depression&#xD;
      when the score is upper or equal to 11. (ii) Maternal anxiety evaluated with the scale STAI&#xD;
      (Trait Anxiety Inventory) form Y, Trait Anxiety Inventory of Spielberger. The inventory of&#xD;
      trait anxiety is intended to estimate on one hand the trait anxiety and on the other hand the&#xD;
      state anxiety through 20 items, which concern only the psychological and not somatic aspects&#xD;
      of the anxiety. The Y version was developed to eliminate items more bound to the depression.&#xD;
      &quot;State Trait Inventory Anxiety&quot; is both very used in the practice and in the clinical&#xD;
      research. It includes different scales to estimate the state (STAI form Y-A) and the trait&#xD;
      (STAI form Y-B). Each scale includes 20 proposals, the scale E to estimate what the subjects&#xD;
      feel at the moment, the scale T to seize what the subjects feel generally. The STAI is&#xD;
      intended for the auto-administration. He can be individually performed or in a group. The&#xD;
      time of signing is about 10 minutes to fill in both scales. Every answer to a proposal of the&#xD;
      questionnaire corresponds to a score from 1 to 4: - 1 indicating the lowest degree of&#xD;
      anxiety, - 4 the strongest degree. French translation and validation by Scweitzer MB. (iii)&#xD;
      Maternal depression evaluated with the scale BDI (Beck Depression Inventory), it gives a&#xD;
      quantitative estimation of the intensity of the depressive feelings. It includes 21 items of&#xD;
      symptoms and attitudes, which describe a specific behavior of the depression, increased from&#xD;
      0 to 3 by a series of 4 statements reflecting the severity degree of the symptom. Scale&#xD;
      translated and validated in French by P. Bourque and D. Beaudette, on 1982. (iiii) Maternal&#xD;
      social support estimated by the Perceived Social Support Questionnaire (QSSP), a&#xD;
      self-assessment that estimates the availability and the satisfaction with the social support&#xD;
      received. The authors were inspired by the theory of the attachment of Bowlby, by associating&#xD;
      the notion of social support with fundamental needs: need for proximity with the mother, then&#xD;
      need for a relation favoured with others significant. Thus this scale allows estimating the&#xD;
      type of received support, the sources of this support, number of people who get it (or&#xD;
      availability) and the perceived quality (or satisfaction). This tool also informs about the&#xD;
      nature of the social support perceived by the person. Translated in French by&#xD;
