    <textblock>
      Severe and un-stopped blood loss can occur for a number of different reasons including after&#xD;
      a serious injury, delivery of a baby and following other medical and surgical emergencies.&#xD;
      The investigators understanding of how to best treat people with serious bleeding is still&#xD;
      incomplete, with many questions remaining. These include questions regarding how many people&#xD;
      have serious bleeding events, what happens to them and the best way to treat them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Massive Transfusion Registry (MTR) is a register of patients who have experienced major&#xD;
      blood loss that required a massive transfusion in any clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MTR uses electronic data extraction and data linkage methodologies. Pre-existing clinical&#xD;
      data from hospital data sources, including Laboratory Information Systems (for transfusion&#xD;
      history and laboratory results) and Health Information Services databases (for Patient&#xD;
      demographics and admission data), are electronically extracted by staff employed at the&#xD;
      participating hospitals. The data is then sent to the MTR Research Team, located at Monash&#xD;
      University, where it is then linked, analysed and stored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The establishment of a Massive Transfusion Registry will be a unique and important resource&#xD;
      for clinicians in Australia, New Zealand and internationally, for Blood Services and for the&#xD;
      broader community. It will provide valuable observational data regarding the types and&#xD;
      frequency of conditions associated with critical bleeding requiring massive transfusion, the&#xD;
      use of blood component therapy (i.e. ratios and quantities of different types of red cell to&#xD;
      non- red cell components) and patient outcomes.&#xD;

      The Australian and New Zealand Massive Transfusion Registry (ANZ-MTR) Clinical Dataset brings&#xD;
      together data from multiple sources and analyses and reports contemporary information on&#xD;
      transfusion practice and patient outcomes following critical bleeding (CB) and massive&#xD;
      transfusion (MT) in all clinical settings, including surgery, trauma, obstetrics and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal bleeding. Data on more than 6,000 patients from 25 participating sites have&#xD;
      already been collected, analysed and results shared with participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ANZ-MTR is a unique resource. Recognising the valuable dataset available for transfusion&#xD;
      policy and practice improvement, the ANZ-MTR is now transitioning from primarily a research&#xD;
      tool to a sustainable operational model to align with Australia's national safety and quality&#xD;
      framework, whilst still allowing research opportunities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANZ-MTR data are already linked with the Australian and New Zealand National Death Indexes&#xD;
      and the ANZ-MTR team is engaged with establishing linkages with other registries (e.g.&#xD;
      intensive care, cardiothoracic surgery, trauma, maternity outcomes and others). This will&#xD;
      provide expanded data for more sensitive outcome measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ANZ-MTR uses electronic data extraction and data linkage methodologies. Clinical data&#xD;
      from hospital data sources, including Laboratory Information Systems (for transfusion history&#xD;
      and laboratory results) and Health Information Services databases (for patient demographics&#xD;
      and admission data), are electronically extracted by the participating hospitals. The data&#xD;
      are then sent to the ANZ-MTR, located at Monash University, where the data from the separate&#xD;
      information systems are linked to enable detailed analyses that otherwise would not be easily&#xD;
      possible. Monash University's Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, where the&#xD;
      ANZ-MTR is located, has internationally recognised expertise in the management and&#xD;
      statistical analyses of large, complex electronic datasets.&#xD;
