    <textblock>
      This study has two portions. The main goal of the Phase I portion of this research study is&#xD;
      to see what doses of CB-839 and capecitabine can safely be given to patients without having&#xD;
      too many side effects. Other purposes of this research study will be to determine what side&#xD;
      effects are seen with this combination of medicines. The Phase II portion of the study will&#xD;
      test how many patients show shrinkage in their tumor with this combination of medicines and&#xD;
      what changes occur inside the cancer cells and blood cells after treatment.&#xD;

      Phase I Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the safety, tolerability and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of combination&#xD;
      CB-839 and capecitabine chemotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors for whom there&#xD;
      are no remaining treatment options or for whom single agent capecitabine is an acceptable&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the disease control rate of combination CB-839 and capecitabine chemotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic PIK3CA mutant colorectal cancers who are refractory to&#xD;
      fluoropyrimidine based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the dose-limiting toxicities and maximum tolerated dose of combination therapy&#xD;
      with CB-839 and capecitabine in patients with advanced solid tumors for whom there are no&#xD;
      remaining treatment options or for whom single agent capecitabine is an acceptable therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the disease control rate as assessed by RECIST criteria of combination therapy&#xD;
      with CB-839 and capecitabine in patients with advanced solid tumors for whom there are no&#xD;
      remaining treatment options or for whom single agent capecitabine is an acceptable therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the progression free survival following treatment with CB-839 and capecitabine&#xD;
      chemotherapy in patients with metastatic PIK3CA mutant colorectal cancer and are refractory&#xD;
      to fluoropyrimidine therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the overall survival following treatment with CB-839 and capecitabine&#xD;
      chemotherapy in patients who have metastatic PIK3CA mutant colorectal cancer and are&#xD;
      refractory to fluoropyrimidine therapy.&#xD;

    <description>The Phase I study has been designed to define the recommended phase II dose of CB-839 and capecitabine. A traditional 3+3 dose escalation design will be adopted. Nine to twenty-four patients are expected to be enrolled, depending on the number of dose escalations and assuming that a total of 6 patients will be treated at the final recommended phase II dose level. Patients who complete the first 21 day treatment cycle of CB-839 and capecitabine chemotherapy will be included in the analysis.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>PHASE 2: Number of patients with response to treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 18 months after beginning treatment</time_frame>
    <description>In the phase II component of this study, the primary endpoint is response rate. Disease control rate will be determined using RECIST criteria.&#xD;
RECIST response categories: Progressive disease (PD): &gt;=20% increase in sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesion(s), taking as reference smallest sum LD recorded since treatment started. Complete response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response (PR): &gt;=30% decrease in sum of LD of target lesion(s), taking as reference baseline sum LD. Stable disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify as PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as PD.</description>

In the phase I portion of the study, patients will receive escalating doses of CB-839 and capecitabine and will have day 15 blood samples drawn and archived for as needed assessment of CB-839 pharmacokinetics. In the phase II portion of the study, patients will receiving 800mg CB-839 and 1000mg/m^2 capecitabine as were determined to be safe doses during the phase I portion of the study. They will also undergo pre-treatment and post-treatment blood samples and tissue biopsies for evaluation of pharmacodynamic biomarkers.</description>

                  with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
