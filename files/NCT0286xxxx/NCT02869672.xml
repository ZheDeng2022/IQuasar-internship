    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety and immunogenicity of the ACYW135 Meningococcal&#xD;
      Polysaccharide Vaccine in population aged 2-50 years old. Subjects will be divided into 3&#xD;
      group according to their age, receiving the test vaccine and the control vaccine at the&#xD;
      proportion of 1:1 randomly. Each age group has 400 subjects, 1200 in total.&#xD;
