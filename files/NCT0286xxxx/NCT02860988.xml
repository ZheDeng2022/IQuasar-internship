  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine differences among incarcerated or recently&#xD;
      incarcerated fathers who receive targeted services and those who do not.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with a criminal justice background (either incarcerated or on community&#xD;
      supervision) and substance use issues will have the opportunity to enroll in services&#xD;
      provided by the Mountain Comprehensive Care Center to focus on enhancing fatherhood and&#xD;
      family situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary research questions focus on gauging the intervention's effectiveness in improving&#xD;
      healthy relationship and responsible fatherhood outcomes. The intervention has several&#xD;
      components targeting parenting skills, job training, relationship education, and case&#xD;
      management/reentry support. Primary research questions include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compared to the counterfactual condition, what is the impact of the intervention on&#xD;
           parenting and co-parenting skills/behaviors, as measured by parental role satisfaction&#xD;
           and confidence in parenting skills six months after release from incarceration?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compared to the counterfactual condition, what is the impact of the intervention on the&#xD;
           likelihood that the participant will be employed six months after release from&#xD;
           incarceration?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compared to the counterfactual condition, what is the impact of the intervention on the&#xD;
           likelihood that the participant will be in a relationship six months after release from&#xD;
           incarceration?&#xD;
