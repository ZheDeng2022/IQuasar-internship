  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Basic and clinical research is revealing that various noncoding and small RNAs play important&#xD;
      and diverse roles in germ cell development and quality, including X/Y silencing during&#xD;
      meiosis, gene regulation, DNA damage responses, and protection of the genome against&#xD;
      transposable elements. Indeed, mammalian germ cells are known to harbor multiple small RNA&#xD;
      species, including small interfering RNAs (siRNA), microRNAs (miRNA), and germline- specific&#xD;
      PIWI- interacting RNAs (piRNA). However, their mechanistic roles in gametogenesis and human&#xD;
      infertility are largely uncharacterized. The goal of this study is to elucidate the role of&#xD;
      small RNA pathways in the events that give rise to viable euploid gametes. Four projects and&#xD;
      three cores are included in this study.&#xD;

      Project 2 (PI: Dr. Darius Paduch): Role of Small RNAs in male infertility. The leading&#xD;
      hypothesis of this project is based on extensive preliminary results obtained by this group&#xD;
      showing that 70% of miRNA expressed from human testis are highly conserved in humans and&#xD;
      rodents. The investigators hypothesize that differentially expressed miRNAs in men with&#xD;
      infertility lead to changes in levels of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) involved in key&#xD;
      regulatory pathways in cell biology. The results of this project will lead to better&#xD;
      understanding of miRNAs' role in male reproduction and have strong potential to enable the&#xD;
      development of new miRNA-based or miRNA-regulating therapies. This project will help to&#xD;
      develop new transgenic animals to study miRNA in vivo with implications not only for&#xD;
      infertility, but also biology of testicular cancer. Derived RNA based therapies have the&#xD;
      potential to be less invasive, less toxic, and more effective in treating these serious and&#xD;
      increasingly prevalent conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Core A (PI: Dr. Paula E. Cohen): Administration Core. The main objective of the&#xD;
      Administrative Core (Core A) is to provide a structure and support mechanism to the entire&#xD;
      Center for Reproductive Genomics (CRG). The Admin core will facilitate interactions across&#xD;
      the Ithaca and Manhattan campuses of Cornell University, will encourage research in small RNA&#xD;
      biology, both in reproductive medicine and across clinical disciplines, and will promote&#xD;
      strong training in reproductive medicine that encourages a translational focus. In general,&#xD;
      the Admin core will focus efforts on three major philosophies: translational and innovative&#xD;
      research, teaching, and outreach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Core B (PI: Dr. Andrew Grimson): RNA Sequencing Core. The main objective of the RNA&#xD;
      Sequencing Core (RSC) is to provide users with efficient and high quality access to&#xD;
      cutting-edge sequencing technologies. These sequencing technologies will be used by all&#xD;
      members of this P50-proposal, and made available to other P50-centers. Importantly, all&#xD;
      members of this P50 are relying on access to these technologies to achieve their project&#xD;
      goals. By centralizing sequencing at the RSC, sequencing will be performed at a lower cost&#xD;
      and with greater efficiency that would be possible for individual users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Core C (PI: Dr. Peter Schlegel): Outreach Core The goals of this outreach core are two-fold:&#xD;
      (1) to provide a scientific and technical resource for clinicians interested in embarking on&#xD;
      research involving small RNA biology in their physiological system of interest, and (2) to&#xD;
      provide outreach to the community by means of a state- of-the-art lecture series. The&#xD;
      Innovation Seminars in Reproductive Technologies Series (InSeRT), in order to educate&#xD;
      patients about the latest advances in our understanding of the genetic and epigenetic basis&#xD;
      for human disease.&#xD;
