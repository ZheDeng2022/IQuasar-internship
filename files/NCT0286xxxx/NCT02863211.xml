      Efforts to identify individuals at a higher risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes focus on&#xD;
      traditional risk factors, such as age, gender, smoking status, blood pressure, and&#xD;
      cholesterol; however, this approach does not directly assess cardiovascular function and&#xD;
      underestimates the risk of experiencing adverse cardiovascular outcomes in women. This&#xD;
      prospective, observational trial will examine the ability of the Assessment of Large and&#xD;
      Small Artery Elasticity for the Early Detection of Cardiovascular Disease screening protocol,&#xD;
      a series of non-invasive procedures to identify middle-aged and older women who are at&#xD;
      elevated risk for experiencing an adverse cardiovascular event in the five-year period after&#xD;
      screening. The predictive value of the Assessment of Large and Small Artery Elasticity for&#xD;
      the Early Detection of Cardiovascular Disease protocol will also be compared to the&#xD;
      Framingham Risk Score to determine if one method has better sensitivity for estimating risk&#xD;
      for an adverse cardiovascular outcome.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Every seven minutes in Canada, there is a death due to heart disease or stroke. Up to 80% of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) could be prevented by identifying and controlling for biological&#xD;
      risk factors such as hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes, and behavioral risk&#xD;
      factors such as physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, and smoking. Efforts to identify&#xD;
      individuals at a higher risk for adverse cardiovascular events, such as the Framingham&#xD;
      Disease Risk (FDR) score, focus on traditional risk factors, such as age, gender, smoking&#xD;
      status, blood pressure, and cholesterol. While this approach does estimate 10-year risk for&#xD;
      heart attacks,3 it remains suboptimal as it does not assess how well each individual's&#xD;
      cardiovascular system is functioning. In fact, a previous study suggests that more than 80%&#xD;
      of females evaluated with the FDR were identified as being at low risk, or not qualifying for&#xD;
      medications known to lower cardiovascular risk before experiencing a myocardial infarction.&#xD;
      Therefore, these data warrant the use of cardiovascular screening approaches that are more&#xD;
      accurate in identifying the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a common perception that CVD is a 'man's disease'; however, women tend to develop&#xD;
      heart disease approximately 10-15 years later than men, with a prevalence rate similar&#xD;
      between sexes after ≥ 60 years of age. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in women&#xD;
      worldwide. Women are often under-represented in cardiovascular clinical trials, which is an&#xD;
      issue because their clinical presentation and prognosis of cardiovascular disease differs&#xD;
      from that of men. In fact, women who suffer an acute MI are more likely to die, have an&#xD;
      increased risk of repeat MI, develop heart failure, or consequentially suffer sudden cardiac&#xD;
      death, as compared to men. Although improvements in CVD management have led to decreased&#xD;
      mortality rates, more women than men have died from causes related to CVD since 1980. It is&#xD;
      also important to highlight that traditional risk factors assessed by FDR score underestimate&#xD;
      the risk of experiencing an adverse cardiovascular event in women, as compared to men. Thus,&#xD;
      it appears that there is a need to develop innovative screening tools to better detect early&#xD;
      stages of CVD risk amongst women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Assessment of Large and Small Artery Elasticity for the Early Detection of Cardiovascular&#xD;
      Disease trial is a screening program designed to screen for cardiovascular risk in women. It&#xD;
      was adapted from the 4-Test Rasmussen cardiovascular screening program, which was developed&#xD;
      by Dr. Jay Cohn at the Center for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention, University of Minnesota.&#xD;
      The 4-test screening approach utilizes non-invasive procedures to measure structural and&#xD;
      functional changes in the large and small arteries, including elasticity of artery walls and&#xD;
      blood pressure at rest and in response to 3-min of moderate intensity exercise. Tests are&#xD;
      scored from 0-2 (0 = normal; 1 = borderline; 2 = abnormal) with a total RDS ranging from 0-8.&#xD;
      Each participant is categorized based on risk (i.e. 0-2 = normal; 3-8 = abnormal). These&#xD;
      simple, non-invasive procedures aim to detect early stages of CVD for individual asymptomatic&#xD;
      patients. However, these tests are not yet available in the primary care setting and have not&#xD;
      been used in a Canadian clinical context. Moreover, it is not known if this screening&#xD;
      approach and other protocols are feasible and have sufficient predictive value within the&#xD;
      context of the Canadian health care system, where health services in Canada are generally&#xD;
      delivered by the private sector but funded by payments from provincial health insurance. The&#xD;
      more comprehensive 10-test Rasmussen Disease Score (RDS), which uses, in addition to the&#xD;
      4-test approach, optic fundus imaging, a resting electrocardiogram, an ultrasound of the left&#xD;
      ventricle and abdominal aorta, microalbumin, and brain natriuretic peptide, is better than&#xD;
      the FDR at identifying individuals at risk for experiencing adverse cardiovascular events&#xD;
      within 3-5 years.10 However, it is unknown whether the 4-test RDS (which will hereon in be&#xD;
      referred to the Assessment of Large and Small Artery Elasticity for the Early Detection of&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Disease protocol) is a better predictor of future cardiac events than the FDR&#xD;
      in women. It is also unknown if the Assessment of Large and Small Artery Elasticity for the&#xD;
      Early Detection of Cardiovascular Disease screening protocol can predict future adverse&#xD;
      cardiovascular events in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, observational study aims to: 1) determine if the Assessment of Large and&#xD;
      Small Artery Elasticity for the Early Detection of Cardiovascular Disease screening protocol&#xD;
      identifies middle-aged and older women who are at an elevated risk for experiencing adverse&#xD;
      cardiovascular outcomes within a five-year period after screening; and, 2) compare the&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity value of the Assessment of Large and Small Artery Elasticity for&#xD;
      the Early Detection of Cardiovascular Disease protocol and the FDR for predicting future&#xD;
      adverse cardiovascular outcomes in women. The investigators hypothesize that the Assessment&#xD;
      of Large and Small Artery Elasticity for the Early Detection of Cardiovascular Disease&#xD;
      protocol will provide better diagnostic accuracy in identifying middle-aged and older women&#xD;
      at an elevated risk for experiencing adverse cardiovascular outcomes in the five year period&#xD;
      post-screening, as compared to the FDR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Assessment of Large and Small Artery Elasticity for the Early Detection of Cardiovascular&#xD;
      Disease Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After patient enrollment and consent, the Assessment of Large and Small Artery Elasticity for&#xD;
      the Early Detection of Cardiovascular Disease protocol required participants to attend one&#xD;
      appointment, which was scheduled for approximately 90 minutes. The Assessment of Large and&#xD;
      Small Artery Elasticity for the Early Detection of Cardiovascular Disease protocol involves&#xD;
      four measurements, as follows: 1) resting blood pressure; 2) systolic blood pressure response&#xD;
      to 3-min of moderate intensity exercise; 3) large artery elasticity assessment; 4) small&#xD;
      artery elasticity assessment. For these measurements, the HD/PulseWave™ CR-2000 Research&#xD;
      CardioVascular Profiling System (CV profiler) was used. This device is indicated for use in&#xD;
      determining cardiovascular parameters in human subjects for research purposes only. Research&#xD;
      staff were trained in the use of the HD/PulseWave™ CR-2000 Research CardioVascular Profiling&#xD;
      System and performed all of the testing. Below each of the measures involved in the&#xD;
      Assessment of Large and Small Artery Elasticity for the Early Detection of Cardiovascular&#xD;
      Disease protocol are described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test 1: Resting blood pressure A blood pressure cuff attached to the CV profiler is placed on&#xD;
      the participant's arm while they are in a supine position. A resting blood pressure of less&#xD;
      than 120/80 mmHg is considered normal (0 RDS points), 120-139/80-89 is considered&#xD;
      pre-hypertensive (1 RDS point) with the potential for the development of high blood pressure&#xD;
      (hypertension). Blood pressure greater than 140/90 is considered abnormal for adults (2 RDS&#xD;
      points).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test 2: Systolic blood pressure response to exercise The magnitude of rise in blood pressure&#xD;
      during exercise may be an indication of early risk for developing hypertension, even if the&#xD;
      participant's resting blood pressure is normal. After the resting blood pressure is assessed,&#xD;
      the participant is asked to perform 3 minutes of moderate exercise on a 2-step stool&#xD;
      according to the Dundee Step Test, or on a treadmill for those who are unable to perform the&#xD;
      step test. Both of these exercise procedures are performed at a 5 metabolic equivalent (MET)&#xD;
      workload. The participant then has their blood pressure measured once again in a supine&#xD;
      position immediately following the exercise protocol. A rise in systolic blood pressure of&#xD;
      under 30 mmHg and less than 169 mmHg absolute blood pressure is considered normal (0 RDS&#xD;
      points), a rise of 30-39 mmHg and an absolute resting blood pressure of 170-179 is considered&#xD;
      borderline (1 RDS point), and a rise of 40 mmHg or more and an absolute resting blood&#xD;
      pressure of 180 mmHg or high is considered abnormal (2 RDS points).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test 3 and 4: Large and small artery elasticity To measure artery elasticity a wrist&#xD;
      stabilizer is placed on the participant's wrist while they are in a supine position. A&#xD;
      piezoelectric transducer, or pulse wave sensor, is then placed on the location of strongest&#xD;
      pulsation of the radial artery adjacent to the styloid process. The CV Profiler assesses the&#xD;
      diastolic decay and waveform transmitted to it through the sensor. Based on the modified&#xD;
      Windkessel model, the instrument can then determine small artery and large artery elasticity.&#xD;
      Measures from this instrument have been shown to be reproducible, with one studying finding&#xD;
      that intra-visit measurements five minutes apart only differed by 3% and inter-visit measures&#xD;
      one to four weeks later only differed by 4%. Scoring of normal, borderline and abnormal&#xD;
      results for large and small arterial elasticity are based on age and gender cutoffs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scoring the Assessment of Large and Small Artery Elasticity for the Early Detection of&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Disease protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of the tests in the 4-test RDS are scored as 0 for normal, 1 for borderline abnormal,&#xD;
      and 2 for abnormal10. Total scores range from 0 to 8 and are used to stratify individuals&#xD;
      into one of two risk groups: 0-2 = normal risk; ≥ 3 = moderate to high (abnormal) risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of the Framingham Risk Score:&#xD;
&#xD;
      FDR is determined based on the calculations described by D'Agostino et al. Information&#xD;
      required for this calculation is acquired from a participant questionnaire, fasting blood&#xD;
      sampling of high density lipoprotein and total cholesterol, and the resting blood pressure&#xD;
      reading from the CV Profiler. Participants are asked to fast for the 12 hours prior to the&#xD;
      blood draw at their appointment. Approximately 10 mL of blood is collected by a phlebotomist.&#xD;
      The samples are then centrifuged so that the plasma can be separated and analyzed for total&#xD;
      cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and fasting&#xD;
      glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A battery of additional validated cardiovascular related testing will be conducted in&#xD;
      addition to the previously mentioned tests. Exploratory statistical analyses will examine&#xD;
      different combinations of these test results combined with the resting blood pressure,&#xD;
      exercise blood pressure response and arterial elasticity results in an attempt to improve the&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of the Assessment of Large and Small Artery Elasticity for the&#xD;
      Early Detection of Cardiovascular Disease screening protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are instructed to fill out a series of questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. physical activity behaviour is assessed using the International Physical Activity&#xD;
           Questionnaire (IPAQ) short-version. This questionnaire measures the amount and intensity&#xD;
           of physical activity completed by an individual;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the Cardiovascular Health in Ambulatory Care Research Team (CANHEART) Health Index is&#xD;
           used to assess cardiovascular health behavior and disease risk based on physical&#xD;
           activity (from the IPAQ short-version), smoking status, fruit and vegetable consumption,&#xD;
           body mass index, as well as presence of diabetes and high blood pressure;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. stage of change for health behaviors and stages of change specifically related to&#xD;
           physical activity are assessed using the Transtheoretical Model of Change and the&#xD;
           Physical Activity Stages of Change questionnaires, respectively;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. quality of life is assessed using the EuroQol Five Dimension Five Level questionnaire;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. presence and severity of depressive symptoms are assessed using the Patient Health&#xD;
           Questionnaire-9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fried Frailty Phenotype A phenotype of frailty was assessed using the Modified Fried Criteria&#xD;
      as previously described by Fried et al. Briefly, the Fried score classifies participants as&#xD;
      frail if three or more of the following criteria are met: 1) unintentional weight loss; 2)&#xD;
      self-reported exhaustion; 3) weakness; 4) slow walking speed; 5) low physical activity.&#xD;
      Exhaustion is assessed by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies - Depression Scale. Physical&#xD;
      activity levels are assessed by the Paffenbarger Physical Activity Scale23. Unintentional&#xD;
      weight loss is determined via a questionnaire, while the weakness and slow walking speed are&#xD;
      assessed using a grip strength dynamometer and a five meter gait speed test, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6- Minute Walk Test Participants are instructed to walk as many lengths of a 30 meter track&#xD;
      as possible during the 6 minute duration. Distance covered during the test is recorded. A&#xD;
      study by Beatty et al. showed the prognostic value of the 6MWT for predicting cardiovascular&#xD;
      events in patients with stable coronary heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Cardiovascular Outcomes - 5-year follow-up Upon completion of the Assessment of Large&#xD;
      and Small Artery Elasticity for the Early Detection of Cardiovascular Disease Protocol, each&#xD;
      individual's Personal Health Information Number (PHIN) will be utilized to follow the study&#xD;
      participants and to determine if they experienced an adverse cardiovascular outcome, as&#xD;
      defined in Table 2, using the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy (MCHP) Population Health&#xD;
      Research Data Repository. This linkage will be done at Manitoba Health, which will provide&#xD;
      MCHP with the correct scrambled identifiers needed to follow-up all participants. MCHP data&#xD;
      will be accessed through a number of different databases. Hospital separations abstracts,&#xD;
      medical claims and the Drug Program Information Network will be examined to provide&#xD;
      information on hospitalizations for cardiac diseases, cardiac procedures performed,&#xD;
      cardiac-related and other medications used, and diagnoses with cardiac diseases. This&#xD;
      information will help examine the diagnostic accuracy of the RDS versus the FDR. Vital&#xD;
      statistics will also provide information on cause of death to allow for mortality rate&#xD;
      tracking. This administrative health data will be used to compare adverse cardiovascular&#xD;
      events with the Assessment of Large and Small Artery Elasticity for the Early Detection of&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Disease protocol results to determine if this cardiovascular screening&#xD;
      approach predicted which individuals were at moderate to high risk of an adverse&#xD;
      cardiovascular outcome over the five-year period after screening. The investigators'&#xD;
      rationale to access all follow-up health information from the Repository at the MCHP is to&#xD;
      obtain the most accurate information on healthcare service utilization, adverse&#xD;
      cardiovascular events, demographics, etc. This method is much simpler, more complete and less&#xD;
      invasive than repeated contact with participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Based on published data, the investigators predict that 36% of the&#xD;
      screened population (i.e. 360 of the 1000 participants) will have an abnormal outcome based&#xD;
      on the Assessment of Large and Small Artery Elasticity for the Early Detection of&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Disease Protocol (i.e. a score of 3 or greater). This data indicates that&#xD;
      approximately 7.7% (i.e. 28 of the 360 participants) of the people with an abnormal score&#xD;
      will experience an adverse cardiovascular outcome in the 5-year period. Kaplan-Meier methods&#xD;
      and Receiver Operating Characteristic curves will be conducted to estimate cumulative rates&#xD;
      of adverse outcomes and to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the Assessment of Large&#xD;
      and Small Artery Elasticity for the Early Detection of Cardiovascular Disease protocol and&#xD;
      the FDR score, respectively. A Cox Proportional Hazards model will be conducted, controlling&#xD;
      for covariates identified through univariate analysis, such as age, that could be predictive&#xD;
      of adverse cardiovascular outcomes.&#xD;
