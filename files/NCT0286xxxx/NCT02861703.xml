    <textblock>
      Obesity presents serious psychological and physical consequences for breast cancer survivors,&#xD;
      including diminished quality of life, poorer prognosis and increased mortality. As such,&#xD;
      there is a great need to develop strategies for these women to maintain optimal body weight.&#xD;
      Diet and exercise have been shown to lead to successful weight loss among this population but&#xD;
      these effects are seldom sustained, plausibly because these efforts alone overlook less&#xD;
      obvious, but equally important, psychosocial factors that can interfere with prolonged&#xD;
      progress. This study will implement a group-based intervention addressing diet and exercise&#xD;
      along with other psychosocial issues related to survivorship such as depression, fatigue,&#xD;
      body image and social support. Based on the growing popularity and benefits of computer-based&#xD;
      health care, including convenience and anonymity, this intervention will also be offered&#xD;
      online, representing the first of its kind. It is hypothesized that the intervention will be&#xD;
      feasible to implement and acceptable to its participants. It is also hypothesized that the&#xD;
      intervention will yield meaningful and sustained changes in body weight, body mass index,&#xD;
      waist circumference (primary outcomes), as well as mental well-being, quality of life, and&#xD;
      body image (secondary outcomes). This research has the ability to improve the long-term&#xD;
      health of breast cancer survivors by incorporating psychosocial interventions into standard&#xD;
      medical care practices and has the potential to increase accessibility of these services&#xD;
      using online technology.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common types of cancer in Canadian women, and although&#xD;
      the mortality rate is decreasing, there remain numerous challenges for survivorship. Among&#xD;
      the most prevalent yet less commonly discussed post-treatment concerns, is substantial weight&#xD;
      gain, with approximately 70% of women being overweight at diagnosis and additional weight&#xD;
      gain often resulting from treatment. Obesity has serious psychological and physical&#xD;
      implications for both pre- and post-menopausal BC survivors; in addition to compromising body&#xD;
      image and QoL, it increases risk for recurrence and mortality. Specifically, increased fat&#xD;
      results in greater production of estrogen, insulin, leptin and pro-inflammatory cytokines,&#xD;
      and lesser production of sex hormone binding globulin, all of which have been linked to the&#xD;
      promotion of BC and tumor growth. As such, the development of strategies for the promotion&#xD;
      and maintenance of optimal body mass has become a primary focus for BC survivorship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trials of lifestyle interventions for this population are in their early stages and have&#xD;
      primarily included modification of diet alone, exercise alone, or both. Results have been&#xD;
      mixed, especially regarding the effects of dietary change alone but generally support the&#xD;
      benefits of exercise and combined diet and exercise on weight loss and improved QoL in cancer&#xD;
      survivors. However, despite indications that diet and exercise interventions lead to&#xD;
      improvements in physical health and mental health, there remains a lack of consistent&#xD;
      evidence that these gains are maintained long-term. As such, there is a need for more&#xD;
      systematic follow-up of these interventions to determine their potential to produce enduring&#xD;
      effects as well as for development and refinement of techniques that improve long-term weight&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beyond developing effective services, a direction for future research should include outreach&#xD;
      to underserved populations. Rural BC survivors represent one group, in particular, with&#xD;
      limited access to healthy lifestyle interventions, and who could benefit greatly from&#xD;
      participation. Compared to their urban counterparts, these women are less likely to have&#xD;
      timely diagnostic biopsies and receive optimal treatment, and are diagnosed later, at more&#xD;
      advanced stages when prognosis is less favourable. They are also more likely to be obese, be&#xD;
      less physically active, have poor eating habits, experience psychological distress, and have&#xD;
      less access to mental health resources, placing them at heightened risk for weight gain.&#xD;
      Researchers and health care providers have a responsibility to develop ways of redressing&#xD;
      such health disparities and helping these particularly vulnerable women make lasting changes&#xD;
      to their overall health and QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Society's recent movement toward &quot;eHealth&quot;, which refers to &quot;the use of emerging information&#xD;
      and communication technology, especially the Internet, to improve or enable health and health&#xD;
      care&quot;, introduces an exciting opportunity to increase availability of health care to BC&#xD;
      survivors. Numerous eHealth diet and exercise interventions have been evaluated using&#xD;
      community samples and have generally yielded mixed findings along with recommendations for&#xD;
      refinement of future programs and more rigorous evaluation. Only one online community&#xD;
      intervention has been in group-format, and to the investigators knowledge, no online,&#xD;
      group-based lifestyle intervention has yet been developed specifically for BC survivors.&#xD;
      Given the potential for broader delivery of health care services via the Internet, research&#xD;
      surrounding the value of computer-based lifestyle interventions is especially warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Present Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, while trials to date demonstrate that diet and exercise interventions lead to&#xD;
      improvements in physical and mental health, there remains a lack of consistent evidence that&#xD;
      these gains are maintained long-term. Arguably, programs that focus primarily on modifying&#xD;
      nutrition and/or physical activity render only short-term effects because they fail to&#xD;
      address more subtle, but ingrained, psychosocial factors that interfere with sustained&#xD;
      progress. This project will develop and evaluate a group-based lifestyle intervention that&#xD;
      incorporates diet and exercise strategies along with education of issues more broadly related&#xD;
      to healthy lifestyle in the context of BC survivorship such as depression, fatigue, body&#xD;
      image, and social support. The program will be developed by an interdisciplinary team of&#xD;
      clinicians/researchers (oncologist, nurse, dietician, physiotherapist and senior&#xD;
      psychologist), and grounded in Systems and Self-Determination Theory, which recognize one's&#xD;
      motivation and self-efficacy as being the multi-determined product of interactions between&#xD;
      personal, social, and environmental factors; as such, this program goes beyond behavioural&#xD;
      diet and exercise modification by incorporating self-monitoring, motivational interviewing,&#xD;
      professional knowledge, and peer feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, despite growing evidence for the efficacy of interactive computer-based programs&#xD;
      aimed at behaviour change and the associated advantages (e.g., convenience, accessibility,&#xD;
      anonymity), there are no such interventions to support weight loss and sustained management&#xD;
      for BC survivors. This project aims to fill this gap in health care by developing and&#xD;
      evaluating the first online, group-based lifestyle intervention for BC survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      an online group-based lifestyle intervention for BC survivors. Qualitative data from the&#xD;
      post-treatment interviews, and written responses from the treatment satisfaction survey were&#xD;
      analyzed using thematic analysis to investigate this aim. A secondary aim is to evaluate the&#xD;
      short- and longer-term effects of this healthy lifestyle intervention on participants' (1)&#xD;
      physical (weight, BMI, waist circumference,) (2) behavioural (eating and physical activity&#xD;
      habits) and (3) psychosocial well-being (quality of life, body image). This secondary aim was&#xD;
      evaluated by comparing participants' scores on these measures prior to participating in the&#xD;
      intervention, to their scores immediately following treatment, six months following&#xD;
      treatment, and 12-months following treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim hypotheses. It is hypothesized that this program is feasible to implement, as&#xD;
      demonstrated by acceptable rates of attrition, homework completion and discussion board&#xD;
      posting. It is also hypothesized that this program is acceptable, as demonstrated by&#xD;
      satisfactory feedback obtained through a treatment satisfaction questionnaire and&#xD;
      post-treatment interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aim hypotheses. It is hypothesized that there will be a significant reduction in&#xD;
      participants' weight, BMI, and waist circumference from pre-treatment to post-treatment, from&#xD;
      pre-treatment to 6-months follow-up, and from pre-treatment to 12-months follow-up. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that there will be a significant improvement in participants' eating and&#xD;
      physical activity habits from pre-treatment to post-treatment, from pre-treatment to 6-months&#xD;
      follow-up, and from pre-treatment to 12-months follow-up. It is also hypothesized that there&#xD;
      will be a significant improvement in participants' quality of life from pre-treatment to&#xD;
      post-treatment, from pre-treatment to 6-months follow-up, and from pre-treatment to 12-months&#xD;
      follow-up. Finally, it is hypothesized that there will be a significant improvement in&#xD;
      participants' body image from pre-treatment to post-treatment, from pre-treatment to 6-months&#xD;
      follow-up, and from pre-treatment to 12-months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will employ a single-arm pilot study, with repeated measures psychometric&#xD;
      evaluation. Standardized measures will be completed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 6-&#xD;
      and 12- months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be accrued through the Louise Temerty Breast Center at Sunnybrook Health&#xD;
      Sciences Centre (SHSC). The study will be advertised by staff and through brochures in the&#xD;
      hospital and community-based organizations such as 'Willow Breast Cancer Support Canada', and&#xD;
      via electronic brochures posted on websites commonly accessed by BC survivors. Interested&#xD;
      women will contact the principal investigator, who will provide detailed information about&#xD;
      the nature of the project, the study objectives and procedures, answer any questions the&#xD;
      prospective participants have, and determine eligibility using the screening questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will follow an individualized diet and exercise plan while participating in a&#xD;
      10-week online group, consisting of group discussion, educational videos, as well as homework&#xD;
      completion and related feedback. Once screened, participants will be invited to SHSC to&#xD;
      complete consent forms and baseline measures and a demographics questionnaire. They will be&#xD;
      asked to complete these same measures immediately following completion of the intervention,&#xD;
      as well as 6 and 12 months afterwards.&#xD;
