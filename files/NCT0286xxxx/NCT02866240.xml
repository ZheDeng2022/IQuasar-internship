      This is a single site, non-randomized, prospective, open-label, interventional&#xD;
      pilot/feasibility study. Patients recruited will have medically-refractory focal neocortical&#xD;
      epilepsy, defined on the basis of presence of focal spikes and (if available) focal seizure&#xD;
      onsets originating from the lateral cortical surface of any lobe. All patients and referring&#xD;
      physicians will be requested to maintain their current antiepileptic drugs throughout the&#xD;
      study with changes after enrollment permitted only to maintain pre-enrollment drug levels, or&#xD;
      if clinically necessary. The primary outcome measure will be the change in seizure frequency&#xD;
      (seizures/week) as compared to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with medically-refractory neocortical epilepsy will receive cathodal tDCS&#xD;
      administered to the seizure focus for 10 sessions over a 2-week period with the allowance of&#xD;
      make-up sessions in week three. Subjects will be evaluated at baseline, during the&#xD;
      stimulation sessions, and 8 weeks after the completion of the tDCS visits&#xD;

      Noninvasive neurostimulation techniques include Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and&#xD;
      Cathodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS). Of these, tDCS is uniquely suited to&#xD;
      mass distribution and treatment, even at home, as it is lightweight, portable, inexpensive&#xD;
      and has a favorable safety profile. In tDCS, a low intensity (1-2 mA) unidirectional&#xD;
      electrical current is applied to the scalp to influence underlying cortical excitability.&#xD;
      Some small preliminary studies suggest that cathodal tDCS may suppress epileptic seizures.&#xD;
      However, a well-powered randomized-controlled trial demonstrating convincing proof of&#xD;
      efficacy has not been conducted. This study is intended to test whether tDCS reduces seizures&#xD;
      in patients with intractable focal neocortical epilepsy. The hypothesis is that repeated&#xD;
      daily sessions of cathodal tDCS will lead to a clinically significant decrease in seizures in&#xD;
      this population. Successful completion of this pilot study will be an essential first step&#xD;
      toward a larger placebo-controlled trial with the goal of establishing cathodal tDCS as a&#xD;
      novel, non-invasive and inexpensive treatment for drug-resistant seizures, and will provide&#xD;
      the critical data needed for an application to obtain FDA approval for the use of tDCS in the&#xD;
      treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      tDCS is a painless method for focal brain stimulation. tDCS is based on decades-old&#xD;
      observations that neuronal firing is modulated by low amplitude electrical direct current&#xD;
      (DC). Specifically, when applied to the cerebral cortex, cathodal DC inhibits neuronal&#xD;
      firing. The mechanisms by which cathodal DC reduces neuronal firing likely relate to&#xD;
      hyper-polarization of the soma membrane which occurs when the apical dendrites neuron are&#xD;
      oriented toward the cathode in a constant electric field. The practical application of tDCS&#xD;
      is simple: low amplitude DC is administered via scalp electrodes such that the cerebral&#xD;
      cortex is exposed to cathodal DC beneath one of the electrodes, and the return (anodal)&#xD;
      electrodes can be placed anywhere else on the body, or in more complex arrangements to&#xD;
      minimize currents at any one site. tDCS methods have also recently been adapted to rats for&#xD;
      work with disease models showing success with seizure suppression. Numerous of tDCS studies&#xD;
      have demonstrated the technique to be well tolerated and safe. Direct electrical current&#xD;
      stimulation is presently FDA-approved for extracranial use, and FDA applications for tDCS for&#xD;
      management of mood disorder and chronic pain are in progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      tDCS units are also inexpensive and light-weight. The electrical supply can be derived from&#xD;
      conventional 9-volt batteries. The scalp electrodes can be fastened in seconds. tDCS can be&#xD;
      combined easily with other therapies, such as those that may be required for resuscitation of&#xD;
      an acutely-injured patient. tDCS is presently under investigation as a treatment for&#xD;
      epilepsy, where excess cortical excitability is a prominent feature of the disease process,&#xD;
      and where neuronal inhibition may be beneficial. Thus for epilepsy, tDCS may offer a&#xD;
      practical non-pharmacologic therapy for the large minority, approximately 35%, of patients&#xD;
      whose seizure cannot be controlled by medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tDCS stimulator used in this clinical study is the STARSTIM device (Neuroelectrics, Inc).&#xD;
      STARSTIM is capable of recording EEG before, during and after tDCS stimulation, and will not&#xD;
      only allow for a detailed understanding of the tDCS-induced effect on neural activity, but&#xD;
      may eventually serve as a guidance to fine-tune the stimulation parameters and improve the&#xD;
      tDCS protocol based on the developmental, behavioral, dynamical, and disease state through&#xD;
      closed-loop systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starstim device is remotely controlled using NIC software that stands for Neuroelectrics&#xD;
      Instrument Controller (NIC). This application will allow physicians to configure the study&#xD;
      protocol with all the defined parameters. The provided version of software will only enable&#xD;
      to apply tDCS protocols to the subjects in the study.&#xD;
