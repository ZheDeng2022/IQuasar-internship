  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, blinded, controlled trial to evaluate growth velocity and clinical outcomes in&#xD;
      infants with single ventricle physiology fed an exclusive human milk diet prior to, and&#xD;
      throughout the post-operative period following, surgical repair. Human milk is defined as&#xD;
      expressed human milk or donor milk and its derivatives, human milk-based fortifier and human&#xD;
      milk caloric fortifier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that infants fed an exclusive human milk diet will have short and&#xD;
      long term benefits, with improved wound healing, growth, and neurodevelopmental outcomes&#xD;
      while reducing episodes of feeding intolerance and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single blinded (physician investigator), randomized, controlled trial to evaluate&#xD;
      growth velocity and clinical outcomes in infants with single ventricle physiology fed an&#xD;
      exclusive human milk diet during their initial hospitalization after birth and through the 30&#xD;
      days post-surgical repair feeding period or hospital discharge, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to one of two groups at birth or immediately following diagnosis&#xD;
      if prenatal care was not obtained prior to birth. Parents who decline participation by their&#xD;
      infants in the study will be asked to consent to data gathering on their infants who will be&#xD;
      treated and fed per institutional practice. The data on these individuals will be summarized&#xD;
      and evaluated descriptively in comparison with the actual trial results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive exclusive maternal human milk or donor human milk prior to&#xD;
      randomization. Once randomized, patients in Group One will receive an exclusive human milk&#xD;
      diet prior to the surgery and throughout the 30-day feeding period following surgical repair&#xD;
      or until hospital discharge, whichever comes first. Day 1 is defined as the day of the first&#xD;
      enteral feed post-surgery. Patients in Group Two (Control Group) will receive maternal human&#xD;
      milk or formula or donor human milk (per standard of care at each hospital) in the&#xD;
      pre-surgical period. In the post-surgical period the control group will receive human milk or&#xD;
      formula, as per feeding algorithm The primary objective of this study is to evaluate growth&#xD;
      velocity (weight velocity [g/kg/day] and weight z-score from World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
      growth charts) at 30 days after the initiation of feed post-surgery for infants with single&#xD;
      ventricle physiology who are fed an exclusive human milk diet from birth through the 30 day&#xD;
      feeding period following surgical repair or until hospital discharge, whichever comes first.&#xD;
