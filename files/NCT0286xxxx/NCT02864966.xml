  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 24 hour patch test to determine the acute tolerance of 3 variants of condom on a&#xD;
      panel of healthy adult subjects. The patches will be affixed to the back and remain under&#xD;
      occlusion for 24 hours. They will then be assessed at 30 minutes and 24 hours post patch&#xD;
      removal.&#xD;

      Three test products (plus positive and negative control) will be applied to the back using&#xD;
      occlusive tape and will remain on the skin for 24 hours. The patches will be removed after 24&#xD;
      hours and assessed as 30 minutes post patch removal and again at 24 hours post patch removal.&#xD;
      Each test site will be scored for erythema and oedema by a dermatologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint for this Clinical Investigation is the irritation of the test products&#xD;
      according to the Cutaneous Irritancy Index value. The test products success criteria is to be&#xD;
      graded as 'non-irritant' and this should be confirmed by the study dermatologist.&#xD;
