      This test is a single center, one-armed exploratory clinical research, aimed at the&#xD;
      evaluation the efficacy and safety of Apatinib with Gemcitabine in the patients with advanced&#xD;
      metastatic pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study plan in Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital.From launched in&#xD;
      July 2016, this research intends to recruit the end time about as of December 2017, is&#xD;
      expected to the end of the test time is in December 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If do not have the appearance of the following circumstances, such as the subjects out of&#xD;
      informed consent, drug toxicity tolerance or the researchers think that do not fit for&#xD;
      further test, each subject research and treatment time is expected until imaging of tumor&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
