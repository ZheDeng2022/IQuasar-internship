  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal for the study is to test the efficacy of a smartphone app which includes an&#xD;
      alcohol brief intervention (SP-BI) versus an Enhanced Usual Care (EUC) condition for National&#xD;
      Guard members in the State of Ohio who meet criteria for at-risk drinking in the previous 4&#xD;
      months. The main hypothesis is that those in the SP-BI group with have reduced frequency and&#xD;
      intensity of at-risk drinking and fewer binge drinking episodes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project is a fully-powered randomized controlled trial of a smartphone app which includes&#xD;
      an alcohol brief intervention (SP-BI) versus an Enhanced Usual Care (EUC) condition for&#xD;
      National Guard members in the State of Ohio, who are already participating in the Ohio Army&#xD;
      National Guard Mental Health Initiative (OHARNG-MHI) study, titled &quot;Resilience and Risk&#xD;
      Factors Associated with Deployment Related Posttraumatic Psychopathology&quot;, who meet criteria&#xD;
      for at-risk drinking in the previous 4 months. After tailoring the content of the SP-BI&#xD;
      intervention for NG soldiers, the study will prescreen ~ 8,500 individuals over the three&#xD;
      year enrollment period to identify 850participants with at-risk drinking. TParticipants in&#xD;
      this study will be randomized to either the SP-BI (n=375) or the EUC condition (n=375) and&#xD;
      followed at 4, 8 and 12 months post-enrollment. Participants who are randomized to the SP-BI&#xD;
      condition will receive an informational brochure with resources available to members of the&#xD;
      military related to mental health and alcohol use and will download a free app on to their&#xD;
      smartphones. The app will be developed to be used on both Android and iPhone platforms and&#xD;
      will be used over 12 weeks to deliver the study intervention. Those assigned to the EUC&#xD;
      condition will receive the informational brochure only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the study are to compare SP-BI and EUC in: 1) Reducing the frequency and&#xD;
      intensity of at-risk drinking at 4 -, 8- and 12-months; 2) Decreasing binge drinking at 4-,&#xD;
      8- and 12 months. The secondary aims are to: 1) Compare the SP-BI and EUC conditions in&#xD;
      reducing the frequency of illicit drug use and depressive symptoms at 4-, 8- and 12-months;&#xD;
      2) Examine if deployment status moderates the effect of intervention assignment (SP-BI or&#xD;
      EUC) on post-intervention drinking, depressed feelings, and other substance use.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in the SP-BI group will receive a 20-30 minute intervention through an app program based on the FRAMES format: providing personalized Feedback (regarding substance use, risk factors), emphasis on Responsibility for change, Advice, Menu of options, Empathic clinical behaviors, and support of Self-efficacy regarding making changes. The intervention is designed to address the target behavior of alcohol use, and will include a tailored review of participants' goals/values, feedback regarding their alcohol use patterns and consequences (either actual experiences or potential based on risk behaviors), developing a discrepancy between their alcohol use and ability to meet goals and values through a decisional balance exercise, and formulation of a &quot;change plan&quot;.</description>
