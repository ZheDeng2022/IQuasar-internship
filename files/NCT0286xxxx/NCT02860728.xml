  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Structural changes in skeletal muscles of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      (COPD) have been linked to impaired muscle function, reduced exercise capacity, and increased&#xD;
      mortality associated with this disease. Muscle dysfunction also contributes to dyspnea&#xD;
      intensity and the ability to sustain exercise, making aerobic exercise training intolerable&#xD;
      at the intensity and/or volume required to achieve clinically important changes. Resistance&#xD;
      training (RT) is an attractive exercise modality because it is efficacious and more tolerable&#xD;
      initially. No work has examined whether a short-term RT program can reduce exertional&#xD;
      symptoms and improve exercise tolerance (dyspnea and leg fatigue) in patients with COPD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skeletal muscle dysfunction is common in patients with COPD and has been recognized as a&#xD;
      contributing factor to reduced exercise capacity, health related quality of life and&#xD;
      increased mortality associated with this disease. Several structural changes in the limb&#xD;
      muscles of patients have previously been reported and have been linked to the known&#xD;
      reductions in muscle strength and endurance commonly reported in COPD. Muscle dysfunction,&#xD;
      lower extremity muscle strength, and muscle fatigue also contribute to the intensity of&#xD;
      dyspnea and the ability to sustain exercise mostly through stimulation of type III and IV&#xD;
      muscle afferents. As such, many patients who primarily perform aerobic exercise training as&#xD;
      part of pulmonary rehabilitation are unable to tolerate the intensity and/or volume of&#xD;
      exercise required to achieve clinically important changes in exercise capacity or symptom&#xD;
      relief. Resistance training (RT) is an attractive exercise modality for patients with COPD&#xD;
      because it is efficacious and often more tolerable initially. To our knowledge no one has&#xD;
      examined whether similar benefits to those elicited by longer RT programs can be attained in&#xD;
      just 4 weeks using multi-joint, multi-muscle exercises and individualized progression. If a&#xD;
      short term RT program can improve muscle quality, enhance endurance, and reduce type III and&#xD;
      IV afferent activity then it would reduce the drive to breathe and thus dyspnea. These&#xD;
      adaptations would likely translate into improved exercise tolerance making it feasible to&#xD;
      &quot;pre-habilitate&quot; COPD patients with tolerable RT, allowing them to achieve a higher&#xD;
      volume/intensity of endurance training, thus making pulmonary rehabilitation more effective.&#xD;
