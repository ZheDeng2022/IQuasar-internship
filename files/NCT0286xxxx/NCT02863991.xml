  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ONC201 is an orally bioavailable first-in-class small molecule with demonstrated antitumor&#xD;
      activity in preclinical models of difficult-to-treat solid and liquid tumors without&#xD;
      imparting significant toxicity. This is a Phase 1/2 open-label study of ONC201 administered&#xD;
      orally once every week in combination with dexamethasone to patients with relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      multiple myeloma.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must be refractory to, or not a candidate for, established therapy known to&#xD;
             provide clinical benefit for their malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Measurable disease M protein component in serum (at least 0.5 g/dL) and/or urine (if&#xD;
             present) (&gt;=0.2 g excreted in a 24 hour collection sample).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. All previous therapies for cancer, including radiotherapy, major surgery and&#xD;
             investigational therapies discontinued for ≥ 14 days (≥ 28 days for mitomycin C or&#xD;
             nitrosoureas) before study entry, and all acute effects of any prior therapy resolved&#xD;
             to baseline severity or Grade ≤ 1 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&#xD;
             (CTCAE v4.03), except alopecia or parameters defined in this eligibility list.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Age ≥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. ECOG performance status ≤ 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/mm3 without growth factor use ≤ 7 days prior to&#xD;
                  treatment (cycle 1 day 1, C1D1)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Platelets ≥75,000/mm3 without platelet transfusion ≤ 3 days prior to C1D1&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Hemoglobin &gt;8.0 mg/dL without red blood cell transfusion ≤ 3 days prior to C1D1&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Total serum bilirubin &lt;1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤2 X ULN; ≤ 5 X ULN if there is liver involvement secondary&#xD;
                  to tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 X ULN (OR creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2)&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Serum or urine pregnancy test (for females of childbearing potential) negative ≤7&#xD;
                  days of starting treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
             and comply with the study scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory tests and&#xD;
             other procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Female patients must be surgically sterile or be postmenopausal, or must agree to use&#xD;

             completion of treatment. Male patients must be surgically sterile or must agree to use&#xD;
             effective contraception during the period of the trial and for at least 90 days after&#xD;
             completion of treatment. The decision of effective contraception will be based on the&#xD;
             judgment of the principal investigator or a designated associate.&#xD;

             gastrointestinal perforation, peptic ulcer disease, or intra-abdominal abscess within&#xD;
             6 months prior to study enrollment. Gastroesophageal reflux disease under treatment&#xD;
             with proton pump inhibitors is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;

          4. Active bacterial, fungal or viral infection including hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C&#xD;
             (HCV)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome&#xD;
             (AIDS)-related illness that is not well controlled.&#xD;

             comprised of plasma/CD138+ cells or an absolute count of 2 x 10^9/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Solitary bone or solitary extramedullary plasmacytoma as the only evidence of plasma&#xD;
             cell dyscrasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects with serum calcium (corrected for albumin) ≥ 12 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Any of the following in the previous 6 months: myocardial infarction, severe/unstable&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study&#xD;
             drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, or in&#xD;
             the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
