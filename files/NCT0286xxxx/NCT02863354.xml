      The RECOVERY trial will assess the safety and tolerability of 2 mg intravitreal aflibercept&#xD;
      injections (IAI) given monthly (Q4WK) or every 12 weeks (Q12WK) for the treatment of retinal&#xD;
      capillary non-perfusion (RNP) associated with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the safety and tolerability of IAI for the treatment of proliferative diabetic&#xD;
           retinopathy by evaluating the incidence and severity of ocular and systemic adverse&#xD;
           events through week 52&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in area of retinal capillary non-perfusion, as assessed by central reading&#xD;
           center, from baseline through week 52&#xD;

      The investigational product is intravitreal aflibercept injection, which will be supplied by&#xD;
      Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in sterile vials for intravitreal (IVT) injection. Vials must&#xD;
      be used (defined as entered with needle) only once. All drug supplies are to be kept under&#xD;
      recommended storage conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The injection volume will be 50μL (0.05 mL) and will be administered to the subjects by IVT&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study eyes will be assigned randomly (1:1 ratio) to one of the following 2 treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1- aflibercept 2 mg every 4 weeks (defined as every 28 days (+ 7 days) and at&#xD;
           least 21 days between injections) through week 48. Subjects will have a mandatory Year 1&#xD;
           visit at week 48. Subjects have a mandatory visit at week 52 &amp; will not receive&#xD;
           treatment. During the second year of follow-up, subjects will be monitored and treated&#xD;
           every 12 weeks (Week 60, 72, 84 and 96) with an end of study visit at week 100. If NV or&#xD;
           PDR are worse per the pre-specified criteria at week 60, or at any study visit&#xD;
           thereafter, the subject will be treated monthly through the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 - aflibercept 2 mg every 12-weeks for 48 weeks. Subjects will be followed every&#xD;
           4 weeks through week 12, and can be treated if the pre-specified criteria are met.&#xD;
           Starting at week 12 if NV or PDR are stable or improved (as assessed by investigator)&#xD;
           the subject will be monitored and treated at a 12-week interval through week 48. If NV&#xD;
           or PDR are worse per the pre-specified criteria at week 12, or at any study visit&#xD;
           thereafter, the subject will be treated monthly through week 48. At week 52 -&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For subjects without any retinal non-perfusion, monitoring and treatment will&#xD;
                continue at every 12 weeks (Week 60, 72, 84, 96) with an end of study visit at week&#xD;
                100.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For subjects with visible retinal non-perfusion, monitoring and treatment will be&#xD;
                at a 4-week interval (defined as every 28 days + 7 days and at least 21 days&#xD;
                between injections). If retinal non-perfusion has completely resolved at week 72,&#xD;
                the subject will be switched back to monitoring and treatment every 12 weeks (Week&#xD;
                72, 84, 96).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-specified criteria (subject must meet at least one criterion, which must be documented&#xD;
      with imaging):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Increased neovascularization&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Decrease in BCVA by 5 or more letters due to progressive DME or PDR&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Worsening central subfield diabetic macular edema causing vision loss, with principal&#xD;
           investigator or other delegated investigator confirmation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Total area of retinal ischemia increases by 10% as determined by the central reading&#xD;
           center&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescue Treatment At any point throughout the study, for either treatment arm, if PDR&#xD;
      progresses despite 3 monthly IAI, a fluorescein angiogram will be performed to evaluate PDR&#xD;
      progression. PRP will only be permitted after confirmation of PDR progression with the&#xD;
      primary&#xD;

At week 52, aflibercept 2 mg every 4 weeks (defined as 28 days (+ 7 days) and at least 21 days between injections) for subjects with visible retinal non-perfusion. If retinal non-perfusion has completely resolved at week 72, aflibercept every 12 weeks through end of study. For subjects without retinal non-perfusion at week 52, aflibercept 2 mg every 12 weeks through the end of study.&#xD;

At week 52, aflibercept 2 mg every 4 weeks (defined as 28 days (+ 7 days) and at least 21 days between injections) for subjects with visible retinal non-perfusion. If retinal non-perfusion has completely resolved at week 72, aflibercept every 12 weeks through end of study.

            <description>Aflibercept 2 mg every 12-weeks. Subjects will be followed every 4 weeks through week 12, and can be treated if the pre-specified criteria are met. Starting at week 12 if NV or PDR are stable or improved (as assessed by investigator) the subject will be monitored and treated at a 12-week interval through week 48. If NV or PDR are worse per the pre-specified criteria at week 12, or at any study visit thereafter, the subject will be treated monthly through the end of the study.&#xD;
At week 52, aflibercept 2 mg every 4 weeks (defined as 28 days (+ 7 days) and at least 21 days between injections) for subjects with visible retinal non-perfusion. If retinal non-perfusion has completely resolved at week 72, aflibercept every 12 weeks through end of study. For subjects without retinal non-perfusion at week 52, aflibercept 2 mg every 12 weeks through the end of study.&#xD;
