  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism, ranked among the '' pervasive developmental disorders' (ASD), is characterized by&#xD;
      disturbances in the areas of reciprocal social interaction, communication and behavior,&#xD;
      interests and activities restricted, repetitive. Various studies indicate that autistic&#xD;
      disorder is subjected to a genetic predisposition, most likely polygenic and heterogeneous.&#xD;
      However, no major gene responsible for this disorder has yet been identified. Given the link&#xD;
      between the Fragile X syndrome (the most common form of mental retardation (MR) hereditary)&#xD;
      and autistic behavior, it seems interesting to look, also, a possible link to the molecular&#xD;
      level. Among the proteins interacting with FMRP (absent protein in fragile X patients), the&#xD;
      investigators were interested to CYFIP1, protein encoded by the gene CYFIP1 appears to be a&#xD;
      good candidate gene involved in the RM and autism by its chromosomal position and function.&#xD;
      As FMR1, CYFIP1 is expressed in the brain cortex, hippocampus and Purkinje cells of the&#xD;
      cerebellum. This protein co-localizes and interacts with Rac and FMRP, which are both&#xD;
      involved in neurogenesis and cognitive development. In humans, the gene encoding CYFIP1 is&#xD;
      located in the 15q11-q13. Now, the only autosomal abnormalities most frequently observed in&#xD;
      autism are those involving the proximal 15q region, including duplications or 15q11-q13&#xD;
      triplications interstitial, of maternal origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data suggest that an / or more autism genes responsible are probably present in the&#xD;
      15q11-q13 chromosomal region, although no gene has yet been identified. Thus, the study of&#xD;
      the role of CYFIP1 gene in patients with autism spectrum disorders would most likely&#xD;
      contributory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to study the involvement of the 15q11-q13 chromosomal region and&#xD;
      CYFIP1 gene in autistic disorder in a hundred patients from the Autism Resource Centre (ARC)&#xD;
      Nice PACA antenna, over a two year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis and assessment report of children likely to be included in this study will be&#xD;
      conducted at ARC Nice. Balance sheets are made according to the recommendations of the High&#xD;
      Authority of Health for diagnosis of infantile autism and PDD. These children are then sent&#xD;
      to the Genetic Consultation Nice Hospital where an analysis of the background and a specific&#xD;
      morphological examination will be realized..&#xD;
