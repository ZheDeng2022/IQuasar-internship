  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteogenesis imperfecta (or brittle bone disease) is a rare genetic disease characterized by&#xD;
      fragile bone and a low mass ossue, secondary to abnormal collagen synthesis. This is a real&#xD;
      congenital osteoporosis. The prevalence of the disease is not known precisely, but it is 1 in&#xD;
      10000 at 20000. There are many forms of osteogenesis imperfecta to classify patients with&#xD;
      symptomatology minor to the patients with lethal form during the neonatal period. The main&#xD;
      symptoms are dominated by fractures and bone deformities, particularly in the lower limbs.&#xD;
      Bisphosphonate medication is used for over 10 years to reduce the number of fractures.&#xD;
      However the long-term effects are not known to date, not allowing even to establish proof of&#xD;
      the benefit risk. Thus unable to process all of these patients and over a long time, these&#xD;
      drug treatment leaves much therapeutic solutions to surgery. The goal of surgery is to treat&#xD;
      fractures, treat bone deformities and prevent fractures future. In the long bones of the&#xD;
      limbs, the only effective techniques are intramedullary nailing. The majority of realized&#xD;
      nailing nailing are either sliding or telescopic enabling having a reinforced bone of an&#xD;
      intramedullary osteosynthesis material over its entire length during the period of bone&#xD;
      growth. It has been shown that the technique of the sliding nailing was inexpensive but&#xD;
      reliable especially before the age of 5 years. After that age, all are telescopic nailing&#xD;
      nailing. The first telescopic nail described is the Bailey-Dubow nail still widely used in&#xD;
      France. However, the number of complications relating to its use is important. Thus, there&#xD;
      are 8% of disunity equipment and 33 to 72% of the nail migration forcing him to change one or&#xD;
      more times during growth. A new nail presented at the French orthopedic company in 2005 and&#xD;
      Fassier Duval reported a much lower complication rate because the rate of nail migration is&#xD;
      only 9%, without opening the knee joint, which is not possible with the highlight of&#xD;
      Bailey-Dubow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is proposed to conduct a prospective series of 10 nailing the lower extremities with this&#xD;
      nail Fassier-Duval in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta and compare the results with a&#xD;
      series of patients already treated with Bailey-Dubow nails in order to highlight the&#xD;
      advantages and disadvantages of using of such a nail.&#xD;
