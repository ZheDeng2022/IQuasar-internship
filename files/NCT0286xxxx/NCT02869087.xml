      The aim of this study is to prospectively collect information to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      performance of the Akesys Prava Sirolimus Eluting Bioresorbable Peripheral scaffold system&#xD;
      for the treatment of symptomatic primary atherosclerotic stenoses and occlusions of the&#xD;
      superficial femoral artery (SFA).&#xD;

      This is a mutli center, prospective ,single arm study enrolling up to 60 patients at up to 12&#xD;
      centers in New Zealand and Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose is to prospectively collect information to evaluate the safety and performance of&#xD;
      the Akesys Prava Sirolimus eluting bioresorbable scaffold system in peripheral arterial&#xD;
      disease (PAD) Patients will be treated with the investigational device and followed up&#xD;
      clinically at 1 month, 6 Months, 12 months, 24 months and 36 months post procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo non-invasive assessments such as Duplex Ultrasound (DUS),&#xD;
      Ankle/Brachial Index (ABI) measurements and will complete a Walking Impairment Questionnaire&#xD;
      (WIQ) and Quality of Life Questionnaire (VASCUQoL) at each follow up interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected via electronic data capture (EDC) and reportable Events will be&#xD;
      reviewed by a medical monitor and classified using the MedDRA system. The information entered&#xD;
      by the research centres will be source data verified (monitored) by an independent Contract&#xD;
      Research Organisation (CRO.) A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) with appropriately qualified&#xD;
      members independent of the study will meet to review and adjudicate on events at&#xD;
      predetermined intervals, according to the charter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary safety and efficacy endpoints will be evaluated at 6 months There will be no formal&#xD;
      hypothesis testing in the study, endpoints will be evaluated with 95% confidence intervals&#xD;
      around the observed point estimates. The endpoints will be evaluated with Kaplan-Meier&#xD;
      methodology.&#xD;
