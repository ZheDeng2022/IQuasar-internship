      The purpose of this study was to evaluate, for the first time in Literature, the effects of&#xD;
      betadine washing versus normal saline washing after uterine closure in women undergoing&#xD;
      cesarean section (CS) at â‰¥36 gestational weeks in terms of post CS infections, complication,&#xD;
      fever and pain.&#xD;

      This was a single-centre randomized controlled trial performed at Department of Obstetrics&#xD;
      and Gynecology of San Camillo Hospital of Rome. The protocol was approved by the Internal&#xD;
      Review Board. All women having a cesarean section (CS) were eligible for recruitment unless&#xD;
      there was suspected or known allergy to iodine. The study was widely publicized around&#xD;
      obstetrics unit and all women were provided antenatally with a brief statement regarding the&#xD;
      study. The study was presented to women as part of hospital initiative to reduce&#xD;
      postoperative infections and to improve postoperative recovery. Consent was obtained from all&#xD;
      women at the time of consenting for CS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background was recorded for each patient: maternal age, gestational week at delivery, BMI,&#xD;
      and pregnancy complication; plural fetal pregnancies, premature rupture of membranes,&#xD;
      placenta previa and pre-eclampsia. The investigators recorded the type of cesarean procedure,&#xD;
      elective (scheduled operations) or urgent (patients in labor and maternal or fetal emergent&#xD;
      indication), mean surgical time to perform CS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Literature, povidone-iodine irrigation has been demonstrated to be a simple and&#xD;
      inexpensive solution with the potential to prevent surgical site infection , which can also&#xD;
      reduce the incidence of intra-abdominal infectious complications when used as an&#xD;
      intraperitoneal irrigant in patients undergoing bacterially-contaminated surgical procedures,&#xD;
      i.e. orthopedic, general surgery, oncologic surgery. Therefore, the investigators aimed to&#xD;
      test its use in CS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were intra-operatively randomized to receive intraperitoneal irrigation prior to&#xD;
      abdominal closure with low molecular weight povidone-iodine solution ('Betadine LMW') (PVP-I&#xD;
      LMW) diluted 50:50 with normal saline or with only normal saline solution. Randomization to&#xD;
      'Betadine' or 'no Betadine' group was performed using sequentially numbered sealed opaque&#xD;
      envelopes that contained the allocation. The allocation was prepared using computer generated&#xD;
      list of random numbers using a variable block of 10 and performed by a staff members, part of&#xD;
      the clinical team. After all layers were sutured and just prior to starting skin closure, the&#xD;
      envelope with the allocation was opened by one of the theatre nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All CS were generally performed under spinal anesthesia by the specialist obstetricians,&#xD;
      credentialed trainee registrars or by juniors in the presence of a specialist obstetrician&#xD;
      using the modified Misgav Ladach surgical technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An abdominal opening was made through a straight transverse incision, which was placed 3-4 cm&#xD;
      above the symphysis. The subcutaneous tissue was left untouched apart from the midline. The&#xD;
      rectus sheath was separated along its fibers and the rectus muscles separated by pulling.&#xD;
      Stretching with index fingers opened the peritoneum and the uterus was opened with an index&#xD;
      finger. The hole was enlarged between the index finger of one hand and the thumb of the&#xD;
      other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single-layer closure of the uterine incision was performed as follows: a holding Vicryl-0 was&#xD;
      placed in the left corner to stabilize and define the demarcation of the suture line. A&#xD;
      continuous non-locking stitch beginning at the right corner was used, closing the whole&#xD;
      thickness of the uterine wall, excluding the decidual layer, in a cranial/caudal position.&#xD;
      Additional single sutures were added for hemostasis if required. Routinely exteriorization of&#xD;
      the uterus was not performed. The visceral and parietal peritoneal layers were left open and&#xD;
      the rectus muscle was not stitched. The rectus sheath was stitched with a continuous&#xD;
      non-locking Vicryl-0 and the subdermal space was closed in all patients. All patients had&#xD;
      preoperative exams not longer than 4 weeks prior the CS and received prophylactic intravenous&#xD;
      antibiotics (amoxicillin 2 g and metronidazole 1 g) preoperatively to reduce the rate of&#xD;
      wound infection. In addition, all patients received oxytocin intravenous during CS and 20 IU&#xD;
      was administered by an intravenous drip running post surgical procedure. All patients were&#xD;
      encouraged to start breastfeeding during early postoperative care, supported by a midwife and&#xD;
      by a nurse specialized in newborn care after admission to the maternity ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post CS infections included:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postpartum endometritis: defined as a clinical diagnosis, usually involving fever,&#xD;
           uterine fundal tenderness, or purulent lochia requiring antibiotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative wound infection: defined as erythema, tenderness, purulent drainage from&#xD;
           the incision site, with or without fever, requiring antibiotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative fever: defined as greater than 38 degrees C or 100.4 degrees F.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative wound seroma or hematoma: defined as collection of serous fluid or&#xD;
           blood/clot in the subcutaneous area of the incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Composite wound complications: defined as the presence of any one of the following:&#xD;
           wound infection, seroma, hematoma, separation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were examined during daily rounds whilst in hospital about intestinal&#xD;
      recanalization, postoperative mobilization, postoperative 24h post CS pain and wounds.&#xD;
      Preoperative and postoperative exams, presence of fever or any symptoms have been accurately&#xD;
      registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge from the hospital, the women were sent a letter with addressed return&#xD;
      envelope to report any post CS problems at four weeks after surgery as part of hospital&#xD;
      surveillance policy. Charts of all women readmitted for any reason were reviewed. Differences&#xD;
      between 'Betadine' and 'no Betadine' groups were assessed using chi square for categorical&#xD;
      data test. Fisher's exact test was used where there were 5 or fewer counts within a category&#xD;
      and t-test for continuous data. Relative risk (RR) and the corresponding 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval (CI) were calculated. A P value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
