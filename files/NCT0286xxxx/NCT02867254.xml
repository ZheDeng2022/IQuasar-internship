      Pulpal and periodontal tissues are closely related and have similar microbiota that&#xD;
      cross-contamination between the pulp and periodontal tissues.The aim of this study was to&#xD;
      investigate the prevalence of isolated Candida albicans from periodontal endodontic lesions&#xD;
      in diabetic and normoglycemic patients and their virulence in different atmospheric&#xD;
      conditions. A case-control study was conducted on 15 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      (G1) and 15 non-diabetics (G2), with periodontal endodontic lesions. Samples of root canals&#xD;
      and periodontal pockets were plated on CHROMagar for later identification by polymerase chain&#xD;
      reaction (PCR) and virulence test.&#xD;

      This case-control study was conducted on thirty patients (15 patients with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus and 15 normoglycemics) with clinical and radiographic diagnosis of a periodontal&#xD;
      endodontic lesion. To assess the glycemic control of the patients were measured the plasma&#xD;
      glucose level and glycosylated hemoglobin concentrations (HbA1c). All patients were initially&#xD;
      submitted to examination to verify the clinical periodontal parameters (plaque index, probing&#xD;
      bleeding, probing depth, clinical attachment level and gingival recession) and pulp&#xD;
      sensitivity testing. The study included patients who presented periodontal pockets involving&#xD;
      the apical region of the tooth and pulp necrosis (periodontal endodontic lesion). Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria were: use of antibiotics in the last six months, pregnancy, smoking, other systemic&#xD;
      diseases, clinical signs of oral candidiasis, and patients who did not sign a free and&#xD;
      clarified consent term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection Collection from the root canal was performed after access, rubber dam&#xD;
      isolation, disinfection of the surgical field with 5.25% sodium hypochlorite, and&#xD;
      neutralization with 5% sodium thiosulfato, with 3 sterile paper points remaining in the root&#xD;
      canal for one minute. Sampling of the periodontal pocket was made at the deepest site through&#xD;
      3 sterile paper points, inserted one by one for one minute. The material collected from the&#xD;
      periodontal pocket and the root canal was inoculated in Eppendorf tubes containing 1 ml of&#xD;
      reduced transport fluid (RTF). Next, samples from each site were diluted and plated on the&#xD;
      medium Saboraund Dextrose Agar plus Chloramphenicol and chromogenic medium (CHROMagar Candida&#xD;
      ®, BioMerieux, Paris, France) and incubated at 37° C for 48h in a reduced oxygen atmosphere&#xD;
      (10% CO2 and 90% air). The green colonies that grew on CHROMagar plates were chosen at random&#xD;
      and stored in glycerol at 20° C for later identification by PCR.&#xD;
