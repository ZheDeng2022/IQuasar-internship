      Background: The best strategy for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients with&#xD;
      multi-vessel disease, who undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the&#xD;
      infarct-related artery (IRA) in the acute phase with remaining multivessel disease, is still&#xD;
      not well established. Current guidelines recommend PCI of only the infarct related artery&#xD;
      (IRA). However, recent small scale randomised controlled trials indicate that full&#xD;
      revascularization of these non-infarct related arteries during the index procedure is&#xD;
      superior to initial conservative treatment. Fractional flow reserve (FFR), a method used to&#xD;
      determine ischemia-inducing lesions, has been shown to be superior to angiography-guided PCI&#xD;
      in stable angina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective and methods: To test the hypothesis that a strategy of systematic complete&#xD;
      revascularization with FFR-guided PCI following STEMI/very high risk NSTEMI leads to improved&#xD;
      clinical outcomes at one year compared to initial conservative management of non-culprit&#xD;
      lesions. The trial is a prospective international multicentre registry-based randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial with combined primary endpoint of all-cause mortality and non-fatal MI at&#xD;
      one year. Key secondary endpoint is unplanned revascularization. 1545 patients with acute&#xD;
      STEMI/very high risk NSTEMI with multi-vessel disease in Sweden, Denmark, Serbia, Finland,&#xD;
      Latvia, Australia and New Zealand will be randomized into 2 arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. FFR-guided PCI of non-culprit lesions during index hospital admission or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Initial conservative management following acute PCI of the culprit lesion(s) or&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and data collection in the registries - the Swedish Coronary Angiography and&#xD;
      Angioplasty Registry (SCAAR) and corresponding registries in other countries (or electronic&#xD;
      data capture) - will ensure low bias, high inclusion rate and excellent follow-up of events&#xD;
      at a low cost. Adjudication of clinical events and collection of data from other registries&#xD;
      including death cause registries is also planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: If this study shows that FFR-guided PCI of non-culprit lesions in STEMI/very&#xD;
      high risk NSTEMI improves clinical outcome compared to conventional management this will&#xD;
      change practise in how we should best manage these patients. Therefore a study of this size&#xD;
      will definitely be of great importance in determining future guidelines for this large&#xD;
      patient group to reduce both morbidity and mortality.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background Information: Early epicardial coronary reperfusion is a prerequisite for the&#xD;
      effective salvage of ischemic myocardium and reduces morbidity and mortality in patients with&#xD;
      ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The recent ESC guidelines currently recommend&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of only the infarct related artery (IRA) in the&#xD;
      setting of acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Subsequent management of&#xD;
      residual disease is initially conservative with a low threshold for non-invasive&#xD;
      investigation for residual ischemia. There is a recent meta-analysis of 34279 patients with&#xD;
      1819 cardiovascular deaths registered during follow-up showing that PCI of the culprit lesion&#xD;
      only is associated with reduced mortality as compared to full revascularization at the time&#xD;
      of STEMI in multivessel disease. Also in non ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction&#xD;
      (NSTEMI), the strategy of multivessel PCI for suitable significant stenoses-rather than PCI&#xD;
      limited to the culprit lesion-has not been evaluated in an appropriate, randomized fashion&#xD;
      according to the European Society of Cardiology guidelines on myocardial revascularization.&#xD;
      In NSTEMI there is growing evidence to suggest a benefit of an invasive strategy within 2 h&#xD;
      in patients with a very high risk profile according to the ESC NSTEMI guidelines.&#xD;
      Accordingly, also patients with a very high risk NSTEMI requiring urgent revascularization&#xD;
      may be included in the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent small scale randomised controlled trials (RCT) have however produced results which&#xD;
      suggest that in cases where there is anatomically significant non-culprit multi-vessel&#xD;
      disease full revascularization of these non-infarct related arteries during the index&#xD;
      procedure or at least during the same hospitalization is superior to initial conservative&#xD;
      treatment. Since these studies were so small and also go against earlier observational&#xD;
      studies and current guidelines it is therefore difficult to draw any conclusions on how to&#xD;
      treat this patient group in the optimal way to reduce mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By way of paradox, in recent years it has been shown that fractional flow reserve (FFR) used&#xD;
      to determine ischemia-inducing lesions is superior to angiography guided PCI in both stable&#xD;
      angina and in NSTEMI. Whether performing full revascularization of physiologically&#xD;
      significant non-culprit lesions for patients with STEMI improves outcome compared to an&#xD;
      initial conservative approach is not known. The primary PCI in multivessel disease&#xD;
      study(PRIMULTI) was a small study (650 patients) that investigated this question with a&#xD;
      combined primary endpoint of all cause death, myocardial infarction or revascularization at&#xD;
      one year. In PRIMULTI conservative treatment was safe; there was no difference at all&#xD;
      regarding death and myocardial infarction, only revascularization. One critique of these&#xD;
      studies is that they are including revascularization in the primary endpoint and it is&#xD;
      expected that you will increase revascularization if you leave significant stenoses&#xD;
      untreated. The key question is if complete revascularization prevents death or MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate whether in patients with STEMI/rescue&#xD;
      PCI/risk evaluation following successful thrombolysis/very high risk NSTEMI FFR-guided PCI of&#xD;
      non-culprit lesions during the index hospital admission will improve cardiovascular outcomes&#xD;
      compared to an initially conservative approach of non-culprit lesions. The study aim is&#xD;
      powered statistically for the combined primary endpoint of total mortality and myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (MI) at a minimum follow-up of 1 year (all events when the last patient has been&#xD;
      for 1 year).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments and Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo primary PCI according to clinical routine for patients with&#xD;
      STEMI/Rescue PCI/Risk evaluation following successful thrombolysis/very high risk NSTEMI. If&#xD;
      index procedure PCI is performed then oral informed consent of the study will be obtained and&#xD;
      the patient will be randomized following PCI of the culprit lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A simple randomization procedure based on a computer module will be performed via SCAAR&#xD;
      registry (Sweden). Other participating countries without possibility to randomize patients&#xD;
      through registries can do this through a web page. It is strongly recommended that&#xD;
      randomization is done directly following primary PCI of the culprit lesion. However, it is&#xD;
      possible to randomize the patient within 6 h from puncture time of the index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will receive written information about the study and sign a consent form in the&#xD;
      ward after the PCI procedure is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up of both treatment arms: If patients at follow-up are found to have angina pectoris&#xD;
      that could not be medically managed, it is recommended that an imaging-based non-invasive&#xD;
      stress test is performed before deciding on a new elective coronary angiography according to&#xD;
      current guidelines. If patients in both groups are found to have signs of significant&#xD;
      ischemia on a stress-test or still have significant angina and sent for elective coronary&#xD;
      angiography, then FFR is allowed according to current ESC guidelines of stable coronary&#xD;
      artery disease and is at the discretion of the patient responsible physician. However, it is&#xD;
      recommended that a non-invasive stress test is performed as first option if a patient comes&#xD;
      back with angina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are eligible but not randomized into the study will be followed in the&#xD;
      registries for the same endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected for all patients on hospitalization for myocardial infarction from the&#xD;
      The Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence- based care in Heart&#xD;
      disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies (SWEDEHEART) registry (Sweden) or&#xD;
      corresponding registries in other countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will also be collected from the the Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty&#xD;
      Registry (SCAAR) in Sweden or corresponding registries in other countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on coronary-artery bypass surgery after the index procedure will be determined by the&#xD;
      diagnose registry or CABG registry in Sweden. For deceased patients data on cause of death&#xD;
      will be collected from the Swedish Death Cause Registry. Corresponding registries in other&#xD;
      countries will also be used where possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other participating countries must decide their possibility to capture registry data from&#xD;
      corresponding registries according to the data model for the study. If not possible data must&#xD;
      be collected manually through an UCR EDC system that mirrors the interface in registries used&#xD;
      in Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment assignment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization (1:1) will be performed by means of an online randomization module within the&#xD;
      SCAAR registry using permuted block randomization stratified by site. In other participating&#xD;
      countries randomization will be performed in corresponding registries or through a web page.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intention-to-treat analysis will be performed as primary analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research nurse at each site will contact each patient and perform a medical record review&#xD;
      at 30 days and one year to confirm if the patient has experienced anything of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MI, unplanned rehospitalization due to anything of the following: revascularization, major&#xD;
      bleeding requiring transfusion or surgery, stroke or heart failure. Furthermore, the Seattle&#xD;
      Angina Questionnaire-7 will be used to evaluate effects on angina pectoris.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A majority of patients aged &lt;75 years in the study will have a clinical follow-up visit at&#xD;
      one year to a Cardiology nurse. This is according to clinical routine for patients in Sweden&#xD;
      with and age &lt;75 years. At this visit quality of life parameters (EQ-5D) will be entered into&#xD;
      the the Swedish quality registry for secondary prevention according to clinical routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will have the possibility to stop enrolment due to&#xD;
      perceived increased risk to patients in the FFR-group only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No follow-up of adverse events is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All MIs and unplanned revascularization (PCI/CABG) will be adjudicated by the Clinical Events&#xD;
      Adjudication (CEA) group at Uppsala Clinical Research Centre (UCR). The CEA charter defines&#xD;
      the specific criteria and definitions of the endpoints. The adjudication decision will be&#xD;
      entered in a CEA database, handled by UCR. All details of the event definitions and the&#xD;
      adjudication process are described in detail in the CEA charter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data defined as study data will be recorded in an electronic data capture system (EDC) at&#xD;
      UCR. Access to data sets with information on allocated treatment, or data summaries presented&#xD;
      by treatment, will be restricted and documented to decrease the risk of bias due to&#xD;
      non-blinded decisions during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be evaluated for compliance with the protocol and accuracy in relation to source&#xD;
      documents which means that regular data checks for completeness of the variables in the EDC&#xD;
      system will be done and follow-up of informed consent. The study will be conducted in&#xD;
      accordance with procedures identified in the protocol. Regular monitoring will be performed.&#xD;
      Following written standard operating procedures, the monitors will verify that the clinical&#xD;
      trial is conducted and data are generated, documented and reported in compliance with the&#xD;
      protocol and the applicable regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses will primarily be performed on the intention-to-treat (ITT) set, defined as all&#xD;
      intentionally randomized patients, by randomized treatment. All statistical tests will be&#xD;
      performed on the 5% significance level using two-sided tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All endpoints will be presented as Kaplan-Meier plots and frequency tables at 30 days and 1&#xD;
      year, by randomized treatment, and analysed using Cox proportional hazards regression with&#xD;
      randomized treatment, country, and gender as factors, and age as a continuous covariate, and&#xD;
      treatment contrasts presented as hazard ratios with 95% confidence interval and associated&#xD;
      p-values. The primary analysis will be based on events of all follow-up time of each patient&#xD;
      at time of data base lock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation is based on the patients with 2- or 3-vessel disease in the TASTE&#xD;
      trial. This group constitutes 3138 patients, of which 208 died and 312 had a composite event&#xD;
      of death or rehospitalization with myocardial infarction within 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4052 patients (2026 per arm) would give 80% power to detect a relative risk reduction of 25%&#xD;
      at one year in the composite of all-cause death and myocardial infarction, for FFR-guided&#xD;
      non-culprit PCI against conservative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following publication of the COMPLETE trial in September 2019, enrollment into the FULL&#xD;
      REVASC trial was stopped. See publication in American Heart Journal 2021 - FULL REVASC Design&#xD;
      and Rationale, Böhm et al. for details. A new power calculation was performed and the 1,545&#xD;
      patients will be followed for at least 2.75 years after last patient in (june 2022) to reach&#xD;
      at least a total of 346 events (death, MI and unplanned revascularization). The study is now&#xD;
      event driven and the combined primary endpoint is changed to also include unplanned&#xD;
      revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting the study all centres will have a web-based start meeting with presentation&#xD;
      of the study, study procedures and documentation (Investigator Study File with Essential&#xD;
      Documents). The sponsor is responsible for performing remote monitoring, no on-site&#xD;
      monitoring is planned. Data from the randomization module (registry data) will be evaluated&#xD;
      for protocol compliance and logs for signed informed consents will be sent to Sponsor for&#xD;
      follow-up. The monitoring activities will be described in detail in the monitoring plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator or designee (PCI operators) will record data from the source into the SCAAR&#xD;
      registry or through an EDC system in countries outside the SCAAR platform. Data fields should&#xD;
      not be left blank. Also, discharging doctors will record data in the Swedish Register of&#xD;
      Information and Knowledge about Swedish Heart Intensive Care Admissions and in corresponding&#xD;
      registries in other participating countries. Data will be entered in Heart Surgery Registries&#xD;
      for patients with CABG (in Sweden and in other countries where possible).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistician will analyse the original registry data regarding components of the primary&#xD;
      endpoint and report to the DSMB.&#xD;
