  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will help elucidate the mechanism underlying the cardioprotective and&#xD;
      anti-diabetes effect of dietary fiber by exploring a comprehensive set of inflammatory and&#xD;
      oxidative stress markers, based on a contemporary understanding of this process. In addition,&#xD;
      there have been very few studies that explored the immediate change in oxidative stress and&#xD;
      incretin secretion after fiber intake. In this study, the investigators will be able assess&#xD;
      the short term metabolic impact of dietary fiber at great details. The result will contribute&#xD;
      to dietary recommendation or designing of fiber supplementation for prevention/treatment of&#xD;
      diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;

      Baseline labs include complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP),&#xD;
      Hemoglobin A1C, and lipid profile. All labs will be drawn in the fasting state&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Subjects will arrive after having fasted overnight (10 hours) at 7 to 7:30 am. An&#xD;
      indwelling intravenous cannula will be placed in the anterior cubital vein for blood draws. A&#xD;
      blood sample of the research labs and a urine sample will be collected. Blood pressure, heart&#xD;
      rate and weight will be measured. Subjects will consume either a High Fat High Calorie (HFHC)&#xD;
      meal or HFHC meal plus fiber (FiberOne Original cereal) according to randomization. Fiber&#xD;
      will be consumed before and after the HFHC meal (28 grams in total, 14 grams before and after&#xD;
      the meal). HFHC meal includes an egg muffin sandwich, a sausage muffin sandwich and two hash&#xD;
      browns which contain 88g carbohydrate, 51 g fat (33% saturated) and 34 g protein. 35 ml of&#xD;
      blood will be obtained at 1h , 2h, 3h and 5 h and 5 ml at 15 min,30 min,45 min,75 min and 90&#xD;
      min. A total of 165 ml (11 tablespoon) blood will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Visit 2: Subjects will return 1 week later after overnight fasting (10 hours) at 7 to 7:30&#xD;
      am. Blood pressure, heart rate and weight will be measured. Baseline blood and urine samples&#xD;
      will be collected again and subjects will be crossed over to receive the second meal (HFHC&#xD;
      only or HFHC with fiber). Visit details are similar to visit 1. After this, the subject will&#xD;
      be discharged from the study.&#xD;
