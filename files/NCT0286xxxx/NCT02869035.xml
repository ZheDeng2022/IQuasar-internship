    <textblock>
      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is one of the most severe and frequently occurring brain&#xD;
      disorders worldwide. It has been linked to serotonergic dysfunction, sexual dysfunction,&#xD;
      vulnerability to stress and neuro-inflammation. However, at the same time the etiological&#xD;
      understanding is limited. Most antidepressants act on the serotonin (5- HT) system, yet&#xD;
      between 30-50 % of patients with MDD does not respond successfully to 5-HT acting drugs.&#xD;
      Recent experimental models from our group suggest that cerebral 5-HT levels in vivo can be&#xD;
      indexed through molecular brain imaging of the 5-HT 4 receptor (5-HT4R) with a novel Positron&#xD;
      Emission Tomography (PET) ligand (11C-SB207145). Also, our human studies have confirmed that&#xD;
      cerebral synaptic 5-HT is inversely related to 5-HT4R binding and this technique thus can be&#xD;
      used to investigate the role of 5-HT tone in the brain in MDD with differential responses to&#xD;
      standard antidepressant treatment. By using multimodal neuroimaging technology, we aim to&#xD;
      determine the status of the 5-HT system prior to and after either successful or failed&#xD;
      neuropharmacological intervention in a non-randomized longitudinal open clinical trial. 100&#xD;
      untreated patients with moderate to severe MDD will be included. Data collection from various&#xD;
      neurobiological domains (i.e, 5-HT4R PET imaging, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),&#xD;
      functional MRI (fMRI), electroencephalogram (EEG), psychometrics, neuropsychological tests,&#xD;
      and peripheral biomarkers) will be conducted before, during and after 12 weeks of&#xD;
      antidepressant treatment. The objective is to identify predictors of pharmacological&#xD;
      antidepressant treatment response in depressed individuals before and after 8 weeks of&#xD;
      antidepressant treatment.&#xD;

      Study population and study program:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited through a unique new central referral site for &quot;depression&#xD;
      packages&quot; in The Mental Health Services in the Capital Region of Denmark. 100 patients with&#xD;
      MDD, 18-65 years of age, with moderate to severe single or recurrent episode of MDD (Hamilton&#xD;
      17 item (HAMD-17) score &gt; 17) will be recruited through this portal. All diagnoses will be&#xD;
      confirmed by a specialist in psychiatry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before initiation of pharmacological antidepressant treatment with escitalopram, patients&#xD;
      will receive baseline examinations as follows: 1) 5-HT4R imaging with 11C-SB207145 PET-scan,&#xD;
      2) EEG examinations, 3) structural MRI, 4) functional MRI , 5) neuropsychological testing, 6)&#xD;
      peripheral markers of immune-active cell responses, oxidative stress, cortisol-levels, RNA,&#xD;
      genotypes and epigenetic factors will be measured in urine, saliva and peripheral blood at&#xD;
      baseline and across the study period. Repeated measures across the study period include: 7)&#xD;
      psychometrics by using self-reported questionnaires covering trait and state, including&#xD;
      mental distress related to depression and other psychopathology, 8) neuropsychological&#xD;
      examinations as well as 9) clinical follow-up with interview based ratings of mental status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with escitalopram at flexible doses of 10-20 mg/day adjusted&#xD;
      depending on effects and side effects, and participate in clinical follow-up sessions at week&#xD;
      1, 2, 4 and 8. Patients with no response to escitalopram after 4 weeks will be shifted to a&#xD;
      secondary pharmacological treatment (duloxetine). A final visit to determine longer-term&#xD;
      clinical outcome will be performed at week 12. Compliance, side-effects to antidepressant&#xD;
      treatment, and depressive symptoms will be monitored at each follow-up session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Hamilton 6 items (HAMD-6) subscale has recently shown to be more sensitive to&#xD;
      antidepressant response (Østergaard et al), and will be used to identify treatment response&#xD;
      in patients. Patients with &gt; 50 % reduction in HAMD-6 after 4 weeks will be defined as early&#xD;
      responders, and those with additional &lt; 5 points on the HAMD-6 scale after 8 weeks will be&#xD;
      considered in remission. Patients with &gt;25% response at week 4 and &lt; 50% reduction in HAMD-6&#xD;
      after full intervention will be considered non-responders. The assessment program including&#xD;
      brain imaging with PET 11C-SB207145 will be conducted before drug intervention is initiated&#xD;
      and, depending on treatment outcome, again after 8 weeks of antidepressant treatment in 20&#xD;
      patients in remission (remitters) and 20 non-responding patients (non-responders).&#xD;
&#xD;
      UPDATE: As per April 3, 2017 the rescanned group has been expanded to include various&#xD;
      response patterns in order to capture rescan data from patients on a spectrum from poor to&#xD;
      excellent treatment response, since out of the first 17 included patients only 1 patient&#xD;
      fulfilled the non-responder criterion defined above. Accordingly, the clinical outcome&#xD;
      parameter in the context will be changes in HAM-D6 from baseline at week 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy controls:&#xD;
&#xD;
      From previous studies conducted at the Neurobiological Research Unit, there is access to&#xD;
      brain imaging data and baseline PET-SB207145 brain images among healthy controls as well as&#xD;
      an associated biobank with stored blood specimens. During the trial, additional healthy&#xD;
      controls will be included and will receive baseline examinations and repeated&#xD;
      neuropsychological testing after 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 5-HT4R binding (as imaged by 11C-SB207145 PET) before treatment will predict&#xD;
           antidepressant treatment outcome (remission vs non-response) in depressed patients;&#xD;
           higher binding at baseline is hypothesized to be associated with a better treatment&#xD;
           outcome. Likewise, secondary, 5-HT4R binding (as imaged by 11C-SB207145 PET) before&#xD;
           treatment is expected to be associated with the magnitude of change from baseline in&#xD;
           Hamilton score (HAMD-6) at 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Remitters will display a greater reduction in 5-HT4R binding (as imaged by 11C-SB207145&#xD;
           PET) after antidepressant treatment relative to non-responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients with MDD will have a higher 5-HT4R binding (as imaged by 11C-SB207145 PET)&#xD;
           relative to healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. High amygdala reactivity in an &quot;emotional faces&quot; fMRI paradigm before treatment predicts&#xD;
           remission in response to antidepressant treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Amygdala response to exposure to negative emotional faces (fear and anger) and cerebral&#xD;
           5-HT4R binding is expected to be associated, both in cross-sectional comparison before&#xD;
           treatment and with regard to longitudinal changes (changes from baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. In resting state fMRI (rsfMRI), we expect that changes from baseline in a functional&#xD;
           network centered around dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and other networks centered around&#xD;
           anterior cingulate cortex and posterior cingulate cortex (default mode network)&#xD;
           respectively will predict treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Low activity in a brain network engaged in reward processing (as assessed by fMRI) will&#xD;
           predict antidepressant treatment response (i.e. positive association between low&#xD;
           activity and remitter- relative to non-responder group) both in cross-sectional&#xD;
           comparison before treatment and with regard to longitudinal changes (changes from&#xD;
           baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. We expect reduced evoked gamma-activity measured with EEG and &quot;Event-related-potentials&quot;&#xD;
           (ERP) in MDD patients compared to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Using EEG/ERP, we expect reduced alpha and theta cordance and higher theta band activity&#xD;
           among remitters measured at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Higher levels of systemic inflammation will predict poor cognitive function at baseline,&#xD;
           and a poor antidepressant treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. A blunted cortisol awakening response (CAR) at baseline will predict a positive&#xD;
           antidepressant treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Restored HPA-axis dynamics (increased CAR compared to baseline) at week 8 will be&#xD;
           associated with a positive treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. There will be a significant association between functional networks found by EEG and&#xD;
           fMRI, both at baseline and as contrast between remitters and non-responders after 8&#xD;
           weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. Hippocampal volume will predict treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
       15. Patients with a low 5-HT4R binding (as imaged by 11C-SB207145 PET) at baseline before&#xD;
           treatment will have a lower libido relative to patients with a high binding.&#xD;
&#xD;
       16. Patients who respond to antidepressant treatment with the most pronounced changes in&#xD;
           5-HT4R binding (as imaged by 11C-SB207145) will experience a larger degree of sexual&#xD;
           side-effects; i.e., the magnitude of 5-HT4R binding changes from baseline will be&#xD;
           positively associated with the degree of sexual side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
       17. Childhood abuse (defined by a composite measure of early life stress questionnaires) and&#xD;
           anxious depression (defined as anxiety/somatization factor score in HAMD-17 &gt; 7)&#xD;
           predicts poor antidepressant treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
       18. We expect urinary markers of oxidatively generated DNA/RNA damage to increase more in&#xD;
           responders than in non-responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
       19. With an exploratory approach it will be possible to identify a set of predictors of&#xD;
           antidepressant treatment outcome. This explorative analysis includes genetics,&#xD;
           epigenetics, peripheral and central neurobiological characteristics, neuropsychology&#xD;
           testing outcomes, psychometry including self-reported mental distress, both&#xD;
           cross-sectional at baseline and as longitudinal measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol complies with the Declaration of Helsinki II and approval by all relevant&#xD;
      authorities will be obtained before initiation. All human volunteers will receive oral and&#xD;
      written information about the given study and provide written informed consent before&#xD;
      enrolment. The trial is monitored by a Good Clinical Practise unit for the relevant domains.&#xD;
