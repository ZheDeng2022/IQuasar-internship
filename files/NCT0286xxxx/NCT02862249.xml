  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced cirrhosis have enteric dysbiosis with small bowel bacterial overgrowth&#xD;
      and translocation of bacteria and their products across the gut epithelial barrier. This&#xD;
      culminates in systemic inflammation and endotoxemia which induces innate immune dysfunction&#xD;
      predisposing to infection and development of complications such as bleeding, sepsis and&#xD;
      hepatic encephalopathy. It also plays a key role in the natural history of cirrhosis by&#xD;
      influencing the rate of progression to advanced liver disease and terminal liver failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose an intervention utilising Faecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT)&#xD;
      from a healthy donor to modify the gut microbiome alleviating gut dysbiosis and immune&#xD;
      dysfunction. This may ultimately reduce the progression to chronic liver failure and the&#xD;
      development of infection and organ dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study will be to assess whether stabilising gut dysbiosis with&#xD;
      FMT in patients with advanced cirrhosis is both feasible and safe.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Humans are colonized by a diverse range of microbes, the most abundantly inhabited being the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract which anatomically commences at the oral mucosa, with the colonic&#xD;
      lumen being the most densely populated. The gut microbiota consist mainly of bacteria, but it&#xD;
      is worth remembering that fungi, viruses, archaea and protozoa are also resident and active.&#xD;
      As a composite, these micro-organisms outnumber human cells by a factor of ten. Humans can&#xD;
      carry up to two kilograms of microbes within our gut, and these tens of trillions of&#xD;
      micro-organisms have been referred to as the 'last human organ.' Whilst these microbes&#xD;
      consist of over three million genes, or an impressive 150 times the number contained within&#xD;
      our own genome, two thirds of the entire gut microbiome is unique to each individual.&#xD;
      Furthermore although the gut microbiome consists of greater than 1,000 species of bacteria;&#xD;
      approximately 170 species predominate in any given individual with Bacteroidetes and&#xD;
      Firmicutes being the dominant phyla. The diverse and complex role played by the gut&#xD;
      microbiome includes the development and modulation of the innate and adaptive immune systems;&#xD;
      both locally within the intestinal mucosa with defense against pathogens and tumorigenesis,&#xD;
      and systemically. Dietary and homeostatic functions pertain to the biosynthesis of vitamins,&#xD;
      metabolism of glucose, bile salts and xyloglucans, and the liberation of short-chain fatty&#xD;
      acids (SCFAs) from otherwise indigestible dietary starches, mainly by bacteria from the&#xD;
      Bacteroidetes phylum. SCFAs have immune-signaling and anti-inflammatory properties and are a&#xD;
      vital source of energy for intestinal mucosal cells helping to maintain intestinal integrity&#xD;
      and barrier function. A change to the gut microbiome therefore impacts on a multitude of&#xD;
      vital homeostatic functions, many of which the human host cannot perform independently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technological advances in genomic sequencing and bioanalytics are beginning to revolutionize&#xD;
      our understanding of the gut microbiome in relation to hepatological diseases. Further&#xD;
      insights are now being gained with the unraveling of some of the complex mechanisms that&#xD;
      contribute to the commensal and synergistic interactions between the host and our microbiome,&#xD;
      and the downstream mechanistic effects in both normal physiology and when these processes are&#xD;
      disturbed inducing pathology. It is well established that patients with cirrhosis have&#xD;
      enteric dysbiosis with small bowel bacterial overgrowth and translocation of bacteria and&#xD;
      their products (such as lipopolysaccharide and bacterial DNA) across a more permeable gut&#xD;
      epithelial barrier which is exacerbated by underlying portal hypertension and endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction. This culminates in systemic inflammation and endotoxemia which induces innate&#xD;
      immune dysfunction via toll-like receptor signaling, predisposing to infection and&#xD;
      development of decompensating complications such as haemorrhage, sepsis and hepatic&#xD;
      encephalopathy (HE). Indeed, it is widely recognised that intestinal decontamination with&#xD;
      non-absorbable antibiotics such as rifaximin is an effective treatment for HE. This&#xD;
      implicates gut dysbiosis and the ensuing metabolic sequelae involving intestinal absorption&#xD;
      of nitrogenous compounds in the progression of neurocognitive dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enteric dysbiosis has also been linked to progression to advanced liver disease. Utilising&#xD;
      quantitative metagenomics it has been recently shown that 75,245 microbial genes differ in&#xD;
      abundance between patients with cirrhosis and healthy individuals, and of relevance that over&#xD;
      50% of these taxonomically assigned bacterial species are of buccal origin suggesting an&#xD;
      invasion of the gut from the mouth in cirrhosis. Salivary dysbiosis, represented by a&#xD;
      reduction in autochthonous bacteria, is also present and to an extent reflects the changes&#xD;
      seen in the faecal microbiota in cirrhosis, with an associated systemic and salivary-specific&#xD;
      inflammatory milieu.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of note salivary dysbiosis is more pronounced in patients that go on to be hospitalized&#xD;
      during 90-day followup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This implies a causative role particularly when considering that cirrhotic saliva is enriched&#xD;
      with genes related to endotoxin synthesis proteins, and nucleic acid and vitamin metabolism,&#xD;
      the latter of which are purported to modulate intestinal barrier integrity and oxidative&#xD;
      stress. Modulating the gut microbiota in patients with cirrhosis with the non-absorbable&#xD;
      antibiotic rifaximin has been associated with improved cognitive performance and reduction in&#xD;
      endotoxemia in patients with cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the investigators have recently performed a multicentre retrospective study&#xD;
      including 170 patients in which rifaximin therapy given for 90-days significantly (i) reduced&#xD;
      hospital re-admission rates after 3 months treatment, impacting significantly on the NHS&#xD;
      resource burden and (ii) reduced overall liver disease severity [as measured by the Child&#xD;
      Pugh and Model for End Stage Liver Disease scores raising the possibility that modulation of&#xD;
      gut microbiota may significantly modify the natural history of chronic liver failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data constitute in the investigators' view &quot;proof of principle&quot; that modifying the gut&#xD;
      microbiota in patients with cirrhosis improves clinical outcomes. Rifaximin was approved by&#xD;
      NICE for the prevention of the recurrence of overt hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis, but&#xD;
      considerable concern remains regarding whether long term antibiotic prescription will result&#xD;
      in a change in bacterial function and virulence rather than a simple reduction in bacterial&#xD;
      population and whether this may drive bacterial resistance to antibiotics in an already&#xD;
      functional immunocompromised population. The question therefore is raised as to whether&#xD;
      directly, as opposed to indirectly modulating the gut microbiota utilising faeces from&#xD;
      healthy donors may be a safer and more durable therapy. Faecal microbiota transplantation&#xD;
      (FMT) is a well-established treatment to stably modify the gut microbiome and has been shown&#xD;
      to be safe and efficacious in several disease states resulting from gut dysbiosis including&#xD;
      Clostrium difficile infection [NICE approved] and inflammatory bowel disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that in patients with advanced cirrhosis FMT may reduce the&#xD;
      progression to chronic liver failure including jaundice, accumulation of fluid within the&#xD;
      abdominal cavity, bleeding, encephalopathy and the development of infection and organ&#xD;
      dysfunction. Whether FMT is feasible in the setting of liver cirrhosis remains to be&#xD;
      investigated. A trial is proposed to determine whether a FMT from a healthy donor to a&#xD;
      patient with advanced cirrhosis is both feasible and safe.&#xD;
