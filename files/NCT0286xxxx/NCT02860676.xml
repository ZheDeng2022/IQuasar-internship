  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the safety of the investigational drug called&#xD;
      cirmtuzumab when given for a duration of 6 to 12 months. Cirmtuzumab is a type of drug called&#xD;
      a monoclonal antibody. This drug is designed to attach to a protein called ROR1 that is on&#xD;
      the surface of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. This blocks growth and survival of&#xD;
      the CLL cells. ROR1 is rarely expressed on healthy cells so this drug should target the&#xD;
      cancer cells. Cirmtuzumab is considered experimental because its use is not approved by&#xD;
      United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is evidence from tests on laboratory animals that cirmtuzumab can decrease the&#xD;
      number of CLL cells, the investigators do not know if this will work in humans. Therefore,&#xD;
      the goal of this study is to see if cirmtuzumab is safe and tolerable in study participants&#xD;
      when given for a duration of 6 to 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label extension study to determine the safety and tolerability of cirmtuzumab&#xD;
      given to participants who enrolled and completed the initial phase 1 trial in CLL without a&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UC-961 is administered by intravenous infusion every 14 days for 4 doses, then every 28 days&#xD;
      for 4 doses, after which responses will be assessed. Patients with an objective response&#xD;
      (meeting working group criteria for partial response or complete response) will continue at&#xD;
      the same dose and schema. Patients with stable disease or progressive disease are eligible to&#xD;
      increase the dose of UC-961 for another 6-month course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of UC-961 administration is until disease progression, treatment intolerance, or&#xD;
      lack of clinical benefit.&#xD;
