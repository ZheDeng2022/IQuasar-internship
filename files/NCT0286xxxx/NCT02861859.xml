  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether adding olanzapine 5mg to standard antiemetic&#xD;
      medication can significantly reduce chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in breast cancer&#xD;
      patients receiving emetogenic chemotherapy regimens such as anthracycline with&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy and platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To help clinicians prescribe antiemetic medications in a more patient-centered,&#xD;
      evidence-based and cost-effective manner, we've developed the world's first validated&#xD;
      risk-stratification tool for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) and because of&#xD;
      this, it is now possible to perform a trial of personalized precision antiemetic therapy for&#xD;
      breast cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite widespread antiemetic use, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) remains&#xD;
      among the most feared and expected side effects of chemotherapy for breast cancer.&#xD;
      Inadequately controlled CINV can significantly reduce a patient's quality of life, impair&#xD;
      functional activity, lead to chemotherapy dose delays and reductions, and even&#xD;
      discontinuation of treatment. The merit of current antiemetic medications is based on their&#xD;
      ability to control chemotherapy-induced vomiting, but not necessarily nausea, and nausea is&#xD;
      the major issue for breast cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With olanzapine demonstrating significant promise in preventing acute and delayed nausea, the&#xD;
      investigators are proposing to evaluate guideline-recommended aprepitant-based triple regimen&#xD;
      compared to the same regimen plus olanzapine (5 mg) for patients at high personal risk for&#xD;
      CINV. For patients at low personal risk for CINV the investigators will also evaluate&#xD;
      guideline-recommended double antiemetic regimen compared to the same regimen plus olanzapine&#xD;
      (5 mg).&#xD;
