      Carcinomas of the salivary glands (SGCs) are rare tumors. Some selected salivary gland&#xD;
      histotypes such as salivary duct carcinomas (SDC) and adenocarcinomas, NOS (not otherwise&#xD;
      specified) distinguish themselves for the expression of androgen receptors (AR), which is&#xD;
      reported in 21% to 43% of the cases. Thus, similarly to prostate cancer (Pca), androgen&#xD;
      deprivation therapy (ADT) has been suggested to be beneficial in patients with recurrent or&#xD;
      disseminated AR-expressing disease. No other therapy except palliative chemotherapy is&#xD;
      available after progression on ADT, thus underling the necessity of alternative therapeutic&#xD;
      approaches.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Carcinomas of the salivary glands (SGC) are rare tumors. They comprise less than 1% of all&#xD;
      cancers of the head and neck. The standard treatment is surgical excision, followed by&#xD;
      radiotherapy in selected cases, such as high-grade tumors, and/or in the presence of&#xD;
      perineural invasion, and/or in the presence of advanced disease. Some selected salivary gland&#xD;
      histotypes such as salivary duct carcinomas (SDC) and adenocarcinomas, NOS (not otherwise&#xD;
      specified) distinguish themselves for the expression of androgen receptors (AR), which is&#xD;
      reported in 21% to 43% of the cases. Thus, similarly to prostate cancer (Pca), androgen&#xD;
      deprivation therapy (ADT) has been suggested to be beneficial in patients with recurrent or&#xD;
      disseminated AR-expressing disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proven activity of ADT in AR expressing SGC as well as in Pca, suggests a common clinical&#xD;
      behaviour by apparently sharing the same biological background. Once Pca becomes resistant to&#xD;
      castration it still remains driven by ligand-dependent AR signaling and further hormonal&#xD;
      manipulations are active and efficacious. Abiraterone acetate is currently approved by FDA&#xD;
      for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). We treated with abiraterone two patients&#xD;
      with AR-positive adenocarcinoma who had progressed on ADT, both patients showed a partial&#xD;
      response suggesting the activity of a second line hormonal therapy in SGCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above biological and clinical evidences, the aim of the trial is to assess the&#xD;
      activity of abiraterone in AR-expressing castration resistant SGCs.&#xD;
