  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the data on the active ingredients of Totum-63, this research aims to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of its chronic consumption (24 weeks) on glucose and lipid homeostasis and especially&#xD;
      on fasting plasma glucose in volunteers with abdominal obesity associated with impaired&#xD;
      glucose tolerance or untreated type 2 diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia. This clinical study&#xD;
      is designed to estimate the effect of Totum-63, active ingredient of Valedia, on several&#xD;
      glucose and lipid homeostasis related parameters since these data are still unknown for this&#xD;
      specific dietary supplement formula. Collected data will provide more reliable information&#xD;
      which may be used to plan a subsequent larger main study.&#xD;

      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the present trial is to assess the beneficial effect of Totum-63&#xD;
      compared to a placebo on glucose homeostasis assessed by the fasting plasma glucose level in&#xD;
      prediabetics or untreated type 2 diabetics after 24 weeks of consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of the study are to assess the efficacy of Totum-63 compared to a&#xD;
      placebo in prediabetics or untreated type 2 diabetics after 12 and 24 weeks of consumption&#xD;
      through the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glucose homeostasis assessed by fasting plasma glucose level (after 12 weeks of&#xD;
           consumption only), fasting blood HbA1c and fructosamine levels, OGTT (Oral Glucose&#xD;
           Tolerance Test after 24 weeks of consumption only), insulinemic and glycemic parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pancreatic beta-cells function and insulin sensitivity assessed by fasting blood insulin&#xD;
           level, HOMA-IR (Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance), HOMA-β, QUICKI&#xD;
           (Quantitative Insulin sensitivity Check Index), ISI-M (Matsuda-DeFronzo Insulin&#xD;
           Sensitivity Index after 24 weeks of consumption only), OGIS (Oral Glucose Insulin&#xD;
           Sensitivity after 24 weeks of consumption only) and PREDIM (PREDIcted M after 24 weeks&#xD;
           of consumption only) indexes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lipid homeostasis assessed by fasting blood levels of triglycerides (TG), Total&#xD;
           Cholesterol (TC), HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and NEFA (Non-Esterified Fatty&#xD;
           Acids).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oxidation mechanism of circulating lipids assessed by the ratio fasting blood LDLox /&#xD;
           fasting blood LDLc and the PON-1 (paraoxonase-1, arylesterase activity) activity in&#xD;
           blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Low grade inflammation assessed by fasting blood hsCRP level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hepatic function assessed by fasting blood total bilirubin level, GGT, ASAT and ALAT&#xD;
           activities in blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemodynamics assessed by Heart Rate (HR), Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), Diastolic Blood&#xD;
           Pressure (DBP).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometrics assessed by Body Weight (BW), Waist Circumference (WC), Hip&#xD;
           Circumference (HC) and Waist to Hip Ratio (WHR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Satiety assessed by the three-day food diary energy and nutrient intake parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following criteria assessed after 24 weeks of study product consumption participate to&#xD;
      the objectives of safety check:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Renal function assessed by fasting blood creatinine and urea level;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete blood count.&#xD;
