      Early Phase I Study of the Safety and Preliminary Efficacy of Human Fetal Retinal Pigment&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a perspective, single-arm and open-labeled investigation of the safety and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of unilateral subretinal transplantation of fRPE cells in subjects with&#xD;
      dry Age-Related Macular Degeneration and non-exudative AMD. The investigators will recruit&#xD;
      and enroll 6 patients based on specific inclusive/exclusive criteria. Experimental and&#xD;
      self-controlled eye will be determined based on best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). The eye&#xD;
      with BCVA of no more than 20/400 will be determined as experimental eye, which will be&#xD;
      divided into 3 groups and undergo subretinal injection of 3 different dosages of fRPE cells&#xD;
      (100.000, 200,000 or 500,000) respectively, while the other one (BCVA of more than or equal&#xD;
      to 20/400) as control eye, will not receive the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      fRPE cells will be obtained from the fetuses aborted in the Department of Obstetrics and&#xD;
      Gynecology in Jiangsu Province Hospital from 2015 to 2018. The obtained fRPE cells will meet&#xD;
      specific inclusive/exclusive criteria and conform to Good manufacturing practices (GMP). fRPE&#xD;
      will be transplanted by a board-certified vitreoretinal surgeon, which will be administered&#xD;
      into the subretinal space of experimental eye through a standard surgical approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunosuppressive agents will be administered orally to all subjects after transplantation.&#xD;
      Dosage and time duration of immunosuppressive agents will be regulated strictly relying on&#xD;
      the condition of immune rejection. Subjects will be monitored with ophthalmologic and&#xD;
      systemic examinations frequently at regular post-transplant intervals after fRPE cell&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
