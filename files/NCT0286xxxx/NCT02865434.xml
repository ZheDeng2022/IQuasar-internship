      A Manocept Platform prospective, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation, safety with PK and&#xD;
      dosimetry study of injected Tc 99m tilmanocept in the detection of and assessment of&#xD;
      localization to skeletal joints in subjects with and without active RA by SPECT imaging. All&#xD;
      subjects will receive IV administration at one of 3 mass doses: 50 µg, 200 µg, or 400 µg.&#xD;
      Within each mass dose group, subjects will receive Tc 99m tilmanocept labeled with one of 3&#xD;
      radiolabel doses: 1 mCi, 5 mCi, or 10 mCi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will have a whole body planar SPECT scan. Subjects enrolled in Groups 1-9 will&#xD;
      receive a whole body and planar hands scan followed by SPECT/CT scans on areas of interest&#xD;
      post injection at 60 minutes ± 15 minutes and 180 minutes ± 15 minutes. Subjects enrolled in&#xD;
      Groups 10-11 will receive a whole body planar SPECT scan performed at 4 specified time points&#xD;
      post injection: 15 ± 5 minutes, 60 ± 15 minutes, 180 ± 15 minutes and 18-20 hours. Planar&#xD;
      hand scans will be collected at 60 ± 15 minutes and 180 ± 15 minutes post-injection. PK blood&#xD;
      sampling will be performed before injection (within 15 minutes), immediately following&#xD;
      injection (within 5 minutes) and at each scanning timepoint. Dosimetry tests will be&#xD;
      performed at each scanning timepoint. PK of urine will be assessed through counts of the&#xD;
      bladder wall obtained from cumulative quantitative planar imaging from radiation dosimetry.&#xD;

    <description>Tc 99m Tilmanocept localization is defined as the visually (i.e., qualitatively) determined binary categorization of Tc 99m tilmanocept activity in a given DAS28 joint. The purpose of the visual assessments is to obtain dichotomized classifications of tracer uptake (herein referenced as 'localization') on planar images. Per subject localization rate is the number of subjects with at least one localized DAS28 joint per number of subjects in the analysis population.</description>

Results were obtained at the subject level from Hybrid Dosimetry™ Version 2.8.3 and OLINDA/EXM® Version 2.1RC93 in accordance with NAV3-21 Protocol Amendment 6. The Hybrid Dosimetry™ function provides an efficient way to generate kinetic data for selected organs via regions of interest (ROI) drawing. From this data, residence times are calculated and transferred to OLINDA/EXM®, which generates absorbed dose tables using the MIRD methodology.</description>

        <title>Per Subject Localization Rate of Tc 99m Tilmanocept by SPECT Imaging</title>
        <description>Tc 99m Tilmanocept localization is defined as the visually (i.e., qualitatively) determined binary categorization of Tc 99m tilmanocept activity in a given DAS28 joint. The purpose of the visual assessments is to obtain dichotomized classifications of tracer uptake (herein referenced as 'localization') on planar images. Per subject localization rate is the number of subjects with at least one localized DAS28 joint per number of subjects in the analysis population.</description>

Results were obtained at the subject level from Hybrid Dosimetry™ Version 2.8.3 and OLINDA/EXM® Version 2.1RC93 in accordance with NAV3-21 Protocol Amendment 6. The Hybrid Dosimetry™ function provides an efficient way to generate kinetic data for selected organs via regions of interest (ROI) drawing. From this data, residence times are calculated and transferred to OLINDA/EXM®, which generates absorbed dose tables using the MIRD methodology.</description>

Results were obtained at the subject level from Hybrid Dosimetry™ Version 2.8.3 and OLINDA/EXM® Version 2.1RC93 in accordance with NAV3-21 Protocol Amendment 6. The Hybrid Dosimetry™ function provides an efficient way to generate kinetic data for selected organs via regions of interest (ROI) drawing. From this data, residence times are calculated and transferred to OLINDA/EXM®, which generates absorbed dose tables using the MIRD methodology.</description>
