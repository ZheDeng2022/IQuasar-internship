    <textblock>
      This is a single site, open-label, non-randomized, dose escalation phase I study designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, the tolerability and the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of SXL01, a&#xD;
      synthetic small interfering ribonucleic acid (RNA) targeting the androgen receptor messenger&#xD;
      RNA (mRNA), in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard method &quot;3+3&quot; will be used for dose escalation. A maximum of 30 patients will&#xD;
      complete the dose-escalation phase of the study; 12 additional patients will be included at&#xD;
      the RP2D in the expansion phase.&#xD;
