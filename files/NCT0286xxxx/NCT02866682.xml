  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the patents for brand-name immunosuppressive medications expire, there is increasing&#xD;
      interest in using generic immunosuppressive drugs. However, despite pharmacokinetic studies&#xD;
      showing bioequivalence, questions remain regarding the clinical impact of use of generic&#xD;
      immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most important immunosuppressive agent in the modern transplant era is arguably&#xD;
      tacrolimus, a calcineurin-inhibitor with a narrow therapeutic index. This study seeks to&#xD;
      answer the question regarding the clinical impact of generic tacrolimus use as measured&#xD;
      primarily by acute rejection, loss of graft function, and patient death through a randomized&#xD;
      trial of 2 phases: Brand tacrolimus only, and Generic A tacrolimus only. Given that kidney&#xD;
      transplantations are the most commonly performed transplants with well-defined measures of&#xD;
      rejection and graft failure, this organs will be studied in a six-center study designed to&#xD;
      accrue the target number of transplant recipients within the one-year study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has now been branched off into 2 phases. Phase 1: consists of randomization of&#xD;
      patients onto brand and generic tacrolimus. This was completed once 40 brand patients were&#xD;
      enrolled. Phase 2: consists of patients being enrolled only on generic tacrolimus (standard&#xD;
      of care from subject's insurance). This will be completed once there is a total of 160&#xD;
      generic participants. 200 participants total in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter, parallel, observational study to assess&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of 200 kidney transplant recipients comparing brand tacrolimus to generic&#xD;
      tacrolimus over a one year follow up period. All subjects will receive other&#xD;
      immunosuppressive medications including induction therapy (thymoglobulin, basiliximab, or no&#xD;
      induction) and maintenance including mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroid therapy as&#xD;
      directed by standard-of-care at each center. Their medication information will be recorded in&#xD;
      their study files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population includes recipients of kidney allografts in the first 14 days after&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The totals of 7 visits over 12 months period are planned as follows. The blood samples&#xD;
      specified below are for the translational research study labs. Subjects will continue to&#xD;
      receive routine labs as part of their standard of care from their treating physician. These&#xD;
      safety labs are done as part of their stand of care from their treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject needs more study drug medication before his or her next study visit the&#xD;
      subject will come in to the clinic to get a new supply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First (Baseline) Visit (up to 14 days after transplant but before you are discharged from the&#xD;
      hospital):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review and sign this consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of your medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of your current medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of your physical exam including vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, pulse&#xD;
           and respiration rate), height and weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of clinical labs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive your study drug if you are in Part 1 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are a woman of child bearing potential, a pregnancy test will be completed prior to&#xD;
      the start of the study. If you are pregnant, you cannot participate in this research study.&#xD;
      You also cannot participate in this study if you are currently breastfeeding. You must use a&#xD;
      medically acceptable method of birth control during the 1-year study period and for 6 weeks&#xD;
      after the last dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible that after the study doctor reviews your medical history and test results, he&#xD;
      or she may tell you that you do not qualify to be in the study. If you do not qualify for the&#xD;
      study, the doctor will tell you the reason(s) why. If you cannot be in this research study,&#xD;
      you will not lose any medical benefits, you can still participate in other studies, and you&#xD;
      can still receive the standard treatment prescribed by your physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the Baseline Visit, you will have 6 additional study visits. These will be scheduled&#xD;
      for 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after your transplant surgery. The following will occur at&#xD;
      each visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Month 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9 Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of your current medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of your physical exam including vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, pulse&#xD;
           and respiration rate), height and weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of any changes in your health and any reactions to the study medication will be&#xD;
           recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of your routine standard of care lab results&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Return completed dosing diary and receive new dosing diary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive your study drug if you are in Part 1 of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Month 12 Visit (End of Study Visit):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of your current medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of any changes in your health and any reactions to the study medication will be&#xD;
           recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of your routine standard of care lab result&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Return your final completed dosing diary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Return any study drug remaining in your possession to the study team if you are in Part&#xD;
           1 of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are Part 1 and require more study medication before your next study visit, you will&#xD;
      come in to the clinic to get a new supply. If you are participating in Part 2, you will&#xD;
      obtain more study drug from your local pharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will continue having your routine blood and urine collections to monitor your kidney&#xD;
      function as part of your standard of care treatment at UCLA, UCSD, UCI, and UCD. The schedule&#xD;
      for these routine blood and urine collections will depend on your condition and will be at&#xD;
      your treating physician's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence will be measured with daily medication diaries and with the coefficient of&#xD;
      variation of tacrolimus in subjects' blood.&#xD;
