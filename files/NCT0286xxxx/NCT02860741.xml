    <textblock>
      Rural African Americans are disproportionately impacted by social stressors that place them&#xD;
      at risk for experiencing elevated depressive symptoms. This project will test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a culturally adapted behavioral activation intervention (REJOICE) for use&#xD;
      within rural African American churches. Further, this project will gather data on strategies&#xD;
      necessary to promote the successful implementation of this intervention within rural African&#xD;
      American churches.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rural African Americans are disproportionately exposed to numerous stressors such as poverty,&#xD;
      racism, and discrimination that place them at risk for experiencing elevated levels of&#xD;
      depressive symptoms. Elevated levels of depressive symptoms can lead to a host of negative&#xD;
      outcomes including both the development of and poor management of chronic illnesses (i.e.&#xD;
      hypertension, diabetes, etc.), poor social functioning, poor occupational functioning, and&#xD;
      development of clinical depression. Though effective treatments for decreasing depressive&#xD;
      symptoms exist, rural African Americans often fail to receive adequate and timely care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      African American churches have been identified as potential venues for providing depression&#xD;
      education and treatment for rural African Americans. Within the African American rural&#xD;
      community, churches represent a key portal through which a large proportion (as much as 85%)&#xD;
      of the African American community can be reached. Churches have been used to address physical&#xD;
      health outcomes in those communities but few have focused primarily on addressing mental&#xD;
      health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through the NIMHD funded project entitled, &quot;Faith Academic Initiatives to Transform Health&#xD;
      (FAITH) in the Delta&quot;, our partnership, consisting of faith community leaders and UAMS&#xD;
      researchers, culturally adapted an evidence-based behavioral activation intervention for use&#xD;
      with rural African American churches. This 8-session behavioral activation therapy was&#xD;
      adapted to include faith-based themes, Scripture, and other aspects of the rural African&#xD;
      American faith culture (e.g. bible studies, use of lay leaders to deliver the intervention).&#xD;
      In addition to assessing the effectiveness of our intervention, ascertaining ways to&#xD;
      implement this intervention with proper fidelity to maintain clinical outcomes is also&#xD;
      critically important to increase the efficiency of translating research into practice. Work&#xD;
      towards disseminating evidence-based depression interventions to &quot;real world&quot; settings is&#xD;
      particularly salient in addressing depression disparities, whereby rural African Americans&#xD;
      bear a disproportionate burden. Thus, this application proposes a Hybrid-2&#xD;
      pragmatic-effectiveness implementation trial that seeks to test the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      culturally adapted evidence-based intervention and gather preliminary data on the strategies&#xD;
      necessary to support successful implementation of this intervention in rural African American&#xD;
      churches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, this study aims to: 1) Refine a culturally appropriate, evidence-based&#xD;
      depression intervention (REJOICE) based on results from our NIMHD-funded pilot study, 2)&#xD;
      Determine whether REJOICE is superior to a usual-care control group at post treatment and a&#xD;
      3-month follow-up, 3) Collect pilot data regarding &quot;real world&quot; implementation strategies&#xD;
      (i.e. face to face training and coaching calls) on the uptake and maintenance of REJOICE in&#xD;
      rural African American churches.&#xD;
