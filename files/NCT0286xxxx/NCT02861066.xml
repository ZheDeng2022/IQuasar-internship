  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Symptoms of depression and anxiety are extremely prevalent in the population. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      patients often face barriers to accessing mental health care, particularly psychotherapeutic&#xD;
      interventions, including long wait-times and demanding therapeutic protocols. For instance,&#xD;
      Mindfulness-Based Therapy (MBT) has demonstrated effectiveness at decreasing symptoms of&#xD;
      depression and anxiety, and improving wellbeing; however, 'traditional' MBT can demand over&#xD;
      30 hours of clinical time, and 50-60 hours of homework, all of which can be barriers to care.&#xD;
      The goal of this project is to test the effectiveness of an Abbreviated MBT (&lt;10 hours of&#xD;
      clinical time and &lt;10 hours of homework) in reducing symptoms of depression/anxiety and&#xD;
      improving wellbeing. If effective, this Abbreviated MBT could reduce barriers to accessing&#xD;
      mental health care.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: ABBREVIATED-MINDFULNESS BASED INTERVENTION (A-MBI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      By the age of 40, 1 in 2 Canadians have been or are presently experiencing mental health&#xD;
      issues. In particular, anxiety and mood disorders are the most prevalent lifetime mental&#xD;
      health illnesses, affecting 11.6% of the population. Mindfulness based treatments (MBTs) have&#xD;
      strong evidence for improving patient wellness through reduction of anxiety and mood symptoms&#xD;
      in clinical populations. Although efficacious, 'traditional' MBTs are very demanding in terms&#xD;
      of time and homework a relevant factor when considering the recent calls for wait time&#xD;
      reductions in psychotherapeutic mental health services. These programs take 30+ hours&#xD;
      (including 2-3 hr. weekly sessions across 8 weeks, plus a 1-day retreat) and expect 45-60&#xD;
      min./day of meditation homework. The goal of this project is to test the effectiveness of an&#xD;
      abbreviated MBI in reducing anxiety and/or mood disturbances and improving patient&#xD;
      well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MBTs use a non-stigmatizing approach, combining secularized eastern meditative practices with&#xD;
      western psychological advances to improve stress-management and self-care. Participants learn&#xD;
      to generate less distress, engage more positively and fully in their lives and experiences,&#xD;
      and respond more adaptively to challenges instead of reacting in automatic and unhelpful&#xD;
      ways. Participants in MBI often describe the intervention as transformative. Professional&#xD;
      experience and new insights into MBTs suggest that these 'tradition' treatment programs can&#xD;
      be further abbreviated to develop a effective and accessible clinical intervention. This&#xD;
      abbreviated MBT has been developed, which if effective will curtail wait-times and increase&#xD;
      patient treatment annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONAL &amp; HYPOTHESIS/RESEARCH QUESTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rational&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients face barriers to accessing psychotherapy, including long wait-times and/or protocols&#xD;
      that are too demanding for many patients. Traditional Mindfulness-Based Therapies (MBTs) are&#xD;
      highly studied and well-recognized treatment options to reduce anxiety and mood symptoms -&#xD;
      demonstrating repeated efficacy in clinical populations. However, the high demands of&#xD;
      clinical time and homework are a barrier to many patients. Further, longer clinical&#xD;
      interventions mean fewer patients being treated per hour of clinician's time, and therefore&#xD;
      longer wait-times. Clinical experience and new insights into MBTs suggest that these&#xD;
      'tradition' treatment programs can be further abbreviated to develop an effective and more&#xD;
      accessible therapy. If this Abbreviated MBT is demonstrated to be clinically effective, it&#xD;
      can reduce barriers to mental health care by reaching more patients in a more timely fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objective of this study will be to evaluate a novel and potentially highly&#xD;
      effective strategy to reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety and improve quality of life&#xD;
      among outpatients in the chosen pilot site, the Odette Cancer Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis/Research Question&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall study hypothesis is that patients participating in an Abbreviated MBT will show&#xD;
      improvement in self-reported measures of clinical primary (Depression, Anxiety) and secondary&#xD;
      (well-being) outcomes. Improvement will be determined by effect size (magnitude of change&#xD;
      ≥0.2) based on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BDI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current pilot study will explore the effects of an Abbreviated-MBT on symptoms of&#xD;
      depression and anxiety in an outpatient clinical sample; if effective: a) this would be the&#xD;
      first known pilot study to consider and demonstrate efficacy of an Abbreviated-MBT in a&#xD;
      clinical outpatient population; b) this treatment could increase the volume of patients&#xD;
      treated by up to 3x, reduce wait-times by 2-3 fold, and reach a broader group of patients,&#xD;
      including those for whom the investment of time of traditional MBT is too prohibitive.&#xD;
