      The goal of the proposed research is to test the feasibility of a functional progression&#xD;
      program to reduce cost and possible radiation exposure for adolescent athletes with low back&#xD;
      pain. Specifically the investigators plan to test the feasibility of using progression in&#xD;
      rehabilitation to pragmatically differentially diagnose and treat adolescent athletes with&#xD;
      low back pain, instead of using advanced imaging which is the current practice. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to recruit 20 participants, with 10 of usual care (advanced imaging)&#xD;
      and 10 of proposed intervention (functional progression) to assess the feasibility of using&#xD;
      functional progress to guide treatment. The outcomes measured will be number of days for&#xD;
      rest, time to start regular rehabilitation, pain experienced, functional outcomes, ability to&#xD;
      return to sport, time needed to return to sport. If this pilot demonstrates the feasibility&#xD;
      and a decreased rate of advanced imaging and similar clinical outcomes the investigators plan&#xD;
      to progress this work into larger trials.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is a common complaint in adolescent athletes, with rates reported as high&#xD;
      as 50% by the mid-teen years. Although low back pain in adolescent athletes may result from&#xD;
      several different pathologies, spondylolysis--a fracture at the pars interarticularis--is the&#xD;
      most common cause in this demographic, with a prevalence as high as 47%. The recommended&#xD;
      treatment of spondylolysis and non-specific mechanical LBP is quite different. Patients with&#xD;
      mechanical LBP are recommended to stay active, and perform rehabilitation if necessary, while&#xD;
      the primary treatment for spondylolysis is rest for 3 months, physical therapy and bracing as&#xD;
      needed. With the diagnosis of spondylolysis being fairly common in young athletes with low&#xD;
      back pain, physicians need to have a high index of suspicion in making the diagnosis.&#xD;
      Advanced imaging is often necessary to confidently rule in or out the diagnosis of&#xD;
      spondylolysis. Advanced imaging increases diagnostic accuracy, but adds to the cost and&#xD;
      potentially considerable radiation exposure. However, advanced imaging may not be necessary&#xD;
      to effectively treat adolescents with low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Function, not imaging, is used to determine when a patient has healed from a spondylolytic&#xD;
      injury. In fact, results of healing on imaging have no association with clinical outcome.&#xD;
      Most defects do not heal with non-operative treatment suggesting that a successful clinical&#xD;
      outcome does not depend on healing of the lesion. The functional progress that patients make&#xD;
      is markedly different between patients with mechanical LBP and patients with a spondylolysis.&#xD;
      The majority of adolescents with mechanical LBP can make a full functional recovery on their&#xD;
      own or with a short period of rehabilitation. A patient with a spondylolytic injury may&#xD;
      demonstrate an inability to make a full return to activity with rehabilitation and requires a&#xD;
      period of rest from sport and high level activity to make a full functional recovery. Due to&#xD;
      the differences in progression between mechanical LBP and spondylolysis, functional progress&#xD;
      could be used to differentially diagnose these conditions. If effective, using functional&#xD;
      progress instead of advanced imaging would be more cost-effective and expose the patient to&#xD;
      significantly less radiation. In a retrospective review of adolescent patients presenting to&#xD;
      the investigators sports medicine clinic with LBP, 80% had advanced imaging performed due to&#xD;
      a concern of spondylolysis. Thirty-two percent of patients were positive for spondylolysis on&#xD;
      advanced imaging, and 11% of patients had multiple advanced imaging performed due to lack of&#xD;
      progress. No other significant findings were noted on advanced imaging. By using functional&#xD;
      progress to determine the course of care, and only using advanced imaging when a patient does&#xD;
      not respond to conservative care, there is the potential to significantly reduce the need for&#xD;
      advanced imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary risk of using functional progress in physical therapy (PT) instead of advanced&#xD;
      imaging to determine to the course of care in adolescents with LBP is a delayed diagnosis for&#xD;
      those who fail to respond to conservative care. The risk of missing a sinister pathology&#xD;
      mimicking LBP can be minimized with a thorough clinical evaluation and radiographs if&#xD;
      warranted. The results of the investigators' previous work demonstrate that early PT care in&#xD;
      patients with a spondylolytic injury is safe and reduces time to return to sport. In a&#xD;
      retrospective review with a cross-sectional follow-up, patients with an acute spondylolysis&#xD;
      who began physical therapy as soon a 4 weeks (mean of 2 months) made a quicker functional&#xD;
      recovery back to all activity and had similar clinical outcomes at 1-5 year follow-ups. A&#xD;
      delayed diagnosis does not negatively impact long-term functional outcomes for patients with&#xD;
      a spondylolysis as duration of symptoms is not found to be associated with outcome. Using&#xD;
      logistic regression on the same dataset as above to determine factors associated with good&#xD;
      short and long-term clinical outcomes, duration of symtpoms or time to diagnosis was not&#xD;
      found to impact outcomes. On the other hand, delaying PT care to obtain advanced imaging is&#xD;
      found to negatively impact outcomes in patients with mechanical LBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will lay the groundwork to demonstrate the feasibility of a functional&#xD;
      progression to treat adolescent athletes with LBP. If successful, additional study will be&#xD;
      proposed to test the effectiveness of intervention (functional progression) as compared to&#xD;
      usual care (imaging) in improving the recovery outcome of LBP. Ultimately, this research&#xD;
      would lead to change in the way adolescent athletes with LBP are treated, resulting in&#xD;
      decreased cost, decreased exposure to radiation, and decreased time to begin rehabilitation.&#xD;
      The results of this work would positively impact patients, clinicians, and decreased the&#xD;
      costs to the health care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Cohort A series of 10 individuals who meet the inclusion criteria and are patients of&#xD;
      the sports medicine physicians (Dr.s James MacDonald, Ravindran), physicians who are not&#xD;
      recruiting patients for the experimental cohort but are still co-investigators, will serve as&#xD;
      a non-randomized control cohort of typical clinical care and outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the functional progression to guide treatment protocol. (Figure 1) Patients&#xD;
      will be evaluated by their physician to determine appropriateness for participation in this&#xD;
      study. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and consent to participate in the pilot study&#xD;
      as a part of the experimental cohort will not have advanced imaging done and will be referred&#xD;
      directly to PT care for 2 times per week for 3 weeks. The functional progression protocol&#xD;
      will be performed by physical therapists trained in the treatment and progression protocol.&#xD;
      Patients will perform phase I of the PT protocol and progress to phase II as able without an&#xD;
      increase in pain and with sufficiently proper mechanics. (Table 1) Patients will be assessed&#xD;
      at each session to determine if they meet the criteria to begin the next step of functional&#xD;
      PT progression back to sport. (Table 2) Those patients who meet these criteria within the&#xD;
      designated 3 week period will progress into the next phase of functional PT for return to&#xD;
      sport activity with an additional 2 weeks of PT. If these patients progress well in this&#xD;
      third phase, and are able to meet the return to sport criteria, they will be discharged from&#xD;
      PT and monitored by phone for recurrence of symptoms until 2 months. (Table 3) Those patients&#xD;
      who do not progress through phase I or II functionally or without pain will be braced, as&#xD;
      determined by their physician, and placed on rest from all activities excepting ADL's and&#xD;
      their PT home exercise program and will be treated as patients with a presumed spondylolysis.&#xD;
      Additionally, patients who are unable to meet the return to sport criteria within 5 weeks of&#xD;
      PT will be braced, as deemed necessary by their physician, and placed on rest from all&#xD;
      activities except ADL's and their PT home exercise program and will be treated as having a&#xD;
      presumed spondylolysis. These patients will follow care appropriate for the condition. They&#xD;
      will rest from sport until &gt;2 months after initial evaluation , be braced as necessary, and&#xD;
      ultimately complete 4 weeks of PT care to progress them as able back to sport activity.&#xD;
      Patients who are treated as having a presumed spondylolysis will not be returned to sport&#xD;
      before 3 months of rest as this period of rest has been found to produce optimal results.(El&#xD;
      Rassi et al., 2013) Patients will have monthly re-evaluations with their physician until&#xD;
      discharge. If at any point the patient is not responding as expected or the physician has&#xD;
      concerns over the patient's safety, the physician can take the appropriate steps they feel&#xD;
      are necessary for the safety of the patient. Patients who are classified as non-responders&#xD;
      will be those who do not progress as expected for the typical course of mechanical LBP or&#xD;
      spondylolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Outcome Variables&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Advanced imaging use during the episode of care: Computed tomography (CT), single-photon&#xD;
           emission computed tomography (SPECT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Total cost will be calculated as the billed costs of physician visits, physical therapy&#xD;
           visits, radiographs, advanced imaging, prescribed brace, and prescribed medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Total number of PT visits will be calculated as the number of physical therapy visits&#xD;
           completed for the LBP episode of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The number of days from when the physician initially evaluates the patient and places&#xD;
           them on hold from sport activity to when the patient was cleared to return to sport.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. , Clinical outcomes: Modified Odom's Criteria, and Micheli Functional Scale. Ability to&#xD;
           return to sport This pilot study will not be randomized. All patients consenting to&#xD;
           participate will be treated according to the treatment approach the co-investigating&#xD;
           physicians have agreed to perform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding No blinding will be performed in this pilot trial as it is not feasible to blind&#xD;
      either the clinicians or the patient to the treatment cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Descriptive statistics of the patient demographics and outcome variables will&#xD;
      be reported. The two treatment groups will be compared based on cost, imaging usage, and&#xD;
      outcomes but will not perform statistical analysis due to the small sample size.&#xD;
