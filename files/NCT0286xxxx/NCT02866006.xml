      BVAC-C is an immunotherapeutic vaccine using B-Cell and Monocytes as antigen-presenting&#xD;
      cells. This study is consists of 2 parts(Phase I, Phase II). Phase I study is Open-label,&#xD;
      dose-escalation, multiple dosing study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immune response&#xD;
      and preliminary efficacy of BVAC-C in patients with multiple metastatic progressive or&#xD;
      recurrent HPV type 16 or 18 positive cervical cancer after failure to standard care. 9~18&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled In Phase IIa study, which Open-label, sequential assignment&#xD;
      multiple dosing study, efficacy, immune response and safety will be evaluated. Total 21&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled in 3 groups.&#xD;
