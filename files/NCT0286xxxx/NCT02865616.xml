      MET-2 clinical study is an Open label, single center, multiple dose pilot study of 19&#xD;
      patients. The study is designed to measure the resolution of diarrhea as well as the&#xD;
      feasibility of administration and safety of MET-2 for the treatment of recurrent CDI in&#xD;
      patients who have experienced at least two prior episodes of CDI and have developed&#xD;
      recurrence after having completed standard-of care oral antibiotic therapy to treat CDI.&#xD;

      Microbial Ecosystem Therapeutics (MET) is a new treatment approach for debilitating recurrent&#xD;
      Clostridium difficile infection that has been developed as an alternative to fecal&#xD;
      transplantation. This treatment is not a drug or biologic, but is comprised of live microbes&#xD;
      that normally reside in the human gut of a healthy individual.The product is a defined&#xD;
      microbial community derived from healthy donor stool, referred to as Microbial Ecosystem&#xD;
      Therapeutic-2 (MET-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this open label, single center, multiple dose pilot study of 19 patients will be&#xD;
      recruited. Patients will be given an initial daily loading dose of MET-2 over 2 days followed&#xD;
      by a maintenance dose of MET-2 over 8 days. Patients experiencing treatment failure after the&#xD;
      first dose may be offered a second, higher loading dose of MET-2. Patients failing the second&#xD;
      loading dose of MET-2 may be offered a higher dose of MET-2 via colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is clinical resolution of diarrhea with no CDI relapse at 30 days&#xD;
      following the last dose of MET-2, i.e., absence of recurrence of diarrheal symptoms with&#xD;
      laboratory-confirmed evidence of C. difficile 30 days after last dose of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are: i) Safety and tolerability, including adverse events of grade 2&#xD;
      or above; ii) Overall well-being including number of bowel movements and energy level, etc.&#xD;
      as based on standardized IBS questionnaire; iii) Presence of MET-2 bacteria in stool at 30&#xD;
      days, based on DNA sequencing; and, iv) Mortality, at end of follow up period - mortality&#xD;
      attributable to CDI will also be determined, by performing a detailed clinical chart review&#xD;
      on any patient who expires during the follow up period.&#xD;

    <description>To demonstrate clinical resolution of diarrhea with no CDI relapse at 30 days following the last dose of MET-2, the subject will undergo full physical examination including Blood Pressure, Heart rate and body temperature measurement. A blood test will be conducted with chemistry panel, and CBC with differential. Stool test and culture will also be conducted to measure the presence of C.difficile and DNA sequencing will determine the presence of MET-2 bacteria in the stool.</description>

    <description>Patients will be on vancomycin to control symptoms up until the time of the treatment.&#xD;
Initial Loading Dose: Patients will be given an initial daily loading dose of 5 g MET-2 over 2 days followed by a maintenance dose of 1.5 g over 8 days. Patients who do not experience treatment failure between Day 14 and Day 40 will be monitored until Day 130.&#xD;
Second Loading Dose: Patients experiencing treatment failure after the first dose may be offered a second, higher loading dose 10 g of MET-2 in the form of 20 MET-2 capsules per day for two days, there will not be additional daily dosing beyond the first 10 days.&#xD;
Colonoscopy: Patients failing the second loading dose of MET-2 may be offered 15 g of MET-2, equivalent to a 30 MET-2 capsule loading dose by weight, via colonoscopy..&#xD;
All patients will be followed up for 120 days after the last treatment has been received.</description>
