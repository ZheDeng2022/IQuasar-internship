  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      he postpartum period is vulnerable to dysfunction of the pelvic floor musculature, which is&#xD;
      associated with incontinence, pain, reduced stability of the core and functional deficits.&#xD;
      The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada recommends instruction on the&#xD;
      correct performance of pelvic floor muscle exercises, commonly known as Kegels, as standard&#xD;
      care. However, only a small proportion of women seek medical care for incontinence in Canada.&#xD;
      Recently, there has been an influx of mobile Health technology applications marketed for&#xD;
      pelvic floor restoration and fitness that have not been studied. The existence of mHealth&#xD;
      technologies may represent an innovative mode to support pelvic health, however systematic&#xD;
      exploration to substantiate claims and proposed benefit is required. This pilot study aims to&#xD;
      understand the utility of a new mobile health application, iball, as a rehabilitation tool to&#xD;
      promote optimal pelvic floor function and to correct pregnancy related pelvic floor&#xD;
      dysfunction. The iball is comprised of a device and a mobile app, and it has been brought to&#xD;
      market in Europe as a consumer product. The study aims to assess the acceptability,&#xD;
      feasibility, and effectiveness of the iball as a pelvic floor muscle training intervention,&#xD;
      in comparison to standard care.&#xD;

      Participants would be recruited through three midwifery practices: 1) The Hamilton Midwives;&#xD;
      2) Burlington &amp; Area Midwives Inc.; and 3) Community Midwives of Halton. Women in the third&#xD;
      trimester of their first pregnancy, presenting at these sites will be invited to participate.&#xD;
      The goal is to enrol a heterogeneous sample of pregnant women in the Hamilton-Halton region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-step strategy will be used to recruit study participants. First, recruiting sites will&#xD;
      attend an information session related to the study. Recruitment posters with tear-off tabs&#xD;
      containing the study email (iballstudy@gmail.com) will be posted at the sites. Interested&#xD;
      participants will contact the study co-ordinator. Over the phone, the study co-ordinator will&#xD;
      determine that the patient is eligible, review the letter of information with the patient,&#xD;
      and schedule them for a baseline assessment at approximately 6-weeks post-partum. The letter&#xD;
      of information will be emailed to the patient so that they may follow along during the&#xD;
      review. All Internet transmission will be performed on campus through MacSecure, or performed&#xD;
      off campus through a Virtual Private Network (VPN) provided by McMaster University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will provide informed, written consent at the baseline appointment and prior to&#xD;
      the assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study compares a 16-week iball pelvic floor training protocol to a 16-week standard care&#xD;
      regimen. Sixty participants will be recruited and randomly assigned to the standard care&#xD;
      (control) group or the iball intervention group. All participants will meet with an assessor&#xD;
      (Dr. Sinead Dufour or Dr. Donna Fedorkow) to undergo a pre-and a post-intervention&#xD;
      assessment. Each assessment (30min) will consist of a (15min) internal pelvic exam, following&#xD;
      the PERFECT criteria, and two (15min) self-report questionnaires, the Urogenital Distress&#xD;
      Inventory-Short Form (UDI-6) and the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire-Short Form (IIQ-7).&#xD;
      The pre-study assessment will take place approximately 6 weeks post-partum. The post-study&#xD;
      assessment will take place at the end of the 16-week study period. At 8 weeks, midway through&#xD;
      the intervention period, all participants will be emailed by the study co-ordinator as a&#xD;
      means to provide any support that might be needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the pre-study assessment, the standard care group will receive instructions on how to&#xD;
      perform a correct pelvic floor contraction through a digital pelvic examination. In addition&#xD;
      to receiving the same standard care instructions, the iball intervention group will undergo a&#xD;
      training session (15min) on how to use the iball device and app with the research&#xD;
      co-ordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The post-study assessment will require additional time from both groups. The standard care&#xD;
      group will answer three self-administered close-ended questions (5min). In addition to&#xD;
      answering two of the three close-ended questions (5min), the intervention group will also&#xD;
      participate in a semi-structured interview (30min) with the research assistant either&#xD;
      in-person or over the phone, depending on the participant's preference.&#xD;
