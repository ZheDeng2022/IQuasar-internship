      The study will be a pilot interventional case series aiming to treat 30 patients with&#xD;
      Femtosecond Laser-assisted Pterygium Surgery (FLAPS). All patients included will undergo&#xD;
      FLAPS in one eye. All procedures will be performed in SNEC by fully qualified surgeons. The&#xD;
      doctor is informed of the procedure on the day of.&#xD;

    <description>Surgical procedures will involve 1) excision of pterygium tissue from cornea and conjunctiva, 2) resection of residual Tenon and coagulation to stop any bleeding 3) preparation of a 8x8 mm conjunctiva autograft in the superior bulbar conjunctiva with the femtosecond laser (12 oÂ´clock position) and 4) fixation of the graft with fibrin glue to the resection site.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A pterygium will be defined as a wing-shaped growth of fibrotic connective tissue onto&#xD;
             the cornea originating from the nasal conjunctiva.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Only patients older than 21 years will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No gender criteria are applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Only individuals with the mental capacity to provide informed consent will be&#xD;

&#xD;
        More specifically, all the following inclusion criteria must be met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients have primary pterygium encroaching onto the cornea by a minimum of 1 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are willing and able to sign a written Informed Consent Form prior to any&#xD;
             study-specific procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are willing and able to return for scheduled follow-up examinations for 12&#xD;
             months after the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior history of pterygium surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a prior history of glaucoma filtration surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with optic atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with ocular pathology or disease that might confound the outcome or increase&#xD;
             the risk of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a prior history of vitrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with central corneal scarring.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with residual, recurrent, active or uncontrolled eyelid disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any conjunctival scarring other than pterygium, that could affect&#xD;
             surgery outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with anterior segment pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any corneal abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any progressive retinal disease or subjects with a history or evidence&#xD;
             of retinal vascular occlusion and/or hypercoagulability, because of the risks&#xD;
             associated with high pressures during suction application.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with amblyopia or strabismus or those who are at risk for developing&#xD;
             strabismus postoperatively as determined by corneal light reflex and cover-uncover&#xD;
             testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant, lactating, of child-bearing potential and not practising a&#xD;
             medically approved method of birth control, or planning to become pregnant during the&#xD;
             course of the trial, and patients with other conditions associated with fluctuation of&#xD;
             hormones that could lead to refractive changes.&#xD;
