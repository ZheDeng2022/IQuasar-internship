    <textblock>
      Patients should receive a chemotherapy regimen with an overall risk of febrile neutropenia ≥&#xD;
      20%. The use of the web-application their will be proposed .&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be informed of the risk of neutropenia, fever and bleeding which may occur beyond&#xD;
      the fifth day of each chemotherapy cycle (to eliminate fevers related to treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The temperature measurement is performed at home by an infrared forehead thermometer provided&#xD;
      as part of the study, in a systematic manner once daily at the same time of day and in case&#xD;
      of unexplained fatigue or chills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before any fever reported to the physician via the web-application (alert), a questionnaire&#xD;
      will be completed by the patient to the search for gravity criteria to assess his condition&#xD;
      at home. The patient will be hospitalized immediately if it shows signs of severity in order&#xD;
      to document the infection and provide intravenous antibiotics adapted to the clinical&#xD;
      condition; in the absence of these signs, the patient will make a count to the nearest lab&#xD;
      and will receive oral antibiotics if indicated. The subsequent strategy will be defined by&#xD;
      the web-application algorithm to optimize the care of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to use a web-application could allow early detection of complications of&#xD;
      post-chemotherapy haematological toxicity and offer a taking over guided by a decision-making&#xD;
      algorithm managed by the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to favour the taking over at home.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hematological toxicity is frequent and sometimes severe complication of chemotherapy used&#xD;
      in onco-hematology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most frequent is the neutropenia. It is defined by Neutrophils rate lower than 1 Giga/L.&#xD;
      The patient can then have a risk of fever or serious infection which requires a&#xD;
      hospitalization, an empiric antibiotic therapy and sometimes a dose reduction of chemotherapy&#xD;
      which can threaten the patient future. Hospital overall mortality by febrile neutropenia is&#xD;
      estimated at 9.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The growth factor allowed to reduce the risk of neutropenia or to shorten the neutropenia. In&#xD;
      general, they are suggested in primary prophylaxis for chemotherapy whose risk of febrile&#xD;
      neutropenia is superior at 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, only 20 to 30% of post-chemotherapy fever will be documented. A double and early&#xD;
      empiric antibiotic therapy decreases significantly the risk of mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thrombocytopenia is a less frequent complication than the neutropenia but there is a risk of&#xD;
      spontaneous bleeding for the patient when the platelets rate is below 10 Giga/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is informed at the beginning of his taking care of the neutropenia risk, fever&#xD;
      and hemorrhagic event which can happen at home between two chemotherapies. The patient is in&#xD;
      the center of his taking care of and must report quickly all fever or bleeding happening&#xD;
      after chemotherapy to evaluate the risk of immediate complication and to propose the&#xD;
      appropriate therapeutic strategy. However too many patient with one or two hematological&#xD;
      complication during the chemotherapy aren't take care of optimally nor in adapted delay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of a web-application could allow to febrile patient after chemotherapy to benefit of&#xD;
      personalized care with a quicker communication of clinical symptoms and blood tests results&#xD;
      to the oncologist via this tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In practice, patients don't always contact their oncologist in case of fever. On the other&#xD;
      hand, the delays for transmission of biological tests at the medical team don't always allow&#xD;
      an optimal taking care of and in appropriate delays of hematological toxicity and febrile&#xD;
      event of patient during chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possibility of using a web-application could allow to detect earlier the possible&#xD;
      complication of post-chemotherapy hematological toxicity and to suggest a taking care of&#xD;
      guided by a decisional algorithm managed by the oncologist. The aim is to privilege the care&#xD;
      at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected benefit for each patient is to have an earlier and adapted care in case of&#xD;
      infection and/or bleeding. The use of this web-application could allow, in optimizing the&#xD;
      care of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, to limit the number of hospitalization and the&#xD;
      prescription of intravenous antibiotic and to achieve optimally the therapeutic project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usual monitoring (oral advice only) would have been proposed at all patient include in&#xD;
      this study. It is unlikely that post-chemotherapy fever, neutropenia or thrombocytopenia will&#xD;
      supported later than in the usual practice. Therefore it is expected that the use of the&#xD;
      web-application will be for the benefit of patient by allowing to detect earlier&#xD;
      post-chemotherapy complications and so to propose an optimal take care of for included&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient must have a chemotherapy schema with a global risk of febrile neutropenia &lt; 20% could&#xD;
      use the web-application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be informing of the risks of neutropenia, fever and bleeding could happen&#xD;
      beyond the 5th day after chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temperature will be taken at home by an infrared forehead thermometer provided in the study&#xD;
      in a systematic once a day at the same time and in case of unusual fatigue or chills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a fever is detected by the web-application, a questionnaire will be completed by the&#xD;
      patient to find serious symptoms. The aim is to optimize the taking care of patient.&#xD;
