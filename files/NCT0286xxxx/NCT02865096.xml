      This study is attempting to determine whether there is any effect (worsening or improvement&#xD;
      of sexual function) after marijuana consumption. Both users and non users of marijuana will&#xD;
      be given the opportunity to participate by completing a questionnaire.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug (19.8 million past-month users) according to&#xD;
      the 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a current movement towards the legalization of marijuana in various states and there&#xD;
      are numerous claims of potential uses in medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The internet is rich with nonscientific, non-evidence based information regarding the effects&#xD;
      of marijuana on the sex lives of women. However, surprisingly little scientific research has&#xD;
      been done on it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cannabis use and sexual function Endocannabinoids, which are structurally similar to cannabis&#xD;
      (marijuana) help regulate a number of motivated behaviors and emotional states, including&#xD;
      sexual function. There are a variety of ways that cannabinoids interact with the hormones and&#xD;
      neurotransmitters that affect sexual behavior. This interaction has not been clearly&#xD;
      elucidated but studies in rats have helped to clarify the relationship between cannabinoids&#xD;
      and the hormones and neurotransmitters that affect sexual behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In male rats, administration of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the psychoactive compound in&#xD;
      marijuana) reduced sexual motivation. In female rats, the relationship between THC and sexual&#xD;
      behavior is less clear. found that giving female rats a low dose of THC increased their&#xD;
      receptivity to copulation. However a high dose interfered with receptivity, also found that&#xD;
      THC stimulated receptivity and increased proceptivity (&quot;courting behavior&quot;) in female&#xD;
      hamsters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lopez et al found that in rats, giving a cannabinoid receptor blocker, increased sexual&#xD;
      motivation during the estrous cycle. They then found that ovariectomized rats given a&#xD;
      cannabinoid receptor agonist, had reduced sexual motivation. When exogenous estrogen and&#xD;
      progesterone were given, this effect was attenuated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact mechanism by which THC affects sexual function in women is unknown. It is known&#xD;
      that THC and the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, which controls the sex hormones,&#xD;
      interact with eachother. Acute administration of THC has been shown to inhibit LH and PRL&#xD;
      secretion from the anterior pituitary in males and females. In females, high dose of THC can&#xD;
      interfere with estrous and menstrual cycle timing and can delay or prevent ovulation.&#xD;
      Cannabinoids inhibit or interfere with activity of the HPG axis and reduce secretion of&#xD;
      several hormones which tend to have an inhibitory impact on sexual behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that dopamine is a key prosexual modulator in normal excitatory female sexual&#xD;
      function. It is also known that the major effects of THC in the central nervous system are&#xD;
      mediated by cannabinoid receptors. These receptors have been shown to enhance dopamine&#xD;
      (Lazenka et al, 2015), which may be another pathway by which marijuana affects sexual&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human studies are limited. Questioned regular male and female marijuana users about their&#xD;
      opinions regarding changes in the sexual experience when using marijuana. They found that&#xD;
      when marijuana affects the sexual experience, it affects it positively. Marijuana did appear&#xD;
      to increase desire mildly and enhances the quality of orgasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several links between THC and hormonal and neurotransmitter pathways that play a&#xD;
      role in sexual function and dysfunction, providing a theoretical way that THC may alter&#xD;
      sexual functioning. These links need to be more clearly studied and elucidated.&#xD;

        Patient participants will be asked upon check-in at their ob/gyn office whether they would&#xD;
        like to participate in the questionnaire study. Patients will be asked to complete their&#xD;
        questionnaire in the exam room of the ob/gyn practice. Patients who choose to voluntarily&#xD;
        participate in the study, will be instructed to place their anonymous questionnaire in a&#xD;
        provided blank envelope and seal it as to ensure confidentiality, then return their&#xD;
        completed questionnaire to the front desk and place the sealed envelope in a lock box&#xD;
