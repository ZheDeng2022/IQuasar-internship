&#xD;
               2. Nitroimidazoles, including metronidazole and misonidazole (may enhance S-1&#xD;
                  activity)&#xD;

             epirubicin:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Cimetidine (may increase the area under the plasma concentration-time curve [AUC]&#xD;
                  of epirubicin).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Dexverapamil (may alter the pharmacokinetics of epirubicin).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Quinine (may accelerate the initial distribute on of epirubicin from blood into&#xD;
                  the tissues and may have an influence on the red blood cells partitioning of&#xD;
                  epirubicin).&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Interferon alfa-2b (may cause a reduction in both the terminal elimination&#xD;
                  half-life and the total clearance of epirubicin).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Is a pregnant or lactating female.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has known hypersensitivity to 5-FU, epirubicin, oxaliplatin or other platinum&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Patients with reproductive potential who refuse to use an adequate means of&#xD;
             contraception (including male patients). Contraceptive measures must be taken by both&#xD;
             male and female patients during and up to 6 months after stopping treatment with S-1.&#xD;
