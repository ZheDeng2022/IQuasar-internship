  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether transcutaneous spinal direct current&#xD;
      stimulation (tsDCS) is safe for individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). tsDCS is an&#xD;
      electrical current applied to the skin. The plan is to also study the potential&#xD;
      neurophysiological changes (changes in speed and excitability of the nerves) and functional&#xD;
      improvements in gait (for example, gait quality, speed and walking distance) for individuals&#xD;
      with SCI after combined application of tsDCS and exoskeleton assisted gait training.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will participate in two baseline visits, 4 days apart. Each baseline visit will last&#xD;
      1 hour and will include assessment of soleus H-Reflex and 10 meter walk test on arrival and&#xD;
      40 minutes after the initial assessment. Subjects will be asked to minimize their activity&#xD;
      between assessments by either sitting in a chair or lying on a mat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each training visit will involve either an exoskeleton intervention or a combined exoskeleton&#xD;
      and tsDCS intervention. Each training visit will include assessment of soleus H-Reflex and 10&#xD;
      meter walk test before and after the exoskeleton intervention or before and after the&#xD;
      combined exoskeleton and tsDCS intervention.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Spinal Cord Excitability as Measured by Percent Change in Soleus H-Reflex From Beginning of Session to End of the Same Session</measure>
    <time_frame>beginning and end of first no-intervention visit (7 days before any intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>This visit includes assessment of soleus H-Reflex on arrival and 40 minutes after the initial assessment--change between these two readings is reported. Subjects will be asked to minimize their activity between the two assessments by either sitting in a chair or lying on a mat.&#xD;
The H-reflex is a reaction of muscles after electrical stimulation (this stimulation is not the intervention, but is instead part of the H-reflex assessment). H-reflex will be elicited by placing the cathode of an electrical stimulator in the popliteal fossa (a shallow depression located at the back of the knee joint) and stimulating the tibial nerve. To record the electrical-induced muscle activity (that is, to measure H-reflexes), surface electromyography electrodes will be placed at the soleus muscle of the testing leg.</description>

Ekso is a type of wearable robotic exoskeleton that provides support to an individual with lower extremity paralysis for standing and walking.&#xD;

          <title>Level of Spinal Cord Injury (SCI)</title>
          <description>The level of injury is based on International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI). The level reported is the lowest (most caudal) segment of the spinal cord that remains fully intact for sensory and motor function. C is cervical (the region of the neck), with C1 being the highest level closest to the skull and C7 being the bottom of the neck. T is the thoracic/chest region (all the levels with ribs attached), with T1 being the top closest to the neck and T12 the bottom close to low back.</description>

        <title>Change in Spinal Cord Excitability as Measured by Percent Change in Soleus H-Reflex From Beginning of Session to End of the Same Session</title>
        <description>This visit includes assessment of soleus H-Reflex on arrival and 40 minutes after the initial assessment--change between these two readings is reported. Subjects will be asked to minimize their activity between the two assessments by either sitting in a chair or lying on a mat.&#xD;
The H-reflex is a reaction of muscles after electrical stimulation (this stimulation is not the intervention, but is instead part of the H-reflex assessment). H-reflex will be elicited by placing the cathode of an electrical stimulator in the popliteal fossa (a shallow depression located at the back of the knee joint) and stimulating the tibial nerve. To record the electrical-induced muscle activity (that is, to measure H-reflexes), surface electromyography electrodes will be placed at the soleus muscle of the testing leg.</description>

          <title>Gait Speed as Assessed by 10 Meter Walk Test</title>
          <description>Subjects will undergo a walking session with Ekso, Ekso will then be removed, and subjects will then perform a 10 Meter Walk Test (10MWT) without use of Ekso exoskeleton. The 10MWT will assess subject's gait speed. Four marks will be placed on the ground at 0, 2, 12 and 14 meters. Subjects will walk a total of 14 meters. The middle 10 meters (between marks at 2 and 12 meters) will be timed and recorded as their gait speed.</description>
          <population>One participant was not assessed for gait speed for two intervention periods of the cathode tsDCS + Ekso arm and one intervention period of the the Ekso alone arm. For the cathode tsDCS + Ekso arm, 1 received the intervention once (1 data point total). For the anode tsDCS + Ekso arm, 1 received the intervention once, and 1 received the intervention twice (3 data points total). For the Ekso alone arm, 1 received the intervention once, and 2 received the intervention twice (5 data points total).</population>
