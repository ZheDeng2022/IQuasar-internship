  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Empagliflozin (Jardiance), a highly potent and selective inhibitor of the sodium-glucose&#xD;
      cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), was approved in Europe in May 2014 for the treatment of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to improve glycaemic control in adults. As part of the risk&#xD;
      management plan, Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH (BI) has committed to conduct a&#xD;
      post-authorisation safety study (PASS) to evaluate the liver and renal safety of&#xD;
      empagliflozin. The study will also evaluate the risks of severe complications of urinary&#xD;
      tract infections (UTIs) and genital infections. To evaluate the association between&#xD;
      empagliflozin use and mentioned outcomes routinely collected health information from the&#xD;
      Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), the Hospital Episodes Statistics, and Office of&#xD;
      National Statistic will be used. This PASS will be conducted through an observational cohort&#xD;
      study among adult patients with T2DM and at least 12 months of continuous enrolment in the&#xD;
      CPRD where new users of empagliflozin will be compared to new users of dipeptidyl peptidase-4&#xD;
      (DPP4) inhibitors. Estimations will be made on the crude and adjusted incidence rates and&#xD;
      adjusted incidence rate ratios of the primary and secondary outcomes.&#xD;
