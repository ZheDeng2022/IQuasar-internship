    <textblock>
      In this prospective, randomized, double blinded study, the needle tip and needle shaft&#xD;
      visibility of echogenic and nonechogenic needle were compared in ultrasound guided&#xD;
      infraclavicular brachial plexus block. Sixty patients scheduled for upper extremity surgery&#xD;
      were included in the study. Patients were randomised into two groups, group E (Echogenic) and&#xD;
      group NE (Nonechogenic) with 30 subjects in each group. Under ultrasound guidance&#xD;
      infraclavicular brachial plexus block was performed. In Group E, Pajunk Sonoplex echogenic&#xD;
      needle was used and in Group NE, Stimuplex Braun nonechogenic needle was used. The subjective&#xD;
      assessment for needle tip/shaft visibility as scored by the performer and the objective&#xD;
      assessment from the recorded block procedure video were noted.&#xD;

      The aim of the investigators study was to find out the better among the echogenic and&#xD;
      nonechogenic needle in needle tip/shaft visibility and the block success rate in ultrasound&#xD;
      guided infraclavicular brachial plexus block. Sixty patients were randomized into two groups,&#xD;
      Group E (echogenic group) and Group NE (nonechogenic group) with thirty patients in each&#xD;
      group. The ultrasound imaging of each nerve block was video recorded for later analysis.&#xD;
      Recording commenced from skin puncture and stopped at the time of final needle removal (total&#xD;
      block time). After each block the performer was asked to subjectively score the percentage&#xD;
      time he had visualized the needle tip and needle shaft on a 5 point scale (1 = 0%-20%, 2 =&#xD;
      20%-40%, 3 = 40%- 60%, 4 = 60%-80%, 5 = 80%-100%). The recorded video was later analysed by&#xD;
      an investigator. An objective measurement of percentage needle tip visibility and needle&#xD;
      shaft visibility was calculated for each nerve block using the formula,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time in view (needle tip) / total block time x 100&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time in view (needle shaft) / total block time x 100&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjective assessment for needle tip/shaft visibility as scored by the performer and the&#xD;
      objective assessment from the recorded block procedure video were noted. Other block&#xD;
      parameters were also compared.&#xD;
