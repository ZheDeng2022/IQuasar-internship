    <textblock>
      It is recommended that patients with asthma owned a written action plan which must include&#xD;
      the names, doses and dosing of the treatment they should take when acute respiratory symptoms&#xD;
      occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current written action plans must be short to be readily used (1 page) and, therefore, cannot&#xD;
      fit all acute situations. Moreover, they may not be available where and when required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators sought that a digital action plan, available through Smartphone or tablet&#xD;
      computer connected to the internet, could adequately provide suitable action plans according&#xD;
      to the severity of the described exacerbation, and would be more easily available when&#xD;
      useful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to study the effect of the use of a digital action plan for asthma&#xD;
      exacerbation, on the frequency of unscheduled medical contacts (phone calls, visits to&#xD;
      physicians or to emergency departments, hospitalizations) in children and in adults with&#xD;
      asthma. The investigators hypothesized that the use of the digital action plan could reduce&#xD;
      avoidable unscheduled visits due to mild or moderate exacerbations that could successfully be&#xD;
      managed by the patient or his/her caregivers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a frequent chronic disease (10% prevalence in children and 7% in adults) during&#xD;
      which acute exacerbations can occur that require adequate treatment, usually by the patients&#xD;
      and/or his/her caregivers. Despite action plan for asthma exacerbation being recommended by&#xD;
      national and international guidelines, urgent medical contact and often Emergency Department&#xD;
      visits remain frequent for asthma exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reasons for medical contact may be related to the inefficiency of the current Written Action&#xD;
      Plan because of its stereotyped advice whatever the level of severity of the exacerbation,&#xD;
      and because the patients might not have the paper with him/her where and when he/she needs&#xD;
      it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators sought that new electronic technologies could solve these issues of&#xD;
      inadequacy of content and availability of the Written Action Plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A program was built to provide sets of advices according to the severity of the exacerbation&#xD;
      described by the patient using simple clinical descriptors included in the Global Initiative&#xD;
      for Asthma (GINA), and weighted by the medication already used for the exacerbation. In this&#xD;
      way the investigators feel that patients could be more confident in the appropriate treatment&#xD;
      proposed by the algorithm. Second, the possibility to connect through portable electronic&#xD;
      devices (Smartphone, tablet computer) make the action readily available as far as an internet&#xD;
      connection is possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Digital Action Plan is designed to treat asthma exacerbations of all levels of severity&#xD;
      and advice to visit a doctor within few days or to go at once to an emergency department as&#xD;
      appropriate as by the situation based on the patients' information. The investigators&#xD;
      designed a randomized study to assess the effect of the Digital Action Plan on unscheduled&#xD;
      urgent medical contacts (phone calls, visits to physicians or to emergency departments,&#xD;
      hospitalizations) in children and in adults with asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology of the study A multicenter, controlled, randomized, open study, comparative on 2&#xD;
      parallel groups recruited in private practice and in hospitals within or outside the APHP&#xD;
      consortium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both arms have the Written Action Plan respecting the current recommendations; the&#xD;
      experimental arm has in addition the possibility to connect to the AppWeb to obtain advices&#xD;
      from the Digital Action Plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that the use of the digital action plan could reduce avoidable&#xD;
      unscheduled visits due to mild or moderate exacerbations that could successfully be managed&#xD;
      by the patient or his/her caregivers. In the long run, this kind of program could also become&#xD;
      a tool for telemedicine Statistical analysis : about 80% of children and adult patients&#xD;
      included will have a exacerbation during the follow-up year. The expected effect of the&#xD;
      Digital Action Plan is a 20% (relative variation) decrease of the main outcome : in Written&#xD;
      Action Plan group, frequency = 0.8, in Digital Action Plan group, frequency = 0.64 (20% i.e.&#xD;
      0.16 reduction of frequency). Moreover, the Written Action Plan has been shown to result in a&#xD;
      25% decrease of unscheduled visits for severe exacerbation (4); we therefore hypothesize that&#xD;
      the supplemental reduction in unscheduled visits induced by the Digital Action Plan will be&#xD;
      smaller than that of Written Action Plan despite the recording of moderate exacerbations in&#xD;
      addition to severe exacerbations. . With this features, samples of N= 121 per group are&#xD;
      necessary (80% power, bilateral alpha risk of 5%). With an expected attrition of about 15%, a&#xD;
      total of 280 patients will be included. This target can be achieved with regard to the&#xD;
      activity of participating centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of participating centers = 43&#xD;
