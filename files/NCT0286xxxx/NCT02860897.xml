      PURPOSE: To evaluate patient adherence to cream versus tablet based local estrogen therapy by&#xD;
      randomizing treatment modalities to determine differences in adherence to either form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: There is no difference in adherence to cream versus tablet based local estrogen&#xD;
      therapy when prescribed as a 6 week course of postoperative therapy after female pelvic&#xD;
      reconstructive surgery.&#xD;

      Genitourinary syndrome is the consequence of the lack of estrogen exposure to the&#xD;
      genitourinary tract during menopause. The result of this hypoestrogenic state is the&#xD;
      thinning, shrinking, increased vaginal friction, and increase in lower urinary tract&#xD;
      symptoms. It is estimated that up to 60% of postmenopausal women experience these symptoms&#xD;
      and the widely accepted treatment for genitourinary syndrome is the application of local&#xD;
      estrogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estrogen has been widely prescribed as a beneficial adjunct in the treatment of menopausal&#xD;
      genitourinary syndrome and is used to decrease the incidence of urgency, frequency, nocturia,&#xD;
      stress urinary incontinence, urge urinary incontinence, and recurrent urinary tract&#xD;
      infections. Despite the well described use of local estrogen therapy for genitourinary&#xD;
      syndrome, not all forms of vaginal estrogen are created equally and patient adherence to&#xD;
      prescriptions has not been uniform among different formulations. Shulman and colleagues noted&#xD;
      that when used for genitourinary syndrome, patients who were prescribed local estrogen&#xD;
      tablets demonstrated significantly longer compliance to therapy than those prescribed&#xD;
      estrogen cream (149 days vs. 92 days). Similarly, in a cohort of 30,000 patients, Portman&#xD;
      demonstrated that patients prescribed vaginal estrogen tablets were also more likely to be&#xD;
      adherent to therapy than those given the cream formulation. Some of the reasons for early&#xD;
      discontinuation of local vaginal cream was due to messiness with application, leakage,&#xD;
      concerns about underdosing or overdosing, and that the cream was generally unpleasant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the extensive use of local estrogen for genitourinary syndrome, despite limited data,&#xD;
      surgeons have been prescribing local estrogen to prevent the development of postoperative&#xD;
      complications like lower urinary tract symptoms after female pelvic reconstructive surgery.&#xD;
      In a postoperative 12 week follow up, Karp and colleagues noted that the administration of a&#xD;
      vaginal estrogen tablets in postmenopausal women is associated with improved vaginal&#xD;
      maturation indices and objective atrophy assessment after vaginal reconstructive surgery.&#xD;
      Vaccaro also noted that preoperative administration of vaginal estrogen administered 2- 12&#xD;
      weeks before reconstructive surgery improves the vaginal maturation index by more than 15.5%&#xD;
      and may improve the tissue as a substrate for suture placement. There have been two studies&#xD;
      evaluating the effect of vaginal estrogen after midureteral sling placement: Zullo studied&#xD;
      retropubic midureteral slings and noted that patients who did not receive vaginal estrogen&#xD;
      tablets exhibited a higher incidence of urinary urgency than patients who did (4% vs. 29%).&#xD;
      Liapias evaluated local estrogen application for 6 months after transobturator tape slings&#xD;
      and noted statistically significant decreases in urinary frequently and urgency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given this data, there appears to be a role for postoperative local estrogen therapy after&#xD;
      pelvic reconstructive surgery but it not clear if patients are adherent to therapy and the&#xD;
      form of therapy: cream or tablet. To the best of the investigators knowledge, there is no&#xD;
      data that describes patient adherence to local estrogen therapy after female pelvic surgery.&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate patient adherence to cream versus tablet&#xD;
      based local estrogen therapy by randomizing treatment modalities to determine differences in&#xD;
      adherence to either form.&#xD;
