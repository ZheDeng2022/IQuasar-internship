  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor function of the right side of the heart and rise in pressure of the blood vessels&#xD;
      leading to the lungs are two main heart-related factors that are associated with worsening of&#xD;
      airway disease. A relatively new method which uses magnetic field to create images of the&#xD;
      heart called cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging shows immense promise in detailed and&#xD;
      accurate assessment of the heart in patients with airway diseases. This project aims to&#xD;
      assess the heart in patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as&#xD;
      well as healthy participants using CMR to help us determine features on CMR that are&#xD;
      different is patients with asthma and COPD compared to healthy participants. This may help&#xD;
      with early identification of patients who are at risk of episodes of acute worsening of&#xD;
      airway disease, called exacerbation, and potentially halt the progression of the heart&#xD;
      dysfunction with currently available or new treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study involves one visit at Glenfiled Hospital, Leicester, lasting approximately 4 hours. The&#xD;
      visit will include following assessments: clinical history, health status, physical&#xD;
      examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), blood tests, lung function testing, echocardiogram and&#xD;
      CMR. Part of the study will involve a participant questionnaire in which the participants&#xD;
      will rate their CMR experience. The results will potentially change the way CMR is&#xD;
      undertaken. A sub-set of the participants will also be invited back to do a one off focus&#xD;
      group discussing the CMR experience further.&#xD;

      Background and Importance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic respiratory diseases, which include asthma, COPD and pulmonary hypertension (PH),&#xD;
      were responsible for 4.2 million deaths globally in 2008. COPD and asthma affect more than&#xD;
      500 million people worldwide and present an enormous health and economic burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exacerbations of airway disease contribute to disease progression and represent a substantial&#xD;
      proportion of acute hospital admissions. Early identification of patients at risk of such&#xD;
      events is therefore important. There is unclear distinction between the two airway diseases,&#xD;
      particularly in their severe form with evidence of heterogeneity. Right ventricular&#xD;
      dysfunction(RVD) and PH secondary to lung disease and/or hypoxia are now recognised as&#xD;
      important elements of chronic airway disease pathogenesis and play an important role in the&#xD;
      development of frequent comorbidities. There are now data suggesting that pulmonary artery&#xD;
      dilatation in COPD patients is associated with increased risk of exacerbations. This&#xD;
      indicates that cardiovascular factors in addition to airway inflammation may be associated&#xD;
      with exacerbations in airway diseases. Development of RVD and PH in COPD patients are also&#xD;
      associated with poor exercise tolerance.RVD can be seen before the development of PH and cor&#xD;
      pulmonale in COPD. This underpins the importance of early diagnosis as this may improve&#xD;
      overall survival and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical diagnosis of PH in chronic airway diseases is often difficult, particularly in the&#xD;
      mild form due to similarity in clinical presentation. Other methods for diagnosis of RVD and&#xD;
      PH are echocardiography and right heart catheterisation(RHC). The echocardiographic&#xD;
      measurements have been shown to lack sensitivity and specificity on patients with COPD and&#xD;
      the RHC is an invasive test, with risk of complications. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)&#xD;
      imaging provides an excellent alternative for diagnosis of RVD and PH. CMR is a non-invasive&#xD;
      test, free from ionizing radiation and the CMR morphometric indices have dramatically lower&#xD;
      inter-observer and intra-observer variability and test-retest reproducibility compared to&#xD;
      echocardiography. There is a paucity of information on the value of CMR in Group 3 PH. It is&#xD;
      also unclear whether PH plays a role in severe asthma patients who have airway inflammation&#xD;
      and airflow limitation comparable to COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to recruit a total of 86 participants for this study. Adult asthma and&#xD;
      COPD subjects with airflow limitation (FEV1% predicted &lt; 80%) will be recruited for this&#xD;
      study. Healthy participants with no past history of cardiovascular or respiratory disease&#xD;
      will also be recruited. The investigators plan to recruit 33 participants (n=13 with FEV1%&#xD;
      predicted &lt; 50%, n=20 with FEV1% predicted ≥ 50% and &lt; 80%) in each group with airway disease&#xD;
      (COPD and asthma) and 20 healthy participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following assessments on the day of their visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical History Clinical history will be recorded as done routinely in clinics, which&#xD;
           will include date of birth, gender, disease duration, age of onset, other medical&#xD;
           conditions, smoking history, occupational history, severe exacerbations in last one year&#xD;
           (requiring use of steroid tablets or emergency hospital visit) and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Health status and disease control questionnaires (Only for Airway Disease Participants)&#xD;
           Participants will be asked to complete routine health status and disease control&#xD;
           questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Focused physical examination Participant's height and weight will be measured. Pulse&#xD;
           oximetry will also be performed. Pulse oximetry is a non-invasive method to measure the&#xD;
           oxygen level in the blood by placing a sensor device on a person's body, usually&#xD;
           fingertip or earlobe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Electrocardiogram (ECG) An ECG will be performed on all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Blood test Blood will be obtained for the following: (1) assessment of a protein&#xD;
           secreted by the heart chambers in response to excessive stretching of the heart muscles,&#xD;
           (2) full blood count [FBC] (3) urea and electrolytes [U&amp;E] and (4) storage of plasma&#xD;
           extracted from the blood for biomarker (characteristic biological properties or&#xD;
           molecules detected in blood that indicate normal or diseased processes in the body)&#xD;
           analysis at a future date to complement similar ethically approved research at&#xD;
           University of Leicester / University Hospitals of Leicester or other United Kingdom or&#xD;
           international academic partners. The plasma will be stored anonymously at -80°C&#xD;
           indefinitely at the NIHR Leicester Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Spirometry Lung function of all the participants will be assessed using spirometry&#xD;
           (breathing test).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Echocardiogram A focussed test will be performed to measure the pressure with the&#xD;
           pulmonary artery&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
           After identification of the position of the heart using localisers the following&#xD;
           sequences will be obtained:&#xD;
&#xD;
           (i) Cine Imaging: Biventricular volume, function and mass. Interventricular septum and&#xD;
           left ventricle eccentricity index will be calculated. Pulmonary artery(PA) stiffness and&#xD;
           pulsatility will be assessed by measuring the relative area change of the pulmonary&#xD;
           trunk during the cardiac cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (ii) Phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) Cardiac output and flow profile will&#xD;
           be determined. (iii) Magnetic Resonance Angiography(MRA) Contrast-enhanced MRA will be&#xD;
           acquired to assess the pulmonary vascular tree to accurately quantify dimensions and&#xD;
           assess angiogram pattern of the pulmonary vascular tree.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (iv) Late Gadolinium Enhancement(LGE) T1-weighted inversion recovery gradient echo&#xD;
           images will be acquired approximately 15-20 minutes after intravenous injection of&#xD;
           gadolinium based contrast agent. Degree of LGE at the insertion points of the&#xD;
           interventricular septum will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (v) Myocardial T1 mapping T1-mapping sequence based on Modified Look-Locker&#xD;
           Inversion-recovery(MOLLI) technique will be used for assessment of myocardial fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. CMR survey A questionnaire will be given to the participants after the CMR scan to find&#xD;
           out about their experience during the examination.&#xD;
