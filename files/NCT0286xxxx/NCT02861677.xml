      Background: Pharmacists have been proven to improve patient outcomes, medication adherence,&#xD;
      glycemic control, reduce blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein, health care costs and&#xD;
      length of hospital stay, and enhance quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: to measure the impact of clinical pharmacy service on patient care and cost saving&#xD;
      of patients at inpatient wards and ambulatory care clinics of Jimma University Specialized&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: single center Randomized Controlled Trial will be conducted. Participants will be&#xD;
      assigned to either pharmacy professionals' intervention group or non-intervention (control)&#xD;
      group based on computer generated random number. The study will be done from July 26 to&#xD;
      September 15, 2016. The total sample size is calculated with Open Epi online sample size&#xD;
      calculator with 95% CI and 80% power. The total sample size is found to be 146 for inpatients&#xD;
      and 473 for outpatients. Linear regression, student's t-test, logistic regression and&#xD;
      chi-square test will be used for statistical analysis. Variables with p&lt;0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered statistically significant.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many studies have shown the positive impact of clinical pharmacy service on clinical,&#xD;
      economic and humanistic outcomes. This type of service may be highly important in saving&#xD;
      lives, improving patient outcomes, and decreasing treatment costs particularly in&#xD;
      resource-limited settings like Ethiopia with a double burden of communicable and&#xD;
      non-communicable diseases which need medication therapy. Though patients may experience a&#xD;
      number of problems related to drug therapy, no study is conducted in Ethiopia to show the&#xD;
      impact of clinical pharmacy service in alleviating such treatment related problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study aims to answer the following research questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      impact of clinical pharmacy service in improving patient outcome and reducing cost of&#xD;
      treatment of chronic illness patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      impact of clinical pharmacy service in improving patient outcome and reducing cost of&#xD;
      treatment of hospitalized patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study site location and participants: this randomized controlled trial will be conducted at&#xD;
      Jimma University Specialized Hospital, Southwest Ethiopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size for inpatients is calculated using the Open Epi online sample size calculator&#xD;
      software with the following assumptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With 80% power and significance level of 0.05 with a 95% confidence interval. Two tailed test&#xD;
      and a 1:1 ratio between intervention group and control group. The investigators used the&#xD;
      prevalence of drug related problem (primary outcome) to be 52% from previous reports in&#xD;
      Ethiopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect size is considered to be 1.5&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through calculation, the final sample size in each arm is 61 and considering a 20%&#xD;
      contingency for loss to follow up, 73 participants are needed in each group. Therefore, the&#xD;
      total sample size is 146.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For ambulatory patients, sample size is calculated using the prevalence of the three types of&#xD;
      drug related problems (indication, safety, and effectiveness) from previous studies. The&#xD;
      prevalence of effectiveness related drug related problem was reported to be 14%. The effect&#xD;
      size is determined to be 1.4 and all other parameters are considered similar to the above.&#xD;
      Through calculation, 215 patients are needed in each group. Considering a 10% loss for follow&#xD;
      up, the total sample size is 473 in the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and concealing allocation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be completed by Statistical Package for the Social Science version 21&#xD;
      generated algorithm. Treating assignments kept in sealed opaque envelopes with only number&#xD;
      labeled will be opened after patients give their informed consents. The assigned research&#xD;
      assistant will distribute envelopes and record patients in each group enrollment and patient&#xD;
      assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding: research assistants of the trial who are responsible for outcome recording will be&#xD;
      blinded to treatment assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacy Intervention group&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Hospitalized Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four full timer pharmacists trained on clinical pharmacy (ward Pharmacists) will be assigned&#xD;
      to 8-15 patients each at medical ward to provide clinical pharmacy service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two full timer postgraduate year two clinical pharmacy students will be assigned to medical&#xD;
      ward A Male and medical ward B female.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two clinical pharmacists from school of pharmacy will also be assigned to each ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Ambulatory Patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two post graduate year II clinical pharmacy students will be assigned to outpatient&#xD;
      department of ambulatory care clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assigned pharmacy professionals will sit with the physician and make therapeutic&#xD;
      decisions in consultation with the physician, develop therapeutic plan and give patient&#xD;
      education and document into the documentation form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the control group will get the standard care by physicians and nurses.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Interventions by Pharmacy professionals&#xD;
&#xD;
      For hospitalized patients, all interventions made by pharmacy professionals will be&#xD;
      documented on pharmacy professional activity documentation forms. Data collectors will&#xD;
      abstract all the relevant data from the document. The data that will be abstracted by data&#xD;
      collectors are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identified drug therapy problems and interventions made to resolve drug therapy problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suggestions on prevention and avoidance of medication errors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost of medicines and pharmaceuticals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost of hospitalization including cost of laboratory investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient educations given during hospital stay and at discharge for hospitalized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recommendations made for laboratory investigation and treatment monitoring done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient education at hospital for ambulatory patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
      In hospital mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient knowledge about the drug at discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inpatient satisfaction with the health care service provided&#xD;
&#xD;
      For ambulatory patients,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identified drug therapy problems and interventions made to resolve drug therapy problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost of medicines&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient knowledge about the prescribed medicines&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Statistical software Statistical Package for the Social Science 21 will&#xD;
