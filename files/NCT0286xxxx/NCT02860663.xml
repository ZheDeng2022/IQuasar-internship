      Background: Dietary intake of vitamin D includes vitamin D3 (VitD3), 25-hydroxyvitamin D3&#xD;
      (25OHD3) and vitamin D2 (VitD2). However, the bioactivity of the different species is&#xD;
      currently not scientifically established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that VitD3, 25OHD3 and VitD2&#xD;
      affected vitamin D status equally in humans and if rejected, to estimate the difference in&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This study was designed as a 3 x 6 weeks (with 4 weeks run-in) double-blinded&#xD;
      randomized cross-over study with 12 young, apparently healthy male volunteers and was&#xD;
      performed during wintertime at 55 degree N. during the 4 weeks run-in period all volunteers&#xD;
      received 10 ug/d VitD3 in order to achieve steady-state in vitamin D status. During the 3x6&#xD;
      weeks intervention periods the subjects received 10 ug/d VitD3, 10 ug/d 25OHD3 or 10 ug/d&#xD;
      VitD2 in random order. Content of vitD3, VitD2, 25OHD3 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 (25OHD2) in&#xD;
      serum were quantified my LC-MS/MS using 0.1 mL serum.&#xD;

      A total of 12 apparently healthy, free living male adults aged 20-30 years were recruited in&#xD;
      this 3x6 weeks vitamin D intervention trial. Subjects were recruited among students from the&#xD;
      University of Copenhagen through the use of advertisements placed around the University of&#xD;
      Copenhagen. Volunteers were excluded if they had BMI &gt; 27 kg/m2, had donated blood within the&#xD;
      last three month, has any chronic diseases, used medication regularly, hypercalcemic, had&#xD;
      excessive alcohol use, known malabsorption syndromes or used medication known to interfere&#xD;
      with vitamin D metabolism. Furthermore, to decrease sun exposure, volunteers who planned to&#xD;
      go skiing or travel south during the study was excluded. All subjects were Caucasian, had low&#xD;
      habitual fish intake (less than twice a week) and were non-smokers. All subjects were&#xD;
      instructed to maintain the same level of physical activity throughout the study and agreed to&#xD;
      refrain from donating blood, as well as taking any kind of vitamin, mineral or dietary&#xD;
      supplement other than supplements provided in the study. All subjects also agreed to abstain&#xD;
      from taking solarium during the intervention. The study was approved by The Local Research&#xD;
      Ethics Committee of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg. All participants gave written consent in&#xD;
      accordance with the Helsinki declaration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and conduct of study The present study was designed as a double blinded randomised&#xD;
      cross over trial in which adult males were assigned to receive tablets containing 10 µg&#xD;
      vitD3, 10 µg 25OHD3 and 10 µg vitD2 in random order. Prior to the intervention all subjects&#xD;
      received 10 µg vitD3 for 4 weeks in order to achieve steady state in vitamin D status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vitamin D tablets (Jette) Compliance was assessed by tablet counting. The study was&#xD;
      carried out in Copenhagen, Denmark (latitude 55 degree N). All subjects were recruited in&#xD;
      September and run-in periods started in mid-October and the study was finished at the end of&#xD;
      March. During the study the subjects were examined at screening, on day 1, 22 and day 42.&#xD;
      Blood sample was collected 5 times; before run-in, at baseline, and at end of period, 1, 2&#xD;
      and 3, respectively. Blood samples were drawn after 12 h fasting, in the morning (between&#xD;
      0800 and 0900) by by a trained medical laboratory technician. Subjects were informed not to&#xD;
      drink any kind of alcohol and to abstain from hard physical work 24 h before each blood&#xD;
      sampling. They were, however, allowed to drink up to ½ L of water. Blood was collected by&#xD;
      venipuncture into 10 ml dry tubes for analysis of serum vitamin D, in 5 ml tubes for analysis&#xD;
      of serum PTH and in 7 ml Trace element free tubes for analysis of calcium. Blood samples was&#xD;
      kept at 20 degree C and centrifuged after 40 min at 3000 g for 15 min. serum was then&#xD;
      transferred into plastic tubes and stored at -80 degree C for vitamin d analysis or -20&#xD;
      degree C for Ca and PTH. Anthropometric measures, including height and weight, were taken at&#xD;
      baseline. Body weight was measured to nearest 0.1 kg by use of an electronic decimal weight.&#xD;
      Subjects were asked to empty their bladder before measuring weight only wearing underwear.&#xD;
      The height was measured to nearest cm with the subject standing without shoes, gathering&#xD;
      feeds and the head looking forward in horizontal plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Habitual intake of calcium and vitamin D was estimated by using a validated food-frequency&#xD;
      questionnaire. A health and lifestyle questionnaire, which assessed habitual fish intake,&#xD;
      physical activity, general health, smoking status and alcohol consumption, was completed at&#xD;
      screening.&#xD;
