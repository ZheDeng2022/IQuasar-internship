  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the last decade, the embolization has become the treatment of choice for ruptured&#xD;
      intracranial aneurysms, to improve the neurological outcome of patients. At the same time,&#xD;
      for his safety, she also became the technique allowing prophylactic treatment of unruptured&#xD;
      intracranial aneurysms discovered incidentally during imaging exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms, patients who survive often have a&#xD;
      reduced quality of life while one in two has a good neurological outcome after embolization.&#xD;
      Depression, anxiety and fatigue, whose the psycho-social impact is important, are often&#xD;
      cited. This description has often been done without considering the realized type of&#xD;
      treatment (surgery or embolization) and mostly of neurological and functional status of the&#xD;
      patient remotely (disability or not in daily activities).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms, they are mostly asymptomatic and&#xD;
      embolization is programmed. They would present an cognitive impairment in one case in five at&#xD;
      1 month of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If depression, fatigue and difficult return to working life are logically found in patients&#xD;
      with severe sequelae (disability in daily activities) of their ruptured intracranial&#xD;
      aneurysms, the question arises for patients with a ruptured intracranial aneurysms with a&#xD;
      favorable evolution and for asymptomatic patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A precise status of these populations is necessary, especially as the discovery and treatment&#xD;
      of their intracranial aneurysms is often early (between 40 and 60 years) and that their good&#xD;
      neurological status should allow &quot;a priori&quot; to return easily at the active life.&#xD;

      Describe the prevalence of depression among patients treated for intracranial aneurysms,&#xD;
      especially in patients with a favorable neurological outcome at 6 months (mRS inferior or&#xD;
      egal to 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study factors associated with the presence of depression in patients treated for intracranial&#xD;
      aneurysms, especially in patients with a favorable neurological outcome at 6 months (mRS&#xD;
      inferior or egal to 1)&#xD;
