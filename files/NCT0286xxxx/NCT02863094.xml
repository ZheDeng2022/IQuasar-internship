      To investigate the treatment effect of continuous transcranial magnetic stimulation on&#xD;
      schizophrenia patients with auditory hallucinations, and the underlying neural mechanism by&#xD;
      functional MRI&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients underwent a medical evaluation that included physical examination and routine&#xD;
      laboratory studies before and after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)&#xD;
      treatment. Patients were randomly allocated to rTMS group and the sham group by random&#xD;
      number. There are about 30 patients in each group.The decision to enroll a patient was always&#xD;
      made prior to randomization. Patients were studied using a double-blind design. Study&#xD;
      participants, clinical raters, and all personnel responsible for the clinical care of the&#xD;
      patient remained masked to allocated condition and allocation parameters. Only rTMS&#xD;
      administrators had access to the randomization list; they had minimal contact with the&#xD;
      patients, and no role in assessing AVH and other measures. Each patient would be treated for&#xD;
      continuous 15 days by rTMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the rTMS treatment, the Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale, Psychotic Symptom Rating&#xD;
      Scale, and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale were obtained by a trained investigator&#xD;
      to assess baseline severity of auditory verbal hallucination (AVH) and other symptoms. The&#xD;
      patients had receiving a battery measure of neuropsychological tests (standardized tests to&#xD;
      investigate their cognitive problems, anxiety and depressive symptoms in daily life),&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging scan in multimodalities, electroencephalography (EEG),&#xD;
      event-related potentials during stop signal test and Iowa-gambling test record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the last treatment, the Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale, Psychotic Symptom Rating&#xD;
      Scale, and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale were obtained, as well as the Global&#xD;
      Index of Safety to assess adverse events of the treatment. Patients were instructed to focus&#xD;
      their answers on the past 15 days. The patients had also receiving a battery measure of&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests, magnetic resonance imaging scan in multimodalities, and EEG record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A month after the last treatment, participants were interviewed to obtain the Auditory&#xD;
      Hallucination Rating Scale, Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale, the Positive, and Negative&#xD;
      Syndrome Scale. They were instructed to focus their answers on the past week. Additionally,&#xD;
      they were also asked to assess the battery of neuropsychological tests, and have magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging scan in multimodalities, and EEG record. Afterwards, they were unblinded by&#xD;
      the study coordinator.&#xD;

    <description>The continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) protocol lasted 40 s and consisted of burst of 3 pulses delivered at 50 Hz, with bursts being repeated every 200 ms (at 5 Hz) for a total of 600 pulses. In the cTBS session, this 40s protocol was repeated for three times (1800 pulses in total) separated by two 15 min breaks (controlled by a stopwatch). MRI dataset should be acquired before the first cTBS session and after the last cTBS session.</description>

    <description>The procedure of this protocol was performed by a placebo coil. Each session lasted 40 s and consisted of burst of 3 pulses delivered at 50 Hz, with bursts being repeated every 200 ms (at 5 Hz) for a total of 600 pulses. No actual magnetic stimulation was applied on the head of the volunteers. MRI dataset should be acquired before the first sham TBS session and after the last sham TBS session.</description>
