  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial will recruit up to 120 patients; 90 with ovarian clear cell carcinoma and up to 30&#xD;
      with endometrial clear cell carcinoma. Patients will be randomised between chemotherapy and&#xD;
      Nintedanib 200mg twice daily oral administration (PO) continuously. The primary diagnosis&#xD;
      must be histologically confirmed and central pathological review of the presenting tumour or&#xD;
      biopsy of relapsed disease must find at least 50% clear cell carcinoma with no serous&#xD;
      differentiation&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clear cell carcinoma (CCC) is an uncommon histotype of ovarian and a rare histotype of&#xD;
      endometrial cancer. The prognosis for recurrent disease is poor with response rates to&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy of &lt;10% so there is an urgent need for novel therapies. Ovarian CCC&#xD;
      (OCCC) is biologically different from other ovarian cancer histotypes but shares features&#xD;
      with renal CCC, including upregulation of angiogenesis pathways. Hence inhibition of&#xD;
      angiogenesis, which has been a successful strategy in renal CCC, may also be of benefit in&#xD;
      OCCC and endometrial CCC (ECCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nintedanib is a well-tolerated, potent, orally-available, kinase inhibitor targeting Vascular&#xD;
      Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGFR) 1-3, Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptor (PDGFR)α/β,&#xD;
      and Firbroblas Gworth Factor Receptors (FGFR) 1-3. It is licensed in Europe in combination&#xD;
      with docetaxel after first line chemotherapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
      Importantly it also has significant activity as a single agent in renal CCC with an Overall&#xD;
      Response Rate (ORR) of 20.3%, disease control rate of 76.% and 43% 9 month progression free&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response rates (RR) of ovarian CCC to standard chemotherapy with or without platinum are poor&#xD;
      whatever line of treatment. A number of different agents are used in recurrent CCC and,&#xD;
      although isolated instances of response to a variety of agents have been reported, no regimen&#xD;
      seems to offer a particular advantage. As a result the investigators do not expect to see&#xD;
      significant differences in response rates within the chemotherapy arms of the study. Hence it&#xD;
      is feasible to allow physicians a choice of chemotherapy from a pre-specified selection and&#xD;
      to include patients with multiple previous relapses. Since overall and progression free&#xD;
      survival may be shorter with successive lines of treatment, the number of previous lines of&#xD;
      treatment will be a stratification factor. These measures should maximise recruitment of this&#xD;
      rare tumour sub-type across different countries.&#xD;
