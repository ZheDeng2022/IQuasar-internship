    <textblock>
      Postpartum depression (PPD) is a highly prevalent and serious mental health problem and is&#xD;
      defined as the most recent episode of depression occurring between four weeks and twelve&#xD;
      months after childbirth. PPD has negative effects, which are usually strongest during the&#xD;
      first six months and may decrease the quality of mother-child interaction, adversely&#xD;
      affecting the child's behavior and emotional and cognitive development, as well as the spouse&#xD;
      marital relationship.PPD prevalence is estimated at 10 to 20%. A recent studies among&#xD;
      Arab-Bedouin women, reported 31% - 43 of PPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: To develop and implement a culturally appropriate intervention program by using focus&#xD;
      group (FGs) methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Research program description: The study includes two phases. First, qualitative&#xD;
      study will be conducted by using focus groups (FGs) method and based on the results of this&#xD;
      phase we will develop a culturally based program. The second phase will include&#xD;
      implementation and evaluation of the effectiveness of a culturally appropriate intervention.&#xD;

      This study main aim has two aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop and implement a culturally appropriate intervention program by using focus&#xD;
           group (FGs) methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the effectiveness of the culturally appropriate program in preventing PPD&#xD;
           among Arab Bedouin women in southern Israel, while taking into consideration different&#xD;
           factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Research program description The study includes two phases. First, qualitative&#xD;
      study will be conducted by using focus groups (FGs) method and based on the results of this&#xD;
      phase the investigators will develop a culturally based program. The second phase will&#xD;
      include implementation and evaluation of the effectiveness of a culturally appropriate&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study first phase Developing a culturally appropriate intervention using focus groups&#xD;
      (FGs) At this phase we will conduct four focus groups. Focus Group questions will be designed&#xD;
      to encourage participant interaction, and to elicit information relevant to our study aims&#xD;
      regarding methods of preventing and reducing PPD among Bedouin women. Three focus groups will&#xD;
      take place in the morning as most women do not work. One focus groups will be conducted in&#xD;
      the afternoon hours for women who work outside the household.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of each FG, the participants will sign an informed consent form, in addition&#xD;
      each participant will be asked to complete an anonymous, short demographic questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study second phase Evaluation of the effectiveness of culturally appropriate intervention&#xD;
      to prevent PPD. As mentioned above the intervention program will be based on the findings of&#xD;
      the FG in the first phase and will take approximately six to nine months and will be&#xD;
      conducted in the Arabic language by an Arab research team from the same culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: During the year 2016, women who visit a gynecologist in the women's health&#xD;
      center of Clalit in Rahat, Laqqya and Segev-Shalom will be approached by the PhD student and&#xD;
      asked to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women in the intervention and control groups will be screened for PPD symptoms and&#xD;
      interviewed face-to-face before the intervention (during pregnancy, beginning at week of 26),&#xD;
      four to six weeks postpartum and during three to six months postpartum using a structured&#xD;
      questionnaire in Arabic, which will include questions on PPD symptoms, knowledge and&#xD;
      attitudes about PPD, and use of mental health care services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then group training will be carried out for postpartum women in the intervention arm only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interviews will be carried out by the PhD student and other trained female students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A structured questionnaire in Arabic will be administered, and will include questions on&#xD;
      knowledge and attitudes about PPD, PPD symptoms, IPV, self-assessment of health status,&#xD;
      chronic diseases and lifestyle behaviors, socio-demographic, socio-economic, and&#xD;
      psychological characteristics, obstetrical factors, and use of mental health care services&#xD;
      for PPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of each interview will be thirty minutes, and the interviews will be conducted&#xD;
      in Arabic. Women who report EPDS score of ≥10 will be referred to a family physician, social&#xD;
      worker, psychologist and/or a psychiatrist. Question ten on the EPDS refers to thoughts of&#xD;
      self-harm, and any positive answer is considered a cause for concern, which means that women&#xD;
      who reply positively to question ten, regardless of their EPDS score, will be referred to the&#xD;
      nearest mental health service and women that suffer a sever psychiatric condition needing&#xD;
      intensive care will be dropped from the study. All women needing help and professional&#xD;
      psychiatric counseling will be referred to Dr. Awad-Alktnani, psychiatrist from the same&#xD;
      population, which works in Rahat and Soroka Medical Center in Be'er-Sheva, and one of the&#xD;
      researchers in the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study instruments The study instruments will be in Arabic and it will include validated&#xD;
      scales and questions that were used in previous research among Arab women in Israel and in&#xD;
      Arab countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Privacy and Confidentiality of participants and data The first phase of the study: data will&#xD;
      be collected anonymously, questionnaires will be saved by the researchers at the university.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second phase of the study: participants will sign an informed consent form which&#xD;
      include name, social security number, telephone number and a serial number. Informed consent&#xD;
      forms will be saved by researchers in Ben-Gurion University in a closed and locked place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research tools (questionnaires) will include a serial number only, with no Identifying&#xD;
      details of the participants. These questionnaires will also be saved at the university but&#xD;
      not in the same folder of the Informed Consent Forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For performing statistical analysis: Data will be typed and stored on a computer without&#xD;
      identifying details.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis and statistical methods Statistical analysis of the second phase of the study&#xD;
      will be performed using the SPSS statistical software version 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects The study (both phases) will start only after approval of the Clalit Health&#xD;
      services and Ethics Committee approval&#xD;

    <time_frame>2016-2018</time_frame>
    <description>Postpartum depression will be measured by Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), which was used to identify the high-risk cases of PPD. The EPDS is a ten-item self-rating scale designed to identify PPD and it is widely used in primary care settings. Each item is scored on a three-point scale (from zero to three points), the minimum and maximum total score ranging from 0 to 30, respectively. A score of thirteen and over was found to be the optimal cut-off score for probable major depression. It is accepted to use a score of ten to twelve to indicate low to moderate PPD and a score of ≥13 to indicate probable major PPD.</description>
