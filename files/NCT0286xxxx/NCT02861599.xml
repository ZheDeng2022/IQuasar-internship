  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Before proposing this observational study protocol, a randomized study was attempted. This&#xD;
      consisted in proposing to families of children with difficulties in learning to read, via the&#xD;
      speech therapists who were treating them, to take part in a randomized trial that compared&#xD;
      speech therapy alone with a combination of speech therapy and proprioceptive therapy. If&#xD;
      parents agreed in principle with the study, the child underwent a complementary speech&#xD;
      therapy examination and was referred to the nearest investigating doctor for inclusion.&#xD;
      However, this study had to be abandoned because of insufficient recruitment (2 patients&#xD;
      included in 1 year). Despite the motivation and training of participating speech therapists,&#xD;
      proposing a study based on randomization to families often in distress proved to be extremely&#xD;
      difficult, as their conviction of the interest of proprioceptive therapy was greater than the&#xD;
      available scientific evidence suggested. Direct recruitment by investigating ophthalmologists&#xD;
      was not possible because they were consulted directly by the families so as to obtain&#xD;
      proprioceptive therapy. The principle of randomization would thus not have been accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of the above, we decided to turn towards a non-randomized study comparing outcomes&#xD;
      in two groups of children:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  children who consulted an ophthalmologist who proposed proprioceptive therapy in Côte&#xD;
           d'Or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  children managed by one of the four speech therapists who do not propose proprioceptive&#xD;
           therapy and who accepted the principle of the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  with a delay of 18 months or more compared with children in the same group at&#xD;
             inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  who had never had proprioceptive therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  in cases of two or more siblings with reading difficulties between year 3 and year 8,&#xD;
             only one child will be included.&#xD;

          -  With national health insurance cover For the &quot; speech therapy only&quot; cohort: children&#xD;
             followed by speech therapists who do not usually refer their patients to&#xD;
             ophthalmologists that use proprioceptive therapy in cases of delayed reading&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             agents or rehabilitation, which may interfere with reading difficulties or the therapy&#xD;
             proposed in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
