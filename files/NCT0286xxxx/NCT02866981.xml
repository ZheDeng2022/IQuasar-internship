  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this registry is to determine if select patients with CNS metastatic disease&#xD;
      can be safely observed rather than treated. The investigators hypothesize that there is a&#xD;
      subset of patients with small asymptomatic CNS mets that do not require treatment, these&#xD;
      patients can simply be observed and will not have CNS progression.&#xD;

      Subjects will be given a consultation with physician investigators in the department of one&#xD;
      of the study investigators, who will introduce the study if the subject is potentially&#xD;
      eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information collected at initial assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life survey (FACT-Br)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History and Physical exam (to include KPS, disease status on most recent non-CNS&#xD;
           imaging, chemotherapy history, age).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of walking pace: patient will walk a pre- measured 6 meters, patient is to&#xD;
           be instructed to walk at a normal pace. The time required to travel this distance will&#xD;
           be recorded. For patients that are wheelchair bound or otherwise immobile, the pace will&#xD;
           be recorded as '0'.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurocognitive testing (Montreal Cognitive Assessment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI scan with contrast (must be within 6 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observation and Follow-up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be seen at 6 weeks and then every 2 months for follow-up (with physical&#xD;
           exam) with repeat MRI with contrast at that time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FACT-Br survey to be filled out at each follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurocognitive status (Montreal Cognitive Assessment)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment for Progression:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progression is defined as: Increase in size to &gt; 1 cm (&gt; 2.0 for patients being treated&#xD;
           with targeted therapy); Interval growth of 0.4 cm in 6-8 weeks; Development of edema or&#xD;
           increase in edema; Development of symptoms from CNS lesion; Patient preference&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients that meet criteria for treatment will be treated at discretion of treating&#xD;
           physician; options can include whole brain radiation, radiosurgery, surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study does not provide financial or other compensation to subjects&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CNS metastatic disease that meets the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No lesion greater than 0.8 cm for patients not on targeted therapy with CNS&#xD;
             penetration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No lesion greater than 1.5 cm for patients on targeted therapy with CNS penetration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No previous treatment for the observed lesion. Patients may have had other lesions&#xD;
             that have been treated as long as there is at least one index lesion that has not been&#xD;
             treated. For example, patient may have had 3 lesions treated in March 2012 with&#xD;
             radiosurgery and on recent scan is found to have a new 0.5 cm lesion, this patient is&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Less than 5 untreated CNS lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to have MRI scan with contrast&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All CNS lesions are asymptomatic. Patient may have symptoms from previous treatment or&#xD;
             cancer outside the CNS but cannot have symptoms attributable to the current CNS&#xD;
             metastatic disease. This is left to the discretion of the treating physician and in&#xD;
             some instances is not easy as sometimes CNS metastatic disease is incidental finding&#xD;
             to un-related symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible primaries&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lung (NSCLC)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Head and Neck&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Sarcoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             penetration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No lesion greater than 1.5 cm for patients on targeted therapy with CNS penetration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  More than 5 CNS lesions (can have had previously treated lesions by either surgery or&#xD;
             radiation, but at time of protocol SRS must have 5 or less untreated lesions).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic CNS lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ineligible primaries&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lymphoma&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Leptomeningeal disease in CNS&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to have an MRI (secondary for example to metal hardware)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to have MRI contrast (secondary for example to poor renal function&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CNS lesion &gt;0.8 cm in any dimension for patients not on targeted therapy with CNS&#xD;
             penetration or &gt;1.5 cm for patients on targeted therapy with CNS penetration.&#xD;
