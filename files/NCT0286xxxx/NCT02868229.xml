    <measure>Characterization of Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0-24</time_frame>
    <description>The MTD assessment was based on safety data. If more than 2 of 8 active participants in a cohort experience a Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLT), the MTD was considered to have been exceeded. The DLT threshold was defined using a threshold of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) Grade 3 events, which includes severe: infusion-related reactions, cardiopulmonary infusion reactions, anaphylaxis, or hypersensitivity.&#xD;
DLTs are defined as follows:&#xD;
Confirmed Grade 3 neutropenia and representing a decline of &gt; 25% from baseline&#xD;
Serious adverse events (SAEs) of infection in the presence of confirmed Grade 2 or higher new onset lymphopenia or new onset neutropenia.&#xD;
≥ Grade 3 ALT (Alanine transaminase) or AST(Aspartate transaminase)&#xD;
≥ Grade 4 hematologic toxicity&#xD;
≥ Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted at 13 sites in the United States.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were randomized to ziltivekimab (COR-001) or placebo within each cohort. For the first and other higher dose cohorts, first 2 participants were randomized 1:1 to ziltivekimab or placebo, and were treated at least 48 hours prior to the remaining participants randomized in a 7:1 ratio of ziltivekimab to placebo. For cohorts with doses less than the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) determined from earlier cohorts, randomization was done in 8:2 ratio of ziltivekimab to placebo.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Characterization of Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)</title>
        <description>The MTD assessment was based on safety data. If more than 2 of 8 active participants in a cohort experience a Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLT), the MTD was considered to have been exceeded. The DLT threshold was defined using a threshold of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) Grade 3 events, which includes severe: infusion-related reactions, cardiopulmonary infusion reactions, anaphylaxis, or hypersensitivity.&#xD;
DLTs are defined as follows:&#xD;
Confirmed Grade 3 neutropenia and representing a decline of &gt; 25% from baseline&#xD;
Serious adverse events (SAEs) of infection in the presence of confirmed Grade 2 or higher new onset lymphopenia or new onset neutropenia.&#xD;
