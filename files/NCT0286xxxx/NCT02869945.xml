  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease onset is clinically defined as the appearance of motor symptoms including&#xD;
      akinesia, tremor and hypertonia. Several studies have shown that motor symptoms occur when at&#xD;
      least 50 % of dopaminergic neurons are lost. However, there are evidence suggesting that the&#xD;
      level of dopaminergic denervation is not homogenous at the time of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients have a higher level of dopaminergic loss at disease onset indicating the&#xD;
      existence of compensation mechanisms. The aim of this study is to decipher how the metabolism&#xD;
      of dopamine is involved in this compensation with a focus on the polymorphism of the COMT&#xD;
      gene. This gene is expressed according to two variant: (i) COMT H that encodes a form of the&#xD;
      enzyme with a high level of activity and (ii) COMT L that encode a form of the enzyme with a&#xD;
      low level of activity. Thus, there are 3 possible genotypes in the population: (i) COMT HH&#xD;
      associated with an increased degradation of dopamine, (ii) COMT LL associated with a&#xD;
      decreased degradation of dopamine and (iii) COMT HH (intermediary between COMT HH and COMT&#xD;
      LL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that this polymorphism of the COMT gene may participate to compensation&#xD;
      mechanisms in early PD. Patients with COMT HH genotype may have an earlier motor symptoms&#xD;
      onset than patients with COMT LL genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis, we will recruit 51 patients with de novo PD will be recruited (17&#xD;
      patients for each genotype). Given the distribution of COMT polymorphism in the population, a&#xD;
      maximum sample of 76 patients will be screened to recruit 17 patients for each genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluation will include MDS-UPDRS, Non Motor Symptoms Scale, segmental symptoms&#xD;
      scale, Montreal Cognitive assessment, MMSE, Frontal assessment battery and Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease behavioral assessment scale (ECMP). All the patients will have a monophotonic&#xD;
      emission tomography with I-123-Ioflupane in order to assess the level of dopaminergic&#xD;
      denervation and an MRI scan with resting state study. Cerebrospinal fluid sampling will be&#xD;
      optional and will allow direct measurements of dopamine metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome measure will be the level of dopaminergic denervation on I-123-Ioflupane&#xD;
      scans according to COMT genotype, age, gender and severity of motor symptoms on the MDS-UPDRS&#xD;
      part 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this hypothesis is confirmed, this will allow to test the efficacy of COMT inhibitors in&#xD;
      order to delay dopaminergic drugs initiation for PD patients.&#xD;

      Parkinson's disease onset is clinically defined as the appearance of motor symptoms including&#xD;
      akinesia, tremor and hypertonia. Several studies have shown that motor symptoms occur when at&#xD;
      least 50 % of dopaminergic neurons are lost. However, there are evidence suggesting that the&#xD;

      have a higher level of dopaminergic loss at disease onset indicating the existence of&#xD;
      compensation mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to decipher how the metabolism of dopamine is involved in this&#xD;
      compensation with a focus on the polymorphism of the COMT gene. This gene is expressed&#xD;
      according to two variants: (i) COMT H that encodes a form of the enzyme with a high level of&#xD;
      aactivity and (ii) COMT L that encode a form of the enzyme with a low level of activity.&#xD;
      Thus, there are 3 possible genotypes in the population: (i) COMT HH associated with an&#xD;

&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that this polymorphism of the COMT gene may participate to compensation&#xD;
      mechanisms in early PD. Patients with COMT HH genotype may have an earlier motor symptoms&#xD;
      onset than patients with COMT LL genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis, 51 patients with de novo PD will be included (17 patients for each&#xD;
      genotype). Given the distribution of COMT polymorphism in the population, a maximum sample of&#xD;
      76 patients will be screened for inclusion of 17 patients for each genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only untreated patients will be included in the study in order to have a reliable assessment&#xD;
      of motor severity without interference of dopaminergic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be scheduled as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the first visit (V1), inclusion criteria will be checked and patients will sign the&#xD;
           informed consent. COMT genotype of selected patients will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Result of COMT genotype will be obtained within 4 weeks. Only the 17 first patients with&#xD;
           each genotype will continue the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For these patients, an evaluation visit with clinical assessment including MDS-UPDRS,&#xD;
           Non Motor Symptoms Scale, segmental symptoms scale, Montreal Cognitive assessment, MMSE,&#xD;
           Frontal assessment battery and Parkinson's disease behavioral assessment scale (ECMP)&#xD;
           will be performed..&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients will have a monophotonic emission tomography with I-123-Ioflupane in order&#xD;
      to assess the level of dopaminergic denervation. An MRI scan with resting state study will&#xD;
      also be performed to assess the compensation mechanisms at the networks level. Cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid sampling will be optional and will allow direct measurements of dopamine metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome measure will be the level of dopaminergic denervation on I-123-Ioflupane&#xD;
      scans according to COMT genotype with and without adjustment for age, gender and severity of&#xD;
      motor symptoms on the MDS-UPDRS part 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  level of dopaminergic denervation compared across the 3 genotypes (COMT HH, COMT HL and&#xD;
           COMT HH) with and without adjustment for age, gender and motor scores&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determination of functional compensation at the networks scale assessed on fMRI resting&#xD;
           state scan according to dopaminergic denervation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determination of CSF dopamine metabolite profile at the time of diagnosis (CSF sampling&#xD;
           will be optional).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this hypothesis is confirmed, this will allow to test the efficacy of COMT inhibitors in&#xD;
      order to delay dopaminergic drugs initiation for PD patients.&#xD;
