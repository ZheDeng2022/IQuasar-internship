  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab (MK-3475)&#xD;
      combination therapy in patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).&#xD;
      There will be nine cohorts in this study: Cohort A will receive pembrolizumab + olaparib,&#xD;
      Cohort B will receive pembrolizumab + docetaxel + prednisone, Cohort C will receive&#xD;
      pembrolizumab + enzalutamide, Cohort D will receive pembrolizumab + abiraterone + prednisone&#xD;
      Cohort E will receive pembrolizumab+lenvatinib, Cohort F will receive&#xD;
      pembrolizumab+lenvatinib, Cohort G will receive pembrolizumab/vibostolimab coformulation&#xD;
      (MK-7684A), Cohort H will receive pembrolizumab/vibostolimab coformulation, and Cohort I will&#xD;
      receive pembrolizumab+carboplatin+etoposide in Arm 1 and carboplatin+etoposide in Arm 2.&#xD;
      Outcome measures will be assessed individually for each cohort.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Assignment of patients to a cohort will be based on prior treatment as outlined in the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who discontinue pembrolizumab or vibostolimab+pembrolizumab after 35 infusions&#xD;
      for reasons other than disease progression or intolerability, or who discontinue&#xD;
      pembrolizumab or coformulation of pembrolizumab/vibostolimab after attaining a complete&#xD;
      response (and had at least 8 administrations of pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab/vibostolimab&#xD;
      coformulation and at least 2 treatments with pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab/vibostolimab&#xD;
      coformulation beyond initial complete response) may be eligible to receive a second course of&#xD;
      treatment that includes up to 17 additional infusions (approximately 1 year) of pembrolizumab&#xD;
      monotherapy or pembrolizumab/vibostolimab coformulation after they have experienced&#xD;
      radiographic disease progression after stopping first course treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective with Protocol Amendment 08, enrollment into Cohorts A, B, C, and D was closed.&#xD;
