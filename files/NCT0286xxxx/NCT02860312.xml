  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients on chronic hemodialysis present severe physical dysfunctioning associated with a&#xD;
      significant reduction of their muscle mass. These two parameters are associated with&#xD;
      increased morbidity and mortality along with deconditioning and poor quality of life. There&#xD;
      are several studies- usually short term, single center uncontrolled and underpowered- that&#xD;
      have shown a significant improvement of the physical, metabolic and dialytic parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are only few studies that have measured the impact of a long term intradialytic&#xD;
      exercise intervention on a supervised manner. This is a multi-center controlled study&#xD;
      examining the effects of intradialytic cycling on parameters of physical functioning, body&#xD;
      composition, cardiovascular and nutritional status, immunological status and quality of life&#xD;
      in a group of clinically stable hemodialysis patients&#xD;

    <textblock>
      General Context Chronic Kidney Patients (CKD) live a sedentary life. Sedentarity and&#xD;
      Sarcopenia worsen during the evolution of CKD with numerous cardiovascular diseases,&#xD;
      infectious and other comorbidities. Inactivity may activate and amplify the inflammatory&#xD;
      process, hypercoagulability, malnutrition, invoking a vicious circle of further inactivity&#xD;
      and deconditioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These populations have a very low physical activity profile due to important tiredness,&#xD;
      perturbed general condition and bad adaptation in effort. The patients with cardiovascular&#xD;
      problems have additional limitations due to breathlessness associated with congestive cardiac&#xD;
      failure and intermittent claudication due to peripheral arteriopathy. At the dialysis stages&#xD;
      the tiredness is accentuated after the hemodialysis sessions. The days off dialysis are&#xD;
      rarely used for practicing a physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The deconditioning along with the reduction of the physical activity are leading to a&#xD;
      de-socializing progressing in the course of the chronic renal failure. In that way the&#xD;
      patient feels more and more isolated with a serious eventual impact on the nutrition status&#xD;
      and his quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular physical activity in this population of patients is exerting beneficial effects on&#xD;
      insulin resistance, inflammation, dialysis efficiency, nutrition and arterial pressure. It&#xD;
      may also reduce the intradialytic hypotensive episodes and improve quality of life, without&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to investigate an improvement of the physical functioning&#xD;
      associated with a reprogramming of the autonomous nervous system, a reduction of the&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory factors with a reduction of the insulin resistance (reduction of the&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome), along with improvements on the immune system functioning for&#xD;
      hemodialysis patients participating on a one year intradialytic physical activity program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal aim of the present study is to show the efficacy of intradialytic physical&#xD;
      activity on functional capacity with the sit-to-stand test in 60 seconds (STS60) and the time&#xD;
      to perform 5 complete sit-to-stand movements (STS5) along with a 6 minutes' walk test (6MWT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are the amelioration of parameters associated with cardiovascular,&#xD;
      sympathetic or autonomous nervous system, immune, nutritional, metabolic and inflammatory&#xD;
      outcomes among with quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter, controlled randomized trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion of patients willing to participate in the study, and consequently their&#xD;
      randomization in 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will benefit from a supervised physical activity during the dialysis&#xD;
      session and the other group will carry on with his usual physical activities and have the&#xD;
      same tests before and after the trial without undergoing a supervised intradialytic physical&#xD;
      activity program&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary judgment criteria :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal criteria will be the effect of an aerobic training program with a warming up&#xD;
      phase, followed by 30 minutes of intradialytic cycling on 55% of the VO2max, 3 times a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary judgement criteria will be the improvement of the Sit-to-stand test in 60 seconds&#xD;
      (STS60) and the time to complete 5 sit-to stand movements (STS5) as well as the 6 minutes'&#xD;
      walk test (6MWT) from T0 (before the training program) to T12 (12 months after the start of&#xD;
      the training period)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life parameters evaluated from the questionaries SF36 (The Short Form (36)&#xD;
           Health Survey), Borg scale, EVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical activity levels: IPAQ (international physical activity questionary).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body composition (Fat mass, lean mass, bone mineral density, estimation of the muscular&#xD;
           mass) with DEXA (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiovascular parameters : Cardiac echography, doppler of the carotid arteries and the&#xD;
           lower extremity arteries, 24h cardiac rhythm exploration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immune parameters: leucocyte subpopulation functioning&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nutritional and metabolic parameters: weight, BMI, albumin, pre-albumin, pre- and&#xD;
           post-dialytic serum urea and creatinine levels, nPCR (normalised Protein catabolic&#xD;
           Rate).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inflammatory parameters :(Interleucin) IL1 bêta, IL6, IL8, IL-10, TNF alpha (Tumor&#xD;
           necrosis factor alpha), CRP (C reactive protein)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dialysis parameters : Kt/v, anemia control : Hemoglobin (Hb), MCV (mean corpuscular&#xD;
           volume), ferritin, erythropoetin dosage (EPO).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number, etiology and duration of hospitalisations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survival in 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of participants : 100, ie 50 per group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Layout of the study :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion of the patient, evaluations at the start of the study protocol, at 6 months and at&#xD;
      the end -12 months (M0, M6, M12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits and risks of this study :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvement of functional aerobic capacity, inflammatory status and quality of life.&#xD;
      Improvements on the state of pain, autonomy, augmentation of the lean mass with conservation&#xD;
      of the muscular mass for the lower extremities and reduction of the total fat mass are&#xD;
      expected as well as improvement of the nutritional status, dialysis parameters, anemia&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks are of cardiovascular origin: a possible decompensation of coronary artery disease,&#xD;
      peripheral artery disease, taking into consideration that all patients benefit from echo&#xD;
      doppler arterial control before the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular Perdialytic Activity during Dialysis is practiced in AURA Auvergne (Association pour&#xD;
      l'Utilisation du Rein Artificiel Santé) since 2 years; there has been no secondary vascular&#xD;
      problem associated with the supervised physical activity. Nevertheless, rare tendon problems&#xD;
      or articular and muscular pains could be possible on the course of the study&#xD;
