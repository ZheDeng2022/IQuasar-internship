    <textblock>
      This phase II randomized trial studies how well high dose flu vaccine works in treating&#xD;
      children who have undergone done stem cell transplant. Higher dose flu vaccine may build a&#xD;
      better immune response and may provide better protection against the flu than the standard&#xD;
      vaccine.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether high-dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-TIV) compared&#xD;
      with standard dose quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (QIV) will increase the&#xD;
      probability of achieving a &gt;= 4-fold rise in hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) titers, &gt;=&#xD;
      1:40 HAI titer, or higher geometric mean titer (GMT) to influenza A antigens in pediatric&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether HD-TIV compared with standard dose QIV will increase the probability&#xD;
      of achieving a &gt;= 4-fold rise in HAI titers, &gt;= 1:40 HAI titer, or higher GMT titers to&#xD;
      influenza B antigens in pediatric HSCT recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the frequency and severity of solicited local injection site adverse events&#xD;
      (e.g. pain/ tenderness, redness, and swelling at injection site) with HD-TIV compared to&#xD;
      standard QIV in pediatric HSCT recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the frequency and severity of solicited systemic adverse events (e.g.&#xD;
      fevers, headache, fatigue/malaise, nausea, body ache/myalgia, general activity level, and&#xD;
      vomiting) with HD-TIV compared to standard dose QIV in pediatric HSCT recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To define the relationship between HAI titers, in vivo T and B cell phenotype, and in&#xD;
      vitro influenza-specific T and B cell response in pediatric HSCT recipients receiving either&#xD;
      HD-TIV or standard dose QIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To correlate HAI responses to microneutralization responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To compare the persistent HAI and microneutralization (MN) titers for all four antigen&#xD;
      seven months after the last vaccine dose to assess for persistence of antibody titers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To compare influenza detection by PCR during influenza season in pediatric HSCT&#xD;
      recipients receiving either HD-TIV or standard dose QIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To assess HAI and MN response in children vaccinated during year 1 and revaccinated&#xD;
      during year 2 using the same antigen dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I (Experimental): Patients receive HD-TIV intramuscularly (IM) on day 0 and day 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II (Standard): Patients receive standard dose QIV IM on day 0 and day 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28-42 days, and at 7 months.&#xD;
