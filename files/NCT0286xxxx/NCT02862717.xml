      End-stage renal disease represents a major problem for public health, and is a severe disease&#xD;
      affecting hundreds of millions of people in the world and increasing rapidly. It brings about&#xD;
      complex implications to social and economic structures of every nation. Providing renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy including , peritoneal dialysis and renal transplants for ESRD patients&#xD;
      are resource intensive. Possible options have been proposed to ease the burden include early&#xD;
      medical intervention to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease in high-risk patients,&#xD;
      promotion of renal transplantation, and use of the most cost-effective dialysis therapy&#xD;
      without compromising outcome. In Malaysia, despite growing financial pressure in health care&#xD;
      system, cost-effectiveness studies of RRT modalities are scarce.The prevalence of ESRD&#xD;
      patients on dialysis are approximately 34, 767 as of 2014 and expected to rise significantly&#xD;
      in the foreseeable future. Thus, the sustainability of dialysis therapy is uncertain. This&#xD;
      study aimed to assess the cost utility of hemodialysis and continuous ambulatory peritoneal&#xD;
      dialysis treatment from Malaysia Ministry of Health perspective. One hundred and eighty&#xD;
      patients will be recruited from five state hospitals via National Renal Registry. Patients'&#xD;
      resource utilization including overhead costs, medications, dialysis consumables and&#xD;
      hospitalizations will be recorded using specially designed case report form. Patients'&#xD;
      quality of life will be assessed using validated EQ-5D-3L questionnaire. Survival analysis&#xD;
      will be conducted based on NRR data. Next, a hypothetical cohort Markov model will be&#xD;
      constructed to assess the cost utility of HD and CAPD using varying levels of CAPD use versus&#xD;
      current practice. The data collection period is from 1st October 2016 to 30th September 2017.&#xD;
      Incremental cost effectiveness ratio is the primary outcome of this study.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-stage renal disease (ESRD) represents a major problem for public health, and is a severe&#xD;
      disease affecting hundreds of millions of people in the world and increasing rapidly. It&#xD;
      brings about complex implications to social and economic structures of every nation. Renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy (RRT) is a standard choice of treatment in patients suffering from ESRD&#xD;
      which include hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD) and transplant. The National Center&#xD;
      for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion estimated that in 2014, more than 20&#xD;
      million people in the US may have different levels of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). According&#xD;
      to Fresenius Medical Care, information gathered from 150 countries worldwide showed number of&#xD;
      patients being treated globally for ESRD was estimated to be 3,200,000 at the end of 2013&#xD;
      and, with approximately 6% growth rate, continues to increase at a significantly higher rate&#xD;
      than the world population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among these patients, 2,522,000 were undergoing dialysis treatment HD or PD and around&#xD;
      678,000 people were living with kidney transplants. The annual growth rate of HD, PD and&#xD;
      transplant were estimated around 6-7%, 8% and 4-5% respectively. Reported incidence of ESRD&#xD;
      across the globe showed an important trend ranging from under 100 to over 2,000 patients per&#xD;
      million populations (pmp) in 2013. Taiwan, Japan and the USA continue to have some of the&#xD;
      highest rates with 3170 pmp, 2,620 pmp and 2,080 pmp respectively. It averages about 1,090&#xD;
      p.m.p. in the 28 countries that make up the European Union (EU). From a global view, most&#xD;
      dialysis patients can be allocated to three major geographical regions: the USA, the EU and&#xD;
      Japan. Around 44% of all dialysis patients are treated in these 30 countries. Estimates on&#xD;
      the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) for years 2000-2012, conducted by the World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO), indicated that kidney diseases were responsible for 864,226 deaths (1.5%&#xD;
      of the total number of global deaths) and 29,685,826 disability adjusted life years (DALYs)&#xD;
      lost, corresponding to 1.1% of all global DALYs lost in 2012. In Malaysia, according to the&#xD;
      22nd Report of the Malaysian Dialysis and Transplant Registry (MDTR) 2014, 6107 new HD cases&#xD;
      were reported representing an acceptance rate of 203 pmp while new peritoneal dialysis cases&#xD;
      totaled 948, representing an acceptance rate of 31 pmp in 2014. Overall, the total number of&#xD;
      HD and PD patients increased to 31,497 and 3270 respectively, giving a prevalence rate of&#xD;
      1046 pmp and 109pmp respectively from 2004 to 2014. A total of 3521 patients of HD and 494 of&#xD;
      PD were reported died in 2014. In addition, the number of dialysis centres for the whole of&#xD;
      Malaysia increased from 205 in 2000 to 758 in 2014 giving a rate of 13 pmp in 2004 and 25 pmp&#xD;
      in 2014. The increase in dialysis centres was mainly contributed by the private dialysis&#xD;
      centres which had tripled from 6 pmp in 2005 to 14 pmp in 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 22nd MDTR report also stated the number of new transplant patients was 172 in 2005 and&#xD;
      this decreased to 81 (3 pmp) in 2014. The reduction in the number of new transplants was&#xD;
      mainly due to reduction in commercial transplantation performed overseas. The number of&#xD;
      functioning renal transplants increased from 1716 in 2005 to 1907 in 2011 but declined to&#xD;
      1844 in 2014. The Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2010 conducted by Institute of Health&#xD;
      Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) revealed that among the total number of years of life lost&#xD;
      (YLLs) due to premature death in Malaysia, kidney disease ranked 14th from 25 causes of death&#xD;
      with 62 YLL per thousand population which accounted for 1.1% of the total premature death.&#xD;
      Ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and lower respiratory infections were the&#xD;
      highest ranking causes in 2010. Besides, the figures also show the Malaysia ranked 13th&#xD;
      relative to the same comparator countries for the leading causes of DALYs for kidney disease&#xD;
      in 2010 with 1 as the best performance and 15 as the worst.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESRD imposes significant economic consequences in terms of direct loss of gross domestic&#xD;
      product as a result for the management of patients with ESRD. The expenditure for the&#xD;
      management of patients with ESRD in developed countries accounted for 2-3% of total&#xD;
      healthcare expenditure, while ESRD patients represent only 0.02-0.03% of the total&#xD;
      population. The United States Renal Data System reported for 2013 $30.9 billion medicare&#xD;
      expenditure for ESRD (+1.6% versus previous year) (USRDS 2015). In the National Health&#xD;
      Service (NHS) in England, annual spending on kidney care was estimated at £445 million in&#xD;
      2002 (∼£566 million in 2009-2010 prices) and programme budgeting analysis by the Department&#xD;
      of Health estimated the total NHS expenditure on kidney care, including CKD, at £1.64 billion&#xD;
      in 2009-2010. In Australia, kidney disease contributes substantially to health care&#xD;
      expenditure in Australia and is increasing much faster than expenditure on total health care.&#xD;
      In 2004-2005 it accounted for 1.7% of total expenditure ($898.7 million), an increase of 33%&#xD;
      since 2000-2001 ($573.6 million).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Malaysia, according to the report by Malaysia National Health Accounts (MNHA), Ministry of&#xD;
      Health, total health expenditure was 4.49% per of GDP (RM 42,256 mil) with 6.22% of General&#xD;
      Government Health Expenditure (GGHE) as percent General Government Expenditure (GGE) in 2012.&#xD;
      Although limited data available of ESRD or CKD expenditure in Malaysia, the estimated cost of&#xD;
      dialysis in 2005 reported to be RM379.1 mil. NHMA (2013) report stated that, in 2005, total&#xD;
      health expenditure was 3.58% per of GDP (RM 19,447 mil).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Statement of Problem&#xD;
&#xD;
      The observed World Kidney Day annually beginning in March 2006 sends a clear message to the&#xD;
      public, government health officials, physicians, allied health professionals, patients, and&#xD;
      families that 'CKD is common, harmful, and treatable'. Renal replacement therapy is available&#xD;
      in three different modalities which include haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and kidney&#xD;
      transplantation from either a living donor or deceased donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kidney transplantation offers a nearly normal life in both, quality of life and survival, and&#xD;
      is considered the optimum treatment for eligible patients. Despite renal transplants from&#xD;
      live donors, organ shortage remains a worldwide problem producing increasing waiting lists&#xD;
      for transplantation and an inevitable necessity for dialysis treatments. According to&#xD;
      Electronic Malaysian Organ Sharing System (eMOSS), there are around 19,500 people on the&#xD;
      waiting list for kidney transplants in Malaysia as of 31st May 2016. New transplant rate in&#xD;
      Malaysia is very low at 3 pmp in 2014. Hence, most of the patients require dialysis therapy.&#xD;
      There are close to 35,000 are on dialysis (PD and HD). As compared to renal transplantation,&#xD;
      dialysis is less effective in terms of 'survival' and 'quality of life'. In spite of a&#xD;
      notable growth in dialysis provision rates by more than 10-fold between 1993 and 2014,&#xD;
      Malaysia is still incapable to provide universal access to RRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increased of dialysis centres are driven by the private dialysis centres which had almost&#xD;
      tripled from 6 pmp in 2005 to 14 pmp in 2014. Nongovernmental organization (NGO) centres had&#xD;
      only increased from 4 pmp in 2005 to 5 pmp in 2014. In contrast, the rate of growth was&#xD;
      stagnant in the public sector, 5 pmp in 2005 and 2014. Most of the increases in the private&#xD;
      dialysis centres occurred in the more economically developed west coast states of Malaysian&#xD;
      Peninsula. Public sectors still provides most of the dialysis centres in the economically&#xD;
      disadvantage states. Moreover, prevalence of ESRD is expected to rise significantly in the&#xD;
      foreseeable future. Thus, the sustainability of dialysis therapy (HD and PD) in the future is&#xD;
      uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Justification&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESRD is a chronic and serious illness with significant health consequences and high-cost&#xD;
      treatment options. Despite rising economic pressure on the collective health care system,&#xD;
      cost effectiveness studies of managing ESRD treatment are scarce in this country. An economic&#xD;
      evaluation of HD and CAPD in MOH hospitals, Malaysia was conducted in 2005 which only&#xD;
      included cost per life saved. This study was expanded in 2007 by incorporating utility&#xD;
      measures to obtain the cost utility for both HD and PD. The measurement of improvement in&#xD;
      quality of life was only associated with haemoglobin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, it is worth to note that both studies were performed based on 2001 costs data.&#xD;
      Obviously, the cost of treatments in medical settings has changed tremendously according to&#xD;
      current economic situation. For example, the cost of erythropoietin (EPO) was not adapted in&#xD;
      2007 study from the earlier study as there had been large reductions in the price of EPO, an&#xD;
      Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agent (ESA) following the in introduction of EPO-β to the MOH in&#xD;
      early 2004. As a result, the utilization rate of ESAs increased to 91% of patients on HD and&#xD;
      80% of patients on PD in 2013 as compared to 74% of patients on HD and 63% of patients on PD&#xD;
      in 2004. In regards to the utility score, they also found that the quality of life of HD and&#xD;
      CAPD patients were high by international standards (UK value set). Hence, a Malaysian EQ-5D&#xD;
      questionnaire value sets was produced that can be used in cost utility studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the low organ donation rate and continual global growth in ESRD population, it is&#xD;
      necessary and important to carry out effectiveness evaluation of HD and PD in terms of cost&#xD;
      utility analysis so that the expenditure of its management can be justified without&#xD;
      compromising outcomes. In economic evaluation studies, the choice of perspective (societal or&#xD;
      provider) has an important effect on the cost-outcome components assessed and used in the&#xD;
      evaluation. This study will be conducted from Malaysia Ministry of Health perspective. The&#xD;
      information obtained may facilitate financial planning and health policy decisions by&#xD;
      Ministry of Health regarding health care allocations for a more sustainable dialysis&#xD;
      treatment program in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Objective (s)&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aimed to compare the cost-utility between HD and CAPD from a Malaysian Ministry of&#xD;
      Health perspective by estimating cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the socio-demographic characteristics of patients on HD and CAPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the mean cost of HD and CAPD treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine life expectancies of HD and CAPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess predicted and measured quality of life (QoL) values in HD and CAPD patients&#xD;
           using EQ-5D-3L questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate the cost utility as cost per QALY gained in HD and CAPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of varying levels of PD use versus current practice&#xD;
           using a hypothetical cohort Markov model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is commencing in two phases. Phase 1 is a prospective multicentre study to&#xD;
      determine the cost utility of HD and CAPD from MOH perspective using activity based costing&#xD;
      (ABC) and step-down approach. Costs of interventions (HD and CAPD) are obtained from the&#xD;
      participating dialysis centres and dialysis patients' medical records. Health related quality&#xD;
      of life (HRQoL) or utility score is evaluated using EQ-5D-3L questionnaire. Data from&#xD;
      National Renal Registry (NRR) will used to estimate of participating dialysis patients. The&#xD;
      data collection period is from 1st October 2016 to 30th September 2017. Phase 2 involves the&#xD;
      development of a hypothetical cohort Markov model using TreeAge software with inputs from the&#xD;
      earlier phase and other secondary data including transition probabilities and incident&#xD;
      dialysis patients to evaluate the cost utility by varying levels of CAPD use versus current&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 Cost utility analysis of sampled data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1: Selection of participating centres Stage 2: Patient recruitment Stage 3: Cost&#xD;
      analysis Stage 4: Measurement of quality of life Stage 5: Measurement of patient survival&#xD;
      (based on secondary data from NRR) Stage 6: Cost utility analysis Stage 7: Sensitivity&#xD;
      analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 Cohort Simulation Markov model Stage 1: Development of Markov Model using TreeAge Pro&#xD;
      Software Stage 2: Inputs of cost and health utilities Stage 3: Transition probabilities Stage&#xD;
      4: Scenario analysis Stage 5: Sensitivity analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sampling frame of a participating centre is all MOH state hospitals with HD and PD units&#xD;
      that submit their patients' data to the Malaysian National Dialysis and Transplant Registry&#xD;
      (MDTR) via National Renal registry (NRR). The MDTR was set up in 1992 to collect data for&#xD;
      patients on RRT. The registry functions to describe the natural history of ESRD, describe the&#xD;
      characteristics of patients with ESRD, its management, patients' survival and treatment&#xD;
      outcomes (NRR). Following are the inclusion and exclusion criteria for selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Centres that commenced operations before 2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Awarded compliance certificate and contribute &gt;80% annual treatment return according to&#xD;
           the MDTR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Possesses adequate clinical and administrative data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Private and NGO dialysis centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Centres with less than 50 CAPD and 50 HD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  State hospitals from Sabah and Sarawak due to logistic reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the inclusion and exclusion criteria, five state hospitals have been selected to&#xD;
      participate in this study using purposive sampling including Hospital Kuala Lumpur and&#xD;
      Hospital Tengku Ampuan Rahimah (Central), Hospital Tengku Ampuan Afzan (East), Hospital&#xD;
      Sultanah Aminah (South) and Hospital Pulau Pinang (North). A purposive sampling was used&#xD;
      after considering logistics problem, availability of a senior nephrologist to become&#xD;
      principal site investigator at each sites, availability of medical assistants and nurses to&#xD;
      assist on data collections and approval from the respective site's head of department and&#xD;
      director. However, selected hospitals can be considered to represent MOH dialysis centres&#xD;
      since they are distributed across various geographical regions except Sabah and Sarawak (Far&#xD;
      East).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Patient recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      180 dialysis patients (90 HD and 90 CAPD) are included in the study. Patients are sampled&#xD;
      using a multistage random sampling. Firstly, a latest master list of patient from the&#xD;
      selected participating centres is obtained from NRR (registered from 2011 to 2015) according&#xD;
      to the inclusion and exclusion criteria mentioned above. Secondly, the list is separated&#xD;
      according to HD and CAPD for each centre and sorted in ascending order based on the patients&#xD;
      registered identification number in the database. Next, a simple random sampling is applied&#xD;
      to select participating patients. Selected patients who agreed to participate in this study&#xD;
      are be asked to read the information sheet before signing the consent form. They can withdraw&#xD;
      in any point of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Study tools&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following forms are designed and being used to elicit information on patient's&#xD;
      sociodemographic characteristics, commodities, baseline lab test, quality of life/utility&#xD;
      index, and costs (capital + recurrent) :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Form 1: Patient Particulars and resource utilization&#xD;
&#xD;
      This form is designed to collect patient's sociodemographic characteristics such as age,&#xD;
      gender, ethnicity, highest education level and average annual income and commodities such as&#xD;
      hypertension, cardiovascular disease and anemia. Data related to vascular access surgeries,&#xD;
      medications, imaging, laboratory tests, hospitalization, referral to non-nephrology clinics&#xD;
      and patient status (alive/dead/transplanted/withdrawn) is collected via this form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Form 2: Centre Costing Form&#xD;
&#xD;
      This form is designed to collect data on capital cost of dialysis centre including building&#xD;
      cost, equipment/instrument used for dialysis and . Recurrent cost of dialysis related&#xD;
      consumables, staff salaries and other consumables such as office stationery and utilities&#xD;
      including water, electricity and telephone usage will be collected via this form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Form 3: EQ-5D-3L&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of life of HD and CAPD patients will be assessed using EQ-5D-3L instrument. .&#xD;
      EQ-5D is an instrument which evaluates the generic quality of life developed in Europe and&#xD;
      widely used. In general, the EQ-5D questionnaire, descriptive system measures health status&#xD;
      in five dimensions of morbidity, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and&#xD;
      anxiety/depression. Each dimension has three level of severity, namely 1) no problem, 2) some&#xD;
      problem and 3) extreme problem. The descriptive system contains a total of 243 theoretically&#xD;
      possible combinations of EQ-5D questionnaire domains and problem levels, referred to as&#xD;
      health states. It is also recommended that to comply with the Malaysian tariff to convert to&#xD;
      utility scores using the &quot;N3 Re-scaled VAS&quot; scoring algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TreeAge Pro Software&#xD;
&#xD;
      TreeAge Pro Software will be used to construct the Markov model.&#xD;
