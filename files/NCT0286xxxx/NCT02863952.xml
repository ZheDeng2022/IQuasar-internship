    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate early post-stress EF change (∆EF) and its relation to&#xD;
      the severity of myocardial ischemia and angiographic coronary disease using CZT-SPECT MPI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is a&#xD;
      well-established noninvasive procedure for the evaluation and risk stratification of patients&#xD;
      with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, it has been recognized that in certain patients&#xD;
      SPECT MPI is unable to detect the presence of CAD or underestimates its extent. The fact that&#xD;
      moderate to severe perfusion defects are noted in less than half of the patients with&#xD;
      significant left main disease has stimulated studies to improve the diagnostic accuracy of&#xD;
      SPECT MPI. These studies have analyzed post-stress parameters such as left ventricular (LV)&#xD;
      ejection fraction (EF), wall motion abnormalities and transient LV dilation. However, these&#xD;
      parameters were derived from data acquired using conventional Anger cameras as long as 60&#xD;
      minutes after stress tracer injection. Such delayed assessment may miss early ischemic&#xD;
      stunning as a result of its rapid transient changes. However, with highly sensitive detectors&#xD;
      and short lived tracers, the ability of PET MPI to measure EF during peak of stress has been&#xD;
      reported. Similarly, the novel cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) SPECT cameras with solid state&#xD;
      cardiac-focused detectors are significantly more sensitive than the conventional Anger&#xD;
      scintillation cameras giving to SPECT the &quot;PET-like&quot; ability to image rapidly right after the&#xD;
      stress test. The aim of this study is to evaluate early post-stress EF change (∆EF) and its&#xD;
      relation to the severity of myocardial ischemia and angiographic coronary disease using&#xD;
      CZT-SPECT MPI.&#xD;
