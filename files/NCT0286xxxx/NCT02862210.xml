  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a progressive neurodegenerative illness that affects the&#xD;
      frontal and anterior temporal lobes of the brain. Changes in behavior, including agitation,&#xD;
      aggression, and repetitive behaviors, are common symptoms in FTD. The investigators currently&#xD;
      do not have good medications to treat these symptoms in FTD, and the medications the&#xD;
      investigators use often have side effects. In this project, the investigators will test the&#xD;
      use of low-dose lithium, compared to a placebo pill, for the treatment of behavioral symptoms&#xD;
      in FTD. Lithium greatly reduces the behavioral symptoms of bipolar disorder, and many have&#xD;
      found low-dose lithium to be well-tolerated in patients with dementia. Lithium appears to&#xD;
      inhibit the creation of a protein involved in many cases of FTD called tau.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Behavioral symptoms of Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), including agitation, aggression, and&#xD;
      inappropriate repetitive behaviors are common, distressing to patients and caregivers, often&#xD;
      lead to institutionalization, and can be very difficult and expensive to treat. There is a&#xD;
      dearth of medication for treating these symptoms in FTD. Typically, antidepressants and&#xD;
      antipsychotic medications are prescribed - which low efficacy and, with the latter class,&#xD;
      carry serious adverse effects such as parkinsonism and increased cardiovascular-related&#xD;
      mortality. The investigators propose a study of the efficacy of lithium carbonate compared to&#xD;
      placebo in the treatment of agitation, aggression, and inappropriate repetitive behaviors in&#xD;
      60 patients with FTD in a randomized, double-blind, two-arm parallel 12-week trial. Lithium&#xD;
      is a highly effective treatment for mania and symptoms of agitation or aggression in bipolar&#xD;
      disorder. It also inhibits tau aggregation and phosphorylation, leading to considerable&#xD;
      interest in its use as a disease-modifying treatment for tauopathies such as FTD and&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease. Unfortunately, earlier trials using typical doses (i.e., doses&#xD;
      prescribed for treatment of bipolar disorder) showed high incidence of serious adverse&#xD;
      effects (including confusion and delirium). For the study proposed study the investigators&#xD;
      will: 1) use lower doses and lower target serum concentrations than have preceding trials&#xD;
      (shown in preliminary data from a Columbia study and data from other labs to be&#xD;
      well-tolerated) and 2) target behavioral symptoms rather than cognitive outcomes.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in agitation and aggression as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Scale (NPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The NPI is a scale designed to assess behavioral changes due to neurological illness. It uses a standardized caregiver interview to rate patient symptoms in a variety of domains, including &quot;Agitation/Aggression.&quot; Each domain includes a number of questions about potential specific symptoms, and then asks the caregiver to rate symptom frequency (1, occasionally, to 4, very frequently) as well as symptom severity (1, mild, to 3, severe). Thus, in each domain a patient can score from 0-12, with 0 being no symptoms and 12 being very frequent and severe symptoms. The study aims to test that lithium will significantly reduce agitation/aggression as compared to placebo by testing whether participants taking lithium show a greater reduction in their NPI &quot;Agitation/Aggression&quot; domain score over the course of the trial.</description>

    <description>Response requires a 30% decrease in NPI core score (sum of domain scores for &quot;Agitation/Aggression&quot; and &quot;Aberrant Motor Behavior&quot;) plus a Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Change score of much improved or very much improved (CGI based on these behavioral symptoms only).</description>

    <description>NPI domain &quot;Aberrant Motor Behaviors&quot; will be observed to test that lithium will significantly reduce repetitive behaviors as compared to placebo, by examining whether participants taking lithium show a greater reduction in their &quot;Aberrant Motor Behaviors&quot; NPI domain score.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Presence of adverse events as measured by the Treatment Emergent Symptoms Scale (TESS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The tolerability of low-dose lithium by assessing emergent side effects over the course of the 12-week trial will be assessed. The side effects will be captured with TESS in which 30 symptoms are rated either &quot;Absent,&quot; &quot;Mild,&quot; &quot;Moderate,&quot; or &quot;Severe.&quot; The change in TESS score from baseline to week 12 will be observed.</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The baseline serum BDNF levels as a potential baseline predictor of lithium treatment response and an increase from pre to post-treatment BDNF levels as a potential biomarker correlate of improvement in symptoms (as measured by the NPI) will be explored.</description>
