    <textblock>
      This study has two aims: a) to evaluate the pelvic floor muscles strength in primigravid and&#xD;
      non-pregnant nulliparous women and to correlate with their sexual function and b) to compare&#xD;
      PFM strength and sexual function between women in the second and third pregnancy trimesters.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational cross-sectional study. The sample consisted of 161 women divided&#xD;
      into two groups: the first of pregnant women, formed by 81 primigravidae participants in the&#xD;
      Prenatal Program of the public health system in Uberlandia city (Brazil). The second consists&#xD;
      of 80 non-pregnant nulliparous. All participants signed an informed consent and the study was&#xD;
      approved by the Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Uberlandia (nº 145.623/2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate the average strength of vaginal palpation and vaginal squeeze pressure in&#xD;
      primigravid, the investigators used the following equation to scale the sample: Zα/2 refers&#xD;
      to the probability (α/2) standard one-tailed normal distribution; σ2 is the variance&#xD;
      associated with vaginal palpation and vaginal squeeze pressure; ε is the sampling error.&#xD;
      Based on a similar study, which evaluated similar population, it was assumed: α=0.05, σ=1.34&#xD;
      and ε=0.32 for vaginal palpation; and it was assumed: α=0.05, σ=12.60 and ε=3.00 for vaginal&#xD;
      squeeze pressure. Therefore, the sample size would be 67 and 68 women, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PFM assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      PFM evaluation was performed by vaginal palpation and vaginal squeeze pressure. These methods&#xD;
      are widely used in research involving the female pelvic floor and many studies have shown its&#xD;
      reproducibility and validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same examiner conducted all evaluations and before the start of the study, the&#xD;
      reproducibility was tested. Ten women were evaluated twice, with an interval of one week to&#xD;
      determine the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of all variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants were asked about the health history. After checking that they were eligible&#xD;
      to participate in the survey, participants were invited to empty the bladder and to remain in&#xD;
      the supine position with hips and knees flexed and feet propped. Assessments began after&#xD;
      explaining how to perform the contraction of PFM and the volunteer was advised to stay&#xD;
      relaxed and breathing normally. The vaginal palpation was always the first exam to check the&#xD;
      PFM contraction ability and then was held vaginal squeeze pressure exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During vaginal palpation the examiner quantified strength. The physiotherapist introduced the&#xD;
      index and middle fingers about 4cm inside the vagina, and requested to hold the maximum&#xD;
      contraction of the PFM, according to the instruction of a movement &quot;inward and up&quot; with the&#xD;
      greatest possible strength. Muscle function was classified by the Oxford Scale Modified, with&#xD;
      varies from zero (absence of muscle contraction) to five (strong contraction with finger&#xD;
      sucking of the evaluator). To be considered valid, the movement of cranial elevation was&#xD;
      observed by the examiner, as well as the absence of visible contractions of the adductor&#xD;
      muscles of the hip, gluteus or abdominals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaginal squeeze pressure was measured through perineometer equipped with a vaginal probe&#xD;
      that has been covered with a non-lubricated condom and then the probe was lubricated with&#xD;
      hypoallergenic gel. The probe sensor was connected to a microprocessor hand with a latex&#xD;
      tube, which allows the measurement of nip pressure in centimeters of water. To obtain the&#xD;
      measurements, the subjects remained positioning and vaginal sensor was introduced&#xD;
      approximately 4cm into the vaginal cavity. The women were oriented and motivated verbally to&#xD;
      perform three voluntary maximal contractions sustained for five seconds and one minute&#xD;
      interval between them. For statistical analysis, the investigators used the mean of three&#xD;
      peak pressures provided by the equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sexual function assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sexual function was evaluated by the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire, with&#xD;
      a validated Portuguese version, which has an easy to understand language and subsequently was&#xD;
      applied exclusively in Brazilian pregnant women. The questionnaire consists of 19&#xD;
      multiple-choice questions, which involves six sexual response domains: desire, arousal,&#xD;
      lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction and pain. The score for each question is individual,&#xD;
      varying from 0 to 6 points. The investigators performed a mathematical calculation, which&#xD;
      allowed the acquisition of a ﬁnal index, the total score of the FSFI. The total score of FSFI&#xD;
      ranges between 2 and 36 points. The lower the score, the worse is the sexual function is. The&#xD;
      assessment is for the period of the last four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of the interview, the pregnant women were instructed regarding the completion and&#xD;
      they had their enough time to fill it out in a self-administered way in a reserved place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences software&#xD;
      (SPSSV21, Chicago, IL). Data normality was tested by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. To perform&#xD;
      the variables comparison, the Mann-Whitney test was performed. To verify the correlation&#xD;
      between the variables, the Spearman correlation test was used. Values of p&lt;0.05 were&#xD;
      considered significant. The intensity of the relationship of the correlation coefficient&#xD;
      values were interpreted according to the following guidelines: 0 = zero; 0.10-0.39 = weak;&#xD;
      0.40-0.69 = moderate; 0.70-0.99 = strong, 1 = perfect, regardless of whether positive or&#xD;
      negative.&#xD;
