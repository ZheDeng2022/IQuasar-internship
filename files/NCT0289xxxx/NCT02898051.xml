      Low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) are the reference molecule for the long term treatment&#xD;
      of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in cancer patients but remains, however, associated with a&#xD;
      high risk of recurrent thromboembolism. The high rate of recurrence may result from&#xD;
      alterations in the pharmacokinetics of LMWH. The primary purpose of the study is to compare&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics of anti-Xa activity in patients with cancer and patients without cancer&#xD;
      treated with curative dose of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) for venous thromboembolism&#xD;
      (VTE). The secondary purposes are 1/ to study the correlation between anti-Xa LMWH and&#xD;
      concentration of plasma heparanase and 2/ to evaluate the predictive nature of the anti-Xa&#xD;
      activity on the occurrence of thromboembolic recurrence in cancer patients treated with LMWH&#xD;
      for VTE.&#xD;

      Purpose of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of the study is to compare the pharmacokinetics of anti-Xa activity in&#xD;
      patients with cancer and patients without cancer treated with curative dose of low molecular&#xD;
      weight heparins (LMWH) for venous thromboembolism (VTE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary purposes are 1/ to study the correlation between anti-Xa LMWH and concentration&#xD;
      of plasma heparanase and 2/ to evaluate the predictive nature of the anti-Xa activity on the&#xD;
      occurrence of thromboembolic recurrence in cancer patients treated with LMWH for VTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multicentre cohort study of patients hospitalized with VTE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Observational case-control study to compare the pharmacodynamics of anti-Xa activity&#xD;
           between patients cancer patients (n = 50) and non-cancer patients (n = 50) matched (1-1)&#xD;
           for age, renal function and LMWH&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A prospective cohort study including 320 cancer patients with a 6 months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are a common complication of cancer. They complicate&#xD;
      up to 10% of cancers and are the cause of fatality, morbidity and significant impaired&#xD;
      quality of life. The treatment of these diseases is difficult in this context. Low molecular&#xD;
      weight heparins (LMWH) are the reference molecule for the long term treatment of venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism (VTE) in cancer patients. Outside this context, their pharmacological&#xD;
      properties allow to administer a fixed dose without measuring anti-Xa activity. In the&#xD;
      presence of cancer, their use remains, however, associated with a high risk of recurrent&#xD;
      thromboembolism up to 9% after 6 months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This high rate of recurrence may result from alterations in the pharmacokinetics of LMWH in&#xD;
      the presence of a cancer. The synthesis of heparanase by tumor cells might cause a decrease&#xD;
      in anti-Xa activity of LMWH and reduce their effectiveness. If this hypothesis is verified,&#xD;
      it could result in a change in the management of thrombosis in cancer patients and lead to a&#xD;
      dose adjustment of LMWH through the measurement of anti-Xa activity, which may allow reduce&#xD;
      the incidence of thromboembolic relapses during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment (Target or Actual Number of Subjects):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pharmacokinetics study In a preliminary unpublished study of 37 cancer and non-cancer&#xD;
           subjects with the highest concentration of anti-Xa activity was measured. Included 100&#xD;
           subjects (50 cancer patients and 50 non-cancer) would detect a maximum level difference&#xD;
           of anti-Xa activity in plasma of 0.20 between cancer patients and cancer-with a power of&#xD;
           90% and a risk of the first kind 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A difference of 0.20 seems relevant from these preliminary data (median 0.46 vs 0.65),&#xD;
           and returns to show that a cancer patient has over 70% chance of having a maximum&#xD;
           concentration of anti-Xa activity below that of a free cancer patient (nonparametric&#xD;
           Wilcoxon test).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cohort study (cancer patients) The risk of recurrent thromboembolism was estimated&#xD;
           between 5 and 10% in cancer patients. By including 200 subjects, around twenty events&#xD;
           would be observed and corresponds to a reasonable number of subjects can be recruited&#xD;
           over 18 months (50 would already enroll in the pharmacodynamic study). The event rate&#xD;
           will be assessed on the first 100 patients that will have been followed for 6 months, if&#xD;
           event rate is lower than expected, the number of participants will be reassessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After over 2 years of inclusion, the event rate is lower than expected (7%). The number of&#xD;
      subjects required was therefore reassessed. To reach the number of 20 events necessary to our&#xD;
      analysis, a total of 320 cancer subjects must therefore be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Follow-Up, duration :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: 5 years and 6 months (inclusion: 5 years follow-up: 6 months). Duration of&#xD;
      participation: 3 a 10 days for non-cancer patients, 6 months for cancer patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performance of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pharmacokinetics study Inclusion (as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed VTE): 1 tube of&#xD;
           blood taken before the start of treatment (at the time of another blood sample) for&#xD;
           determination of heparanase. After the start of treatment: 3 tubes of blood drawn for&#xD;
           determination of anti-Xa activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assays will be centrally performed, blinded from the clinical data and from the group&#xD;
           knowledge of the group patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prospective cohort study of cancer patients Followed for 6 months with consultation at&#xD;
           1, 3, and 6 months (normal monitoring).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits: Collection of clinical data (recurrent thromboembolism, hemorrhage, death,&#xD;
      tumor progression, cancer treatment since last visit, interruption of treatment with LMWH,&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia, anemia), and removal of 1 tube of blood (at the time of a another sample)&#xD;
      for determination of anti-Xa activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thromboembolic recurrences will be validated centrally by an independent committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduce the incidence of thromboembolic recurrence in cancer patients treated with LMWH for&#xD;
      VTE by adapting the dose of LMWH with anti-Xa activity in this population if the hypothesis&#xD;
      is verified.&#xD;
