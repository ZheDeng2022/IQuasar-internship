    <textblock>
      This is a mixed methods study that evaluates the effectiveness of the Big White Wall (BWW)&#xD;
      online community and its implementation in 3 hospital/health system sites across Ontario. The&#xD;
      6 month study includes 1000 participants that are randomized to an immediate treatment group&#xD;
      or a delayed treatment group. The primary outcome includes a change in total and subscale&#xD;
      scores on the Recovery Assessment Scale. Qualitative interviews with various stakeholders&#xD;
      will explore issues relating to successful implementation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a nested comparative&#xD;
      effectiveness arm to assess the value of intervention extension, with concurrent Realist&#xD;
      Evaluation. The pragmatic randomized trial will assess whether the intervention (the Big&#xD;
      White Wall) works when introduced into a public health or clinical setting, i.e., in real&#xD;
      life conditions. The qualitative realist evaluation will assess the contextual influences and&#xD;
      strategies by which the Big White Wall is adopted or rejected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pragmatic Randomized Control Trial (RCT) with nested comparative effectiveness arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The RCT will include a delayed treatment crossover control. The immediate treatment&#xD;
           group (ITG) will get access to the BWW at time of enrollment and have continuous access&#xD;
           for a period of 3 months. The delayed treatment group (DTG) will have no access for the&#xD;
           first 3 months, then receive access to the BWW for 3 consecutive months. A 2:1&#xD;
           allocation ratio will be used to randomized participants to ITG or DTG. After 3 months&#xD;
           of intervention, ITG participants will have the opportunity to opt-in to an intervention&#xD;
           extension arm. Those who opt-in will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive an&#xD;
           additional 3 months of BWW or no additional intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To determine the incremental benefit and cost-effectiveness of the BWW for patients with&#xD;
           mental health problems who seek care at hospital-based mental health programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators hypothesize that users of the BWW will experience an increase in their&#xD;
           mental health recovery orientation as evidenced using a standardized recovery assessment&#xD;
           tool. The investigators also hypothesize that improvements will be observed in symptoms&#xD;
           of depression and anxiety, along with quality of life and community integration.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recruitment/Study Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A total of 1000 study participants will be recruited from 3 large mental health settings&#xD;
           in Ontario: Ontario Shores Mental Health Sciences, Lakeridge Health, and Women's College&#xD;
           Hospital (WCH). Lakeridge Health and Ontario Shores both have inpatient and outpatient&#xD;
           mental health services that support individuals with mental health issues across the&#xD;
           lifespan while Women's College Hospital has a large outpatient mental health program.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All study participants will be given access to the BWW, free of charge, for 3 months or&#xD;
           6 months for those randomized to the ITG extension arm. Services on the BWW include peer&#xD;
           support, self-guided and facilitated self-help resources, psycho-educational material&#xD;
           and interactive creative activities. All participants will maintain anonymity on the&#xD;
           site through a unique non-identifiable user identifier (ID). All participants will&#xD;
           receive a unique access code for the BWW. Use of the BWW is participant dependent, with&#xD;
           the ability to log in and utilize the services at any frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Baseline socio-demographic data will be collected following consent. Self-report data on&#xD;
           all outcomes will be collected via questionnaires at baseline, 3 months and 6 months.&#xD;
           Baseline outcome questionnaires will be completed in 1 of 3 ways: 1) web survey&#xD;
           (default); 2) by phone; 3) in-person hard copy. All other questionnaires will be&#xD;
           administered with web-based surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data analysis will be done at study completion, after all data has been collected.&#xD;
           Analysis will be blinded to treatment allocation. Initially, descriptive analysis will&#xD;
           be conducted for all variables. The primary outcome, The Recovery Assessment&#xD;
           Scale-Revised (RAS-r) at 3 months, will be analyzed with an intent-to-treat analysis&#xD;
           using an ANCOVA controlling for baseline RAS-r score as well as treatment group,&#xD;
           unadjusted and adjusted for baseline Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), baseline&#xD;
           Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), age, sex, education, relationship status,&#xD;
           household income, duration of episode, and recruitment setting. In sensitivity analysis,&#xD;
           the investigators will repeat this using a marginal structural model to account for&#xD;
           attrition. The same analysis will be repeated for all secondary outcomes at 3 months&#xD;
           controlling for baseline score and treatment group. In the subset of ITG participants&#xD;
           who opt in to the nested extension study, the investigators will examine outcomes at 6&#xD;
           months between treatment groups. Analysis of primary and secondary outcomes will be&#xD;
           repeated as described above, controlling for scores at both baseline and 3 months. The&#xD;
           first exploratory analysis will examine a subset of the ITG group who had a PHQ-9 or&#xD;
           GAD-7 score of at least 10 at baseline. Participants will be categorized as 'responders'&#xD;
           or 'non-responders' based on whether or not they achieved at least a 50% reduction in&#xD;
           the PHQ-9 or GAD-7 at 3 months relative to baseline. Second, the investigators will&#xD;
           examine engagement with the BWW among ITG participants. The number of logins and total&#xD;
           time on the site will be separately predicted with age, gender, education, relationship&#xD;
           status, living situation, household income, baseline belief in treatment credibility and&#xD;
           outcome expectancy, baseline PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores, duration of current episode,&#xD;
           recruitment setting and outpatient mental health visits. In terms of economic&#xD;
           evaluation, the combination of program costs, out-of-pocket costs and costs in the&#xD;
           health care system will be used to determine the total costs associated with&#xD;
           participants in the program. Incremental cost-effectiveness will be assessed using an&#xD;
           incremental cost-effectiveness ratio calculated as the difference in costs between DTG&#xD;
           and ITG divided by the difference in outcomes between these groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Qualitative Realist Evaluation Protocol The Realist Evaluation will occur alongside the&#xD;
           pragmatic randomized trials described above, and will include two key methods. The first&#xD;
           is qualitative interviews with key stakeholders involved in the implementation and use&#xD;
           of BWW, and the second is observations of the introduction and use of the virtual care&#xD;
           interventions among health care provider participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the qualitative realist evaluation component of this study is to (a)&#xD;
      understand perspectives of mental health care providers regarding the appropriateness of BWW&#xD;
      for their patients, (b) explore participants' perspectives of the usability and acceptability&#xD;
      of the BWW online community, and (c) examine the key issues associated with scaling BWW up&#xD;
      across Ontario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of recruitment into the broader pragmatic randomized trial of which this&#xD;
      qualitative study is a part, patient participants will be asked if they consent to be&#xD;
      contacted with further information regarding the qualitative element of the study. The&#xD;
      qualitative research team will purposefully sample from the pool of interested ITG&#xD;
      participants who consented to be contacted for an interview at study enrollment. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to interview 4-6 participants at each site, spanning different age&#xD;
      categories, for a total of 12-15 patient participants. Qualitative interviews will be&#xD;
      completed with 5-7 health care providers at each site; 2-4 organizational leaders at each&#xD;
      site (for example, clinical managers); and 5-7 health system decision makers in Ontario.&#xD;
      These participants will be identified by clinical site leads using a snowball sampling&#xD;
      process to identify key informants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient interviews will be conducted via telephone or personal video conferencing. Patients&#xD;
      will be invited to participate in two interviews 1-2 weeks after gaining access to the BWW&#xD;
      and again at 8-12 weeks after gaining access. Observation of the educational session in which&#xD;
      health care providers and other staff are educated regarding the BWW will take place.&#xD;
      Participants who opt in for the intervention extension arm of the study will again be asked&#xD;
      whether they are interested in participating in a qualitative interview. Participants who&#xD;
      identify as willing to be contacted may or may not have participated in a qualitative&#xD;
      interview in the first phase of the study, and will be purposefully sampled and interviewed&#xD;
      2-4 weeks after the re-randomization process in the same manner as the initial interviews.&#xD;
      The investigators will again recruit 2-3 participants at each of the 3 sites for a total of&#xD;
      12-15 patient participants from the extension arm. Healthcare providers will also be invited&#xD;
      to participate in an interview 1-2 weeks post-education session on the BWW. Health care&#xD;
      provider interviews will take place at their location of work or via telephone.&#xD;
      Organizational leaders will be invited to participate in an interview in person or via&#xD;
      telephone 3 to 4 months post BWW implementation. Health system decision makers will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in an interview in person or via telephone 3 to 6 months post BWW&#xD;
      implementation. Patient interviews will include general questions about how the patient&#xD;
      manages his or her mental health in the community, their perspectives of the BWW, and how&#xD;
      they use the BWW. If the patient has not engaged with the BWW, the qualitative interview will&#xD;
      include questions about why not, and what alternative strategies the patient uses to manage&#xD;
      mental health in the community. Health care provider interviews will include questions about&#xD;
      health care providers' perspectives on the BWW community, mental health services in Ontario,&#xD;
      and the value of virtual care interventions such as the BWW for promoting self-management of&#xD;
      mental health overall. Interviews with organizational leaders and health system decision&#xD;
      makers will include questions about the effectiveness of virtual care interventions to&#xD;
      promote mental health self-management in the community, the context of mental health services&#xD;
      in Ontario, and the procurement and implementation of virtual care interventions such as the&#xD;
      BWW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observation and interview data will be analyzed using thematic analysis strategies,&#xD;
      identifying key themes that demonstrate important contextual influences and practices related&#xD;
      to the implementation and evaluation of the virtual care technologies in actual contexts of&#xD;
      health care delivery. The findings of the qualitative data will be used to develop statements&#xD;
      of the relationships between (a) key contextual factors, (b) the mechanisms by which they&#xD;
      effect the implementation of the virtual care interventions, and (c) the impact on the&#xD;
      outcomes of the intervention themselves. These statements will be used to develop&#xD;
      understanding of (a) the specific mechanisms by which BWW is effective for users, and (b)&#xD;
      strategies to inform the future implementation of BWW and/or similar interventions on a&#xD;
      larger scale.&#xD;

    <description>The BWW is an internet-based intervention that incorporates several elements of mental health care that have been shown to be effective, in a virtual environment that provides anonymity (see www.bigwhitewall.com). The on-line portal gives users access to self-assessment tools to track symptoms for a wide range of conditions over time, educational materials, a social network that allows communication between people who may have similar problems, and access to on-line courses. The service is monitored at all times by &quot;Wall Guides&quot; to ensure that users are responded to and that the content posted is appropriate and safe.</description>
