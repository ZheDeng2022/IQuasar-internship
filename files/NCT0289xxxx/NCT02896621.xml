  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators investigated diastolic function among patients with obstructive sleep apnea&#xD;
      (OSA) and hypertension stage I. In this randomized controlled trial, participants were&#xD;
      randomly allocated to one of two groups: chlorthalidone associated with amiloride or&#xD;
      amlodipine. Randomization was carried out prior to the start of the trial by an&#xD;
      epidemiologist out of clinic and the randomization list was stratified by gender and severity&#xD;
      of OSA. The research team and participants were blinded to the randomization list and&#xD;
      allocation concealment was implemented. This trial aimed to detect changes in the&#xD;
      echocardiography parameters with the drug treatment (higher in the intervention than in the&#xD;
      placebo group). The investigators also assess change in daytime sleepiness among participants&#xD;
      who already have been diagnosed with OSA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial, with participants randomly allocated to one of two&#xD;
      groups: chlorthalidone associated with amiloride or amlodipine. Capsules were identical&#xD;
      presentation and the research team and participants were blinded to the allocation list. The&#xD;
      randomization list was stratified by gender and severity of OSA (AHI: 10-25 or 26-40) and in&#xD;
      blocks in time, with size four and six units. Randomization was carried out prior to the&#xD;
      start of the trial and it was generated by a validated software (Random Allocator). In order&#xD;
      to ensure the confidentiality of the allocation list, it was generated by an epidemiologist&#xD;
      who did not maintain direct contact with participants and the identification of the study&#xD;
      drugs was done through alphanumeric code, implemented via software (RedCap).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence to treatment was measured by counting returned capsules and through the Morisky&#xD;
      questionnaire with eight questions, validated for Portuguese. Participants underwent initial&#xD;
      clinical evaluation prior to randomization and after eight weeks of treatment for evaluation&#xD;
      of outcomes. Demographic characteristics (age, gender, skin color), socioeconomic level&#xD;
      (education), previous morbidity (diabetes mellitus, stroke, acute myocardial infarction,&#xD;
      cancer, rheumatic diseases), treatments in use (anti-diabetic, anti-depressants,&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, corticosteroids, nasal vasoconstrictor, appetite&#xD;
      suppressants, lipid-lowering drugs) and lifestyle characteristics (smoking and drinking) were&#xD;
      collected in a standardized way. The investigators also assess anthropometric measures such&#xD;
      as weight, height, waist, neck and hip circumference, and bioimpedance for determination of&#xD;
      lean and fat mass. Blood pressure was measured using a validated digital oscillometric&#xD;
      monitor, with cuff appropriate to the arm circumference, and two measurements per visit were&#xD;
      made. In addition, ECG was performed and biochemical parameters (creatinine, blood glucose,&#xD;
      serum potassium, uric acid, cholesterol and fractions, C-reactive protein and NT-proBNP) were&#xD;
      determined in the laboratory of Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transthoracic echocardiography is performed by the CX-50 unit (Philips, Bothell, WA -&#xD;
      USA) with sectoral S5-1 transducer. Ambulatory monitoring of blood pressure will be measured&#xD;
      through the Mortara AMBULO 2400 device (Mortara, Milwaukee, WI, USA) with measures 15/15&#xD;
      minutes during the day and 20/20 minutes at night, within 24 hours of a working day.&#xD;
      Polysomnography will be held in type III (home with device that measures at least 4&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory variables) held with handset Sonmocheck (Weinmann GmbH, Hamburg, Germany),&#xD;
      a monitor that detects the position of the patient, the presence of apneas or hypopneas,&#xD;
      heart rate and digital oximetry.&#xD;
