      The Leonetti law of 22 April 2005 on the rights of patients at end of life provides the&#xD;
      opportunity for &quot;all adults&quot; to write advance directives in case she would one day be &quot;unable&#xD;
      to express their will.&quot; If this right is enshrined in the hospitalized patient's charter,&#xD;
      brought to the attention of any patient entering a hospital, the fact remains that only 2.5%&#xD;
      of the deceased have written advance directives (study National Institute of demographic&#xD;
      studies published in 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, according Régis Aubry, a researcher at the observatory on the end of life, the&#xD;
      conditions of the end of life are insufficiently discussed with patients and their families&#xD;
      and can lead to difficult situations conflicting view. Now, thinking about advance directives&#xD;
      should allow an exchange on the conditions of the end of life desired by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sicard report of December 2012 concluded that such legislation is known neither patients nor&#xD;
      doctors. This is the first obstacle to its use, even if major psychological barriers exist&#xD;
      both in patients that their doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is in this context that Valls government asked MM. Claeys and Leonetti to propose a new&#xD;
      bill on the subject. The bill provides that advance directives will no longer be valid for 3&#xD;
      years, but until changed or until the patient's death, and they can be invoked against&#xD;
      doctors except emergency or illegality. In addition, to complete the bill, the Ministry of&#xD;
      Health commissioned the National Health Authority (HAS) writing a form of advance directives,&#xD;
      as well as a doctor's information guide and patient on the subject. The working group is&#xD;
      chaired by Professor Sicard. Among the recommendations made to physicians (and by extension&#xD;
      health professionals), the investigators accept that talk of advance directives as often as&#xD;
      possible and as early as possible, even in the absence of commitment in the short or medium&#xD;
      term prognosis .&#xD;

      Main objective / secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility of addressing the topic of advance directives (% of patients agreeing to answer&#xD;
      the questionnaire) during vascular medicine clinic in town.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessing preferences for editorial context to enable to present the project in optimal&#xD;
      circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess felt an evolution of the doctor-patient relationship by patients in the context of&#xD;
      advance directives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess the reactions according to the characteristics of the study population to help develop&#xD;
      different &quot;profiles&quot; and adapt the introduction of the topic of advance directives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: prospective, single-center, non-interventional kind opinion survey Study duration: 6&#xD;
      months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acquisition of data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The characteristics of the population obtained will be studied to try to understand the&#xD;
      feelings of patients, to better target patients to talk to about advance directives in&#xD;
      vascular medicine and evaluate some extent if the topic of advance directives contributes to&#xD;
      &quot;modernize &quot;the doctor-patient relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  List of data gathered: cf. attached questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical analysis: local management (GHPSJ) from the patient profile&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anonymity of data: an identifier for each subject will be awarded (first name and&#xD;
           surname - year of birth) and the data will be entered on a computer file which will be&#xD;
           sent to the statistician in charge of analyzing the GHPSJ site. There will be no&#xD;
           personally identifiable data exchange.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe how the study: after information transmitted orally by the doctor (Dr&#xD;
           P.Priollet) and patient's consent to participate, patients will be interviewed (attached&#xD;
           schedule) and data gathered during consultations of office visits to Dr. Priollet city&#xD;
           by Dr. Priollet assisted by Hélène Samson (internal medicine), anonymized and handled&#xD;
           within the vascular medicine department of Dr. Priollet to GHPSJ.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expected duration of patient recruitment: 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of patients to recruit 100 patients, 15 minutes per patient. At all times&#xD;
           patients can freely return to the subject in subsequent consultations with Dr. Priollet.&#xD;
