      This project will benefit from the results of the concept study conducted from July to&#xD;
      October 2014 from groups of coronary patients. This first study will help to develop the&#xD;
      precise contours of Appet HEART application for the production of the prototype version used&#xD;
      in the clinical feasibility study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the feasibility study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. assess the rate of use of the application&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to determine the ideal target population of the application&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to evaluate the effectiveness of the application&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to measure the risks and potential limitations of its use&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. to determine the medical and economic impact of this application&#xD;

      The patient education activities at the center in coronary artery disease, and have shown&#xD;
      their efficiency, in combination with exercise training. Unfortunately the issue of&#xD;
      educational care is low and maintaining long-term changes in the lifestyle and adherence to&#xD;
      drug intake is limited which is a major health challenge because originally a recidivism rate&#xD;
      too high coronary disease. In this context, therapeutic measures to enable patients to better&#xD;
      integrate into their daily lives the recommendations in the long term are fundamental.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the expertise of the Toulouse University Hospital in the field of therapeutic&#xD;
      education coronary patient, the investigators decided to develop a Smartphone application&#xD;
      that aims to strengthen and modernize the educational care to the patient. Based on an&#xD;
      accurate and comprehensive assessment of lifestyle, from the technical elements of Smartphone&#xD;
      support, but also on providing innovative educational materials (videos, interactive&#xD;
      software...), the treat ( pharmacological or not: diet, physical activity, toxic consumption&#xD;
      ) may thus be optimized according to the principle of telemedicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will benefit from the results of the concept study conducted from July to&#xD;
      October 2014 from groups of coronary patients. This first study will help to develop the&#xD;
      precise contours of Appet HEART application for the production of the prototype version used&#xD;
      in the clinical feasibility study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the feasibility study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. assess the rate of use of the application&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to determine the ideal target population of the application&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to evaluate the effectiveness of the application&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to measure the risks and potential limitations of its use&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. to determine the medical and economic impact of this application&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center study. Patients will be recruited from the Toulouse University&#xD;
      Hospital in cardiac services when patients came to coronary heart disease. After inclusion,&#xD;
      patients receive an initial educational diagnosis that will determine individualized&#xD;
      educational goals on the management of their coronary disease. Patients then receive training&#xD;
      in the use of Appet HEART application. Using the application is provided on year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation criteria of the study is original because conducted in hetero or self during&#xD;
      the protocol monitoring time. Chronologically the investigators note:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An initial assessment hetero judgments criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A self- evaluation every three months for one year via their smartphone on some of these&#xD;
           criteria via questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A final visit is scheduled to perform the same hetero- evaluation at the initial.&#xD;
