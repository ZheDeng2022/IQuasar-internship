  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goals of antidepressant treatments are to achieve remission of depressive episodes&#xD;
      and prevent recurrences. However, clinical trials designed to approve antidepressants targets&#xD;
      a response rate of at least 50%, which is considered partially effective. Therefore, there is&#xD;
      a need for new treatment strategies, including augmentation with other substances such as&#xD;
      lithium. This research aims to verify through a pilot study, the effect of selenium as an&#xD;
      augmentation treatment for sertraline-resistant major depression. This clinical trial was&#xD;
      designed to be a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial evaluating the effect of&#xD;
      selenium or placebo in subjects diagnosed with major depression who have not responded to&#xD;
      treatment with sertraline&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This research aims to verify in a pilot study the effect of selenium as an augmentation&#xD;
      treatment for sertraline-resistant major depression and, as secondary endpoints, if the&#xD;
      levels of selenium in patients with depressive episodes are different from individuals&#xD;
      without depression. Thus, this clinical trial was intended to be a randomized double-blind&#xD;
      placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating the effect of selenium or placebo in patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with major depression who have not responded to treatment with sertraline in&#xD;
      appropriate dose and treatment duration. The initial sample will be comprised of patients&#xD;
      with moderate or severe major depression, who will receive sertraline up to 200mg/day, for at&#xD;
      least 8 weeks. A group of subjects without major depression will be selected as a control&#xD;
      sample, which will be submitted to the same procedures of the included patients. It is&#xD;
      estimated an initial sample of 90 patients with major depression (DSM-IV criteria), and about&#xD;
      30 patients resistant to treatment, which will be randomly divided into two groups (selenium&#xD;
      and placebo). The control group sample is estimated to be 45 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the diagnosis of major depression, it will be used the Structured Clinical Interview for&#xD;
      DSM Axis I disorders (SCID Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV Axis I disorders). To&#xD;
      evaluate the outcome of treatment of the depressive symptoms, it will be used the Clinical&#xD;
      Global Impression Scale and Patient Global Impression Scale (CGI and PGI), Hamilton&#xD;
      Depression Rating Scale of 17 items for depression (HAM-D-17), Montgomery-Asberg Depression&#xD;
      Rating Scale (MADRS) and SAFTEE- (brief structured interview assessing adverse events). The&#xD;
      exclusion criteria include patients with any diagnosis of psychosis, bipolar disorder,&#xD;
      personality disorder, any psychiatric condition that need hospitalization, severe risk of&#xD;
      suicide, recent drug abuse or dependence, use of any polyvitamin substance, or any substance&#xD;
      with known relevant psychopharmacological action, women with known or suspected pregnancy or&#xD;
      breastfeeding, and people with unstable organic disease such as lupus erythematosus,&#xD;
      uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation is voluntary, and participants of both genders must be over the age of 18&#xD;
      years. After checking for exclusion and inclusion criteria (visit 0), the first phase of the&#xD;
      study will start with the completion of the following laboratory tests: serum levels of&#xD;
      selenium, electrocardiogram, hematology (hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell count,&#xD;
      platelet count), SGOT, SGPT, gammaGT, urea, creatinine, fasting glucose, TSH, free T4, T3,&#xD;
      Na, K, total cholesterol + triglycerides fractions, urine analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second phase consists in the treatment of patients with depression with sertraline, which&#xD;
      will receive initial dosage of 50 mg / day up to 200 mg or maximum tolerated dose, according&#xD;
      to the investigator's decision, for at least 8 weeks. Patients considered&#xD;
      resistant-sertraline (Hamilton-D-17&gt; 7) will be invited to participate in the double-blind&#xD;
      randomization phase to treatment groups with placebo or selenium (400 mcg / day). Sertraline&#xD;
      will be maintained throughout the whole phase randomization. As the trial would be completed,&#xD;
      participants will be referred to outpatient care in community health services. Initially the&#xD;
      variables will be analyzed descriptively. In phase 1 Student's test will be used in order to&#xD;
      compare the serum levels of selenium in both groups. At stage 2 for comparison of pre and&#xD;
      post treatment with Sertraline it will be used the non-parametric McNemar test and in step 3,&#xD;
      to determine the behavior of the groups during six weeks, it will be used analysis of&#xD;
      variance with repeated measures.&#xD;
