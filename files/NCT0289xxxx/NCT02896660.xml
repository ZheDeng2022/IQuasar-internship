      HITLAB will conduct a crossover study wherein participants will be asked to wear an&#xD;
      actigraphy device continuously for 12 weeks. The first four weeks of the study participants&#xD;
      will continue their previously scheduled treatment regimen, prior to receiving the Probuphine&#xD;
      implant. Following four weeks of activity and sleep baseline monitoring using the actigraphy&#xD;
      device, the participant will receive the Probuphine implant as part of their regularly&#xD;
      scheduled treatment plan. Observation of the participant's activity levels will continue for&#xD;
      eight weeks following implantation of Probuphine. Actigraphy measurements will include total&#xD;
      time asleep, total time awake, sleep efficiency, and time mobile.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HITLAB will conduct a crossover study that measures the activity levels and sleep quality of&#xD;
      patients both before and during treatment with Probuphine in order to determine whether&#xD;
      Probuphine offers the additional benefit of improved energy levels during treatment, further&#xD;
      distinguishing it from other opioid dependency treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HITLAB researchers will meet with participating site physicians prior to study recruitment in&#xD;
      order to administer the &quot;Physician Baseline Questionnaire,&quot; a brief semi-structured baseline&#xD;
      questionnaire to assess initial physician expectations for the actigraphy device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Per physician guidelines, patients must be in stable treatment for at least 1 month prior to&#xD;
      study enrollment. If the physician determines Probuphine to be an appropriate treatment&#xD;
      method for the study subject, the physician will meet with the subject and explain the&#xD;
      purpose of the actigraphy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon enrollment, the physician will administer the &quot;Participant Baseline Questionnaire,&quot;&#xD;
      assessing general well-being, physical activity level, sleep patterns, and technology usage.&#xD;
      At this time, the participant will be asked to begin wearing the Actigraph continuously for&#xD;
      12 weeks. The first four weeks of the study patients will continue their previously scheduled&#xD;
      treatment regimen, prior to receiving the Probuphine implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following four weeks of activity and sleep baseline monitoring using the actigraph device,&#xD;
      the participant will receive the Probuphine implant [day 30]. At this visit, the clinician&#xD;
      will administer four clinical assessments: Assessment of Withdrawal from Opioids Scale&#xD;
      (SOWS), Clinical Opiate Withdraw Scale (COWS), Visual Analog Scales (VAS), and Measures of&#xD;
      Morning Desire to use/need to use tool from Braeburn Pharmaceuticals (HS-11-421), as well as&#xD;
      a baseline quality of life assessment (WHOQOL-BREF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observation of the participant's activity levels will continue for a total of eight weeks&#xD;
      following implantation of Probuphine. Actigraphy measurements will include total time asleep,&#xD;
      total time awake, sleep efficiency, and time mobile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the midline 60-day visit with each participant, as part of their regular monthly treatment&#xD;
      appointment, the physician will repeat administration of the four clinical assessments (The&#xD;
      Assessment of Withdrawal from Opioids Scale (SOWS), Clinical Opiate Withdraw Scale (COWS),&#xD;
      Visual Analog Scales (VAS), and Measures of Morning Desire to use/Need to use tool from&#xD;
      Braeburn Pharmaceuticals (HS-11-421)), as well as the quality of life assessment&#xD;
      (WHOQOL-BREF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the participant endline visit [90 days], a physician will administer a repeat quality of&#xD;
      life questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF), and the four clinical assessments: Assessment of Withdrawal&#xD;
      from Opioids Scale (SOWS), Clinical Opiate Withdraw Scale (COWS), Visual Analog Scales (VAS),&#xD;
      and Measures of Morning Desire to use/need to use tool from Braeburn Pharmaceuticals&#xD;
      (HS-11-421).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, five participants will be randomly selected to participate in a short&#xD;
      qualitative interview at the time of the site endline visit. Participant interviews, in&#xD;
      person or via telephone, will assess their experience using the actigraph device during&#xD;
      treatment, and their perspectives on activity changes and sleep quality. Patient perspectives&#xD;
      on activity changes and sleep quality will serve as a point of triangulation for the&#xD;
      actigraphy data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HITLAB will conduct a baseline site visit, a site visit after 30 days, after 60 days, and&#xD;
      after 90 days (the endline visit) of the study period to collect questionnaire and assessment&#xD;
      data for analysis. Actigraphy data will be uploaded at days 30, 60 and 90. At the endline&#xD;
      site visit, participating physicians will be asked to complete a brief, semi-structured&#xD;
      &quot;Physician Endline Questionnaire&quot; to assess satisfaction with the actigraphy device in&#xD;
      helping them improve outcomes and quality of life for patients in Probuphine treatment. A&#xD;
      HITLAB researcher will also conduct a brief qualitative interview with the physicians at the&#xD;
      endline site visit. The in-person physician interviews will assess whether the actigraphy&#xD;
      data informed patient experience in such a way that it improves the efficacy of Probuphine&#xD;
      administration and treatment.&#xD;
