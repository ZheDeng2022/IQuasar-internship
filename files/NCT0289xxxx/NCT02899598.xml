      Neonatal thrombocytopenia isoimmunization maternal-fetal is related to maternal immunization&#xD;
      against fetal platelet antigens with paternal origin not present in the mother. It is&#xD;
      considered the equivalent of hemolytic disease of the newborn. The incidence of this disease&#xD;
      is about 1 in 800-1000 births. The most severe forms associated petechiae, purpura or&#xD;
      cephalhematoma at birth with a major risk of cerebral hemorrhages (20% to 25% of cases) can&#xD;
      cause the death of the child (15%) or severe neurological troubles (15-30%) Biologic&#xD;
      diagnosis requires the detection of anti-platelet antibodies with maternal determination of&#xD;
      platelet phenotypes and genotypes of the two parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this work is to develop specific molecular tools to fetal platelet&#xD;
      genotyping from maternal blood. We are particularly interested to antigens HPA-1, HPA-5 ,&#xD;
      HPA-3 and HPA-4. We evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of this test by comparing these&#xD;
      results with those obtained from an invasive sampling of amniotic fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective study to assess the technical and diagnostic performance of a new&#xD;
      molecular method noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of platelet genotyping.&#xD;

      Neonatal thrombocytopenia isoimmunization maternal-fetal is related to maternal immunization&#xD;
      against fetal platelet antigens with paternal origin not present in the mother. It is&#xD;
      considered the equivalent of hemolytic disease of the newborn. The incidence of this disease&#xD;
      is about 1 in 800-1000 births. The most severe forms associated petechiae, purpura or&#xD;
      cephalhematoma at birth with a major risk of cerebral hemorrhages (20% to 25% of cases) can&#xD;
      cause the death of the child (15%) or severe neurological troubles (15-30%) Biologic&#xD;
      diagnosis requires the detection of anti-platelet antibodies with maternal determination of&#xD;
      platelet phenotypes and genotypes of the two parents. When it is diagnosed, genetic&#xD;
      counseling to the couple for a future pregnancy is necessary because the risk of recurrence&#xD;
      is important and severity increases with the number of pregnancies. The risk depends on the&#xD;
      nature of paternal antigens, homozygous or heterozygous. In case of heterozygosity, prenatal&#xD;
      diagnosis is based on fetal platelet genotyping by an invasive procedure (amniocentesis or&#xD;
      chorionic villus sampling) associated with a risk of fetal loss. The alloantibodies&#xD;
      responsible for fetal damage are directed against platelet alloantigens: this is HPA system&#xD;
      (human platelet alloantigen). 24 alloantigens have been described and 12 of them have a&#xD;
      biallelic polymorphism (a: the most frequent allele and b the rare allele) divided into 6&#xD;
      groups (HPA-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 15). The genotype-phenotype correlations were performed for 22&#xD;
      of the 24 alloantigens and show that the antigenic polymorphism results from the presence of&#xD;
      a SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism-).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1997, Lo et al showed the presence of 3-6% of fetal DNA in maternal blood. This discovery&#xD;
      led to the development of methods of non-invasive prenatal diagnosis: 1/ the determination of&#xD;
      fetal Rhesus 2/ fetal sex by real-time quantitative PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this work is to develop specific molecular tools to fetal platelet&#xD;
      genotyping from maternal blood. We are particularly interested to antigens HPA-1, HPA-5 ,&#xD;
      HPA-3 and HPA-4. We evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of this test by comparing these&#xD;
      results with those obtained from an invasive sampling of amniotic fluid.&#xD;
