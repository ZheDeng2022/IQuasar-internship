      The association study will compare the allele frequencies of polymorphisms of a single&#xD;
      nucleotide (SNP) in the population of individuals with aortic stenosis compared to a control&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be included only if they are suffering from a typical form of tight and&#xD;
      surgical tricuspid aortic stenosis. Patients will therefore only included if they are&#xD;
      suffering from aortic stenosis, the surface is less than 1 cmÂ² and if histological analysis&#xD;
      or failing intraoperative findings of the surgeon showed a tricuspid aortic stenosis.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Criteria has reached:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  That patients are operated or not, they can be considered as having a&#xD;
                  degenerative aortic stenosis, patients will be diagnosed with aortic stenosis&#xD;
                  (aortic area &lt;1 cm) without obvious cause found.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. criteria not met&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Strictly normal aortic valve by ultrasound in an over 65-year-old patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  All patients do not fit into the above two categories are considered as having an&#xD;
                  unknown phenotype and will not be used in binding assays. In particular, the&#xD;
                  presence of an aortic sclerosis or even moderate aortic regurgitation can be&#xD;
                  considered as potentially incipient form of aortic stenosis, patients with this&#xD;
                  type of anomaly will not be scanned during family analyzes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who did not sign the consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non degenerative aortic stenosis or for which another cause could be found.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Among the most commonly found causes are:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bicuspid aortic valve&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe renal impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe Hypercholesterolemia&#xD;
