      Patients with medically refractory epilepsy will be treated by intracerebroventricular (ICV)&#xD;
      delivery of valproate using an implantable drug pump system. The dose of valproate will be&#xD;
      escalated weekly during a blinded-evaluation period through Day 64 to determine the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD). After Day 64, patients can continue for 52 weeks in the open-label&#xD;
      evaluation period (non-blinded). .&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Epilepsy patients that are refractory to oral anti-epileptic drug (AED) treatment have&#xD;
      significantly higher mortality, higher morbidity, higher economic costs and diminished&#xD;
      quality of life compared to those who suffer from epilepsy that can be adequately controlled&#xD;
      with medical management. Current options for refractory patients include neurosurgical brain&#xD;
      resection, responsive neurostimulation, and vagal nerve stimulation. None of these options is&#xD;
      satisfactory due to the low applicability of surgery for patients with poorly localized or&#xD;
      multifocal seizures and the limited success of currently available alternative treatment&#xD;
      options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients with medically refractory focal epilepsy will be treated with&#xD;
      intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of valproate using an implantable drug pump&#xD;
      system. This is a dose ranging study, with a randomized, double-blind dose escalation&#xD;
      component, to establish the dose range of ICV valproate delivery. Clinical assessments,&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs), seizure diaries, concomitant medications, blood samples and&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will be collected and reviewed at designated time points. Magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) will also be performed. Subjects&#xD;
      will have their surgery, dose changes and pharmacokinetics performed in an inpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ICV Valproate dose will be escalated stepwise from 3 mg/day to 60 mg/day through Day 64&#xD;
      if tolerated, or stopped earlier upon establishment of a subject's maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD). The MTD for each subject will be determined based on the highest dose tolerated&#xD;
      without experiencing a dose-limiting adverse event (AE). After establishing a subject's MTD,&#xD;
      delivery of ICV Valproate will continue at the MTD through Day 64 of the blinded evaluation&#xD;
      period. Subjects and assessing physicians will remain blinded to the treatment dose during&#xD;
      the blinded evaluation period. Subjects can continue in the open-label evaluation period&#xD;
      (non-blinded) for 52 weeks following the blinded evaluation period.&#xD;

             and has full scale IQ &gt; 70 by testing or functional assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has brain volume which is not noted to be abnormally small due to atrophy by&#xD;
             either the radiologist reading on MRI scan or the treating clinicians (the&#xD;
             neurosurgeon) review of the MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has had confirmed epilepsy for a minimum of 1 year, with diagnosis of focal&#xD;

             Epileptic Seizures (1981).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. In the opinion of the investigator, subject has disabling seizures. Disabling refers&#xD;
             to seizures that are severe enough to cause injuries, or significantly impair&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Subject has had an EEG or video EEG or invasive monitoring within the past 3 yrs&#xD;
             consistent with partial seizures (a normal interictal EEG is consistent with partial&#xD;
             seizures)&#xD;

             should be counted. The subject should have no period longer than 30 days in the 3&#xD;
             months prior to enrollment with less than 2 seizures. Seizures of hippocampal origin&#xD;
