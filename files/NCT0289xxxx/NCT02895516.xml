  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, open-label, single-arm study, to evaluate the ease of use,&#xD;
      tolerability, efficacy and safety of the Vibrant Capsule administered in the home&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One arm will be assessed: Vibrant Capsule administered twice a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will follow a 2 weeks baseline period and then take the Vibrant Capsule for a&#xD;
      treatment period of 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 2 weeks of baseline, patients will be asked to refrain from taking any medication&#xD;
      or supplement to relieve their constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 14 days the patients will return and eligibility will be re-assessed. Patients will be&#xD;
      instructed to complete a simple patient eDiary each day throughout the duration of the study.&#xD;
      After 3 weeks of treatment, the patient will attend for evaluation and to receive new&#xD;
      capsules. A final visit will take place at the end of the 6 week treatment period.&#xD;
