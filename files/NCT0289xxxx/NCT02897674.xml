  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aims: To investigate whether diet with realistic doses on palm oil will have an effect on&#xD;
      lipid profile and fat deposition in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Design: Randomized, parallel design over 14 weeks including a 2 week standardization period&#xD;
      and 12 week supplementation. In the standardization period all participants will incorporate&#xD;
      palm oil into their diet which will make up 20% of their calories providing a baseline&#xD;
      measure. In the supplementation period of 12 weeks, each volunteer will be randomized into&#xD;
      one of the three fats: palm olein, interesterified palm olein or soybean oil, consuming 20%&#xD;
      of their calories from these fast and remaining 10% fat calories from fats naturally&#xD;
      occurring in foods like meat and nuts. Otherwise participants will keep the rest of their&#xD;
      diet habitual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: 60 healthy males and females aged between 18 and 60 years, of which 30&#xD;
      participants with a BMI between 18.5-24.9kg/m2 and 30 participants with a BMI between&#xD;
      25-29.9kg/m2 and fasting plasma glucose and no evidence of insulin resistance will be&#xD;
      recruited. No pre-existing morbidity including cardiac, hepatic or renal disease, history of&#xD;
      diabetes, hypertension or hyperlipidemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: Pre-intervention: Participants will be asked to record habitual dietary intake by&#xD;
      completion of a 4-day food diary and be asked to wear an accelerometer armband to assess&#xD;
      physical activity at the beginning and at the end of supplementation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 weeks standardization period: All participants will be asked to replace added fat in their&#xD;
      diet with palm olein providing two thirds of 30% fat calories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the standardization period, which will be the first day of a 12 week dietary&#xD;
      intervention, as well as at the end of 12 week supplementation, participants will attend the&#xD;
      clinical research facility for a study visit. Weight, height and waist circumference will be&#xD;
      taken; total and regional body composition will be measured by MRI. Fasting and post prandial&#xD;
      plasma glucose, insulin, appetite hormones and lipids will be measured. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to come in for follow-up visits at week 6 and 10 for a single blood samples and weight&#xD;
      check.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 week supplementation period: participants will be randomized into one of the three&#xD;
      supplementation groups: palm olein, interesterified palm olein or soybean oil. Participants&#xD;
      will be asked to consume two thirds of their 30%fat calories from one of the oils while&#xD;
      incorporating it into their normal diet in cooking and baking.&#xD;
