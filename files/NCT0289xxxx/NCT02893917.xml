  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well olaparib with or without cediranib works in&#xD;
      treating patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer that has spread to other places&#xD;
      in the body (metastatic). PARPs are proteins that help repair DNA mutations. PARP inhibitors,&#xD;
      such as olaparib, can keep PARP from working, so tumor cells can't repair themselves, and&#xD;
      they may stop growing. Cediranib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving olaparib and cediranib may help treat patients with&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the clinical activity of the combination of cediranib and olaparib, as measured&#xD;
      by radiographic progression free survival (rPFS), as compared to olaparib monotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the clinical activity of the combination of cediranib and olaparib, as measured&#xD;
      by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate, radiographic response rate by Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1, and overall survival (OS), as&#xD;
      compared to olaparib monotherapy in patients with mCRPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate association of homologous recombination deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair&#xD;
      deficiency (HRD) with the clinical activity of the combination of cediranib and olaparib or&#xD;
      olaparib monotherapy, as measured by rPFS, in mCRPC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the safety the combination of cediranib and olaparib and olaparib&#xD;
      monotherapy in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize genomic alterations by whole exome sequencing in mCRPC patients and&#xD;
      correlate that with clinical activity or resistance to olaparib with or without cediranib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize changes in ribonucleic acid (RNA) expression of DNA repair genes,&#xD;
      angiogenesis markers, and immune markers, by whole transcriptome sequencing and correlate&#xD;
      with clinical activity or resistance to olaparib with or without cediranib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To characterize changes in immune tumor microenvironment in mCRPC patients by profiling&#xD;
      expression of co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory molecules and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,&#xD;
      and correlate with clinical activity or resistance to olaparib with or without cediranib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To identify baseline predictive biomarkers for rPFS or response and to identify&#xD;
      on-treatment markers of acquired resistance in men with mCRPC receiving either olaparib plus&#xD;
      cediranib or olaparib alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To explore biomarker signatures that correlate with the clinical activity or resistance to&#xD;
      olaparib with or without cediranib, including changes in gene expression or acquired&#xD;
      mutations in tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and cediranib PO once daily&#xD;
      (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive olaparib PO BID on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.&#xD;
