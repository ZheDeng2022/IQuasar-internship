  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV-infected patients with intermediate-high risk have a high prevalence of CAD and a&#xD;
      substantial proportion of obstructive CAD. Degree of stenosis is associated with&#xD;
      immunoactivation (lymphocyte and monocyte) and microbial translocation&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A hallmark of HIV infection is a state of global immune activation that is only partially&#xD;
      restored under highly active antiretroviral therapy. Apart from immune deficiency and&#xD;
      impaired immune restoration, this chronic immune activation may result via various mechanisms&#xD;
      in non-AIDS linked morbidities such as atherosclerosis. Coronary artery disease (CAD),&#xD;
      especially myocardial infarction (MI), is the leading cause of death in Europe [Eurostat&#xD;
      2013]. Cardiovascular deaths are responsible for 8% of deaths among HIV-infected patients in&#xD;
      France and for 15% of deaths among HIV-infected patients in US [Lewden C JAIDS 08, Palella FJ&#xD;
      JAIDS 06]. Multiple cohort studies have shown that HIV-infected patients are at a higher risk&#xD;
      of myocardial infarction than the general population [Triant VA J Clin Endocrinol 07,&#xD;
      Freiberg MS JAMA Intern Med 13] and there is some evidence that HIV-infected patients have a&#xD;
      38% greater risk of mortality from MI than controls [Pearce D AM J Cardiol 12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several tools for cardiovascular risk stratification are available but current risk scores&#xD;
      seem to underestimate this risk in HIV-infected patients. Indeed, a significant proportion of&#xD;
      cardiovascular events occur in subjects with none or few risk factors. A European study&#xD;
      comparing first episode of MI among HIV-infected patients with uninfected controls showed&#xD;
      that 40% had none or only one traditional cardiovascular risk factor [Boccara F Eur Heart J&#xD;
      11]. Another study in general population demonstrates that almost 50% of patients with a MI&#xD;
      had no previous history of coronary symptoms [Tunstall-Pedoe H Circulation 96].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The true prevalence of CAD in asymptomatic HIV-infected patients is unknown. Older studies&#xD;
      performed in tissue samples from deceased patients demonstrated 3-times greater odds of&#xD;
      having obstructive CAD in HIV-infected patients compared with non-infected controls after&#xD;
      controlling for age and sex [Micheletti RG Cardiovasc Pathol 09]. A recent meta-analysis&#xD;
      shows that the prevalence of coronary stenosis and calcified coronary plaques is similar in&#xD;
      comparison with non-HIV age and sex-matched controls but HIV-infected patients have a 3-fold&#xD;
      higher prevalence of non-calcified coronary plaques [D'Ascenzo Atherosclerosis 15].&#xD;
&#xD;
      CAD severity detected by coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) is associated with&#xD;
      cardiac death or MI and all-cause mortality [Habib F Int J Cardiol 12]. 64 slice or greater&#xD;
      CCTA is reported to have a sensitivity of 93 to 97% and specificity of 80 to 90% compared to&#xD;
      standard coronary angiography [Fihn SD J Am Coll Cardiol 12]. There is a high correlation&#xD;
      between CCTA and invasive coronary angiography in the determination of CAD extent and&#xD;
      severity [Miller JM N Engl J Med 08].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether routine CCTA screening in high-risk populations can effect changes in treatment (such&#xD;
      as pre-emptive coronary revascularization or more aggressive medical therapy) remains&#xD;
      unproven. The 2013 AHA guidelines about stable ischemic heart disease states that either&#xD;
      stress test or anatomic imaging in higher-risk individuals may be appropriate [J Am Coll&#xD;
      Cardiol 14].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies using CCTA have been performed in HIV-infected patients and none of these have&#xD;
      been done in intermediate-high risk populations. Most of theses studies have shown an&#xD;
      increased prevalence of non-calcified plaques in HIV-infected men (59% vs. 34%) compared with&#xD;
      controls non infected with similar CVRF [Lo J AIDS 10, Post W Ann Intern Med 14]. There is&#xD;
      some inconsistent data regarding clinical variables associated with coronary stenosis.&#xD;
      Meanwhile CD4 nadir, use or ART for more than 10 years and detectable viral load were&#xD;
      independently associated with coronary stenosis &gt; 50% in the MACS cohort study [Post W Ann&#xD;
      Intern Med 14], another study among African-Americans with HIV only cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors and cocaine use were associated with coronary stenosis [Lai S Clin Infec Dis 08]&#xD;
      Although the epidemiology and pathogenesis of HIV associated cardiovascular disease are&#xD;
      complex and controversial we know that the risk of cardiovascular events is higher in&#xD;
      untreated than treated HIV infection, probably because inflammation is increased in untreated&#xD;
      infection. Recent data have raised interest in the role of Monocytes/macrophages in&#xD;
      HIV-associated cardiovascular disease. Increased levels of monocytes activation markers such&#xD;
      as sCD14 and sCD163 are associated with increased all-cause mortality and HIV progression, as&#xD;
      well as more rapid progression of carotid atherosclerosis, aortic inflammation and&#xD;
      non-calcified coronary plaque [Kelesidis JID 12, Subramanian S, JAMA 12, Burdo JID 11]. There&#xD;
      is some evidence that monocyte profile in untreated HIV infection mirrors those with acute&#xD;
      coronary syndrome [Funderberg N Blood 12] and circulating monocytes CD16+ were associated&#xD;
      with coronary artery calcium progression in the SUN cohort [Baker AIDS 14]. Data from the&#xD;
      MACS cohort showed that elevated levels of monocyte activation markers (sCD163, sCD14 and&#xD;
      CCL2) in HIV-infected men were associated with CAC and coronary artery stenosis [Mc Kibben RA&#xD;
      J Infec Dis 15]. None of these studies have been performed in cardiovascular high-risk&#xD;
      virologically suppressed patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV infection causes dramatic damage to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract that includes&#xD;
      substantial disruption of gut microbiota composition with presence of microbes at higher&#xD;
      pathogenic potential compared to less agressive indigenous organisms, and massive loss of&#xD;
      gut-residing CD4+ T-cells (Brenchley NAT MED 2006, Gori J Clin Microbiol 2007, Douek Annu Rev&#xD;
      Med 2009). Thus, a substantial breach of the anatomo-functional GI barrier occurs, with&#xD;
      progressive failure of mucosal immunity and leakage into the systemic circulation of&#xD;
      bacterial by-products, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and bacterial DNA fragments which&#xD;
      contribute to immune activation even in patients with good virologic control (Brenchley&#xD;
      Nature Med 2006, Jiang JID 2009, Ferri JID 2010, Estes PLoS Pathog 2010). Microbial&#xD;
      translocation is defined as the transfer of gut derived microbes and/or microbial products to&#xD;
      systemic circulation without overt bacteremia. Different markers may be used in order to&#xD;
      evaluate this phenomenon: 16S DNA, LPS or its soluble receptor LBP (LPS Binding Protein),&#xD;
      sCD14 and I-FAB. These markers are not redundant because they describe different aspects of&#xD;
      microbial translocation. For instance 16S DNA measures global presence of microbes in plasma,&#xD;
      while LPS increase is mainly driven by gram negative bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persistent immune activation has been implicated in risk of cardiovascular disease in HIV&#xD;
      infection and should receive as much attention as traditional CVD risk factors and ART&#xD;
      (Currier AIDS 2005, Friis-Moller NEJM 2003, Subramanian JAMA 2012, Shaked Arterioscler Thromb&#xD;
      Vasc Biol 2014, Kelesidis JID 2012). There are some reports associating LPS with subsequent&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease in HIV-infected patients (Pedersen 2013 Kelesidis JID 2012). Increased&#xD;
      levels of CD14s that persist in some treated HIV have been associated to an increased&#xD;
      all-cause mortality and HIV progression, as well as more rapid progression of carotid&#xD;
      atherosclerosis (Kelesidis T at al CROI 2012 Seattle). sCD163, a marker of monocyte and&#xD;
      macrophage activation, has been significantly correlated with aortic inflammation&#xD;
      (Subramanian S, JAMA 2012). Associations of one or more markers of microbial translocation&#xD;
      with characteristics of coronary injuries (stenosis, volume, mass and type of coronary&#xD;
      plaques) have not yet been studied.&#xD;
