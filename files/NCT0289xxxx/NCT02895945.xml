    <time_frame>Day 1 up to discharge or Day 14 (whichever was earlier)</time_frame>
    <description>GHEA score consisted of 3 individual rating scales: (1) Intra-operative Efficacy Assessment Scale, (2) Post-operative Efficacy Assessment Scale, and (3) Overall Peri-operative Efficacy Assessment Scale.

Each rating scale was based on 4 points scale ranging from: 3 (Excellent), 2 (Good), 1 (Fair), and 0 (None). Total score ranged from 0 to 9, where scores evaluated as: excellent (7 to 9), good (5 to 7), fair (3 to 4), and none (0 to 2). The scores of 3 individual ratings scales were added together to form a GHEA score. For a GHEA score of 7 to be rated &quot;excellent&quot; with no individual assessment scores less than (&lt;) 2 and at least 1 assessment score equal to (=) 3; otherwise a score of 7 was rated &quot;good&quot;.

        <title>Percentage of Surgeries With a &quot;Good&quot; or &quot;Excellent&quot; Response as Measured by the Global Hemostatic Efficacy Assessment (GHEA) Score</title>
        <description>GHEA score consisted of 3 individual rating scales: (1) Intra-operative Efficacy Assessment Scale, (2) Post-operative Efficacy Assessment Scale, and (3) Overall Peri-operative Efficacy Assessment Scale. Scales 1 and 2 was performed by the operating surgeon on Day 1, and Scale 3 was performed by the investigator on Day 14. Each rating scale was based on 4 points scale ranging from: 3 (Excellent), 2 (Good), 1 (Fair), and 0 (None). Total score ranged from 0 to 9, where scores evaluated as: excellent (7 to 9), good (5 to 7), fair (3 to 4), and none (0 to 2). The scores of 3 individual ratings scales were added together to form a GHEA score. For a GHEA score of 7 to be rated &quot;excellent&quot; with no individual assessment scores less than (&lt;) 2 and at least 1 assessment score equal to (=) 3; otherwise a score of 7 was rated &quot;good&quot;. Percentage of Surgeries With a &quot;Good&quot; or &quot;Excellent&quot; response as measured by the GHEA score were reported.</description>

        <description>Prior to the surgery, the surgeon/investigator predicted and compared the estimated volume (in milliliter [mL]) of the expected average blood loss and expected maximum blood loss for the planned surgical intervention in a comparable healthy individual with similar demographic characteristics; for intraoperative, postoperative, and overall perioperative time periods. Intra-operative defined as period from start of surgery to completion of surgical procedure. Post-operative defined as period from completion of surgical procedure till 24 hours post-surgery. Peri-operative defined as period from start of surgical procedure till discharge or 14 days post surgery (whichever was earlier). Actual blood loss, estimated volume of expected average blood loss and expected maximum blood loss during each operative period was reported.</description>

Ratio of actual blood loss and estimated volume of expected average blood loss during each operative period was reported.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Major Surgeries With Good or Excellent Hemostatic Score</title>
        <description>Percentage of major surgeries with good or excellent hemostatic score was analyzed by GHEA score. It consisted of 3 individual ratings: (1) Intra-operative Efficacy Assessment Scale, (2) Post-operative Efficacy Assessment Scale, (3) Postoperative Efficacy Assessment Scale. Ratings 1 and 2 was performed by the operating surgeon on Day 1, and Rating 3 was performed by the investigator on Day 14. Each rating scale was based on 4 point scale ranging from: 3 (Excellent), 2 (Good), 1 (Fair), and 0 (None). The scores of each of the 3 individual ratings scales, was added together to form a GHEA score. Total score ranged from 0 to 9 where scores evaluated as excellent (7 to 9), good (5 to 7), fair (3 to 4), and none (0 to 2). Hemostatic efficacy success was defined as &quot;excellent&quot; or &quot;good &quot;outcome for &gt;=70% of hemostatic efficacy assessments. Percentage of major surgeries with good or excellent hemostatic score were reported.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. Serious AE was any untoward medical occurrence (whether considered to be related to study assigned treatment or not) that at any dose resulted in death, was life-threatening, required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, resulted in a congenital abnormality/birth defect, or was an important medical event. TEAEs was defined as any adverse events (classified by preferred term) that had a start date on or after the first dose of study treatment or that had a start date before the date of first dose of study treatment, but increased in severity after the first dose of study treatment. TEAEs included both serious and non-serious TEAEs.</description>
