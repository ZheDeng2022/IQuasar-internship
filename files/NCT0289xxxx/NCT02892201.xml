  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study for patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who&#xD;
      have residual disease following definitive therapy with radiation (with or without systemic&#xD;
      therapy). Patients must be diagnosed with residual disease within 24 weeks of completion of&#xD;
      radiation therapy. Residual disease must be biopsy proven before the patient can consent to&#xD;
      the trial, and can be either from lymph nodes in the neck, or from the primary tumor site.&#xD;
      Prior to beginning study therapy patients are evaluated by an ENT to determine if they have&#xD;
      disease amenable to surgical resection. Both resectable and unresectable patients will be&#xD;
      eligible for participation in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The primary objective is to determine the overall response to pembrolizumab for patients with&#xD;
      residual disease following radiation with or without systemic therapy for squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma of the head and neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The use of pembrolizumab in patients with residual disease following radiation&#xD;
      with or without systemic therapy will lead to an enhanced overall response rate due to&#xD;
      treatment-related priming of the immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When initially registered, the study used a follow up assessment of 12 weeks. However, the&#xD;
      actual study aims for the primary and secondary outcomes were updated to 168 weeks. The&#xD;
      primary completion date was also updated to reflect the primary outcome timeline.&#xD;

             following primary radiation with or without systemic therapy confirmed by a CT scan&#xD;
             within 4 weeks of study treatment. If a biopsy confirming residual disease has not&#xD;
             been performed, this can be performed after obtaining consent during the screening&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;

             therapy is ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
