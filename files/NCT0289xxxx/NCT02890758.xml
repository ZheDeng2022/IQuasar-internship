  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find the number of natural killer (NK) cells from non-HLA&#xD;
      matched donors that can be safely infused into patients with cancer. NK cells are a form of&#xD;
      lymphocytes that defend against cancer cells. NK cells in cancer patients do not work well to&#xD;
      fight cancer. In this study, the NK cells are being donated by healthy individuals without&#xD;
      cancer who are not &quot;matched&quot; by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes to patients. After&#xD;
      receiving these NK cells, patients may also be given a drug called ALT803. ALT803 is a&#xD;
      protein that keeps NK cells alive, helps them grow in number and supports their&#xD;
      cancer-fighting characteristics. HLA-unmatched NK cell infusion is investigational&#xD;
      (experimental) because the process has not approved by the Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA).&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ex vivo expanded non-HLA matched donor NK&#xD;
      cells in combination with ALT-803&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe safety profile / toxicity of combining ALT-803 with NK cell adoptive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine antitumor activity of allogeneic NK cells with ALT-803 support.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if a lymphocyte depleting regimen is adequate for preventing early elimination&#xD;
           of HLA-mismatched donor NK cells by host T-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase I study with &quot;3+3&quot; design with three planned dose levels of NK cells and a&#xD;
      fixed dose of ALT-803. Three patients will be enrolled sequentially to each dose level,&#xD;
      starting with dose level 1. Patients will be segregated to either receive ALT803 as cytokine&#xD;
      support after NK cell infusion (starting with same dose level as Level 1) or no cytokine&#xD;
      administration. Patients in the arm receiving ALT803 will be either hematologic malignancy&#xD;
      patients (Cohort A) or Colon/Soft tissue sarcoma patients (Cohort B). Absence of dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicity (DLT) in the DLT assessment period of 28 days must be documented for all&#xD;
      patients enrolled a cell dose without ALT803 before the next cohort of patients to receive&#xD;
      cytokines at that dose level can be enrolled. Patients can also be enrolled in parallel to&#xD;
      the next cell dose level without cytokines.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with chemotherapeutic agents. In&#xD;
             addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;

             for Grade 1 only of skin, not requiring treatment).&#xD;
