      The purpose of this research study is to look at the efficacy (the effect on tumor) and the&#xD;
      safety (the effect on body) of the study drugs when given as a combination in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic recurrent epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative inflammatory breast&#xD;
      cancer. This is a phase II study of 2 drugs used in combination: nivolumab and ipilimumab.&#xD;
      The combination of these drugs is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#xD;
      to treat advanced melanoma (a type of skin cancer). Nivolumab and ipilimumab are not approved&#xD;
      by the FDA for patients with metastatic recurrent HER2 negative inflammatory breast cancer,&#xD;
      hence the treatment is considered experimental or investigational.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine progression free survival (PFS) in patients with newly recurrent HER2&#xD;
      negative inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab according to&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the overall response rate (ORR) and clinical benefit rate (CBR) according to&#xD;
      RECIST criteria v1.1, in patients with recurrent IBC treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess overall survival in patients with recurrent HER2 negative IBC treated with&#xD;
      nivolumab and ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the safety and tolerability of nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients with&#xD;
      recurrent IBC according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for&#xD;
      Adverse Events v 4.03.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the predictive value of baseline iSCORE and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1&#xD;
      (PDL-1) expression using archival tissue samples as well as any standard of care tissue&#xD;
      obtained during study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the predictive value of circulating cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) and immune&#xD;
      signature by exosome analysis using blood samples at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes every 2 weeks (Q2W) and&#xD;
      ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes every 6 weeks (Q6W) in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 weeks for 12 weeks, and&#xD;
      then every 3 months for up to 2 years.&#xD;

ORR will be the number of patients with complete response plus the number of patients with partial response. Patients will have imaging scans every 12 weeks assessed up to 2 years.&#xD;
In general:&#xD;
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target and non target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10mm.&#xD;
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

Only those patients who have measurable disease present at baseline, have received at least one dose of therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for response.</population>
