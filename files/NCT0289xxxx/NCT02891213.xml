  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is the most common systemic autoimmune disease. The&#xD;
      clinical manifestations are severe and affect multiple target organs such as the kidney,&#xD;
      central nervous system, skin, heart and joints. Despite the progress made in the therapeutic&#xD;
      approach with new immunosuppressive regimens, morbi-mortality is still high. Therefore, it's&#xD;
      important to identify new biomarkers to help clinicians to predict severity and evolution of&#xD;
      the disease for better adaptation of treatments and try to improve the prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts) :&#xD;
&#xD;
      RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts) is an ubiquitous membrane receptor,&#xD;
      involved in development of many diseases such as diabetes, chronic renal failure but also in&#xD;
      vascular remodelling, inflammatory, infectious deseases and cancer. RAGE regulates a number&#xD;
      of crucial cell processes like inflammation, and tissue and cellular homeostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RAGE is able to bind not only the advanced glycation end products (AGEs) such as pentosidine,&#xD;
      carboxymethyllysine (CML), methyl-glyoxal-hydroimidazolone-1 (MG- H1), but also other ligands&#xD;
      such as HMGB1 (high mobility group box1), and S100A8/A9 proteins which have been correlated&#xD;
      in recent studies to the activity index of SLE. The activation of RAGE leads to a cascade of&#xD;
      intracellular signaling and activation of the transcription factor NF-ΚB . NF-ΚB enable the&#xD;
      traduction of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1α ,IFN-γ. In SLE, these cytokines&#xD;
      involved in perpetuation of inflammation and tissue damages including lupus nephritis.&#xD;
      Moreover, the activation of RAGE induces the expression of adhesion molecule such as sICAM -1&#xD;
      and sVCAM -1 wich were recently involved in SLE vasculitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soluble forms of RAGE, sRAGE and esRAGE :&#xD;
&#xD;
      RAGE is a proinflammatory membrane receptor. But RAGE also exists in soluble plasma forms,&#xD;
      esRAGE (secreted form) and sRAGE (a truncated form as cleaved by MMP9 and ADAM10 enzymes).&#xD;
      esRAGE and sRAGE have the same ligand-binding specificity as RAGE and may function as a&#xD;
      'decoy receptor' by binding pro-inflammatory ligands and preventing them from accessing cell&#xD;
      surface RAGE (Kierdorf and Fritz, 2013). Therefore, both soluble forms have an&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory action. Several studies have shown a decrease in circulating levels of&#xD;
      sRAGE in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, or Sjögren Syndrome compared with healthy&#xD;
      controls. However, the role of RAGE in SLE remains unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RAGE and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, recent advances :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our team (Laboratory of Nephrology, CNRS UMR 7369, URCA) showed in a study in lupus RAGE&#xD;
      knockout mice (B6/ MRL-FAS lpr/J RAGE-/-) a strong involvement of RAGE in systemic&#xD;
      manifestations SLE. Recently, another report showed that sRAGE has an anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      effect on the lupus nephritis and could be a potent therapy in mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In humans, two studies show a correlation between the plasma level of sRAGE and lupus&#xD;
      phenotype ( Nienhuis et al. , 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working hypothesis :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the results and those of the current studies, the investigators think that RAGE axis&#xD;
      and its soluble forms play a crucial role in the complex pathogenesis of SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that plasma levels sRAGE and esRAGE are a reflection of the&#xD;
      activity and the development of SLE in humans. Soluble forms of RAGE and ligands may be novel&#xD;
      biomarkers of SLE and sRAGE a potent therapeutic target.&#xD;

      Expected results :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect a correlation between serum sRAGE, esRAGE and activity of SLE and&#xD;
      the presence of visceral involvement. Furthermore this study will allow us to analyze for the&#xD;
      first time in a lupus population, the correlation between soluble forms of RAGE (esRAGE,&#xD;
      sRAGE) and cytokines and molecules involved in lupus visceral involvement as IL-6, IL-1α,&#xD;
      IFN-γ, sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completion of our project, will allow better understanding of the role of RAGE and RAGE&#xD;
      ligand in SLE activity and will provide rationale for prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Future perspectives will include assessment of the risk-benefit for the use of anti-RAGE&#xD;
      strategies or recombinant sRAGE/esRAGE molecules as adjuvant treatment for SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design : the investigators designed an retrospective, analytic, transversal,&#xD;
      mulitcentric study. the investigators would like to use the serum and the clinical&#xD;
      information collected in &quot;Lupus BioBanque du Rhin Supérieur&quot; (LBBR UF 9882) to measure&#xD;
      soluble forms of RAGE, RAGE-ligands, cytokines, and sICAM and sVCAM. The investigators would&#xD;
      like to include 150 patients in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: The main objective of this study is to investigate the association between Systemic&#xD;
      Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) activity as measured by the SLEDAI score and serum concentrations&#xD;
      of sRAGE and esRAGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 : The study of the correlation between the activity of other activity markers of SLE&#xD;
      and soluble forms of RAGE :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the concentration of RAGE ligands (AGEs like CML, pentosidine and MG-H1) and soluble&#xD;
           forms of RAGE (esRAGE, sRAGE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the cytokine profile (IL-6, IL-1α, IFN-γ) and soluble forms of RAGE (esRAGE, sRAGE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The concentrations of sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 and soluble forms of RAGE (esRAGE, sRAGE)&#xD;
