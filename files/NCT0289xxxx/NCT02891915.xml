  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, superiority clinical&#xD;
      trial will test the effectiveness of short (5-day) vs.standard (10-day) course therapy in&#xD;
      children who are diagnosed with CAP and initially treated in outpatient clinics, urgent care&#xD;
      facilities, and emergency departments. Primary objective is to compare the composite overall&#xD;
      outcome (Desirability of Outcome Ranking, DOOR) among children 6-71 months of age with CAP&#xD;
      assigned to a strategy of short course (5 days) vs standard course (10 days) outpatient&#xD;
      beta-lactam therapy at Outcome Assessment Visit #1 (Study Day 8 +/- 2 days)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, superiority clinical&#xD;
      trial evaluating short course (5 day) vs. standard course (10 day) of oral beta-lactam&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy (amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefdinir) for treatment of CAP in&#xD;
      children 6-71 months of age who have clinically improved prior to enrollment. The study will&#xD;
      randomize approximately 400 enrolled subjects to one of the two study arms (approximately 200&#xD;
      children in each arm) in order to reach 360 subjects completing Outcome Assessment Visit 1.&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to receive either a standard course of the initially&#xD;
      prescribed antibiotic (10 days) or a short course of the initially prescribed antibiotic (5&#xD;
      days) plus 5 days of matching placebo. The study will recruit potential subjects from&#xD;
      children who are diagnosed with CAP and who are initiated on oral beta-lactam therapy by&#xD;
      healthcare providers in EDs, outpatient clinics, and urgent care centers at the study sites.&#xD;
      Day -5 is defined as the date on which oral beta-lactam therapy is initiated for a diagnosis&#xD;
      of CAP. Potential subjects will be identified at any time following clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
      pneumonia. These subjects will be assessed for eligibility and enrolled on Day -3 to -1 of&#xD;
      their initially prescribed oral beta-lactam therapy. Subjects may also be enrolled on Day 1&#xD;
      (the first day of receipt of study agent) provided they have not yet received any doses of&#xD;
      the healthcare provider-prescribed antibiotic therapy for that day. The Primary objective is&#xD;
      to compare the composite overall outcome (Desirability of Outcome Ranking, DOOR) among&#xD;
      children 6-71 months of age with CAP assigned to a strategy of short course (5 days) vs&#xD;
      standard course (10 days) outpatient beta-lactam therapy at Outcome Assessment Visit #1&#xD;
      (Study Day 8 +/- 2 days). The Secondary objectives are: 1) To compare the composite overall&#xD;
      outcome (DOOR) among children 6-71 months of age with CAP assigned to a strategy of short&#xD;
      course (5 days) vs standard course (10 days) outpatient beta-lactam therapy at Outcome&#xD;
      Assessment Visit #2 (Study Day 22 +/- 3 days); 2) To compare the resolution of symptoms (a&#xD;
      component of DOOR) among children 6-71 months of age with CAP assigned to a strategy of short&#xD;
      course (5 days) vs standard course (10 days) outpatient beta-lactam therapy at Outcome&#xD;
      Assessment Visits #1 and #2; 3) To compare the clinical response (a component of DOOR) among&#xD;
      children 6-71 months of age with CAP assigned to a strategy of short course (5 days) vs&#xD;
      standard course (10 days) outpatient beta-lactam therapy at Outcome Assessment Visits #1 and&#xD;
      #2; 4) To compare solicited events (a component of DOOR) among children 6-71 months of age&#xD;
      with CAP assigned to a strategy of short course (5 days) vs standard course (10 days)&#xD;
      outpatient beta-lactam therapy at Outcome Assessment Visits #1 and #2; 5) To compare&#xD;
      medically attended visits to Emergency Departments (ED) or outpatient clinics,&#xD;
      hospitalizations, surgical procedures, and receipt of non-study systemic antibiotics&#xD;
      (components of the clinical response) among children 6-71 months of age with CAP assigned to&#xD;
      a strategy of short course (5 days) vs standard course (10 days) outpatient beta-lactam&#xD;
      therapy at Outcome Assessment Visits #1 and #2&#xD;
