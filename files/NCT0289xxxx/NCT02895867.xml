  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized prospective clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes to evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of dairy products with full or low fat on glycemic control and cardio-metabolic&#xD;
      risk factors in comparison to a regular diet.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled clinical study in which 108 subjects with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      will be randomized into 3 different groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full fat dairy group (Group A): will receive nutritional counseling aiming to maintain body&#xD;
      weight from a registered dietician and will be instructed to include at least ≥3 servings of&#xD;
      full fat dairy products into their diet&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low fat dairy group (Group B): will receive nutritional counseling aiming to maintain body&#xD;
      weight from a registered dietician and will be instructed to include at least ≥3 servings of&#xD;
      low fat dairy products into their diet&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group (Group C): will receive nutritional counseling aiming to maintain body weight&#xD;
      from a registered dietician and will not be asked to include a specified amount or type of&#xD;
      dairy products&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in Groups A and B will be educated about different dairy products' serving sizes and&#xD;
      fat content. Subjects in all 3 groups will be asked to record their daily intake of dairy&#xD;
      products in a dedicated log book. Subjects randomized to groups A and B will be asked to only&#xD;
      use only dairy products with either the full fat or and low (≤1%) fat dairy (≤1% fat content)&#xD;
      content respectively. Purchase of the dairy products will be the responsibility of study&#xD;
      subjects for which a subsidy of $500 (about $20/week for 24 weeks) will be provided for each&#xD;
      subject. All study participants will also be asked to record their food intake for 3 days&#xD;
      before each study visit in a 3-day food log.&#xD;
