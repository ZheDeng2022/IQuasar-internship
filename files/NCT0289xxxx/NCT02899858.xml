  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord neural circuitry exists in the lumbar enlargement that makes it possible to stand&#xD;
      and create synergistic, rhythmic stepping activity in the lower limbs. In the past 20 years,&#xD;
      clinicians have tried to reengage such these circuits for standing and walking in the lower&#xD;
      spinal cord of paralyzed humans through novel paradigms of physical therapy, pharmacological&#xD;
      stimulation of the spinal cord, or recently - epidural stimulation of the spinal cord.&#xD;
      Although standing and stepping with these maneuvers are rudimentary at best, these human&#xD;
      studies offer promise to restore controlled, lower extremity movement to the spinal cord&#xD;
      injured (SCI) individual. Evidence from animal data suggests that more focal activation of&#xD;
      intraspinal circuitry (IntraSpinal Micro-Stimulation - ISMS) would produce more fatigue&#xD;
      resistant, natural standing and stepping activity in humans. To date, there has been no&#xD;
      direct confirmation of such circuitry in the spinal cord of bipedal humans who have been&#xD;
      paralyzed. Furthermore, mapping of such circuitry would provide the basis of a novel&#xD;
      intraspinal neuroprosthetic that should be able to restore control of standing or walking in&#xD;
      a manner that is much more physiologically normal and tolerable than by stimulating each&#xD;
      individual muscle group. Proof of the existence of these spinal circuits in man, and the&#xD;
      ability to activate and control these circuits by first mapping the spinal cord is the basis&#xD;
      of this proposal.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two study volunteers who are completely paralyzed (T2-8 region) to undergo an evaluation of&#xD;
      ISMS during an otherwise normal thoracic spinal surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential volunteers will be asked to review and sign a screening consent form prior to&#xD;
      initial screening. This is to ensure that the ideal two patients are selected for this study&#xD;
      and that foreseeable issues are identified and risks minimized for the volunteers. The&#xD;
      subjects must have a stable, complete spinal cord injury involving their upper thoracic&#xD;
      spinal cord (T2-8 region), and are otherwise planning to undergo a spine surgery involving&#xD;
      the lower thoracic spinal cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who have volunteered for this study will undergo their intended spinal surgery by&#xD;
      the clinical team. The usual indications for undergoing such a surgery is either to correct a&#xD;
      deformity involving the lower thoracic region, or stabilizing the lower thoracic region due&#xD;
      to chronic instability from degenerative disease. The surgery intended for clinical treatment&#xD;
      must involve exposure of the T9-T12 spinal lamina. However, exposure of the spinal cord&#xD;
      through a dural opening would not normally be performed in this clinical scenario. The&#xD;
      experimental portion of the surgery begins then, with a laminectomy of T9-T12 and exposure of&#xD;
      the spinal cord through a durotomy using standard neurosurgical techniques for spinal cord&#xD;
      exposure. The spinal cord in this region will then be mapped and stimulated using ISMS and&#xD;
      the effects on the legs measured to determine if the circuitry exists to potentially allow&#xD;
      standing or walking through the use of ISMS. The research requests subjects to specifically&#xD;
      allow 2 hours of extra time during the routine spinal surgery to perform this study.&#xD;
