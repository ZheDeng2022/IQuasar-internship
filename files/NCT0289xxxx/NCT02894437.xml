  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Protocol is the prevention of pelvic pressure ulcers within a care network&#xD;
      of SCI patients whose general organization refers to the medical literature and the&#xD;
      recommendations of the ministerial circular of 18 June 2004. A conceptual framework for work&#xD;
      (CFW) will be set up and semi-structured interviews will be conducted with patients and&#xD;
      professionals. They will confirm or dismiss the CFW gradually with a refined coding As of&#xD;
      domains and sub-domains of the skin preventing spinal cord injury related to the perceptions&#xD;
      and behaviors of those involved in the sector. Quality control will be provided by experts in&#xD;
      qualitative research and interviews will be stopped when the analyzes will further refine the&#xD;
      domains and subdomains. A final framework will be validated to modulate our organization.&#xD;
