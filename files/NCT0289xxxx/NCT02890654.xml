  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Around the scoliosis surgery, the pain (pre or post operative, physical, psychological,&#xD;
      fantasy or real) is a major concern for adolescents and their families. She is also a key&#xD;
      concern of caregivers, both its assessment and management is complex. this pain involved&#xD;
      predominantly in the quality of life of these teenagers today who will become the adults of&#xD;
      tomorrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date in France, no study aims to describe and evaluate the effect of a multidisciplinary&#xD;
      approach and its impact on the quality of life of these young people made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study wish to prevent, anticipate and limit the short, medium and long-term&#xD;
      morbidity. Focus will be on pain and its management, on preparing for surgery,&#xD;
      hospitalization, follow-up after surgery, rehabilitation until recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Help teens reclaim their bodies after the changes caused by the intervention is a major&#xD;
      issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study believe that support good quality, adapted to patient needs will limit operating&#xD;
      and postoperative pain in the medium and long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical team developed special attention around the teenagers that are operated for scoliosis&#xD;
      (teen groups and parent groups, interview before the operation and counseling, physiotherapy&#xD;
      support ...).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study would systematize data collections in order to have a comprehensive and&#xD;
      accurate assessment of the care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative research will focus on the multidisciplinary care in an effort to evaluate&#xD;
      the whole course of these teenagers, their experience and to identify efforts to put in place&#xD;
      to optimize the current care.&#xD;
