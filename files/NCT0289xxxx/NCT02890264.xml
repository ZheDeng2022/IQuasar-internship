      The main purpose for holding this survey is epidemiological surveillance, it must provide the&#xD;
      indicators that contribute to the evaluation of the plan &quot;improvement of the quality of life&#xD;
      in chronic diseases&quot; and monitoring the goal of 81 health law public in August 2004. This&#xD;
      survey is intended to be renewed during the implementation period of the public health law to&#xD;
      provide plan monitoring indicators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is : To describe the quality of life of patients with major end-stage&#xD;
      renal disease treated with dialysis method for at least one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The seconds objectives are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To contribute to the knowledge of the key determinants of the quality of life among&#xD;
           chronic renal failure patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the influence on way of giving a questionnaire about assessment of level of&#xD;
           quality of life&#xD;

      The proposed scheme is that of a repeated cross-sectional survey, with prevalent patients&#xD;
      dialysis for at least 1 year, by self-administered questionnaires using standardized&#xD;
      instruments and passed among a representative sample of subjects included in the nine&#xD;
      participating regions kidney system. The first study in 2005, it is required to be repeated&#xD;
      during the plan period (theoretically in 2007, 2009 and 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three studies will be carried out between 2005 and 2010. The progress of each study is the&#xD;
      same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The random draw of eligible patients, according to a stratification by region and age group&#xD;
      is carried out by the Biostatistics and Medical Informatics Service of the Necker Hospital in&#xD;
      Paris, responsible for basic SIMS-REIN, for data center in the regions Champagne-Ardenne,&#xD;
      Languedoc-Roussillon, Limousin and Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur. For Auvergne, Bretagne,&#xD;
      Lorraine and Rhône-Alpes, which operate independently for the collection of data REIN, the&#xD;
      random draw of patients is done by each epidemiological center responsible for this&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Biostatistics and Medical Informatics Service of the Necker Hospital, and epidemiological&#xD;
      centers of Auvergne, Bretagne, Lorraine and Rhône Alpes must submit the list of selected&#xD;
      patients Clinical Research Associate (CRA) national.&#xD;

        The source population is all patients included in the REIN system at the time of the survey&#xD;
        in the nine participating regions currently in the system: Auvergne, Bretagne, Centre,&#xD;
        Champagne Ardennes, Languedoc Roussillon, Limousin, Lorraine, Provence Alpes Côte d 'Azur,&#xD;
        Rhône Alpes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patients selected to participate in the study were selected by random draw on all of&#xD;
        the base, from those whose annual spot date falls during the investigation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The random draw is stratified by region and age group with a sampling fraction proportional&#xD;
        to the size of the original population.&#xD;
