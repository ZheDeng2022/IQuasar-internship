  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ipilimumab when given together&#xD;
      with decitabine in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia&#xD;
      that has returned after a period of improvement (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment&#xD;
      (refractory). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab, may help the&#xD;
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to&#xD;
      grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as decitabine, work in different ways to&#xD;
      stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,&#xD;
      or by stopping them from spreading. Giving ipilimumab and decitabine may work better in&#xD;
      treating patients with relapsed or refractory myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      combination decitabine and ipilimumab for relapsed or refractory myelodysplastic syndrome&#xD;
      (MDS) or relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients who are post&#xD;
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the MTD or RP2D of combination decitabine and ipilimumab for relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory MDS or relapsed or refractory AML in patients who are transplant naive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To determine the overall response rate&#xD;
      (ORR) including complete remission (CR) and complete remission with incomplete count recovery&#xD;
      (CRi) for AML following 2003 International Working Group (IWG) response criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the ORR including CR, partial remission, marrow CR, hematologic improvement&#xD;
      for MDS using 2006 IWG criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the overall survival and progression free survival at 1 year. V. To&#xD;
      determine the duration of remission. VI. To capture the incidence and severity of acute&#xD;
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in the post allo-HCT cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To capture the incidence and severity of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in the&#xD;
      post allo-HCT cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To measure the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) prior to treatment and during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the genome for evidence of clonal evolution among longitudinal samples (prior&#xD;
      to treatment, during treatment, and at relapse if relevant) from individual patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the histopathologic findings of immune response using immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the immune response in the AML tumor microenvironment by using flow&#xD;
      cytometry and single cell mass cytometry to evaluate T cell subsets.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  expansion cohorts&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior hypomethylating agent (HMA) therapy is allowed, however this study excludes&#xD;
             patients with progression or relapse that occur while receiving HMA-based therapy&#xD;
             within 12 weeks prior to treatment start on study; disease progression is defined as&#xD;
             either: (1) patients with prior MDS who progress to AML (defined by the presence of &gt;=&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Donor lymphocyte infusion within 8 weeks prior to treatment start if post-transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients that are post-transplant, ineligible patients include those with a&#xD;

             investigator, that could adversely affect the safety of the patient or impair the&#xD;
             assessment of study results; as patients with AML and MDS are prone to infections, if&#xD;
             patients are actively being treated with appropriate antibiotics or antifungal therapy&#xD;
             with clinical evidence of infection control, then they will be considered eligible for&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Autoimmune disease: Patients who are not eligible include those with a history of&#xD;
             inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, are&#xD;
             excluded from this study, as are patients with a history of symptomatic disease (e.g.,&#xD;
             rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis [scleroderma], systemic lupus&#xD;
             erythematosus, autoimmune vasculitis [e.g., Wegener's granulomatosis]); CNS or motor&#xD;
             neuropathy considered of autoimmune origin (e.g., Guillain-Barre syndrome and&#xD;
             myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis); patients with a history of autoimmune disease&#xD;
             (specifically including: diabetes mellitus, vitiligo, Hashimoto's thyroiditis) who are&#xD;
             asymptomatic, do not require immune suppression or steroids, and do not have&#xD;
             threatened vital organ function from these conditions may be considered after&#xD;
             discussion with the principal investigator (PI)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No concurrent active malignancies are allowed on study for &gt;= 2 years prior to&#xD;
             treatment start with the exception of currently treated basal cell or squamous cell&#xD;
             carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in-situ of the cervix or breast&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known active hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection should be excluded&#xD;
             because of potential effects on immune function and/or drug interactions; however, if&#xD;
             a patient has HBV history with an undetectable HBV load by polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
             (PCR), no liver-related complications, and is on definitive HBV therapy, then he/she&#xD;
             would be eligible for study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known active hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection; patients with a history&#xD;
             of HCV infection who received definitive therapy and has an undetectable viral load by&#xD;
             PCR would be eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ipilimumab has the potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             ipilimumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
             ipilimumab; these potential risks may also apply to decitabine&#xD;
