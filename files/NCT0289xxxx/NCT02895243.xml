      This pilot study will be a clinical trial to test the feasibility and effectiveness of a&#xD;
      kidney transplant (KT) prehabilitation intervention in adults with end stage renal disease&#xD;
      (ESRD) who are within 3-6 months of transplantation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Prehabilitation is the enhancement of functional capacity of a patient to improve their&#xD;
      ability to withstand a future stressor. The investigators primary objective is to demonstrate&#xD;
      feasibility for prehabilitation in Aim 1 and test whether the number of prehabilitation&#xD;
      sessions is associated with increased physical activity. The investigators will formally test&#xD;
      whether prehabilitation is associated with a reduction in short term and long term KT&#xD;
      outcomes as part of Aim 2. The investigators will test whether there is an effect of&#xD;
      prehabilitation on short-term (KT length of stay&gt; 2 weeks, early hospital readmission and&#xD;
      delayed graft function) and long-term (acute rejection (within the first year), 1 year&#xD;
      patient and graft survival) outcomes compared to standard of care controls. Participants will&#xD;
      be followed for 3-6 months or until they receive a kidney transplant.&#xD;

    <description>The study will use a generic prehabilitation program which will include the following components: Warm-up, cardiovascular training, strength training, flexibility training, and cool down. Prehabilitation will occur once per week and approximately 1 hour in duration. Participants will take part in prehabilitation until they receive a kidney transplant which by study design is approximately for 3-6 months.</description>
