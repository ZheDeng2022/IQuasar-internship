  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Published data indicate that obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) worse the prognosis of&#xD;
      coronary artery disease (CAD) and that oxidative stress can link this 2 diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesise that oxidative stress decrease after 3 months of continuous&#xD;
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) in this specific population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results may have major implication in the comprehension of physiopathologic processes&#xD;
      linking OSAS and CAD and in the treatment of OSAS in this specific population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a common disorder characterized by recurrent upper&#xD;
      airway collapse during sleep and has been associated with worsened prognosis in patients with&#xD;
      coronary artery disease (CAD). Moderate OSAS can be defined by an apnea hypopnea index (AHI)&#xD;
      between 15 and 30 events/hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathophysiologic processes are complex and it seems that oxidative stress play and important&#xD;
      role. Studies showed that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) influence oxidative&#xD;
      stress but the results are conflicting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover there are uncertainties whether diagnosing and treating OSAS can inﬂuence the&#xD;
      pathophysiological and clinical outcomes in patients with CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we aim to test the effects of 3 months of CPAP on systemic redox balance evaluated&#xD;
      by plasma GSH/GSSG ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with moderate OSAS will be randomized for the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with AHI &lt;15/h or &gt;30/h will be included in an ancillary study (blood and urinary&#xD;
      test, MIBG scintigraphy) to characterize the biological profile of coronary patients based on&#xD;
      their AHI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a alpha threshold of 5% and a study power of 80%, the study should include 16 patients in&#xD;
      each group. Taking in account a possible 20% of dropout the study will need to include 20&#xD;
      patients by randomized arm to demonstrate an effect.&#xD;
