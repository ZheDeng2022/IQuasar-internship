  <brief_summary>

      This exploratory study aims to identify the most promising biomarkers that alone or in&#xD;
      combination might predict development of mood disorders [i.e., major depression (MD],&#xD;
      cognitive disorders [i.e., executive function deficits (EFD)], and functional impairment&#xD;
      following repetitive/mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective study of subjects with MTBI, body injury and healthy controls.&#xD;
      Subjects who meet the study criteria will be enrolled in the study after they provide&#xD;
      informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be followed longitudinally at 3 and 6 months post-injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will have 3-4 visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening visit to determine eligibility; first study visit within 1 month of injury for&#xD;
      those with brain or body injury (at the time of screening or within 1 month of screening for&#xD;
      healthy controls); second study visit at 3 months post-injury (3 months after the first visit&#xD;
      for healthy controls) and third study visit at 6 months post-injury (6 months after the first&#xD;
      visit for healthy controls).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals with MTBI: Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have sustained a closed head injury, defined as externally inflicted trauma without&#xD;
             skull fracture;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score 13 or above&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Meet the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine criteria for mild traumatic&#xD;
             brain injury&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have experienced the last injury within 1 month&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Be in excellent/good medical health as assessed by the General Medical Health Rating&#xD;
             (GMHR) scale&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have sufficient cognitive capacity to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Be between 18-65 years of age and&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Be willing to have brain MRI and a blood draw,&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals with Body Injury will meet inclusion criteria 4-8. Instead of criteria for head&#xD;
        injury (1-3) they would have had body injury (defined as injury below the neck (e.g., limb&#xD;
        fractures, stab wound abdomen).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age, and sex, matched normal controls: Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. No history of head injury or any other types of brain injury&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Inclusion criteria 5-8&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of stroke, seizures or other pre-injury neurological diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Mental Retardation&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of skull fracture&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Presence of severe unstable medical disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Contraindications to the MRI brain scan&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Possibility of pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Presence of communication difficulties, such as moderate to severe hearing or language&#xD;
             impairment.&#xD;
