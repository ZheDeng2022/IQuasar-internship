    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to validate the prototype of the WeTakeCare- system in the&#xD;
      real environment (=end users homes) and is embedded in Work-Package 4 (validation and&#xD;
      evaluation) with the following main tasks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      T4.1. Definition of methodologies and protocols T4.2. First validation: concept assessment&#xD;
      T4.3. Second validation: functional assessment T4.4. Third validation: real environment T4.5.&#xD;
      Final check&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the validation phase III of our project the investigators want to validate the&#xD;
      contents of our fitness and information software WeTakeCare with the target group: elderly&#xD;
      and their unprofessional caregivers. It runs on the Microsoft Kinect-System, which is&#xD;
      authorised in Switzerland, and is in accordance with the prescribing information. The&#xD;
      fitness- and information software contains information about strategies and devices which are&#xD;
      available in case an older person is not able to perform the everyday movements in a safe and&#xD;
      easy way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the training and information software is to support elderly to stay independent from&#xD;
      others help as long as possible. The mentioned software is not a medical or therapeutical&#xD;
      treatment or a medical or therapeutical product. Performed exercises or presented information&#xD;
      are highly regarded in the interest of safety and protection of the participants, and serves&#xD;
      to prevent physical restrictions or damage .&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is only minimal risk or burden for the participants; the contents of the intervention&#xD;
      itself (training of basic motor skills, instruction of strategies and the use of assistive&#xD;
      devices to (partly) compensate restrictions in ADL performance, enablement of caregivers) are&#xD;
      a standard in rehabilitation of elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect the start of the third validation in October 2015.&#xD;

      General study design and justification of design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of study: Validation of the prototype of the fitness- and information Software:&#xD;
      WeTakeCare (pilot test) in a pre- post design, no comparators&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preparation of the validation study containing: recruiting, pre-screening, assessing,&#xD;
           instructing (2-4 month)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Validation implies the use of the system during expected 3-6 consecutive months,&#xD;
           starting soonest in October 2015- (expected) April 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population to be studied: Healthy elderly (aged 50+) with mild to moderate restrictions in&#xD;
      the performance of ADL and their caregivers Number of participants: Involvement of a total of&#xD;
      20 couples in Switzerland. Incorporating 2-5 couples in the first month to allow detection&#xD;
      and resolution of any problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study phases&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. &quot;pre testing&quot; of participants eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. medical check&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. first assessment (first part of baseline measurements)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. technical installation of the system Installation of the system at the end-users homes&#xD;
           will be realized by staff members (See team member list) from the ZHAW.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. introduction of participants in the practical use of the system (second part of baseline&#xD;
           measurements) To guarantee reality of the pilot it will be conducted without altering&#xD;
           the environment except if there's environmental elements/factors posing risks to the&#xD;
           end-users when performing the exercises/ using the program. The presence of potential&#xD;
           risk factors will be controlled by occupational therapists, accompanying the&#xD;
           installation of the system. If there's is any risk factor identified (i.e. reduced&#xD;
           available space in front of the television screen), OT's (Occupational therapists) will&#xD;
           ensure the removal. If a removal is not possible, alternate possibilities will be&#xD;
           verified and in case of non-availability this will lead to study exclusion. After&#xD;
           installation of the program participants will receive an initial training on functioning&#xD;
           by occupational therapists Weekly follow-up controls will also be conducted by OT's&#xD;
           (Occupational therapists) (short questionnaire and assessment of improvement of ADL&#xD;
           capabilities). These OT's (Occupational therapists) will have received training in the&#xD;
           WTC (WeTakeCare-system) use before.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Validation phase with a permanent digital log and weekly measurement of…..&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. final assessment (outcome measurements) Methods of minimising bias A description of the&#xD;
           measures taken to minimize/avoid bias, including: Randomization, Blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the pretesting phase possible participants are screened to validate the cognitive&#xD;
      status as well as the physical condition to include only elderly and caregivers which have a&#xD;
      benefit from participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY INTERVENTION (SPIRIT #11) 8.1 Identity of Investigational Products (treatment / medical&#xD;
      device) (ICH/E6 6.2.1, 6.4.2, 6.4.4; AGEK Checklist 2, item 3) Enrolled participants will get&#xD;
      the technical appliances and support with the installation of the gadgets. (Kinect I&#xD;
      (Microsoft-Kinect) and if necessary an appropriate Laptop) Occupational therapists will give&#xD;
      a comprehensive instruction to the system, which also includes clarification of safety&#xD;
      precautions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants are free to use the system within their everyday life whenever they&#xD;
      want.(Alone or together with their caregivers.)&#xD;
