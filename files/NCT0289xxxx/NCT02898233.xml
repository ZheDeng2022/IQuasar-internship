  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand how low-level light therapy (LLLT) can be&#xD;
      used to augment the antidepressant effects of Deprexis, an internet-based treatment program&#xD;
      for depression, for participants with current major depressive disorder. The researchers will&#xD;
      administer active and placebo LLLT to the right forehead of participants who show an&#xD;
      improvement of at least 10% in depressive symptoms from baseline after two weeks of Deprexis&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Participants who receive active LLLT will show a greater reduction of depressive&#xD;
      symptoms than participants who receive placebo LLLT.&#xD;

      1. Online screening Following a digital informed consent, all participants will complete a&#xD;
           brief online screening questionnaire to determine the severity level of their&#xD;
           depression, using the Center for Epidemiological Studies - Depression Scale (CES-D).&#xD;
           Initial consent and screening procedures will be conducted online via Research&#xD;
           Electronic Data Capture (REDCap), a secure, on-line assessment tool designed to collect&#xD;
           self-report questionnaire data for research studies. Participants with a CES-D score of&#xD;
           16 or higher will be eligible to continue with the study. At this initial screening,&#xD;
           eligible participants will also provide contact information (name, email address, and&#xD;
           phone number) for a follow-up phone screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Phone screening Following the online screening, eligible participants will complete a&#xD;
           phone screening, the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), conducted by&#xD;
           researchers in the Mood Disorders Laboratory. The phone screening will be audio recorded&#xD;
           for quality control purposes. Participants will be eligible to continue on in the study&#xD;
           if they meet criteria for current Major Depression without any comorbid disorders,&#xD;
           excluding anxiety disorders. Next, participants will complete the Colombia-Suicide&#xD;
           Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) to assess for suicidality. Any participant who endorses&#xD;
           suicidal intent, with or without plan, (i.e., items 4 or 5) within the last six months,&#xD;
           will be deemed ineligible. Researchers will provide resources to any participant&#xD;
           endorsing suicidal ideation, and will contact authorities if necessary. At the end of&#xD;
           the phone screening, eligible participants will be scheduled to come into the Mood&#xD;
           Disorders Laboratory for their initial study meeting within a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Initial meeting&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants deemed eligible by the online and phone screenings will come into the Mood&#xD;
           Disorders Laboratory within a week of their phone screening. The initial meeting will&#xD;
           last approximately one hour. The initial meeting will have several objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
           First, participants will provide informed consent. Research personnel will provide&#xD;
           participants with detailed oral and written description of all study procedures in order&#xD;
           to ensure understanding of all components of the study. Participants will provide&#xD;
           informed consent for completing the Deprexis program, pre-treatment questionnaires,&#xD;
           daily questionnaires, weekly questionnaires, and post-treatment questionnaires. All&#xD;
           questionnaires will be accessed online via REDCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Next, participants will complete several pre-treatment questionnaires. Also, researchers&#xD;
           will introduce the Deprexis program, and participants will receive an access code that&#xD;
           will allow them immediate access to the Deprexis site. Information about the Deprexis&#xD;
           program is detailed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will also complete an eye tracking/pupil dilation task during the meeting.&#xD;
           Pupil dilation response to emotional stimuli has been shown to be related to depression.&#xD;
           In this pupil dilation task, participants will passively view emotional and neutral&#xD;
           stimuli (images). More details about the task are below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pre-treatment questionnaires Participants eligible to take part in the Deprexis program&#xD;
           will complete several pre-treatment questionnaires at the initial meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Deprexis All Deprexis treatment will be provided via the Deprexis website:&#xD;
           http://deprexis.com/. Participants will have access to this website for twelve weeks.&#xD;
           They can access this website as often as they would like. The Deprexis program is&#xD;
           self-guided, so participants determine how often they access the material (see below for&#xD;
           a description of the Deprexis treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
           While participants are engaged in the Deprexis treatment program, they will complete the&#xD;
           Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self-Report (QIDS-SR) each week, starting&#xD;
           with the pre-treatment meeting. This will be automated within the REDCap system and will&#xD;
           serve as our primary outcome measure to determine the efficacy of Deprexis in improving&#xD;
           depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Researchers will monitor the progression of the Deprexis treatment and the QIDS-SR&#xD;
           scores for each participant. Participants will be contacted via phone or email as needed&#xD;
           to encourage them to continue participating. Participants whose QIDS-SR scores improve&#xD;
           by at least 10% from baseline in the first two weeks of Deprexis treatment will be&#xD;
           contacted via phone and email to schedule four weekly LLLT sessions in the lab.&#xD;
           Participants whose QIDS-SR scores do not improve by 10% from baseline in the first two&#xD;
           weeks within the first six weeks of treatment will not be eligible for LLLT, but will&#xD;
           continue to have access to the Deprexis program.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will be scheduled for their initial meeting within 1 week of their phone&#xD;
           screening. After the initial meeting, participants will have immediate access to the&#xD;
           Deprexis program. During the 12 weeks that participants have access to the Deprexis&#xD;
           program, participants will complete the QIDS-SR weekly and may come into the&#xD;
           Gonzalez-Lima Lab for LLLT treatment once weekly for four weeks. The maximum amount of&#xD;
           time spent in this study for each participant would therefore be 13 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Daily REDCap questionnaires REDCap will automatically send an email to prompt users to&#xD;
           answer questions at several times each day during the course of their enrollment in this&#xD;
           study. Participants will respond to questions about their mood, stress level, sleep&#xD;
           patterns, social interactions, and recent activity. Several times each week,&#xD;
           participants will also indicate which, if any, of the Deprexis CBT techniques they have&#xD;
           recently used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. LLLT Eligible participants will come into the Gonzalez-Lima Lab in Seay 3.304 at their&#xD;
           scheduled appointment times. Written informed consent to receive active or placebo LLLT&#xD;
           for four sessions will be collected of all lab participants before the first LLLT&#xD;
           session. Each session will last approximately twenty minutes. Participants will receive&#xD;
           either active or placebo LLLT for eight minutes (procedure described below). Each&#xD;
           participant will receive either active LLLT only for all four sessions or sham LLLT only&#xD;
           for all four sessions, but not a combination of active and placebo LLLT. Participants&#xD;
           will return to the lab at one-week intervals for four weeks. Following each session,&#xD;
           participants will be asked if they experienced any perceived side effects (physical or&#xD;
           psychological) from the LLLT treatment. In the unlikely event that a participant&#xD;
           experiences adverse effects, appropriate measures will be taken to eliminate these&#xD;
           effects, and participants will be dismissed from the study if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Post-treatment questionnaires Following completion of the Deprexis treatment,&#xD;
           participants will complete several more questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Location Researchers in the Mood Disorders Laboratory, located in the Liberal Arts&#xD;
           Building at The University of Texas at Austin, will administer and assess the&#xD;
           participation of each subject in the Deprexis program. Participants will complete the&#xD;
           Deprexis treatment online at a location of their choice. Participants who have shown an&#xD;
           improvement in depressive symptoms of at least 10% from baseline in the first two weeks&#xD;
           of Deprexis treatment will be scheduled to come into the lab for LLLT treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LLLT treatment will be administered in the Gonzalez-Lima Lab, located in Seay 3.304 at The&#xD;
      University of Texas at Austin. Participants will come to the lab for four sessions, held&#xD;
      approximately one week apart, each of which will last approximately twenty minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because Deprexis treatment lasts twelve weeks and LLLT lasts four weeks, participants will&#xD;
      continue to complete the Deprexis treatment online in the weeks during and after their LLLT&#xD;
      sessions. Participants who do not show a 10% improvement in depressive symptoms from baseline&#xD;
      in the first two weeks of the Deprexis program will not be eligible to receive LLLT, but will&#xD;
      still have access to the Deprexis treatment for the full twelve weeks.&#xD;
