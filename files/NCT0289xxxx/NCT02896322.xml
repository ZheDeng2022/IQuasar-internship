    <textblock>
      Accelerated partial breast irradiation with CyberKnife (CK-APBI) is a promising innovative&#xD;
      approach for early breast cancer after conservative surgery, for addressing the need of a&#xD;
      radiotherapy target only to the surgical cavity in selected patients, exceeding the limits of&#xD;
      other PBI/APBI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The large majority of local recurrences in breast cancer after breast conserving treatment&#xD;
      are close to the original tumor site. This evidence suggested to restrict the radiotherapy&#xD;
      target to the surgical cavity in selected patients. Consequently, shorter fractionation&#xD;
      strategies focused only on tumor bed with a small cuff of surrounding subclinical disease,&#xD;
      i.e. accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI), were developed. Stereotactic radiotherapy&#xD;
      was thought, consisting of a short course of intense treatment focused on the target tissue.&#xD;
      There is very little experience with CiberKnife for early breast cancer until now.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective non-randomized study designed to assess the acute, sub-acute,&#xD;
      late toxicity, cosmesis and globally the feasibility of CyberKnife (CK-APBI). From June 2013&#xD;
      to June 2018 we are going to enroll 80 patients considered eligible for the present study.&#xD;
      All patients will be followed for at least 2 years. A first enrollment of 20-25 patients is&#xD;
      scheduled as first assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be aided to mammography and ultrasound&#xD;
      examination for confirming the best selection of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the assessment of acute toxicity, cosmetic results by three different observers&#xD;
      (physician, patient, external observer), medium term and late toxicity, patients were&#xD;
      evaluated and the results recorded immediately before and after radiotherapy, then after 1&#xD;
      month, three, six, nine, and twelve, and twenty-four months. The toxicity will be correlated&#xD;
      to the main radiotherapy treatment dosimetry and delivery recorded.&#xD;
