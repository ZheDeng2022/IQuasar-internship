  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The path of a patient depends largely on his health care network, that is to say of the&#xD;
      interrelationships between health professionals who will be involved throughout his career.&#xD;
      At the hospital, the transition points in the care process is a vulnerable time for the&#xD;
      patient regarding the continuity of his medication. These transition points are the intake,&#xD;
      the transfer and the outlet. In town, our health system must be able to build on the&#xD;
      inter-city hospital, warranty essential guarantee of the continuity of care. However, there&#xD;
      is often a breakdown in this relationship with more or less serious consequences ranging from&#xD;
      simple dissatisfaction of the patient, to the realization of duplicate examinations or the&#xD;
      use unjustified emergency and re-hospitalization. Medication errors can occur, resulting from&#xD;
      incomplete information or poorly communicated in this city hospital interface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The city hospital dysfunctions are mainly organizational, hospital being rather specialized&#xD;
      therapeutic approach centered on pathology and medicine city instead focuses on a patient's&#xD;
      overall approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The involvement of the pharmacist in the hospital, as the city is an interesting axis to&#xD;
      develop. In town, the pharmaceutical nomadism, including in major cities remains low,&#xD;
      patients generally have a dedicated pharmacies for the treatment of their serious or chronic&#xD;
      pathologies. The development of the pharmaceutical folder today allows the pharmacies to&#xD;
      access the history and the entire therapy of patients prescribed to town by different&#xD;
      specialists and general practitioners, on the last 4 months. Its recent availability within&#xD;
      our hospital Group allows us to consider its use to fully optimize the patient's drug&#xD;
      monitoring.&#xD;

      Hypothesis The involvement of hospital pharmacists from the admission of the patient in the&#xD;
      oncology department until its release, with a comprehensive review of its treatment and&#xD;
      anticipation of therapeutic needs when returning home and a joint organized with the&#xD;
      community pharmacist and doctor, reduces the rate of drug discontinuity and thus improve its&#xD;
      therapeutic management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to integrate and evaluate clinical pharmacist activities at different&#xD;
      stages of the patient care process transition points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The admission by drug conciliation to determine exhaustively the medication history and&#xD;
           the observed differences, and assess the patient's treatment adherence, to consider a&#xD;
           revision of the treatment if necessary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the stay by daily pharmaceutical validation of drug prescriptions made in DxCare&#xD;
           to play down the drug iatrogenic and participate in the definition of pharmacotherapy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In preparation for the release of the drug per patient reconciliation to inform and&#xD;
           advise the patient about treatment and communicate relevant information to the city of&#xD;
           health professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. / DRUG RECONCILIATION TO ENTRY&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Rational The investigators all remember, share different hospital functions,&#xD;
                     at least one example of Event Junk Medicated (EIM) suffered by a patient, the&#xD;
                     investigators participate in the management and from a medication error. The&#xD;
                     frequency of Adverse Event Graves (SAEs) exclusively related to health&#xD;
                     products is estimated at 1.7 per 1000 SAE avoidable hospital days, or just&#xD;
                     over 1 SAEs per day for a 1,000 bed hospital. This study showed a stronger&#xD;
                     exposure to preventable SAEs among elderly and vulnerable. Indeed, promoting&#xD;
                     factors the occurrence of iatrogenic injuries for this population are&#xD;
                     manifold: multi-pathologies, polypharmacy, organic impairment, cognitive&#xD;
                     impairment, inadequate mode of administration. Some of these therapeutic&#xD;
                     errors are the result of poor communication between the city and the hospital,&#xD;
                     leading to hospitalized patients for whom took home treatments are not&#xD;
                     exhaustively known. It is also estimated that 67% of drug history of patients&#xD;
                     have one or more medication errors and that 46% of these errors occur at the&#xD;
                     time of the drafting of a new order to the entrance or exit of the patient 's&#xD;
                     hospital. The EQUIP study showed that the risk of prescription errors was&#xD;
                     increased by 70% during the intake phase of the patient from the hospital&#xD;
                     phase. On the other hand, it has been reported that 60% of cancer patients use&#xD;
                     complementary and alternative medicine, for which we must be vigilant about&#xD;
                     taking these medications potentially iatrogenic (MAC-AERIO study 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal Detect differences in prescription between the city and the hospital in establishing a&#xD;
      complete and exhaustive list of treatments taken by the patient before hospitalization,&#xD;
      avoiding medication errors, appearance starting point EIG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      procedure The hospitalization of Medical Oncology Service has 20 beds (14 traditional&#xD;
      hospital beds and six weeks of hospital beds) with an average rate of entries per day of 3-4&#xD;
      patients, 1 to 2 per week are new patients. Patients will be seen by a hospital pharmacist&#xD;
      within &lt;24h of admission, or &lt;72 h during late entry on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. / The reconciliation begins with a review of treatments called Bilan Medicated Optimized&#xD;
           (BMO). The list to be drawn regarding medications taken by the patient whether&#xD;
           prescribed or not. To formalize, it is necessary to conduct an interview with the&#xD;
           patient and / or his entourage as well as city health professionals or other care&#xD;
           facilities if any. The first source of information is that we will exploit the patient's&#xD;
           pharmaceutical record (if open), accessible via its vital card and resuming treatment&#xD;
           provided during the last 4 months. If drugs are brought home by the patient, they are&#xD;
           another useful source of information. BMO This will be achieved in 2 ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Proactive Patient entering Sunday to Thursday. The drafting of the first order in&#xD;
                the service has not yet taken place, BMO is then used to prescriber for the&#xD;
                drafting of the Ordinance for Medicinal Products for admission (OMA). Accordingly,&#xD;
                the error of drug therapy is intercepted before it takes place. This option&#xD;
                requires that conciliation by the pharmacist is made early in the patient's care in&#xD;
                the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Retroactive for patients who already have a prescription in hospital Â© DxCare&#xD;
                following their admission. BMO is established after drafting the OMA. It can then&#xD;
                be discrepancies that conciliation will allow to intercept and correct. It follows&#xD;
                writing additional information or a new prescription to correct the detected&#xD;
                differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. / The differences observed may be unintentional (medication errors) and correspond to&#xD;
           involuntary treatment changes and are likely to generate an adverse event for the&#xD;
           patient, or intentional but not documented and correspond to voluntary changes in&#xD;
           treatment, the reasons are not indicated in the patient file. It may be an addition,&#xD;
           modification or interruption of a medicament. This lack of information is likely to&#xD;
           generate a medication error later. The characterization of the differences will result&#xD;
           in 3 steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Each drug line is characterized by medical decision that seems to have been taken.&#xD;
                The drug is thus considered stopped, suspended, continued in the state, continued&#xD;
                with amendment, substituted or added.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Then the search of the annotated medical decision in the patient's file shows that&#xD;
                if the decision is documented or not. When it is, the treatment line is validated.&#xD;
                When it is not, it is concluded that there was a discrepancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At this late stage, the physician participation is mandatory to describe the degree&#xD;
                of intent of the undocumented divergence: divergence is characterized as&#xD;
                intentional or unintentional. Following the implementation of the reconciliation&#xD;
                rule, three decisions are possible for each drug line studied:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The drug is validated online&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In case of undocumented intentional discrepancy, the medical decision is to explain&#xD;
                by filling in the patient file&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In case of unintended discrepancy, the prescription is correct, there is a&#xD;
                medication error. Any deviation must be documented at BMO. The lack of information&#xD;
                can leave wrong to think that this discrepancy is intentional or not, hence the&#xD;
                importance of documenting prescription for medical decision is explicit. By cons, a&#xD;
                gap that is properly called unintentional must be corrected: it is a drug error can&#xD;
                cause harm to the patient if it is not caught.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. / The finalized conciliation document is then validated by the hospital pharmacist and&#xD;
           ends up embedded in the patient record to be reused during a transfer or discharge.&#xD;
