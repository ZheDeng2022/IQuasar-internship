  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a real-world, pre-post observational study from an ambulatory endocrinology practice&#xD;
      which will determine the effectiveness and safety of the addition of glucagon-like&#xD;
      peptide-1(GLP-1) agonist therapy (weekly exenatide {Bydureon} or daily liraglutide&#xD;
      {Victoza}), added to the regimens of T2DM patients who have already received a minimum of one&#xD;
      year of basal insulin therapy. Specifically, the investigators hypothesize that GLP-1 agonist&#xD;
      therapy added to basal insulin therapy will result in statistically significant improved&#xD;
      glycemic control and weight loss, with no higher risk of hypoglycemia compared to baseline.&#xD;

      This is a pre-post observational study which will assess the efficacy and safety of 12 months&#xD;
      of GLP-1 therapy added to the therapeutic regimen of a group of T2DM patients. This study was&#xD;
      reviewed and approved by the Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board. Potential subjects will be identified via a computerized text search of the&#xD;
      medication and problem fields of patient electronic medical records (EMR). Search terms&#xD;
      include exenatide, Bydureon, liraglutide, Victoza, GLP-1 agonist, NPH, Lantus, Levemir, and&#xD;
      T2DM. Individual records of identified patients will be reviewed to ascertain if all&#xD;
      applicable study criteria are met. Inclusion criteria are: T2DM, age 18-85 years,&#xD;
      documentation of basal insulin therapy for minimum of one year prior to GLP-1 initiation, and&#xD;
      addition of weekly exenatide or daily liraglutide added to basal insulin therapy for a&#xD;
      minimum of 12 months. Exclusion criteria include: Type 1 diabetes, patients receiving&#xD;
      prescription medications for weight loss, and initiation of additional diabetes, hypertension&#xD;
      or cholesterol drugs during the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A data collection form will be utilized to collect the following patient information:&#xD;
      baseline demographic information (gender, age, height, weight), duration of diabetes,&#xD;
      medications, laboratory information (HbA1C, cholesterol profile [total cholesterol,&#xD;
      triglycerides, LDL-C, HDL-C]), and blood pressure. The primary study outcome is change in&#xD;
      HbA1C from baseline to 12 months after GLP-1 therapy is added to basal insulin therapy. A&#xD;
      separate analysis including patients who do not complete 12 months of GLP-1 therapy will also&#xD;
      be performed. Secondary outcomes are change in weight, percentage of patients achieving an&#xD;
      A1C of &lt;7%, changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressures, changes in lipid parameters&#xD;
      (TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG's), and reductions in number/doses of diabetes, blood pressure, and&#xD;
      lipid lowering medications. Safety will be assessed by collection of reported adverse&#xD;
      effects. Medication compliance will be assessed by review of an insurance data base record of&#xD;
      refills.&#xD;
