      Twelve participants were randomized to either a Facebook group or a book club group for six&#xD;
      weeks. Data was collected on the participants social and behavioral function at both the&#xD;
      start and the conclusion of the intervention.&#xD;

      Research Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Project Rex team will randomize up to 12 subjects with Autism Spectrum Disorder who have&#xD;
      completed the Project Rex Teen Treatment Group into either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (Group F) A closed, invite-only group within Facebook facilitated by an&#xD;
           interprofessional team that not only reinforces skills, but also aims to promote bonds&#xD;
           and a sense of community and connectedness between participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (Group B) A topical book club group conducted by a single healthcare professional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both treatment arms will be 8 weeks in duration. The interprofessional team for the Facebook&#xD;
      arm of treatment will consist of one child and adolescent psychiatrist, one psychologist, two&#xD;
      social workers and one medical student. The single professional conducting the book club&#xD;
      activity will be a medical student. Parents will be required to help facilitate their child's&#xD;
      participation in the study treatment. All study subjects will have completed the 8-week&#xD;
      social skills introduction to social conversation Project Rex Teen group immediately prior to&#xD;
      enrolling in either the Facebook arm (F) or the Book Club arm (B) of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of this treatment cycle, the study investigators will conduct an additional&#xD;
      treatment cycle by randomizing two additional groups, each comprising up to 12 subjects with&#xD;
      Autism Spectrum Disorder who have completed the 8-week Project Rex Teen Treatment Group into&#xD;
      either Group F or Group B. The investigators will therefore enroll up to 24 total subjects in&#xD;
      the study. The study is being divided into three cycles due to the limitation of recruiting&#xD;
      only subjects who have completed the most recent round of the Project Rex teen program.&#xD;
      Approval by the Medical University of South Carolina Institutional Review Board will be&#xD;
      obtained before beginning this pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients participating in the Project Rex Teen Group and their parents will be provided with&#xD;
      written and verbal information about the opportunity to enroll in this study. This&#xD;
      information will be disseminated to patients and parents after the completion of five of the&#xD;
      total eight weeks of the Project Rex Teen Group. Patients and their parents will have&#xD;
      opportunities to ask questions about the study with co-investigators after the sessions on&#xD;
      week 6 and week 7. After the 8-week Project Rex teen group concludes, study co-investigators&#xD;
      will be available to obtain informed consent from the parents of the subjects ages 12 to 17&#xD;
      years of age, and to obtain the assent of the respective subjects. The study investigators&#xD;
      will also be available to obtain the informed consent of subjects who are age 18 to 20 years&#xD;
      at the conclusion of the 8-week Project Rex Teen Group. The parents and subjects will have up&#xD;
      to seven days after the conclusion of Week 8 of the Project Rex Teen Group to provide their&#xD;
      informed consent and assent, respectively, for enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once parents and subjects have provided their informed consent/assent and the subjects are&#xD;
      enrolled in the study, each subject will be randomized using REDCap into either Group F&#xD;
      (Facebook arm) or Group B (Book Club Arm). Both subject groups and their parents will meet&#xD;
      with for an information session about the study and their participation, which will be&#xD;
      scheduled to occur within a week of the conclusion of Week 8 of the Project Rex Teen Program.&#xD;
      Both treatment groups will meet on the same day and time, but will attend different&#xD;
      information sessions located in different rooms within the Institute of Psychiatry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects who are assigned to the Facebook group and their parents will meet for a&#xD;
      90-minute group information session at Week 1, prior to the start of the Facebook treatment&#xD;
      phase. These meetings will be conducted by the study investigators and will include a review&#xD;
      of the study procedure, Facebook guidelines and Facebook terms and policy, privacy settings&#xD;
      and data collection methods. The study investigators will directly support each subject in&#xD;
      setting up their project Rex Facebook account and educating subjects about privacy settings.&#xD;
      The study investigators will provide parents with education and training on the use of the&#xD;
      Project Rex Facebook account and the maintenance of Project Rex Facebook account privacy&#xD;
      settings to ensure that subjects are using the account appropriately and safely. At the&#xD;
      conclusion of the Facebook information session, the subjects will be randomly assigned via&#xD;
      lottery into two groups (1 &amp; 2) for the purpose only of posting and responding to the&#xD;
      discussion topic of the week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects and parents who are assigned to the Book Club group will meet for a 90-minute&#xD;
      group information session at week 1, prior to the Book Club arm beginning. A study&#xD;
      investigator will conduct this meeting and will provide a review of the study procedure,&#xD;
      orient participants to the Book Club, review book club rules and expectations, and distribute&#xD;
      the books.&#xD;
