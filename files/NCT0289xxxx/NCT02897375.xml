  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of palbociclib with cisplatin or&#xD;
      carboplatin in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other places and&#xD;
      usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment. Palbociclib may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them&#xD;
      from spreading. Giving palbociclib with cisplatin or carboplatin may help stop tumor growth&#xD;
      in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the safety and tolerability of palbociclib when administered along with cisplatin&#xD;
      or carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the tested combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of cisplatin, carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Obtain preliminary evidence of anti-tumor efficacy of the tested combination regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Conduct PK/pharmacodynamics (PD) correlative analyses using palbociclib trough&#xD;
      concentration and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) inhibition read-outs in tumor and&#xD;
      surrogate samples collected on course 1 day 22 (C1D22).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess potential association between tissue-based biomarkers and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1 and&#xD;
      palbociclib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 2-22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up&#xD;
      to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1 and palbociclib PO QD on&#xD;
      days 2-22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 4 weeks.&#xD;
