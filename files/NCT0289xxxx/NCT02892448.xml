    <textblock>
      There may be a relationship between heart function and the metal ion levels in patients&#xD;
      having undergone total hip replacement. The idea is to use results from a clinical cardiac&#xD;
      MRI to assess heart function in a sample of 30 patients whom have undergone either&#xD;
      metal-on-metal hip replacement (unilateral or bilateral) or a non-metal on metal total hip&#xD;
      replacement to determine whether having undergone a metal on metal hip procedure may be&#xD;
      impacting heart function. In addition to the clinically used parameters, the images will also&#xD;
      be retrospectively assessed using special software to assess amount of fibrosis and early&#xD;
      changes affecting cardiac muscle contraction which may be indicative of impaired heart&#xD;
      function. With these values we will compare to known, and previously collected, hip&#xD;
      replacement and function data to determine whether there is any differences in how the heart&#xD;
      works in those having had a hip replacement relative to a normal population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There has been some recent concern regarding possible systemic health effects resulting from&#xD;
      elevated blood cobalt concentrations in patients with cobalt containing hip implants (1). To&#xD;
      date there are no blood cobalt criteria to help guide physicians when evaluating an&#xD;
      individual hip implant patient's risk of developing systemic health effects because&#xD;
      historically there was little or no concern about systemic cobalt toxicity in implant&#xD;
      patients. Included within this is heart function, for which investigators see a need to use&#xD;
      this novel software to analyze heart function relative to Hip status and Metal Ion levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with metal on metal hip prosthesis are subject to local and systemic release of&#xD;
      cobalt and chromium ions which may increase the potential for locally aggressive ion-induced&#xD;
      local tissue reactions such as pseudotumours, a type of Adverse Reaction to Metal Debris&#xD;
      (ARMD) (2). Although there have been reports of local toxicity as well as cases of cobaltism&#xD;
      (as seen during outbreak in Quebec of so called 'cobalt beer drinkers' cardiomyopathy)&#xD;
      leading to cardiac and ototoxicity, it is unclear if chronic exposure to these ions can lead&#xD;
      to impaired cardiac function (cardiotoxicity) in a well-functioning prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of the blood cobalt concentrations reported for hip implant patients appear to&#xD;
      range from approximately 0.2 to 10 µg/L, and based on our review of the available literature,&#xD;
      should not pose an increased risk for the development of systemic health effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concern for systemic health effects is for the small number of patients with&#xD;
      cobalt-containing hip implants with markedly elevated blood cobalt concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extensive evaluations of these 'cobalt beer drinkers' have found that poor nutrition and&#xD;
      underlying disease states caused by severe alcoholism were likely significant contributing&#xD;
      factors to heart disease in this particular population. However, there remains a significant&#xD;
      concern that cardiac function could be affected in the long term. This is especially relevant&#xD;
      as the majority of these implants are put in patients less than 50 years age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is the gold standard method to assess cardiac&#xD;
      function in patients at risk of cardiotoxicity. In addition to assessing cardiac function,&#xD;
      CMR enables imaging of inflammation, and fibrosis (which may be secondary to the ion&#xD;
      deposition) in the heart which may provide more specific information about the mechanism of&#xD;
      injury in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to look at cardiac function in patients with a metal on metal&#xD;
      hip prostheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: 30 patients in total (10 unilateral and 10 bilateral hip resurfacing patients&#xD;
      and 10 non-metal on metal total hip replacement patients) will be recruited which should&#xD;
      provide indication of relationship both between either instances and heart function, as well&#xD;
      as compared to one another. All patients will be undergoing clinical cardiac MRI. All&#xD;
      patients will have extra images collected during their MRI and these images will be analyzed&#xD;
      to determine any relationship between heart function and the possible metal ion levels from&#xD;
      the hip implant. As part of the scan analysis they will be required to also have a 5&#xD;
      millilitres (mLs) vial of blood collected. Ultrasound values will be retrospectively&#xD;
      collected, for analysis of soft tissue reaction, from a previous clinically ordered&#xD;
      ultrasound of the affected joint.&#xD;
