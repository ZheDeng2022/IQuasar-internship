    <textblock>
      Facial palsy can be divided into supranuclear lesion (central facial palsy) and infranuclear&#xD;
      lesion such as Bell's Palsy, an idiopathic disease. The peripheral facial paralysis (PFP) is&#xD;
      a frequent but little-known pathology (20 / 100 000 inhabitants in France a year). Oro-facial&#xD;
      functions and the ability to convey emotional facial information are seriously affected by&#xD;
      facial palsy, thereby reducing patient's quality of life. The PFP can have several&#xD;
      repercussions on the functional, aesthetic, social, occupational and psychological levels.&#xD;
      Evolution and prognosis depend not only on its etiology and gravity, but also on the&#xD;
      precocity and the quality of the medical and paramedical care. It is essential to assess&#xD;
      functional and psychological issues before beginning an adapted global therapeutic care. If&#xD;
      these depressive symptoms can be explained by multiple factors, the inability to smile would&#xD;
      be one of the triggering factors of depression. The facial feedback hypothesis could be one&#xD;
      of many explications because smiling induces a positive emotional state and a feeling of&#xD;
      well-being. In PFP, patients must cope with their difficulties to smile. Their facial&#xD;
      behaviour affected their own emotional experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of the present study is to determine if virtual rehabilitation program is&#xD;
      relevant compared to standard therapy. The second aim is to characterize the efficiency by&#xD;
      analysing the time required to obtain a stable score of 4 in the Sunnybrook test. A secondary&#xD;
      objective will be to decrease the functional and social repercussions of the facial paralysis&#xD;
      with an intensive and targeted therapy of the smile. Furthermore, a virtual rehabilitation&#xD;
      program will be implemented in an interactive platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this end, a parallel randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the two groups will be&#xD;
      conducted: standard therapy versus virtual rehabilitation program. RCT involves a treatment&#xD;
      in which active participation of the patient is necessary so only the assessment will be&#xD;
      blinded. Facial motor skills (tongue, mouth and face motricity) are measured using electronic&#xD;
      devices, objective and subjective evaluation with pragmatic fields such as communication,&#xD;
      emotion and quality of life. The severity of patient's facial paralysis is appraised by the&#xD;
      House and Brackmann scale. This global assessment will be conducted before the beginning of&#xD;
      the therapy and every 3 months during 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be recruited within the Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) service after a&#xD;
      baseline assessment. Simple randomization will be used in order to establish both therapeutic&#xD;
      groups with 45 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Patients taken care in consultation within the ENT service which provides&#xD;
      oro-myo-functional classical rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: Patients taken care in external consultation who receive oro-myo-functional&#xD;
      rehabilitation through a virtual rehabilitation program targeted at the smile, in their place&#xD;
      of living in virtual conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients must have been diagnosed with unilateral peripheral facial palsy, according to&#xD;
      House and Brackmann international classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion time : 18 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between-two-groups analysis will be conducted in order to compare a targeted and intensive&#xD;
      implementation-intention rehabilitation such as virtual rehabilitation program to standard&#xD;
      therapy. This virtual therapy will consist in repeating mentally movement desired, so that it&#xD;
      will be more spontaneously executed in the every-day-life situation.&#xD;

      facial behaviour affected their own emotional experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time required for improvement and risk of sequelae are proportional in the severity of the&#xD;
      paralysis (speed of installation and axonal loss). Do the patients benefiting from virtual&#xD;
      care have a deadline of recovery faster than control patients? Does a virtual rehabilitation&#xD;
      program, home delivered, which is targeted at the smile improve symmetric movements and&#xD;
      reduce psychological and functional issues?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of the present study is to determine if virtual rehabilitation program is&#xD;

&#xD;
      Oro-myo-functional classical rehabilitation (Diels et al.):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuromuscular retraining is a problem solving approach to treatment using selective motor&#xD;
      training to facilitate symmetrical movement and control undesired gross motor activity&#xD;
      (synkinesis). Treatment consists to accomplish daily massages and facial exercises (ten&#xD;
      minutes per day). Motivation on the part of the patient is a crucial element in the success&#xD;
      of treatment Tools such as feedback and specific mirror exercises provide augmented sensory&#xD;
      information to enhance neural adaptation and learning. Patient education is the most basic&#xD;
      aspect of the therapeutic process. The facial therapist provides training in basic facial&#xD;
      anatomy, physiology and kinesiology pertinent to each patient's specific situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment is based on functional profile. Techniques will be used to facilitate movement and&#xD;
      inhibit abnormal patterns refine motor control, coordination and complexity of movement. The&#xD;
      specific objectives of the reeducation are to mobilize the paralyzed hemiface and to avoid&#xD;
      the over-investment of the healthy hemiface via the relaxation. Focus: to inhibit the&#xD;
      abnormal over-activity rather than to strengthen muscles. Although each patient's program&#xD;
      differs, there are common aspects in the treatment of all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique is based on three fundamental principles:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Slow execution to maintain inhibition as exercise increases - minimal, incremental&#xD;
           movements. Initiating movements slowly and gradually allows the patient to observe and&#xD;
           modify the angle, strength and speed of the excursion as it occurs. As a result, new&#xD;
           motor control strategies are systematically developed and learned.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Small movements enough to mimic expressive movements and decrease overflow. Small&#xD;
           movements preserve isolated responses of the facial muscles by limiting motor unit&#xD;
           recruitment to those muscles targeted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symmetry. Patients are instructed in symmetrical exercise of movements to reinforce the&#xD;
           normal physiological response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic treatment sessions are designed to identify, develop and refine the movement patterns&#xD;
      that will be of greatest benefit to each patient. Patients practice these movement patterns&#xD;
      repeated in the clinic to assure accuracy. Through the home program, patients consistently&#xD;
      practice the strategies learned in the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual Rehabilitation program:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It's in the e-health context that virtual rehabilitation program should be considered.&#xD;
      E-health is a recent term for healthcare practice supported by electronic processes and&#xD;
      communication. E-health is becoming more and more as the solution for universal access to&#xD;
      high quality care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The virtual rehabilitation program is a computerized rehabilitation, remotely managed by the&#xD;
      therapist. This rehabilitation would meet patients' and therapists' expectations with the aim&#xD;
      of dealing with the lack of therapists trained in the specific rehabilitation of the PFP. It&#xD;
      will avoid too frequent and binding travels of the patients. Indeed, kilometric average of&#xD;
      paralyzed patients taken care in the ENT service in Pitié-Salpêtrière is about 88 km. This&#xD;
      virtual rehabilitation program would then meet the requirements of the law '' Hospital,&#xD;
      Patient, Health and Territory '' of July 29th, 2009.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This virtual rehabilitation could also help patients to stay motivated by involving them&#xD;
      actively in the rehabilitation process. In fact, the patient is an autonomous actor of his&#xD;
      own rehabilitation. Furthermore, visual feedback provided by the avatar will help them to&#xD;
      execute movements in a proper way&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient data is transferred to the therapists. At distance, the clinician is able to&#xD;
      straighten the exercises to execute and to update the method while waiting for the next&#xD;
      patient consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be in front of his screen and the avatar will produce '' praxies'' according&#xD;
      to the evolution and the severity of the PFP (House and Brackmann scale). It is recommended&#xD;
      to observe the avatar repeatedly (three times a day for two weeks) so that, the patient will&#xD;
      learn the appropriate motor schemes. Then, the patient will apply the ''&#xD;
      implementation-intention '' technique in order to find the movement in any circumstances.&#xD;
      This technique consists in repeating mentally in advance the deliberate movement, so that it&#xD;
      will be executed more spontaneously in every-day-life situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration tool presents two sectors: it allows on one hand to consult the recorded&#xD;
      patients (addition, modifications, consultation of the exercises video, rehabilitation&#xD;
      management and updating, indication of the next recommended exercises, addition of a note for&#xD;
      the next session...). On the other hand, it allows to manage the exercises which include a&#xD;
      number of poses. For every pose, maintaining poses time and number of iterations of the pose&#xD;
      is indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital, still sub-used technology, represents a real potential to improve professional&#xD;
      practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient training tool is a Windows run-time software which connects to the database and&#xD;
      downloads the exercises of the session. This connexion involves an automatic identification.&#xD;
      The software begins with a message posted by the therapist. Then, a simple interface,&#xD;
      including a half-screen posting what sees the webcam and another half-screen showing the&#xD;
      avatar which serves as a model for the training sessions. The patients are able to record&#xD;
      their own pose and to try again if they need to. In the end, a message indicates the end of&#xD;
      the current session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between-two-groups analysis will be conducted in order to compare a targeted and intensive&#xD;
      implementation-intention rehabilitation such as virtual rehabilitation program to standard&#xD;
      therapy. This virtual therapy will consist in repeating mentally movement desired, so that it&#xD;
      will be more spontaneously executed in the every-day-life situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the quantitative variables, as the Sunnybrook score, the bilabial strength, the&#xD;
      House-Brackmann score, the MADRS score and the Quality of Life score will be described by&#xD;
      their average score, standard deviation, median score, minimum and maximum score.&#xD;
      Category-specific variables as Spielberg stress scale, Mouth-tongue-face motricity assessment&#xD;
      will be described by their frequencies and their percentages. Missing data will be taken into&#xD;
      account in these calculations Reliable intervals in 95% will be supplied when it will be&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percentages in both groups will be compared by Pearson X2 tests or Fisher tests according to&#xD;
      the distribution. Continuous data will be compared by Student tests or Mann-Whitney tests,&#xD;
      according to their distribution. P-values must be lower than 0,05 in order to be considered&#xD;
      as statistically significant..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses will be realized in intention to treat, under the responsibility of the&#xD;
      Biostatistics pole of Clinical Research Unit (URC) Pitié-Salpêtrière Charles Foix, with the&#xD;
      software SAS 9.2 (SAS(AIRLOCK,SIEVE,AIRLOCKS) INSTITUTE, CARY, NC).&#xD;
