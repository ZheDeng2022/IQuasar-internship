    <textblock>
      Patients with severe and enduring eating disorders (SEED) are seriously ill and have a low&#xD;
      quality of life. In 2014, a special unit based on case management (CM), for patients with&#xD;
      SEED (the Eira unit) was started at Stockholm Centre for Eating Disorders, Sweden. Eating&#xD;
      disorder is a serious illness that creates a great deal of suffering. Most patients who&#xD;
      undergo specialized eating disorder treatment will be healthy, but a small percentage of the&#xD;
      patients develop a SEED. SEED patient have gone through numerous of treatments and has been&#xD;
      to several specialists units for years as well as they has completed many different therapies&#xD;
      without getting fee from the eating disorder (ED). Due to the long term sick in ED the SEED&#xD;
      patient is often alone and has difficulties to cope with everyday life situations. SEED&#xD;
      patients are a vulnerable patient population with a great suffering and poverty to release&#xD;
      the identity of the ED. However, no previous study is done in which patients with SEED&#xD;
      themselves describe their own theory about why they are still ill and how specialized eating&#xD;
      disorder care has affected them. In the ED field, there is a growing consensus that treatment&#xD;
      of patients with SEED needs to be multi-professional, with a focus on improving the patients'&#xD;
      social situation, minimizing medical complications, and enhancing quality of life and&#xD;
      independence, rather than focusing one-sided on symptom reduction. Is case management a way&#xD;
      to help the SEED patients witness a better quality of life? Besides the personal suffering of&#xD;
      patients and their families, SEED is also associated with high costs for health care and for&#xD;
      society in general.&#xD;

      1. This is a qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews with 21 patients with&#xD;
           SEED. Grounded theory was used to analyse data. The patients had suffered from eating&#xD;
           disorders on average for 21,5 years with a BMI of 15,4 (12,2-19.5) at the time for the&#xD;
           interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Methods for data collection are a semi-structured diagnostic interview, a qualitative&#xD;
           interview, self-report questionnaires and data from medical records. The diagnostic&#xD;
           interview and the self-report assessments will be done at start of treatment and at&#xD;
           follow-ups after one, two, and three years. The qualitative interview will be conducted&#xD;
           one year after start of treatment. Data from medical records will be collected&#xD;
           retrospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Structured Eating Disorder Interview (SEDI) is a semi-structured diagnostic interview for&#xD;
      ED diagnoses according to the DSM-IV. The interview consists of a maximum of 30 and normally&#xD;
      about 20-25 questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RAND-36 (also known as the SF-36) measures health-related quality of life (HRQoL).&#xD;
      Changes in the HRQoL over time can be seen by comparing repeated assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) measures central symptomatic aspects of&#xD;
      ED by way of patient's self-ratings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Treatment Satisfaction Scale 2 (TSS-2) is a patient-rated assessment of treatment&#xD;
      satisfaction in a simple 6-item scale. TSS-2 will be used at all follow-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative interview is semi-structured and consists of three broad themes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The patient's thoughts about her/his life situation in the year he/she has been at Eira.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The patient's thoughts and reflections about her/his quality of life, and whether it has&#xD;
           been affected in the year he/she has been at Eira.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The patient's thoughts about her/his future. The informants will be asked to talk openly&#xD;
           around these themes. The interviewer, who is the same person for all interviews, is a&#xD;
           psychologist who is not part of the Eira staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. The cost-effectiveness analysis consists of costs of the CM intervention, changes in&#xD;
      quality of life, as well as societal costs such as health care usage and loss of production.&#xD;
      The perspective of the analysis will be societal and the time horizon three years. The&#xD;
      analysis method is going to be cost-utility analysis with health effect expressed in quality&#xD;
      adjusted life years (QALY). The analysis will be complemented with the probability of&#xD;
      acceptable cost-effectiveness with different willingness to pay for a QALY.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All costs of the CM intervention occur at Eira. The cost for each patient in the study can be&#xD;
      calculated by Eira's total cost divided with each patient's share of resource utilization&#xD;
      based on enrolled time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QALYs will be estimated based on RAND-36 transformed to SF-6D based on a British preference&#xD;
      score. From the measures at baseline, and after 1, 2 and 3 years, changes in QALYs can be&#xD;
      estimated. From medical records, changes in cost of health care usage can be calculated. The&#xD;
      participants' employment and change acquisition work rate is followed during the same period&#xD;
      based on interviews with participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment may also have impact on relatives' quality of life, costs and earnings. These&#xD;
      aspects will not be considered in the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first 5-6 sessions at Eira, the patient's psychiatric, somatic and social&#xD;
      condition is carefully investigated as well as her/his medical history and previous treatment&#xD;
      experiences. Thereafter the CM intervention starts. The patients' needs and preferences&#xD;
      guides where and how often the meetings take place and some can be done by phone or text&#xD;
      messages. Another important part of the CM is to help the patients contact the authorities&#xD;
      and if necessary to aid them with economic issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the supportive interventions is it also important to regularly monitor the&#xD;
      somatic condition and the weight of the patients. If the patient is temporarily in need of&#xD;
      more somatic or psychiatric help, the therapists can help in planning a short, more intensive&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twice a year, there is a lecture about the SEED condition for the relatives (without the&#xD;
      patients) at Eira. During the lecture the relatives can ask questions and discuss problems&#xD;
      they encounter as SEED relatives. With the patients' consent, relatives are invited to&#xD;
      participate in the CM treatment. Information and support is offered relatives on an&#xD;
      individual basis, this also includes underage children.&#xD;
