  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) lifestyles with lower physical&#xD;
      activity levels have been shown to increase the risk of hospital admissions and shorten&#xD;
      survival rates. An established process in increasing activity levels is to undergo pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation classes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to identify whether the use of activity monitors,which will provide&#xD;
      feedback on activity levels, will increase the physical activity levels of patients with COPD&#xD;
      outside of the supervised pulmonary rehabilitation sessions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research proposal has been developed in conjunction with the Respiratory Physicians and&#xD;
      Physiotherapy team who deliver the pulmonary Rehabilitation sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to address if providing patients with monitors to record activity&#xD;
      levels and then giving feedback on activity level data enhances the effect of the standard&#xD;
      pulmonary rehabilitation program. The investigators want to pay particular attention to the&#xD;
      levels of activity outside the duration of the rehabilitation classes - to see if higher&#xD;
      levels of activity are reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This aims to be a feasibility study done on a small scale where issues such as compliance&#xD;
      with wearing the device can be monitored closely. Compliance will be reviewed during a one&#xD;
      week trial of wearing the device prior to starting the rehabilitation sessions. It will also&#xD;
      enable study participants to get into the routine of wearing the device, charging etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the data will be data collected during weekdays, choosing the 4 weekdays where&#xD;
      there is a minimum of 8hrs of wearing time during waking hours. If the device has been worn&#xD;
      for less than 8 hours, then days with most wear-time of the device will be selected. This&#xD;
      method was chosen as it is a robust and statistically validated method of assessing activity&#xD;
      levels in patients with COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants will be asked to wear the activity monitor to minimise any bias in the&#xD;
      collected data. Subjects will be randomised as to whether they receive feedback or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice of activity monitor to be used was considered. Requirements are that it should be&#xD;
      wrist-worn and the data collected by the device able to been downloaded through the&#xD;
      associated computer software/&quot;app&quot;. Wrist worn devices were chosen so that compliance in&#xD;
      wearing the device would be maximized - they are worn in the same way a normal wrist watch&#xD;
      would be.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A model from the brand &quot;Fitbit&quot; was selected based on this criteria. This was justified by&#xD;
      previous studies showing Fitbit has good validity and usability in measuring energy&#xD;
      expenditure in COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As all participants in the study will partake in the pulmonary rehabilitation sessions there&#xD;
      will be no deviations from standard care with this project. Analysis of activity will be&#xD;
      downloaded, once a week, from the devices during the sessions and subjects randomised to&#xD;
      receive feedback will have a 10 minute session dedicated to this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a risk that subjects will have an exacerbation of their condition/chest infection&#xD;
      during the period of pulmonary rehab. If a subject is too unwell to attend a rehabilitation&#xD;
      session they will receive their feedback on their next attendance. Any subjects that are&#xD;
      hospitalised during the study will be withdrawn.&#xD;
