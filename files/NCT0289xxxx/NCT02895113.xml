      The pathophysiology of diabetes is multifactorial. Beyond genetic susceptibility loci, a lot&#xD;
      of acquired risk factors are involved in the development and progression of the disease.&#xD;
      Chronic complications of diabetes can be divided into vascular and nonvascular. The risk of&#xD;
      developing complications increases with the duration of hyperglycemia, and usually become&#xD;
      apparent in the second decade of hyperglycemia. Vascular complications are further subdivided&#xD;
      into microvascular (retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy) and macrovascular (coronary&#xD;
      artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, cerebrovascular disease). It is estimated that&#xD;
      the annual decline of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in diabetic adults is about&#xD;
      2.1-2.7 ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there is consolidated evidence about the use of aspirin (ASA) for secondary prevention&#xD;
      in diabetic patients, there is no consensus on the use in primary prevention; the use of ASA&#xD;
      in these patients is at physician discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASA is an effective antithrombotic agent that inhibits the production of thromboxane (Tx) A2&#xD;
      and other prostaglandins by blocking cyclooxygenase (COX). In patients treated with aspirin,&#xD;
      serum TxB₂ level is the most reliable in vivo indicator of COX-1 inhibition than TxA2, due to&#xD;
      its short half-life and artifacts associated with platelet activation ex vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COX are present in the kidney in the macula densa, in the medulla and in the interstitium.&#xD;
      Experimental animals models have demonstrated that COX are involved in regulation of renal&#xD;
      blood flow. In particular, in a murine animal model, after the administration of COX&#xD;
      inhibitors such as aspirin and celecoxib, it was observed an improvement in renal plasma flow&#xD;
      and eGFR, suggesting a role for Tx in the progression of renal damage However, data on the&#xD;
      relationship between aspirin and renal function in humans are scarce. In a recent work lead&#xD;
      on a large cohort of 800 patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, ASA use was&#xD;
      associated with a reduced progression of eGFR &lt;45 ml/min during 2 years of follow-up.&#xD;
      Furthermore, basal levels of urinary excretion of TxB2, correlated inversely with the use of&#xD;
      aspirin and with the decrease of eGFR at follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the decline in renal function in diabetic patients&#xD;
      treated with low-dose aspirin (100 mg/day) vs. untreated diabetic patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological data show that type 2 diabetes has an epidemic trend worldwide. The increase&#xD;
      in food intake, the greater availability of refined grains and the reduction of physical&#xD;
      activity had, in fact, negative effects in most areas. It is expected that the number of&#xD;
      people suffering from diabetes will double in the period 2000-2030.The most important&#xD;
      increase is expected in developing countries, where the prevalence of obesity has rapidly&#xD;
      increased. Unlike developing countries, in Europe and in US the higher incidence of diabetes&#xD;
      is primarily related to the increased life expectancy of the general population and of&#xD;
      diabetic people in particular, and secondary to the higher incidence of the disease. The&#xD;
      Casale Monferrato Study indicate an increase of 44% (2.6% vs. 3.8%) in the period 1988-2000.&#xD;
      The prevalence of obesity in diabetic patients (Body Mass Index, BMI&gt; 30 kg / m2) increased&#xD;
      from 23% to 34%. Whereas in subjects aged &lt;65 years the increase in the prevalence of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes was non-significant (1.1% vs. 1.7%), in the age group &gt; 65 years, the increase was&#xD;
      significant (6.5% vs. 9.1%). In particular, a doubling of the prevalence in the age ≥80 years&#xD;
      was recorded (3.5% vs. 7.2%). The most recent data from the Turin Study show that in 2003 the&#xD;
      prevalence of overt diabetes was 4.9% in 2003. Thus, there was a doubling of cases over a&#xD;
      period of 15 years (1988-2003); in the age group 65-74 years, the prevalence rose to 13% and&#xD;
      in the age&gt; 74 years to 14%. It is also estimated that 1.5-2% of the population is affected&#xD;
      by misdiagnosed diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiology of diabetes is multifactorial. Beyond genetic susceptibility loci, a lot&#xD;
      of acquired risk factors are involved in the development and progression of the disease. The&#xD;
      most important are Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG) (odds ratio, OR = 11), Impaired Glucose&#xD;
      Tolerance (IGT) (OR = 3.9), the weight (overweight: OR = 3.4 and obesity: OR = 9.9),&#xD;
      dyslipidemia (OR = 1.6), hypertension (OR = 2.3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic complications of diabetes can be divided into vascular and nonvascular. The risk of&#xD;
      developing complications increases with the duration of hyperglycemia, and usually become&#xD;
      apparent in the second decade of hyperglycemia. Vascular complications are further subdivided&#xD;
      into microvascular (retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy) and macrovascular (coronary&#xD;
      artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, cerebrovascular disease). In particular, the&#xD;
      worsening of renal function seems to be a peculiar characteristic of the patients suffering&#xD;
      from diabetes. It is estimated that the annual decline of estimated glomerular filtration&#xD;
      rate (eGFR) in diabetic adults is about 2.1-2.7 ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aspirin and Diabetes The efficacy and the safety of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin, ASA) as an&#xD;
      antithrombotic agent has been assessed in different subsets, both in apparently healthy&#xD;
      people at low risk of vascular complications (primary prevention), and in high-risk patients,&#xD;
      such as those with a previous myocardial infarction or acute ischemic stroke (secondary&#xD;
      prevention). Diabetic patients represent an important group in whom treatment with ASA should&#xD;
      be carefully considered. The evidence that type 2 diabetic patients taking glucose-lowering&#xD;
      agents have similar cardiovascular risk compared to non-diabetic with a previous myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, could make reasonable the use of an antiplatelet drug as primary prevention&#xD;
      strategy for cardiovascular diseases. However, while there is consolidated evidence about the&#xD;
      use of ASA for secondary prevention in diabetic patients, there is no consensus on the use in&#xD;
      primary prevention; ASA use in these patients is at physician discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanism of action of aspirin. Aspirin is an effective antithrombotic agent that inhibits,&#xD;
      the production of thromboxane (Tx) A2 and other prostaglandins by blocking cyclooxygenase&#xD;
      (COX) enzyme. There have been described two isoforms of COX, the COX-1, which is widely&#xD;
      expressed and which plays a function of gastric cyto-protection, and COX-2 expressed upon&#xD;
      external stimuli and mainly in inflammatory and immune cells. Low-dosage ASA can inhibit&#xD;
      COX-1, while at high dosage, ASA can inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antiplatelet action of ASA is via specific inhibition of COX in platelets, through the&#xD;
      acetylation of serine-529 of COX-1. This enzyme possesses both cyclooxygenase activity&#xD;
      [converting arachidonate into prostaglandin G2 (PGG2)] and peroxidase [converting PGG2 into&#xD;
      PGH2, the biochemical precursor of many other prostaglandins and Tx]. In platelets, this&#xD;
      inhibitory effect has as a result, the reduced production of prostaglandins and TxA2, which&#xD;
      is a strong platelet agonist. This inhibitory effect is irreversible so that TxA2-mediated&#xD;
      platelet aggregation can be restored only through the synthesis of new platelets. Thus, after&#xD;
      ASA administration, platelet aggregation is inhibited up to 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients treated with low doses of aspirin, serum TxB₂ level is a most reliable in vivo&#xD;
      indicator of COX-1 inhibition than TxA2, due to its short half-life and artifacts associated&#xD;
      with platelet activation ex vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both urinary levels of 11-dehydro-TxB₂ and 2.3-dinor-TxB₂, the most abundant metabolite of&#xD;
      TxB₂, have been proven to be platelet activation surrogates. As 11-dehydro-TxB₂ is excreted&#xD;
      in higher amounts and has a longer half-life, is the marker of choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thromboxane binds to TP receptor, commonly found on platelets, smooth muscle cells,&#xD;
      endothelium and vessels. They exert vasoconstriction function on blood vessels, platelet&#xD;
      aggregation and induce the initial stages of coagulation. In particular, Tx is entailed in&#xD;
      the reduction of renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimal dosage of aspirin. Randomized placebo-controlled studies have shown that aspirin is&#xD;
      effective as an antithrombotic agent at a dosage ranging from 50 to 1500 mg/day; however,&#xD;
      long-term clinical efficacy requires daily dosage of 50 up to 100 mg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patrono et al. assessed a relationship between aspirin dose and TxB2 levels. This study&#xD;
      showed that a single dose of 100 mg of drug was able to reduce by 98% the concentration of&#xD;
      serum levels of Tx during the first hour. Single doses of 100-400 mg were able to reduce of&#xD;
      94-98% after 24 and 48 hours, with an inhibition rate up to 90-92% at 72 hrs. Serum Tx&#xD;
      decreased to normal levels after a period compatible with the platelet half-life. More than&#xD;
      90% of platelet inhibition could be maintained over one month by giving 200 mg of aspirin&#xD;
      every 72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aspirin, eicosanoids and renal function As previously reported, ASA is able to inhibit Tx&#xD;
      production by inhibiting COX; COX are present in the kidney in the macula densa, in the&#xD;
      medulla and in the interstitium. In the macula densa this enzyme seems to favour renin&#xD;
      production (eg. salt restriction, use of ACE inhibitors, renovascular hypertension).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental animals models have demonstrated that COX are involved in regulation of renal&#xD;
      blood flow. In particular, in a murine animal model, after the administration of COX&#xD;
      inhibitors such as aspirin and celecoxib, it was observed an improvement in renal plasma flow&#xD;
      and eGFR, suggesting a role for Tx in the progression of renal damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, data on the relationship between aspirin and renal function in humans are not&#xD;
      available. In a recent work that included a large cohort of 800 patients with non-valvular&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation, the use of aspirin was associated with a reduced progression of eGFR &lt;45&#xD;
      ml/min during 2 years of follow-up. In particular, patients not receiving aspirin had an&#xD;
      incidence of GFR &lt;45 ml/min of 15% vs. 5% of those treated with aspirin 100 mg/day.&#xD;
      Furthermore, basal levels of urinary excretion of TxB2, correlated inversely with the use of&#xD;
      aspirin and with the decrease of eGFR at follow-up.&#xD;
