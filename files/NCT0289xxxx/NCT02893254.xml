      Study of the efficacy and safety of IBI303 compared with adalimumab in adult patients with&#xD;
      ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who have had an inadequate response to or who are intolerant to&#xD;
      one or more nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adults patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      receive treatment with adalimumab 40 mg every other week (eow) or IBI303, given&#xD;
      subcutaneously (SC), in the 24-week double-blind (DB) phase. Randomized participants received&#xD;
      one SC injection of the appropriate DB study medication (adalimumab 40 mg or IBI303) at Week&#xD;
      0 and then eow until Week 22. A follow-up visit occurred 70 days(Week 32) after the last dose&#xD;
      of study drug to obtain information on any ongoing or new adverse events (AEs).&#xD;
