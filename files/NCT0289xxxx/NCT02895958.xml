      Evaluation of Zepatier in a community-based setting among cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic&#xD;
      patients on stable opiate substitution therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hard-to-reach groups such as those attending addiction and homeless services are particularly&#xD;
      at risk for HCV-associated liver disease progression as they do not engage in treatment, have&#xD;
      poor attendance records for appointments, and are at risk of progression to cirrhosis without&#xD;
      evaluation and detection. These patients are therefore &quot;silently&quot; progressing in the&#xD;
      community and may be close to decompensation. Once a patient goes over that critical stage&#xD;
      from compensated to decompensated cirrhosis, the cost to the patient in terms of their&#xD;
      health, and the cost to the state in terms of the management of cirrhosis related&#xD;
      complications are great.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of this investigator-led community-based treatment protocol we aim to demonstrate the&#xD;
      utility of an integrated community-based care partnership between primary and secondary care&#xD;
      to best evaluate and treat such hard to reach populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to actively find fibrosis levels of HCV related liver disease using the FibroScan&#xD;
      diagnostic tool, and support patients to be treated for their HCV with the newly available&#xD;
      DAAs and be cured of their HCV infection and disease through:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Active case finding by travelling to the services used by 'at risk' groups as opposed to&#xD;
           giving appointments to the patient to attend hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Locating HCV patients (with positive RNA or HCV antigen) that are 'lost to follow up'.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Staging and risk-stratifying HCV patients locally to support access to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Educating HCV patients around new assessment tools and treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Setting up and supporting the initiation of treatment in the community e.g. daily&#xD;
           dispensing of medication/treatment with methadone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Providing on-going harm reduction advice on preventing reinfection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Work in partnership with Methadone prescribing GP practices and Drug Treatment Centres&#xD;
           from the North and South Dublin catchment area&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. 1. Child Pugh B or C (see Appendix 10.1 for Child-Pugh Classification)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. HCV non-G1/G4&#xD;
&#xD;

             aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject is enrolled in one or more investigational drug protocols, which may impact on&#xD;
             assessment of HCV treatment with Zepatier (+/-ribavirin).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject is, in the opinion of the investigator, unable to complete the study dosing&#xD;
             period and protocol evaluations and assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with alcohol and drug use problems that in the view of investigator will&#xD;
             compromise adherence to compliance with the study will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject is either pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject suffers from any serious medical condition (such as pancreatitis, diabetes,&#xD;
             congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy or other cardiac dysfunction), which in the&#xD;
             opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the safety of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject has a pre-existing mental, physical, or substance abuse disorder that, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the Investigator, may interfere with the subject's ability to comply with&#xD;
             the dosing schedule and protocol evaluations and assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subject has a history of inflammatory bowel disease or intestinal malignancy,&#xD;
             intestinal ischemia, malabsorption, or other gastrointestinal dysfunction, which, in&#xD;
             the opinion of the Investigator, may interfere with drug absorption or render the&#xD;
             subject unable to take oral medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subject has any acute laboratory abnormality at screening, which, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the Investigator, would preclude the subject's participation in the study of an&#xD;
             investigational compound. If subjects are found to have an acute Grade 4 laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality at screening, this test may be repeated once within the 45-day screening&#xD;
             window. Any verified Grade 4 laboratory abnormality would exclude a subject from study&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subject has received treatment with radiation therapy or cytotoxic chemotherapeutic&#xD;
             agents within 28 days prior to Screening, or has an anticipated need for these agents&#xD;
             within the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subjects who require treatment with any contraindicated medications (as outlined in&#xD;
             the SPC) within 14 days of commencement of investigational product, or an anticipated&#xD;
             need during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subject has a history of allergy to any of the treatment products or any excipients&#xD;
             therein.&#xD;
