  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective treatment for a variety of psychiatric&#xD;
      disorders. However, despite continued advances in ECT technique, neurocognitive dysfunction&#xD;
      continues to be a frequent adverse effect. Declarative memory and less so selective memory&#xD;
      are often impaired after an ECT course. Immediate memory, however, is broadly preserved. It&#xD;
      is hypothesized that memory impairments are due to ECT induced disruptions on long term&#xD;
      potentiation as well as in cerebral flux and glutamatergic and cholinergic systems. Different&#xD;
      pharmacological agents for the treatment of ECT induced cognitive dysfunction have been&#xD;
      tried. Agents such as opioids, vasopressin, neuropeptides, cholinergic agents, thyroid&#xD;
      hormone, and stimulants have been used with equivocal results, and no controlled studies&#xD;
      showed clear efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive, painless brain stimulation&#xD;
      treatment that uses direct electrical currents to stimulate specific parts of the brain.&#xD;
      Electrical currents are applied constantly at low intensities (1-2 mA) over a long period,&#xD;
      usually in minutes (5-30 minutes), to achieve changes in cortical excitability by influencing&#xD;
      spontaneous neural activity. There are two types of stimulation with tDCS: anodal and&#xD;
      cathodal stimulation. Anodal stimulation acts to excite neuronal activity while cathodal&#xD;
      stimulation inhibits or reduces neuronal activity. Several studies demonstrated moderate to&#xD;
      strong effect sizes of tDCS in various neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric settings. Majority&#xD;
      of studies show positive effects of tDCS on cognitive functioning among healthy volunteers&#xD;
      and subjects with neurological or psychiatric conditions. Beneficial effects of online&#xD;
      stimulation applied over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex have been reported for&#xD;
      working memory, attention and information processing in depressed patients. To the&#xD;
      investigators' knowledge no studies have evaluated the potential efficacy of tDCS for the&#xD;
      prevention of ECT induced cognitive adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, the investigators propose a double blind, randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      to test the use of tDCS as a strategy to prevent or mitigate the memory impairments&#xD;
      frequently associated with an ECT course.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, random assignment, double blind, parallel group study with an adaptive&#xD;
      design comparing the efficacy of tDCS performed during the course of ECT to that of sham tDCS&#xD;
      in patients with a major depressive episode being treated with ECT. The investigators intend&#xD;
      to recruit patients who are scheduled to receive an acute course of ECT. Patients who are&#xD;
      able and willing to provide written informed consent, and who meet study criteria when&#xD;
      screened, will be randomly assigned on a 1:1 ratio to receive a course of real tDCS or sham&#xD;
      tDCS. Subjects will receive a standard acute course of bifrontal ECT (3X/week) and depressive&#xD;
      symptomatology will be monitored with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-24)&#xD;
      before each treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be change in cognition from baseline to end of study. The&#xD;
      investigators will monitor cognitive changes before and after each ECT treatment, at the end&#xD;
      of the treatment course and two months after the last treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome will be the number of treatments needed to achieve remission. Remission is&#xD;
      defined as two consecutive Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) scores &lt;= 10, and HRSD&#xD;
      total score does not change &gt; 3 points or remains &lt; 6 at the last two consecutive treatments.&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators will collect data on other treatment parameters such as&#xD;
      seizure duration, electroencephalogram (EEG) morphology as well as hemodynamic changes.&#xD;
