      The Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain (MAPP) Research Network&#xD;
      has been established by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases&#xD;
      (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to focus on a broader approach to the&#xD;
      study of Interstitial Cystitis (IC)/ Bladder Pain Syndrome (BPS) in men and women, and&#xD;
      Chronic Prostatitis (CP)/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CPPS) in men, than previously&#xD;
      undertaken. Patients with IC or CP are being recruited for a new study called the &quot;Trans-MAPP&#xD;
      Study of Urologic Chronic Pelvic Pain: Symptom Patterns Study (SPS). This research study will&#xD;
      recruit Control Participants to better understand the symptoms of individuals with some form&#xD;
      of IC or CP. As with many chronic pain disorders, IC and CP are poorly understood, and&#xD;
      treatment is often not helpful. The goal of this study is to better understand how pain is&#xD;
      felt in people with IC or CP and the investigators hope that this study will lead to&#xD;
      improvement in the treatment of IC and CP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urological Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndromes (UCPPS) are characterized by pelvic pain with&#xD;
      concurrent urinary symptoms. Broadly, UCPPS comprise Interstitial Cystitis/Painful Bladder&#xD;
      SyndromeBladder Pain Syndrome (IC/BPS) in men and women, and Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic&#xD;
      Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CP/CPPS) in men. IC is a debilitating bladder disorder characterized by&#xD;
      urinary urgency, frequency, and pain. The presentation of symptoms can be quite variable&#xD;
      among patients, suggesting that IC is a multi-factorial syndrome with several proposed&#xD;
      etiologies, some of which may be interrelated.1 BPS as defined by the International&#xD;
      Continence Society, is &quot;the complaint of suprapubic pain related to bladder filling,&#xD;
      accompanied by other symptoms, such as increased daytime and night-time frequency, in the&#xD;
      absence of proven urinary infection or other obvious pathology.&quot;2 BPS is a clinical&#xD;
      description of disease based on the patient's symptoms, and does not depend on urodynamic or&#xD;
      cystoscopic findings. These symptoms may be related to IC, although diagnostic criteria are&#xD;
      still lacking for this entity, and the relationship between BPS and IC is not clear. After&#xD;
      the initiation phase for the MAPP SPS Study, it became clear that many of the hypotheses&#xD;
      being proposed required well-characterized healthy &quot;normal&quot; controls that lack urologic pain&#xD;
      as well as other study related symptoms/conditions. This second phase is enriched with&#xD;
      pre-defined subgroups and a longer follow-up period which will allow further investigation of&#xD;
      clinical and biologic factors associated with worsening and/or improvement of reported&#xD;
      urinary and non-urinary symptoms.&#xD;

             Culture Result - UCR form). We will keep all specimens and data collected from both&#xD;
             eligible and in-eligible participants unless participant request that his/her data be&#xD;
             destroyed, and not utilized for the study.&#xD;
