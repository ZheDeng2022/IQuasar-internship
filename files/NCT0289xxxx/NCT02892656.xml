      The purpose of this study is to determine the reliability and responsiveness of the Pain&#xD;
      Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ) in a chronic low back pain (CLBP) population referred to&#xD;
      The Danish Rheumatism Associations´ rehabilitation centre Sano Aarhus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a highly prevalent health condition, and the leading cause of&#xD;
      years lived with disability both globally and in Denmark. In the majority of patients with&#xD;
      CLBP, no underlying pathology or cause can be identified and CLBP is acknowledged to be&#xD;
      multifactorial. CLBP is defined by symptoms lasting for a period longer than three months.&#xD;
      The high prevalence of CLBP causes a substantial impact on patients and their families,&#xD;
      communities and health-care systems, as well as a financial burden. Besides pain and&#xD;
      disability people with CLBP often experience psychosocial consequences with signs of anxiety&#xD;
      and depression and effects on social, leisure, and work life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An important component in rehabilitation is documentation of treatment outcomes. This demands&#xD;
      that a change over time can be measured. To determine effect, the measurement tool must&#xD;
      detect real or important change over time. This requires the measurement tool is reliable,&#xD;
      and therefore will show no real or important change in periods where the patient is stable.&#xD;
      If the measurement tool shows real or important change, in periods where there is no change&#xD;
      in the patient state, the results can not be predicted as an effect from an intervention, but&#xD;
      due to uncertainty of measurement tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurement tool is selected by the recommendation of literature and involvement of&#xD;
      clinicians and patients at sano, and examines patient with CLBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is found necessary to determine the reliability and responsiveness of the PSEQ on the CLBP&#xD;
      population referred to Sano Aarhus. Data will be electronically entered in, stored in and&#xD;
      collected from Sanos internal database (SanoBasen).&#xD;

    <description>The PSEQ consists of 10 items, each item is scored on a seven-point Likert scale with responses ranging from 0 (not at all confident) to 6 (completely confident). A total score is calculated by summing the scores of the 10 items yielding a total sum score ranging from 0-60. Higher scores indicate a stronger self-efficacy belief</description>
