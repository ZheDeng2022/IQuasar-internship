      Potential therapy with MACITENTAN in the treatment of Chronic Lung Allograft Dysfunction&#xD;
      (CLAD) after Lung Transplantation. Pilot Study, Double-blind, &quot;ADD-ON Therapy&quot; with&#xD;
      MACITENTAN to &quot;usual standard of care immunosuppressive therapies&quot; after lung transplantation&#xD;
      for established BOS Stages I or II versus a &quot;matched control group&quot; who receive &quot;usual&#xD;
      standard of care immunosuppressive therapies&quot; alone, results in a decrease in the Primary&#xD;
      Endpoint: &quot;rate of decline&quot; in &quot;Forced Expiratory Volume-1 sec (FEV1) versus time&quot; while&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints including: differences in Six minute walk distance (6MWD), BORG Score,&#xD;
      corrected single-breath diffusing capacity (DCO corrected) at time intervals of 1, 3, 6&#xD;
      months on therapy. Specific biomarkers for BOS, including inflammatory chemokines, which are&#xD;
      routinely collected in the context of post-transplant &quot;surveillance&quot; will be analyzed.&#xD;
      Chemokines which our group has previously described in the pathogenesis of the continuum of&#xD;
      &quot;acute-to-chronic lung allograft rejection&quot;, have included both C-C (CCL2, CCL5) and CXC&#xD;
      (CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11) chemokines as determined in bronchial-alveolar lavage (BAL).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary studies employing a &quot;rat tracheal allograft transplant model&quot; have demonstrated&#xD;
      amelioration of the fibrous airway obliteration associated with blockade of the&#xD;
      renin-angiotension and the endothelin system implementing the ERA antagonist, BOSENTAN (100&#xD;
      mg/kg). Clinical studies have indeed demonstrated that the mitogenic and profibrotic peptide,&#xD;
      ET-1, may represent a potential biomarker in clinical BOS. Detection of levels of ET-1 mRNA&#xD;
      were significantly increased in the lung allografts of those with versus those without BOS at&#xD;
      3 and 12 months post-transplantation while ET-1 concentrations were significantly elevated&#xD;
      both in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patients with BOS. Additional&#xD;
      studies have further demonstrated a pronounced inhibitory effect elicited by chronic ET(A)&#xD;
      receptor blockade in the absence of immunosuppressive therapy, on both plasma levels and&#xD;
      transcriptional regulation of inflammatory chemokines in a rat heterotopic heart transplant&#xD;
      model of chronic rejection .&#xD;
&#xD;
      MACITENTAN, a novel, competitive ERA with significantly slower receptor dissociation kinetics&#xD;
      than currently approved ERAs, may represent a renewed hope for patients suffering from&#xD;
      progressive CLAD post-transplantation. The efficacy of MACITENTAN was not realized in the&#xD;
      exploratory Phase II MUSIC Trial for IPF for the primary endpoint measure of forced vital&#xD;
      capacity (FVC), nevertheless, mechanistic disparities in the pathobiology of CLAD versus IPF,&#xD;
      therefore should not preclude a separate therapeutic trial. Further, in vitro treatment with&#xD;
      MACITENTAN and its major metabolite (ACT-132577) decreases alpha smooth muscle actin&#xD;
      elaboration by dermal fibroblasts in systemic sclerosis fibrotic skin lesions, therefore&#xD;
      offering significant promise for potential disease modulation. Most importantly, the MUSIC&#xD;
      Trial has further demonstrated the &quot;clinical safety&quot; of this pharmacologic therapy in 178&#xD;
      patients with IPF with mean drug exposure of approximately 14 months and without statistical&#xD;
      differences in incidence of abnormal liver function studies. Recent pharmacokinetic studies&#xD;
      of MACITENTAN have suggested no &quot;clinically significant&quot; drug-drug interaction with respect&#xD;
      to Cytochrome P4503A4 for concurrent post-transplant immunosuppressive type therapies, such&#xD;
      as cyclosporine, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil; while insignificant interaction with&#xD;
      the frequently implemented &quot;azole-type antibiotics&quot; was also observed.&#xD;
