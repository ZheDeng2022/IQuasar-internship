      This study is designed as a prospective, randomized controlled trial that will compare the&#xD;
      use of the peanut exercise ball in laboring patients compared with no use of the exercise&#xD;
      ball. We hypothesize that use of the peanut ball decreases the incidence of cesarean section.&#xD;

      This study is designed as a prospective, randomized controlled trial that will compare the&#xD;
      use of the peanut exercise ball in laboring patients compared with no use of the exercise&#xD;
      ball. The investigators plan to include all pregnant women over the age of 18 who present to&#xD;
      VCU Labor and Delivery in labor or for induction of labor with a fetus in cephalic&#xD;
      presentation. They will have the peanut shaped exercise ball placed between the maternal legs&#xD;
      in either the supine or upright position during labor. The peanut ball can be seen at this&#xD;
      link, which is similar to the ball the investigators use on Labor and Delivery&#xD;
      (http://www.amazon.com/Isokinetics-Inc-Brand-Peanut-Ball/dp/B0026N2JWG). We use various sizes&#xD;
      of this durable, non-latex exercise ball. There is a small size (for women ,5'3&quot; that is&#xD;
      40inches), medium size for women 5'3&quot; to 5'&quot;7 (50inches) and a large for women &gt;5'7&quot;&#xD;
      (60inches). The length of time using the peanut ball will be quantified by charting in OB&#xD;
      TraceVue software (which is currently standard practice with peanut ball use).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be assigned a number in order starting at 1. Each patient will then be&#xD;
      randomized using a block randomization scheme with pre-assigned envelopes in the labor and&#xD;
      delivery team room starting at number 1. Each participant will have an envelope pulled in&#xD;
      order of their number assignment when admitted to labor and delivery and consent obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria for this study include women with multifetal gestations, fetus in breech&#xD;
      or transverse position, musculoskeletal abnormalities in the mother which might preclude them&#xD;
      from proper positioning on the peanut ball.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective, two-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT) with interim&#xD;
      analyses planned after 50% and 75% of the patients have completed the study. Using nTerim&#xD;
      2.0, 2000 total subjects (1000 per group) will be needed to have a study powered at 80% to&#xD;
      detect a difference in the C-section rate if the treatment and control groups have C-section&#xD;
      rates of 11.25% and 15%, respectively, using a one-sided test at the 0.05 level. The primary&#xD;
      outcome will be the observed incidence of cesarean section delivery in the two populations of&#xD;
      randomized, laboring women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bayesian stopping rules, for expected success and futility, are to be added to this study.&#xD;
      Bayesian stopping rules have advantages over other traditional types of interim analyses.&#xD;
      Specifically, they can be used for Bayesian or frequentist (e.g. traditional) trial designs&#xD;
      without requiring the statistical analysis or study design to be altered. Additionally, the&#xD;
      study is not penalized for additional 'looks' at the data, as is the case in traditional&#xD;
      interim analyses. A drawback of this strategy is that the methods used to analyze the data&#xD;
      (e.g. frequentist and Bayesian) have different interpretations and may not come to the same&#xD;
      conclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan on conducting three interim analyses, after sample sizes of 500, 1000,&#xD;
      and 1500 have been achieved. At each look, the predicted probability of trial success,&#xD;
      assuming the full 2004 subjects are accrued, will be calculated. The predictive probability&#xD;
      is defined as the probability that the unanticipated C-section rate for the Peanut Ball (PB)&#xD;
      group is lower than that of the control (C), as measured assuming the full 2004 subjects are&#xD;
      accrued and conditional on the data obtained from the subjects that the study has already&#xD;
      accrued. If this probability is small (e.g. &lt; 0.10), then the study will stop for futility.&#xD;
      If the predicted probability with the current sample size is large, meaning it is likely that&#xD;
      the Peanut ball group has a lower unanticipated C-section rate, then the study will be&#xD;
      stopped for expected success. Predicted probabilities of 0.95, 0.90, and 0.90 for the interim&#xD;
      analyses at 500, 1000, and 1500 subjects will be used to determine expected success,&#xD;
      respectively. If neither of these conditions are met, the study will continue to accrue&#xD;
      subjects until a maximum of 2004 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The calculation of the predictive probabilities are slightly different for futility and trial&#xD;
      success. For the futility analysis, the posterior distribution of an unanticipated C-section&#xD;
      will be will be specified as a beta distribution with Xig +1 and Nig - Xig +1 degrees of&#xD;
      freedom (Beta(Xig +1, Nig - Xig +1)), where Xig denotes the total number of unanticipated&#xD;
      C-sections for the group g (PB, C) for assessment i (1,2,3) from the total sample size in&#xD;
      each group (Nig). This distribution comes from the commonly used beta-binomial posterior&#xD;
      distribution using and uninformative (uniform) prior. For each treatment group and interim&#xD;
      analysis, an unanticipated C-section rate will be simulated from the respective posterior&#xD;
      distribution (pigj) and, based on this simulated value, a simulated number of additional&#xD;
      unanticipated C-sections will be calculated. This process will repeat itself 10,000 times,&#xD;
      and for each iteration, the total estimated rate of unanticipated C-sections will be&#xD;
      calculated. The posterior probability for futility, P(pi,PB+0.0375&lt;pi,C) after accruing the&#xD;
      total 2004 subjects will be calculated by summing up the instances where pi,PBj+0.0375&lt;pi,Cj,&#xD;
      where pi,gj is the predictive probability of an unanticipated C-section after full enrollment&#xD;
      for simulation j. The offset, 0.0375, is calculated from the hypothesized difference from the&#xD;
      original power analysis (0.15-0.1125=0.0375)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A similar process will be used for efficacy, however, the predictive probability will be&#xD;
      calculated from the inequality P(pi,PB&lt;pi,C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect the data, perform data entry and review charts to ensure&#xD;
      accuracy of information. Medical Record Numbers will be collected with data collection to&#xD;
      ensure that we can adequately review the chart of the patient for data collection.The&#xD;
      investigators will also collect information on mode of delivery (vaginal, operative vaginal,&#xD;
      csection), gravidity, parity, age, bmi, epidural anesthesia (yes/no), induction vs&#xD;
      spontaneous labor, gestational age at delivery, dilation at admission, fetal position at&#xD;
      delivery, birth weight, cord ph, Apgars, dystocia, length of active phase of labor and second&#xD;
      stage of labor.&#xD;
