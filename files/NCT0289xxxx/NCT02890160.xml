    <textblock>
      The FUTURE-II study is a confirmative clinical trial for Sirolimus Target Eluting&#xD;
      Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold (Firesorb) after the feasibility and safety of the device has&#xD;
      been preliminary confirmed in a small-scale First-in-Man clinical trial.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective, multicenter, single-blind, randomized controlled trial in&#xD;
      patients with coronary artery disease caused by up to two de novo native coronary artery&#xD;
      lesions in separate epicardial vessels. The goal is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness&#xD;
      of Firesorb to support the approval of the Chinese Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) for&#xD;
      this product. The Abbott's XIENCE Everolimus-eluting Coronary Stent System is selected as the&#xD;
      control device. 610 subjects will be recruited and divided into queue 1 (n=430) and queue 2&#xD;
      (n=180). All subjects in two queues will be 1:1 randomly assigned to experimental group and&#xD;
      control group. All subjects will undergo clinical follow-up at 1-month, 6-month, 1-year,&#xD;
      2-year, 3-year, 4-year and 5-year post-index procedure. Subjects in queue 1 will undergo&#xD;
      angiographic follow-up at 1-year post-index procedure; of which 3-5 centers will be specified&#xD;
      as a subgroup to complete OCT follow-up (n=80, 40 each in test and control group). Subjects&#xD;
      in queue 2 will undergo angiographic follow-up at 2-year post-index procedure; of which 40&#xD;
      subjects will complete OCT follow-up (20 each in test and control group).&#xD;
