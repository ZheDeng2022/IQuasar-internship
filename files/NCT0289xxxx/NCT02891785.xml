  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Significant barriers to cancer pain management are patient-related. So far,&#xD;
      cancer pain self-management support interventions have only been tested in strictly&#xD;
      controlled settings of randomized controlled trials (RCT) and thus evidence for comparative&#xD;
      effectiveness is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study includes a multicenter cluster RCT with a stepped wedge design and a&#xD;
      qualitative substudy. The aim of the study is to evaluate the implementation of ANtiPain in&#xD;
      clinical practice. The primary patient-related aim is to improve pain interference with daily&#xD;
      activities. Secondary patient-related aims are pain intensity, barriers to pain management,&#xD;
      self-efficacy, and quality of life. Secondary organization-related aims are nurse proficiency&#xD;
      and satisfaction with cancer pain self-management support, participation rates, and&#xD;
      implementation fidelity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria: On 17 wards in 3 hospitals in Vienna adult oncology&#xD;
      patients will be included (n=150 pre-, n=150 post-implementation) if they are admitted to one&#xD;
      of the participating wards, have pain ≥3 (0=no pain to 10=worst imaginable pain) or regular&#xD;
      pain medication, able to understand German, discharged with pain self-management, and give&#xD;
      informed consent. Patients with signs of disorientation that may severely limit pain&#xD;
      self-management will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Pre-implementation, patients receive standard care. Post-implementation,&#xD;
      patients receive ANtiPain which is based on 3 key strategies: information, skills building&#xD;
      and nurse coaching and consists of in-hospital sessions by staff nurses and follow-up phone&#xD;
      calls after discharge. The implementation process will include training of the designated&#xD;
      staff nurses, case discussions, as well as measures to ensure sustainability of the&#xD;
      implementation (e.g., training of clinical nurse specialists).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: Wards are randomized according to the stepped wedge plan. Patients will complete&#xD;
      questionnaires at admission, and 2, 4 and 8 weeks after discharge. Nurse-level data will be&#xD;
      collected before implementation and 1 and 3 months after implementation. Data on ward and&#xD;
      hospital level will be collected at the beginning of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: The statistical analysis will be conducted based on mixed models, with&#xD;
      a random intercept for the respective ward and time as a covariate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative substudy: The qualitative substudy will comprise interviews with head and&#xD;
      intervention nurses about their views of the implementation.&#xD;

      Background Despite highly effective treatment options, adequate pain control is a persistent&#xD;
      problem in oncology patients. As cancer treatment is shifted increasingly towards the&#xD;
      outpatient setting, patients' self-management is vital for successful pain treatment.&#xD;
      ANtiPain (Advanced Nursing Practice cancer pain self-management support) is a cancer pain&#xD;
      self-management support intervention for patients with cancer that is already available and&#xD;
      tested in a German speaking setting. So far, cancer pain self-management support&#xD;
      interventions have only been tested in the rigorously controlled setting of a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) and thus evidence for its comparative effectiveness is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective This study is unique in that it aims to evaluate the implementation of the ANtiPain&#xD;
      intervention in routine clinical practice in view of its effectiveness for patients and&#xD;
      nurses in realistic clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Design, setting and sample In the context of routine quality improvement, AntiPain&#xD;
      will be implemented on designated wards at three hospitals in Vienna. To evaluate the&#xD;
      implementation, an accompanying multicenter cluster randomized trial with a stepped wedge&#xD;
      design will be supplemented with embedded qualitative evaluations. The stepped wedge design&#xD;
      will involve the sequential rollout of the intervention. The order in which ANtiPain will be&#xD;
      implemented on the wards will be determined at random. By the end of the study, all wards&#xD;
      will have implemented the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited on 17 wards. With an effect size of d=.77 and an expected drop-out&#xD;
      rate of 20%, a sample size of 150 patients will be needed before and after implementation to&#xD;
      demonstrate a difference at the 5% level with 90% power. With 17 wards and a study duration&#xD;
      of 15 months, approximately 1.3 patients will be recruited per month on each of the&#xD;
      participating wards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective and specific aims In congruence with the Reach Efficacy Adoption Implementation and&#xD;
      Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework, the implementation of ANtiPain will be evaluated on two&#xD;
      levels: (i) patient-related outcomes (e.g., pain interference with daily activities, pain&#xD;
      intensity, patient related barriers to cancer pain management), and (ii) organization-related&#xD;
      outcomes (e.g., nurses' self-rated perceived proficiency with pain management, application&#xD;
      fidelity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this implementation project is to improve patient-related outcomes. The&#xD;
      primary patient-related outcome will be pain interference with daily activities. Secondary&#xD;
      patient-related outcomes will be pain intensity, patient-related barriers to cancer pain&#xD;
      management, pain-related self-efficacy, and quality of life. The secondary aim is to explore&#xD;
      the participation rate [Reach], to improve nurse-related outcomes [e.g. proficiency and&#xD;
      satisfaction concerning pain self-management support (Adoption and Implementation)], to&#xD;
      achieve high implementation fidelity in the clinical setting [Implementation], to evaluate&#xD;
      the nursing managers' view on the implementation [Adoption], a crude cost and resource&#xD;
      estimation of the implementation [Adoption], to explore how implementation fidelity will&#xD;
      develop over time [Maintenance], and to explore the nursing managers views on maintaining the&#xD;
      intervention in their organization [Maintenance]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation of cancer pain self-management support Before the implementation, patients&#xD;
      receive standard care without structured cancer pain self-management support. After&#xD;
      implementation, patients will receive cancer pain self-management support by trained staff&#xD;
      nurses who follow the ANtiPain protocol. ANtiPain is based on three key strategies: Provision&#xD;
      of information, skills building and nurse coaching. It consists of an in-hospital baseline&#xD;
      one-to-one session before discharge and a telephone follow up according to a structured&#xD;
      clinical algorithm that is based on pain intensity, patient satisfaction with pain management&#xD;
      and patient adherence. The implementation process will include training of the designated&#xD;
      staff nurses, coaching activities based on case discussions on the ward, as well as measures&#xD;
      to ensure sustainability of the implementation (e.g., training of ward managers and clinical&#xD;
      nurse specialists).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables and Measurement Data collection on patient level will include pain interference&#xD;
      with daily activities, pain intensity, and analgesic intake from the Brief Pain Inventory. In&#xD;
      addition, the self-developed item from a previous study will be used to measure pain-related&#xD;
      activity hindrance, by asking patients to rate &quot;The pain hindered me to do things that I&#xD;
      wanted to do today&quot; on a 0 (not at all) to 10 (completely) numeric rating scale.&#xD;
      Patient-related barriers to cancer pain management will be measured with the German short&#xD;
      version of the Barriers Questionnaire II (BQII-G-S); pain-related self-efficacy with the&#xD;
      German version of the Pain Self-efficacy Questionnaire (FESS); HRQoL with two items from the&#xD;
      EORTC-Quality of Life Questionnaire C30, functional status with the German version of the&#xD;
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS); Depression with the Patient&#xD;
      Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2); demographic and clinical data will include age, gender, time&#xD;
      since first cancer diagnosis, time since first pain onset, circadian rhythm of pain, and&#xD;
      analgesic medication, reason for and day of hospitalization as well as the day of discharge.&#xD;
      Full patient self-report data collection will include ~80 items. Because patient burden was a&#xD;
      substantial issue in our last studies, patients who say that they cannot complete all&#xD;
      questionnaires will be offered to complete a short version of the study questionnaires (49&#xD;
      items).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection on nurse level will include 4 questions regarding self-rated proficiency with&#xD;
      cancer pain self-management support and satisfaction with pain management on the ward. In&#xD;
      addition, demographic data will be obtained (e.g., age, time on ward). Data collection on&#xD;
      ward and hospital level will include the medical field, length of stay, and the number of&#xD;
      patients (with cancer-related pain). Standard care will be explored by asking nurses about&#xD;
      their role in cancer pain self-management support before the implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative substudy: The qualitative substudy will comprise interviews with head nurses and&#xD;
      intervention nurses about their views of the implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Wards will be randomized according to the stepped wedge plan. Data collection will&#xD;
      start January 2016. Eligible patients will be recruited by staff nurses who will be supported&#xD;
      by a study assistant. After informed consent patients will be asked to complete&#xD;
      questionnaires at admission (TP0), as well as 2 (TP1), 4 (TP2) and 8 weeks (TP3) after&#xD;
      discharge. Nurse-level data will be collected one week before implementation (TN0) and 1&#xD;
      (TN1) and 3 months after implementation (TN2). Data on ward and hospital level will be&#xD;
      collected by a study assistant at the beginning of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis of the primary outcome (i.e., pain interference with daily&#xD;
      activities) will be conducted based on mixed models, with a random intercept for the&#xD;
      respective ward and time as a covariate to take potential time trends into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki. Within the clusters (wards), patients will be provided with tailored oral and&#xD;
      written informed consent (i.e., pre- and post-implementation). During the informed consent&#xD;
      procedure patients will be informed about the quality improvement project in general. As soon&#xD;
      as the intervention has been implemented in routine clinical practice on the respective ward,&#xD;
      patients will be offered the intervention. Consequently, the informed consent procedure will&#xD;
      not involve consent for the intervention but only for the completion of questionnaires.&#xD;
