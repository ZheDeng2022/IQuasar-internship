      This study will be a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing cold compression to no&#xD;
      intervention immediately prior to and during intrauterine device insertion. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to cold compress or no intervention (standard practice in our clinics). Following&#xD;
      IUD insertion they will complete a validated pain scale survey regarding their pre-procedure&#xD;
      and intra-procedure pain.&#xD;

      This study will be a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing cold compression to no&#xD;
      intervention immediately prior to and during intrauterine device insertion. Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria include all non-pregnant women, 18 years of age or older, presenting to the VCU&#xD;
      Women's Health clinics with desired IUD placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be identified at the time of presentation to the Women's Health Clinics at&#xD;
      Virginia Commonwealth University Health Systems. A provider (physician, nurse practioner, or&#xD;
      nurse midwife) will discuss the study with the subject. After time for consideration and&#xD;
      having had all questions answered the subject will then be consented for the trial. Consent&#xD;
      will be obtained at that time (see attached list of engaged providers). Randomization will be&#xD;
      performed by pulling sequentially numbered opaque envelopes containing computer randomized&#xD;
      individual allocations. This randomization will be carried out by research staff before the&#xD;
      initiation of the study. Information regarding basic demographic data, comorbidities that may&#xD;
      affect patient's perception of pain will be obtained from the subjects' chart. This&#xD;
      information will include: age, race, socioeconomic status, status of practitioner, parity,&#xD;
      BMI, history of prior cervical procedures, history of chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject has elected to participate in study and is randomized to the cold compression&#xD;
      group, she will have a cold compress placed on the abdomen five minutes prior to and&#xD;
      throughout the intrauterine device placement. Visual acuity pain scales have been commonly&#xD;
      used in similar studies to objectively assess procedural pain. In this study, a validated 10&#xD;
      point visual acuity scale will be used. Pain will be assessed pre- and post-procedure. The&#xD;
      post-procedure questions are directed at pain during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparable studies that assess procedural pain considered a 30% reduction in pain to be&#xD;
      significant. Based on these studies we will similarly consider a 30% reduction in pain&#xD;
      between the experimental and control groups to be significant. With a power of 80 and&#xD;
      significance value of p &lt; 0.05, this will require 69 patients in each group (cold compression&#xD;
      versus no-intervention) to obtain an adequate sample size to detect a difference in the&#xD;
      groups. The study was powered for the post-treatment means of the control groups to be 2.8&#xD;
      and 4.0 (respectively), which is a 30% difference, assuming a SD=2.8 and using a two-sample&#xD;
      t-test. Paper copies of written consent and any identifying information will be kept in a&#xD;
      secured, locked file. All data collected will be stored in a password protected computer file&#xD;
      that will be accessible only to the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the difference in patient's perception of pain before and during&#xD;
      intrauterine device insertion. This will be defined based on a pre and post-procedure survey&#xD;
      using a 10-point visual analogue scale. Additionally, nulliparous and multiparous women will&#xD;
      be stratified as previous studies have shown significantly different pain scores reported&#xD;
      between these two subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect the data, perform data entry and review charts to ensure&#xD;
      accuracy of information provided by the inserting physician. Periodic review of the data&#xD;
      entry will be performed to ensure completeness and accuracy.&#xD;
