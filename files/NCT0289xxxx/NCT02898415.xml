    <textblock>
      Liver transplantation (LT) is one of the curative treatment options for patients with HCC&#xD;
      associated to chronic liver disease (cirrhosis). All current international guidelines&#xD;
      recommend LT for HCC only within pre-defined criteria The use of restrictive criteria to&#xD;
      select patients affected by HCC for LT was originally proposed with the Milan criteria. These&#xD;
      criteria were based on pathologic assessment of number and size of the HCC nodules on the&#xD;
      explanted liver. Subsequently, many authors proposed the expansion of such restrictive&#xD;
      criteria (e.g. UCSF, Tumour Volume, Up-To-Seven etc.). All these attempts, based on different&#xD;
      combinations of morphologic parameters, have been defined on the pathologic staging of the&#xD;
      tumor made on the removed liver, namely after LT, once decision on treatment and treatment&#xD;
      itself could not be changed Although post-LT pathology / pre-LT radiology correlation have&#xD;
      improved over time, significant biases still affect clinical assessment of HCC stage and no&#xD;
      reliable protocols has entered clinical practice yet. In addition, robust evidence indicates&#xD;
      that other biological markers of aggressiveness (such as α-Fetoprotein levels and clinical&#xD;
      response to bridge therapies) have to be added when evaluating pre-operative variable&#xD;
      Although many studies have been conducted, prognostic calculators of cancer-specific survival&#xD;
      for HCC patients undergoing an evaluation for LT are not yet available. Such models should be&#xD;
      able to provide survival estimates based on pre-treatment oncologic variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of the study is the definition of a cancer-specific prognostic model based on&#xD;
      pre-operative features (radiologic staging and α-Fetoprotein levels) of a wide population of&#xD;
      patients who underwent LT for HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the competitive risk of cancer-specific mortality and death due to other causes,&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rationale: Liver transplantation (LT) is one of the curative treatment options for patients&#xD;
      with HCC associated to chronic liver disease (cirrhosis). All current international&#xD;
      guidelines recommend LT for HCC only within pre-defined criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of restrictive criteria to select patients affected by HCC for LT was originally&#xD;
      proposed with the Milan criteria. These criteria were based on pathologic assessment of&#xD;
      number and size of the HCC nodules on the explanted liver. Subsequently, many authors&#xD;
      proposed the expansion of such restrictive criteria (e.g. UCSF, Tumour Volume, Up-To-Seven&#xD;
      etc.). All these attempts, based on different combinations of morphologic parameters, have&#xD;
      been defined on the pathologic staging of the tumor made on the removed liver, namely after&#xD;
      LT, once decision on treatment and treatment itself could not be changed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over time, various attempts have also been made to correlate postoperative pathologic&#xD;
      findings of HCC to preoperative clinical staging in order to anticipate decision-making.&#xD;
      Should a reliable conversion algorithm correlating pre-operative staging with post-transplant&#xD;
      prognosis be available a selection of LT candidates based on routine radiologic HCC findings&#xD;
      would optimise survival patient survival and organ resource allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although post-LT pathology / pre-LT radiology correlation have improved over time,&#xD;
      significant biases still affect clinical assessment of HCC stage and no reliable protocols&#xD;
      has entered clinical practice yet. In addition, robust evidence indicates that other&#xD;
      biological markers of aggressiveness (such as α-Fetoprotein levels and clinical response to&#xD;
      bridge therapies) have to be added when evaluating pre-operative variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another important issue to be considered when dealing with LT for HCC is the striking&#xD;
      progress in treating chronic viral infections (HCV and HBV) that has been achieved over the&#xD;
      last few years. Due to the possibility of treating recurrence of viral infections in the&#xD;
      transplanted liver, these conditions do not significantly affect mortality following LT as&#xD;
      they did in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current scenario, the decreasing role of non-oncologic factors in survival of patients&#xD;
      treated by LT for HCC enhances the need to define new prognostic models oriented towards&#xD;
      cancer-specific survival. These models should include, besides conventional morphological&#xD;
      parameters, also the response to bridge therapies delivered in the pre-transplant setting as&#xD;
      well as other biologic markers commonly used in clinical practise such as α-Fetoprotein&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although many studies have been conducted, prognostic calculators of cancer-specific survival&#xD;
      for HCC patients undergoing an evaluation for LT are not yet available. Such models should be&#xD;
      able to provide survival estimates based on pre-treatment oncologic variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A tailored assessment of cancer-specific prognosis is strongly advocated also by regulatory&#xD;
      authorities, to optimize the allocation/distribution criteria of the limited source of&#xD;
      available organs. Therefore, these criteria could be useful in the daily practise of&#xD;
      transplant Centres to define different priority levels within the waiting list for LT, both&#xD;
      for patients with and without HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints and clinical relevance: The main goal of the study is the definition of a&#xD;
      cancer-specific prognostic model based on pre-operative features (radiologic staging and&#xD;
      α-Fetoprotein levels) of a wide population of patients who underwent LT for HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the competitive risk of cancer-specific mortality and death due to other causes,&#xD;
      the investigators aim to redefine the Up-To-Seven criteria, as they were developed on the&#xD;
      base of pathologic staging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints: besides conventional outcome endpoints, the study aims to develop and&#xD;
      validate a prognostic calculator of recurrence rate and cancer-specific survival for HCC&#xD;
      patients undergoing evaluation for LT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prognostic algorithm will be based on the competitive risk analysis of cancer-related&#xD;
      recurrence and survival vs. non-cancer related outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical relevance: the development of an on-line available prognostic calculator based on&#xD;
      pre-operative oncologic factors would provide precise estimates of survival. This could help&#xD;
      in the comparison of patients with different disease stage and comorbidities, by defining&#xD;
      progressive priority levels to be applied to the waiting list for LT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final goal is to provide reliable survival estimates for patients at different disease&#xD;
      stage and therefore with different priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This perspective may have great clinical impact as would allow the definition of different&#xD;
      priority levels for LT in HCC, both to provide a prognosis-oriented treatment for each&#xD;
      patient and to optimise the global outcome of the population of patients eligible for LT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational period: Retrospective analysis of a population of patients who underwent LT for&#xD;
      HCC from January 2000 to December 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population size: The expected number of patients from Italian centres is more than 1000&#xD;
      cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the training set will allow the development of a cancer-specific prognostic model, at&#xD;
      least 300 other cases will have to be added as a further set of external validation,&#xD;
      preferably belonging to an Eastern series (see above).&#xD;
