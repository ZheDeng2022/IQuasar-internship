      Anticoagulant treatment reduces the incidence of death and cardioembolic events in patients&#xD;
      with atrial ﬁbrillation or prosthetic heart valve and the incidence of death and recurrences&#xD;
      in patients with VTE. Warfarin and similar vitamin K antagonists (VKA) have been the standard&#xD;
      therapy for patients with a metallic valve, or bioprosthesis with atrial fibrillation (AF).&#xD;
      The Dabigatran versus Warfarin in Patients with Mechanical Heart Valves (RE-ALIGN) trial&#xD;
      comparing dabigatran etexilate to warfarin was the only randomized controlled study in&#xD;
      patient with mechanical valve prosthesis, but it was terminated prematurely because of an&#xD;
      excess of thromboembolic and bleeding events among patients in the dabigatran group. To date,&#xD;
      novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have shown to be not both safe and or effective for&#xD;
      patients with mechanical valves.&#xD;

      Anticoagulant treatment reduces the incidence of death and cardioembolic events in patients&#xD;
      with atrial ﬁbrillation or prosthetic heart valve and the incidence of death and recurrences&#xD;
      in patients with VTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Warfarin and similar vitamin K antagonists (VKA) have been the standard therapy for patients&#xD;
      with a metallic valve, or bioprosthesis with atrial fibrillation (AF). Warfarin works by&#xD;
      binding to vitamin K epoxide reductase to inhibit vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II,&#xD;
      VII, IX, and X. For all its extensive use, warfarin has many clinical shortcomings, including&#xD;
      variable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties, a narrow therapeutic index range,&#xD;
      and numerous interactions with certain foods and drugs. All of these factors contribute to&#xD;
      the need for frequent coagulation laboratory monitoring and dosage adjustments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even with the appropriate use of therapy, the incidence of thromboembolic events is still&#xD;
      substantial: 1-4% per year. Furthermore, bleeding risk is significant, ranging from 2% to 9%&#xD;
      per year. The VKA's narrow therapeutic index and they have a complex pharmacology, e.g. long&#xD;
      pharmacologic inertia and the common interaction with other drugs. These features make the&#xD;
      management of these drugs a challenge for physicians and their patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Dabigatran versus Warfarin in Patients with Mechanical Heart Valves (RE-ALIGN) trial&#xD;
      comparing dabigatran etexilate to warfarin was the only randomized controlled study in&#xD;
      patient with mechanical valve prosthesis, but it was terminated prematurely because of an&#xD;
      excess of thromboembolic and bleeding events among patients in the dabigatran group. Most&#xD;
      thromboembolic events among patients in the dabigatran group occurred in population A&#xD;
      (patients who had started a study drug within 7 days after valve surgery), with fewer&#xD;
      occurring in population B (patients who had undergone valve implantation more than 3 months&#xD;
      before randomization). Besides, stroke, death and major bleeding occurred only in population&#xD;
      A. In this study, rivaroxaban will be used in patients with mechanical valves and unstable&#xD;
      INR in a before and after designed.&#xD;
