    <textblock>
      Inappropriate antibiotic therapy in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is associated with&#xD;
      increased mortality. The international guidelines recommend using broad spectrum&#xD;
      antimicrobials especially in patients who received previous antimicrobials, with risk factors&#xD;
      of muti-drug resistant (MDR) VAP or after 5 days of mechanical ventilation. Using&#xD;
      broad-spectrum antibiotics for 48h until the results of conventional cultures and&#xD;
      antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) are available, may promote the emergence of&#xD;
      drug-resistant bacteria. Exposure to imipenem, as short as 1 to 3 days, is associated with a&#xD;
      5-fold increase in the risk of imipenem resistance in the gut microbiota of ICU patients&#xD;
      (Armand-Lefevre AAC 2013). Performing AST directly on clinical respiratory samples would&#xD;
      hasten the process by at least 24h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnostic performance of a rapid method combining mass spectrometry and direct AST&#xD;
      [DAST] are previously analyzed, and compared it with the conventional method (mass&#xD;
      spectrometry with conventional AST [CAST]) and its potential impact was assessed on&#xD;
      antimicrobial use in 85 patients (Le DORZE M et al - Clin. Microbiol. Infect. 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results produced by the dast were useable in 85,9% of the cases and the sensitivity and&#xD;
      negative predictive values of DAST were 100% for all antibiotics tested, except gentamicin&#xD;
      (97.1% [95%CI = 93.3-101] and 97.4% [93.7-101], respectively) and amikacin (88.9% [81.7-96.1]&#xD;
      and 96.4% [92.1-100.7], respectively), compared with CAST. Specificity and positive&#xD;
      predictive values ranged from 82.9 (74.2-91.5) to 100%, and from 86.4 (78.5-94.2) to 100%,&#xD;
      respectively. If results had been reported to the clinicians, that DAST would have saved&#xD;
      carbapenem prescription in 17 cases (22%) and would have allowed immediate narrow spectrum&#xD;
      antimicrobials in 35/85 (41.2%) cases. But, the benefit of DAST was based on a simulation and&#xD;
      should be now tested in a randomized fashion. This project is a prospective multicenter&#xD;
      study. The hypothesis is that, DAST compared to CAST, would increase the number of adequate&#xD;
      antimicrobial therapy within 24 hours in case of late VAP (&gt; 5 days under mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation) with Gram negative bacilli (GNB) in IC patients while sparing carbapenems&#xD;
      (imipenem and meropenem). The primary objective is to determine the impact of a strategy&#xD;
      using DAST on the rate of day1 adequate therapy without carbapenems in case of late VAP due&#xD;
      to GNB.&#xD;

      The diagnostic performance of a rapid method combining mass spectrometry and direct AST&#xD;

      antimicrobial use in 85 patients (Le DORZE M et al - ICAAC 2013, and clinical microbiology&#xD;
      and infections submitted).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results produced by the dast were useable in 85,9% of the cases and the sensitivity and&#xD;
      negative predictive values of DAST were 100% for all antibiotics tested, except gentamicin&#xD;

&#xD;
      Hypothesis - DAST as compared to CAST, would increase the number of adequate antimicrobial&#xD;
      therapy within 24 hours in case of late VAP (&gt; 5 days under mechanical ventilation) with Gram&#xD;
      negative bacilli (GNB) in ICUs while sparing carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective - To determine the impact of a strategy using DAST on the rate of day1&#xD;
      adequate therapy while sparing carbapenems in case of late VAP due to GNB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the impact of the DAST strategy compared to CAST on the following outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adequate antimicrobial therapy at Day1 (with or without carbapenem)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  exposure to carbapenems at D14 and D28&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Broad spectrum antibiotic exposure at D14 and D28&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  De-escalation at D1&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  relapses or new VAP at D14 and D28.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the emergence of ESBL producing GNB and / or resistant to broad-spectrum&#xD;
                antibiotics in clinical samples and in the intestinal microbiota at D3, D7, D14 and&#xD;
                D28, or until discharge of the ICU patient&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Changes in respiratory infection and organ failure&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mechanical ventilation exposure between day 1 and 28&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Length of ICU stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In-ICU mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the performance diagnostic of DAST compared to CAST&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To achieve a minimization study of the costs of the DAST strategy compared to the CAST&#xD;
           strategy Experimental scheme and procedures This study is a multicentre, prospective,&#xD;
           parallel-group, open-label trial. After baseline screening, an independent, centralized,&#xD;
           computer-generated randomization sequence will be used to randomly assign patients in a&#xD;
           1:1 ratio to DAST or CAST groups. Random allocation will be stratified by centre;&#xD;
           investigators will be masked to assignment before, but not after, randomization, as per&#xD;
           our open-label design. This system will be password protected and access by the&#xD;
           principal investigator or study coordinator after the patient or surrogate give consent&#xD;
           and has met inclusion criteria. Although treatment assignments were not masked, all&#xD;
           investigators were unaware of aggregate outcomes during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients According to our preliminary study, 76 patients could be enrolled within&#xD;
      one year in 3 ICUs and more than half will receive carbapenems initially. DAST would have&#xD;
      permit to spare carbapenems in 22% of the cases and to avoid inadequate penem use in 5 other&#xD;
      percent of the cases. The expected proportion of adequate antibiotic therapy without&#xD;
      carbapenem is 68%. In all, 68 patients per arm will be necessary to detect a 22% difference&#xD;
      between groups with a power of 90% (pooled variance Z test). The level of significance will&#xD;
      be 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that 15% of DAST will be non-contributive and if 5% patients are lost to&#xD;
      follow up, 90 patients per arm (140 patients overall) need to be enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to previous number in the preliminary study, 180 patients will be enrolled within&#xD;
      18 months of inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusions - 180 patients will be enrolled during a 18 months period In all, 9 investigation&#xD;
      centers are associated to the study. Thus, around 1.1 patient need to be enrolled per month&#xD;
      during 18 month for each center Statistical analyses - Both group will be compared by&#xD;
      Cochrane Mantel HAENTZEL chi square for primary end point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other secondary objectives will require model for longitudinal data, model for censored data&#xD;
      that account for competing events (MDR acquisition, day 28 outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The random unit is the patient. The first episode will be taken into account for the primary&#xD;
      end point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of repeated VAP with GNB, samples will be proceeded according to their random&#xD;
      allocation arms (CAST of DAST) until day 28 or ICU discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected and definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining an appropriate respiratory specimen for Gram stain and conventional culture,&#xD;
      initial antibiotic therapy (day 0) will be given according to the standards of care, in&#xD;
      agreement with international guidelines: Initial Empiric Antibiotic Therapy for patients with&#xD;
      late-Onset Disease or risk factors for MDR pathogens from ATS and IDSA 2005 (table 1-2-3)&#xD;
      avoiding carbapenem whenever possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected :&#xD;
&#xD;
      At admission to the ICU : age, sex, pre-existing comorbidities, previous location before&#xD;
      admission, admission category, reason for admission, SAPS II, the presence and type of organ&#xD;
      dysfunction using the sequential organ-failure assessment (SOFA) score, and use of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between D1 and D3 : Microbiological results of the VAP episode (GNB identification, CAST and&#xD;
      DAST) Between D1 and D28 All infections occuring and the colonization by MDR SOFA score and&#xD;
      type of organ or system failure and CPIS score (D1,2,3,7,14,28) All antibiotics exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequacy of the initial empirical antibiotics regimen for VAP suspected to be due to gram&#xD;
      negative organisms at inclusion will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inadequate antimicrobial treatment was defined as the use of antibiotics to which at least&#xD;
      one cultured isolate was resistant in vitro at day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides the initial respiratory specimen at inclusion, all other microbiological assessments&#xD;
      from specimens taken between day 0 = inclusion and day 14 for will be recorded.&#xD;
      Multidrug-resistant bacteria were defined according to MAGIORAKOS Clin Microbiol infect,&#xD;
      2012. Broad spectrum antimicrobials were defined as antibiotics belonging to ranks 4 to 6&#xD;
      (Piperacillin+Tazobactam, Ticarcillin+Clavulanic Acid 4th generation cephalosporin,&#xD;
      Antipseudomonal 3rd generation cephalosporin, Carbapenems) (Weiss et al, Clin. MICROB.&#xD;
      Infect. 2015). For the purpose of this study, de-escalation was considered if the pivotal&#xD;
      antibiotic was switched for an antibiotic with a narrower spectrum than the empirical&#xD;
      treatment, according to a ranking of molecules from a recent study performed on behalf of the&#xD;
      &quot;&quot;de-escalation&quot;&quot; study (Weiss et al, Clin. MICROB. Infect. 2015)&quot;&#xD;
