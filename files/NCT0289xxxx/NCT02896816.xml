      Study Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease leads to severally impaired motor control. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to better understand and analyze the characteristics of arm muscle activity while doing some&#xD;
      reaching tasks and of leg muscles while walking. This will allow the investigators to improve&#xD;
      understanding of the mechanisms underlying the motor impairments in Parkinson's disease.&#xD;

      More details:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 20 participants with Parkinson's disease and 20 age- and gender-matched healthy&#xD;
      controls will be included in this study. The participants with Parkinson's disease should&#xD;
      have symptoms only on one side of the body, and they should not be taking any dopamine&#xD;
      replacement medication such as levodopa or dopamine agonists. The study will take place at&#xD;
      the Motion Analysis Laboratory of Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Charlestown,&#xD;
      Massachusetts. It will consist of two assessment sessions; one where muscle activity of the&#xD;
      arms as well as movement characteristics will be assessed during a reaching task; and another&#xD;
      where muscle activity of the legs and movement characteristics will be assessed while walking&#xD;
      on a treadmill. Clinical evaluations will also be performed. In addition, individuals with&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease will undergo brain scans at Massachusetts General Hospital to examine&#xD;
      whether there are any relationships between muscle activity and brain function.&#xD;
