    <textblock>
      The determinants associated with severe outcome and death from Escherichia coli bloodstream&#xD;
      infections (BSI) remain poorly understood. The epidemiology of E. coli BSI has recently&#xD;
      changed dramatically with the global emergence of multiresistant strains producing&#xD;
      extended-spectrum ß-lactamases (ESBL). Outcome is worse in case of ESBL-E. coli, which may be&#xD;
      due to the intrinsic virulence of ESBL-E. coli or to a delayed adequate empirical antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy because of multiresistance. Predicting the severity of an infection as soon as the&#xD;
      initial clinical assessment is of major importance to provide the best care, while limiting&#xD;
      unnecessary hospitalizations and costs. Yet, no simple clinical score exists to predict the&#xD;
      severity of E. coli infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a translational approach, the investigators will include during a maximum of one year 500&#xD;
      adults with E. coli BSI hospitalized in 7 hospitals in the Paris area, France. Precise&#xD;
      clinical data will be collected at inclusion and 28 days after inclusion or upon patient's&#xD;
      discharge (if before day 28). The primary endpoint of the study is death from E. coli BSI at&#xD;
      day 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim is to determine risk-factors for death at day 28, including clinical and&#xD;
      bacteriological factors (determined by WGS) in the era of the global emergence of ESBL&#xD;
      producing E. coli. The second aim is to determine virulence characteristics of ESBL strains&#xD;
      both at the genome and phenotypic level thanks to a mouse model of septicaemia, and compare&#xD;
      them to the clinical data. The third aim, will establish and evaluate a simple clinical&#xD;
      severity score (named COLISCORE), in order to help clinician evaluate patients' severity upon&#xD;
      initial clinical evaluation and particularly to detect patients at risk of severe outcome.&#xD;
      The ultimate goal of this work is to have a clinical impact on patients' management, by&#xD;
      understanding the determinants of patient severity due to E. coli BSI in the context of&#xD;
      current major epidemiological changes.&#xD;

      This project will be conducted as a collaboration between the ASSISTANCE PUBLIQUE HOPITAUX DE&#xD;
      PARIS (or Paris teaching hospitals) and the Infection, Antimicrobials, Modelling and&#xD;
      Evolution (IAME) research group, a joint appointment from Paris DIDEROT University, Paris&#xD;
      Nord University and the INSTITUT NATIONAL DE LA SANTE ET DE LA RECHERCHE MEDICALE (INSERM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective multicentric non interventional observational, study, which will&#xD;
      include up to 500 patients from 7 hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Centres:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven hospitals affiliated with the IAME research group and included in the ASSISTANCE&#xD;
      PUBLIQUE HOPITAUX DE PARIS network will participate. The seven hospitals are all tertiary&#xD;
      care teaching hospitals from Paris or the close suburbs, part of the ASSISTANCE PUBLIQUE&#xD;
      HOPITAUX DE PARIS network. They account for a total of 4230 acute-care adult beds. A total of&#xD;
      780 E. coli BSI occurred in these centres in 1 year with 15% of ESBL producing strains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include adult patients hospitalized in one of the seven participating centres&#xD;
      based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed below. A total of 14 clinical&#xD;
      investigators (CI) and microbiology investigators (MI) will be responsible for patients'&#xD;
      inclusion and data collection in each of the 7 study centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two visits will be organised:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: day of the patient's inclusion in the study (=day of the results of the first&#xD;
      positive blood culture)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 : day the patient leaves the hospital or day 28 after Visit 1 if they are still&#xD;
      hospitalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 1, the E. coli strain responsible for the BSI as well as any other positive sample&#xD;
      will be conserved and sent to a central laboratory for full genome sequencing of the E. coli&#xD;
      strains (IAME Laboratory, University Paris DIDEROT). The investigators will analyze the&#xD;
      molecular characteristics of strains using high-throughput sequencing techniques to try to&#xD;
      highlight virulence factors and will compare the results with clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this work is death at day 28 (or visit 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple secondary endpoints will be studied at day 28 including length of hospital stay and&#xD;
      the need for intensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary endpoint the investigators will analyse the risk factors associated to death&#xD;
      at day 28 (yes/no) using logistic regression. The clinical risk factors achieving a P value &lt;&#xD;
      0.10 will then be entered into the multivariate logistic regression model. A backward&#xD;
      selection method will be used to obtain a model in which all clinical risk factors have a P&#xD;
      value &lt; 0.05. Second, the link between death and various bacteriological factors will be&#xD;
      studied using a similar approach. Third, a final multivariate logistic regression will be&#xD;
      performed adding bacterial factors to the final model with clinical risk factors and&#xD;
      performing a backward analysis. The investigators will also perform an exploratory analysis&#xD;
      to study the association between all the E. coli genes and death, in a model adjusted with&#xD;
      the important clinical factors as defined above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use the results from the multivariate analysis to elaborate a clinical&#xD;
      severity score for E. coli BSI, called the COLISCORE. The objective of the COLISCORE is to&#xD;
      predict the patients' severity and outcome upon admission and help the clinician's initial&#xD;
      management decisions. This score should be simple and easy to use at the patients' bedside.&#xD;
