      Rationale: Timely and effective reperfusion by primary percutaneous coronary intervention&#xD;
      (PPCI) is currently the most effective treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (STEMI). However, permanent myocardial injury related to the ischemia and&#xD;
      subsequent reperfusion is observed in the vast majority (88%) of patients and harbours a risk&#xD;
      of heart failure development. Administration of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been shown to&#xD;
      protect the heart from &quot;ischemia reperfusion injury&quot; in various experimental models. Data in&#xD;
      humans suggests that the H2S-releasing agent sodium thiosulfate (STS) can be administered&#xD;
      safely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: to evaluate the efficacy and safety of STS compared to placebo treatment on&#xD;
      myocardial infarct size in patients presenting with STEMI and treated with PCI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: a multicenter, double blind, randomized controlled clinical trial. A total of&#xD;
      380 patients, aged 18 years and above, undergoing primary PCI for a first STEMI and deemed&#xD;
      amenable, by the investigator, to be treated with STS 12.5g intravenously (i.v.) or matched&#xD;
      placebo immediately after arrival at the catheterization laboratory (cath-lab) and a repeated&#xD;
      dose administered 6 hours after the first dose, on top of standard treatment. Primary&#xD;
      endpoint is infarct size as measured with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR-imaging) 4&#xD;
      months after randomization.&#xD;

      Introduction and rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the recent advances in treatment, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) frequently&#xD;
      results in permanent myocardial injury imposing an increased risk for adverse cardiac&#xD;
      remodelling, diminished cardiac function and the development of heart failure. Decreased&#xD;
      cardiac function after PPCI is associated with impaired prognosis. In addition to PPCI,&#xD;
      cornerstones pharmacological treatment of myocardial infarction (MI) includes; (1) treatment&#xD;
      direct against blood coagulation with platelet aggregation inhibitors, (2) cholesterol&#xD;
      lowering treatment with statins; (3) sympathicus inhibition by beta-blocker treatment; and&#xD;
      (4) inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. These therapies were successfully&#xD;
      implemented over the last decades and resulted in substantial improvements of prognosis after&#xD;
      AMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although timely PPCI has a tremendous benefit in AMI, not only ischemia but also reperfusion&#xD;
      itself is considered to cause myocardial injury and cardiomyocyte death. This phenomena is&#xD;
      referred to as &quot;ischemia reperfusion injury&quot; in literature and is caused by the sudden&#xD;
      restoration of blood flow and its accompanying intracellular acidity (pH) change and calcium&#xD;
      overload, cardiomyocyte hypercontracture, myocardial inflammation, oxidative stress&#xD;
      generation and mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening. Reducing ischemia&#xD;
      reperfusion injury is expected to further decrease infarct size, decreasing adverse cardiac&#xD;
      remodelling and improving cardiac function as well as clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect a substantial beneficial effect of H2S in the prevention of ischemia&#xD;
      reperfusion injury. H2S is the third endogenous gaseous transmitter next to carbon monoxide&#xD;
      (CO) and nitric oxide (NO) and is involved as a physiological mediator in several body organ&#xD;
      and tissue processes. H2S is synthesized endogenously by enzymatic and non-enzymatic&#xD;
      pathways. A non-enzymatic pathway is by the reductive reaction with thiosulfate, with&#xD;
      pyruvate acting as a hydrogen donor. Thiosulfate itself acts as an intermediate in the sulfur&#xD;
      metabolism of cysteine and is known as a metabolite of H2S and in that way also able to&#xD;
      produce H2S, especially under hypoxic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2S has been shown to protect from myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury in various&#xD;
      experimental animal models; e.g. it reduces infarct size and apoptosis and attenuates cardiac&#xD;
      function. Inhibition of leukocyte endothelial cell interactions, neutralization of reactive&#xD;
      oxygen species (ROS) and the reduction of apoptotic signalling are the suggested as&#xD;
      additional mechanisms underlying the cardioprotective effect of H2S. H2S has been shown to&#xD;
      attenuate myocardial ischemia reperfusion in cellular, rodents and porcine animal models. H2S&#xD;
      can be safely administered intravenously as STS to humans. STS has been demonstrated to&#xD;
      detoxify cyanide poisoning in 1895 in dogs, is used in humans since 1933 for the treatment of&#xD;
      cyanide intoxication, is used since the eighties for treatment of vascular calcifications in&#xD;
      end-stage renal disease, and is used to prevent toxicity of cisplatin treatment. More&#xD;
      recently, studies have shown STS can delay the progression of coronary artery calcification&#xD;
      in haemodialysis patients. The aim of the GIPS-IV trial is to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of STS compared to placebo treatment on myocardial infarct size in patients presenting&#xD;
      with STEMI undergoing PPCI in a double blind randomized controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GIPS-IV trial is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind trial. A&#xD;
      total of 380 patients presenting with a first STEMI will be included. All patients will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive STS (12.5 mg iv) or matching placebo. Study&#xD;
      medication will be administered twice. The first dose of study medication will be&#xD;
      administered immediately after checking inclusion and exclusion criteria and obtaining verbal&#xD;
      informed consent at the cath-lab. The second dose of study medication will be administered 6&#xD;
      hours later, at the Coronary Care Unit (CCU). The study will take place at the University&#xD;
      Medical Centre of Groningen (UMCG), University Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU) and Treant&#xD;
      Scheper hospital in Emmen, all high-volume centers with experience in care and research of&#xD;
      patients with STEMI. The primary endpoint will be based on infarct size as measured by late&#xD;
      gadolinium enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (LGE CMR)-imaging 4 months after&#xD;
      STEMI, a period in which the remodelling of the heart is expected to be completed. LGE&#xD;
      CMR-imaging is a well-recognized, validated, and highly reproducible technique. Total&#xD;
      follow-up duration of the GIPS-IV trial is 2 years.&#xD;

The EQ-5D-5L has 2 components:&#xD;
There is a descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, unable/extreme problems. The respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking (or placing a cross) in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions.&#xD;
The EQ VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a 20 cm vertical, visual analogue scale with endpoints labelled 'the best health you can imagine' and 'the worst health you can imagine'.&#xD;
