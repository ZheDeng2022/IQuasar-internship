  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (PC) is the third most common cause of cancer death in men. Most patients&#xD;
      with localized PC will be cured with surgery or radiation therapy, but up to 35% of patients&#xD;
      will have their PC return. Whether it has returned locally or distantly determines which type&#xD;
      of treatment they will receive. Current conventional imaging modalities have limitations&#xD;
      particularly at low prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. This study proposes to use&#xD;
      Fluorine-18-2-(3-(1-carboxy-5-[(6-[18F]fluoro-pyridine-3-carbonyl)-amino]-pentyl)-ureido)-pen&#xD;
      tanedioic acid (18F-DCFPyL) Positron Emission Tomography / Computer Tomography (PET/CT) scans&#xD;
      which targets prostate-specific membrane antigens (PSMA) to detect where in the body the PC&#xD;
      has recurred.&#xD;

      This is a prospective single cohort study to evaluate the diagnostic utility of 18F-DCFPyL&#xD;
      PET/CT in detecting sites of recurrent prostate cancer, in patients who have negative or&#xD;
      equivocal findings on conventional imaging. Eligible subjects will undergo a 18F-DCFPyL&#xD;
      PET/CT at the British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) - Vancouver Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      18F-DCFPyL- Each subject will receive an 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scan at the BCCA - Vancouver&#xD;
      Centre, as part of this research study. Each study subject will receive a bolus intravenous&#xD;
      dose of 18F-DCFPyL. The subject will rest in a comfortable chair for 120 minutes and will&#xD;
      then be taken to the PET/CT scanner for images. The PET/CT scan will take approximately three&#xD;
      hours extra of patient time above and beyond the time needed for standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical History Questionnaire- Demographic and medical history data will be collected either&#xD;
      in person before the PET scan appointment or by mail or phone, whichever is the most&#xD;
      convenient to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up assessments- Positive 18F-DCFPyL findings should be investigated and correlated&#xD;
      with other imaging modalities and/or biopsy whenever possible. These additional procedures&#xD;
      are left at the discretion of the referring physician for the clinical management of their&#xD;
      patient, and will not be mandated by the study. The results of such investigations will be&#xD;
      captured during the follow-up period, to verify the accuracy of 18F-DCFPyL findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be requested to either return to the functional imaging department&#xD;
      approximately 24 hours (acceptable range 16-28 hours) after the injection of 18F-DCFPyL or&#xD;
      agree to be contacted by phone. The subjects will be asked if they experienced any&#xD;
      undesirable effects following the administration of 18F-DCFPyL, or in the intervening 24&#xD;
      hours. The local site attending nuclear medicine physician will then make an assessment as to&#xD;
      whether these effects are likely related to 18F-DCFPyL administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive up to three clinical follow-up evaluations at 12, 24 and 36 months&#xD;
      following the 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT exam to assess the presence of recurrence, once presence of&#xD;
      recurrence is confirmed follow-up will be discontinued. The evaluation will include a chart&#xD;
      review of available imaging, laboratory tests, and treatment along with review of any&#xD;
      symptoms. The data required can be obtained from a review of the patient's paper and&#xD;
      electronic charts, supplemented by telephone contact as needed to complete the information.&#xD;
      The treating oncologist will fill out a survey to determine the clinical impact of the&#xD;
      18F-DCFPyL on clinical managements. This will be categorized into 'minor' (change in&#xD;
      treatment site or dose) or 'major' (change in treatment modality).&#xD;

        The purpose of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic utility of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in&#xD;
        identifying sites of prostate cancer recurrence where conventional imaging has been&#xD;
        negative or equivocal. Concordance with histology, imaging or follow up will be assessed.&#xD;
        This study will also assess the clinical impact of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT on patient management.&#xD;
