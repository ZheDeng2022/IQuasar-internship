  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial, based on a split mouth and double-blind design, will evaluate the effects of a&#xD;
      surface sealant on the clinical performance of composite resin class I restorations.&#xD;
      According to eligibility criteria, 10 pairs of upper and lower molars or premolars will be&#xD;
      restored with Esthet X composite resin. For each pair, one surface will be sealed with&#xD;
      Lasting Touch surface sealant. A clinical evaluation will be performed by two experienced&#xD;
      operators using modified USPHS (United States Public Health service) after 5 years after&#xD;
      treatment. Data will be analyzed using the McNemar test (p &lt; 0.05).&#xD;

      The protocol was approved by the Human Ethics Committee (protocol number 133/2010, CAAE&#xD;
      0124.0.224.000.-10), and all patients will sign informed consent forms and complete a&#xD;
      registration form prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eligibility criteria for participation in the study include good oral hygiene, a class I&#xD;
      caries lesion or unsatisfactory restoration in at least two posterior teeth (molar or&#xD;
      premolar), a buccolingual extension, and a signed consent form. The exclusion criteria&#xD;
      includes patients with a proximal caries lesion, the presence of periodontal disease,&#xD;
      symptomatic restored or nonrestored teeth indicating irreversible pulpal pathology, an&#xD;
      abnormal occlusion or the absence of antagonist teeth, exposure of pulpal tissue, and&#xD;
      extended or large cavities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include 10 patients (aged 18 to 45 years) totaling 14 pairs of class I&#xD;
      restorations (molars and premolars). These pairs will be randomly divided into two study&#xD;
      groups, resulting in a split-mouth design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A hybrid resin composite, Esthet X (Dentsply, Caulk, USA) and an etch-and-rinse two-step&#xD;
      adhesive, AdperTM Single Bond (3M, ESPE) will be used for the composite restorations. For&#xD;
      teeth with the surface sealant, they will be covered with Lasting Touch (Dentsply, Caulk,&#xD;
      USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All cavity preparations and restorations will be performed by the same experienced operator,&#xD;
      using rubber dam isolation. Cavity designs will be prepared using a #245 carbide bur (KG&#xD;
      Sorensen, Cotia, SP, Brazil), which will be changed every five preparations. All enamel&#xD;
      bordered cavity margins will be verified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The restorative procedures will be performed using rubber dam isolation. In very deep&#xD;
      cavities, the dentin will be covered with calcium hydroxide (Dycal; Dentsply Ind. e Com.&#xD;
      Ltda., Petrópolis, RJ, Brazil) and resin-modified glass-ionomer cement (Vitrebond, 3M ESPE,&#xD;
      St. Paul, MN, USA). In deep cavities dentin will be covered solely with resin-modified&#xD;
      glass-ionomer cement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enamel and dentin will be etched with 37% phosphoric acid (Scotchbond Etchant; 3M/ESPE,&#xD;
      St. Paul, MN, USA) for 30 s and 15 s, respectively. Then will be rinsed with water spray for&#xD;
      30 s and gently and thoroughly dried with absorbent paper for 10 s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two coats of one-bottle adhesive (Adper TM Single Bond 2, 3M/ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA) will be&#xD;
      applied homogeneously to the surface with a disposable micro-brush. The cavity will be gently&#xD;
      brushed with a faint air jet, allowing solvent evaporation, and light-cured for 10 s with an&#xD;
      LED light (Smart Lite OS, Dentsply Indústria e Comércio Ltda., Rio de Janeiro/RJ - Brasil),&#xD;
      with 1270 mW/cm2 of power density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The class I teeth cavities will be restored with 2 mm increments of composite resin, by using&#xD;
      a steel instrument (XTS Goldstein Flexi-Thin Mini #3, Hu-Friedy, Rio de Janeiro, RJ), and&#xD;
      light-cured for 20 s, with the same light source and power density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The finishing and polishing procedures will be performed after seven days, using fine diamond&#xD;
      and multilaminated burs, followed by a one step polishing system Pogo (Dentsply, Caulk, USA).&#xD;
      These procedures will be performed using a slow-speed hand piece with water spray. The disks,&#xD;
      burs, and points will be discarded after each use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For teeth assigned to the control group (NSS), they will be treated with finishing and&#xD;
      polishing procedures only. Teeth included in SS group will be covered using a nanotechnology&#xD;
      liquid polish system (Lasting Touch, Dentsply Caulk, Milford, DE, USA) applied as per the&#xD;
      manufacturer's directions after finishing and polishing.. For this application, the composite&#xD;
      surface and 1 mm external limit will be etched with a 37% acid phosphoric acid gel for 30 s&#xD;
      and thoroughly rinse. The excess water will be removed with a mild oil free air stream, as&#xD;
      per the manufacturer's instructions. Utilizing a disposable micro brush, a uniform layer of&#xD;
      low-viscosity agent will be applied over the etched area, gently air brushed for 15 s and&#xD;
      light-cured with the same light source.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of the restorations will be rated according to the U.S. Public Health System/Ryge&#xD;
      criteria. Two independent experienced examiners assessed the restorations. Restorations will&#xD;
      bee calibrated according to Cohen's Kappa. Where disagreement occurred during evaluation, a&#xD;
      consensus will be obtained among the examiners. It will be a double-blind evaluation, as&#xD;
      neither examiner nor patients knew the treatment under evaluation. Examinations will be&#xD;
      performed directly using mirror and probe. The evaluations will obtained at baseline (1 to 2&#xD;
      weeks after insertion) and 5 year after treatment. The parameters included will be marginal&#xD;
      discoloration, anatomic form, secondary caries and marginal integrity. Data will be&#xD;
      statistically analyzed using the McNemar's test (p &lt; 0.05).&#xD;
