    <measure>Pathologic Response Based on Miller-Payne Grading System</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>In the Miller-Payne system, the pathologic response is divided into 5 grades based on comparison of tumor cellularity between pre-neoadjuvant core biopsy and definitive surgical specimen as:&#xD;
grade 1: no change or some alteration to individual malignant cells but no reduction in overall cellularity (pNR)&#xD;
grade 2: a minor loss of tumor cells but overall cellularity still high; up to 30% (pPR)&#xD;
grade 3: between an estimated 30% and 90% reduction in tumor cells (pPR)&#xD;
grade 4: a marked disappearance of tumor cells such that only small clusters or widely dispersed individual cells remain (almost pCR); more than 90% loss of tumor cells&#xD;
grade 5: no malignant cells identifiable in sections from the site of the tumor; only vascular fibroelastonic stroma remains often containing macrophages (pCR) (however, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) may be present)</description>

        <title>Pathologic Response Based on Miller-Payne Grading System</title>
        <description>In the Miller-Payne system, the pathologic response is divided into 5 grades based on comparison of tumor cellularity between pre-neoadjuvant core biopsy and definitive surgical specimen as:&#xD;
grade 1: no change or some alteration to individual malignant cells but no reduction in overall cellularity (pNR)&#xD;
grade 2: a minor loss of tumor cells but overall cellularity still high; up to 30% (pPR)&#xD;
grade 3: between an estimated 30% and 90% reduction in tumor cells (pPR)&#xD;
grade 4: a marked disappearance of tumor cells such that only small clusters or widely dispersed individual cells remain (almost pCR); more than 90% loss of tumor cells&#xD;
grade 5: no malignant cells identifiable in sections from the site of the tumor; only vascular fibroelastonic stroma remains often containing macrophages (pCR) (however, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) may be present)</description>
        <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
        <population>For this outcome measure, the one participant who was in the crossover cohort was counted in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy cohort. Three participants in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy cohort were not evaluable for this outcome measure (2 developed metastases prior to completing neoadjuvant therapy and 1 was taken off study after first imaging appointment).</population>
