  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the potential of probiotics on weight management. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that the consumption of 1 capsule of probiotics daily will modulate the&#xD;
      intestinal gut microbiota thereby reducing body weight and fat compared to those who do not&#xD;
      consume probiotics. In addition, a diet supplemented with probiotics can be expected to be&#xD;
      more beneficial than a diet without probiotic supplementation in impacting biomarkers of&#xD;
      obesity-associated disorders including diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      (CVD).&#xD;

      Overweight, obese men and women volunteers aged between 18-65 yrs with BMI greater than or&#xD;
      equal to 25 will be recruited from the Winnipeg (Manitoba, Canada) area to participate in a&#xD;
      two arm crossover, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, free-living intervention&#xD;
      study for 60 days per study period following obtainment of informed consent. Participants&#xD;
      will be informed to maintain their usual diets as well as their physical activity level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining consent, participants will be randomized to receive either 1 capsule&#xD;
      containing probiotics, or 1 capsule of placebo daily for 60 days. Compared with the probiotic&#xD;
      capsules, the placebo contains the same carrier material and is similar in size, shape and&#xD;
      taste.&#xD;
