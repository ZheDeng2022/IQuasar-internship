    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best way to give hyperthermia and high dose&#xD;
      rate radiation therapy in treating patients with prostate cancer that has come back after&#xD;
      prior radiation treatment. Radiation therapy, such as high dose rate brachytherapy, uses&#xD;
      radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. Hyperthermia&#xD;
      therapy may make tumor cells more sensitive to the effects of radiation therapy by heating&#xD;
      them to several degrees above normal body temperature. Giving hyperthermia and high dose rate&#xD;
      radiation therapy may work better in treating patients with recurrent prostate cancer after&#xD;
      radiation.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and feasibility of combined single fraction high dose rate (HDR)&#xD;
      brachytherapy followed immediately by interstitial hyperthermia treatment of radio-recurrent&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess long-term toxicity. II. To provide a preliminary assessment of efficacy. III. To&#xD;
      obtain blood for future analysis of immune response to combined radiation therapy and&#xD;
      hyperthermia.&#xD;
