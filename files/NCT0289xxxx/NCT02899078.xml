  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial studies how well ibrutinib and nivolumab work in treating patients&#xD;
      with previously-treated kidney cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Ibrutinib&#xD;
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to&#xD;
      grow and spread. Giving Ibrutinib and nivolumab may work better in treating patients with&#xD;
      metastatic kidney cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess in a preliminary fashion the feasibility and efficacy of ibrutinib in combination&#xD;
      with nivolumab in patients with previously-treated metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety of the combination of ibrutinib and nivolumab in patients with&#xD;
      previously treated mRCC.&#xD;
