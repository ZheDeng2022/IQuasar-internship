    <textblock>
      This research study is studying palbociclib as a possible treatment for recurrent brain&#xD;
      metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Pfizer, a pharmaceutical company, is supporting this research study by providing the study&#xD;
      drug as well as funding for research activities&#xD;

      -  This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the&#xD;
           safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the&#xD;
           intervention works in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the&#xD;
           intervention is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of palbociclib in recurrent&#xD;
           brain metastases. Palbociclib is being studied for use in the treatment of a broad range&#xD;
           of cancers. This type of drug inhibits cell growth in the cells called cyclin-dependent&#xD;
           kinases which promote tumor cell proliferation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved palbociclib for&#xD;
           participants specific disease but it has been approved for other uses&#xD;

                  metastases are eligible.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of palbociclib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform&#xD;
             her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, and 6 months after completion of palbociclib administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tissue from a prior craniotomy or biopsy for genetic sequencing (at least one FFPE&#xD;
             block or 15 unstained slides). Patients previously assessed for genetic sequencing who&#xD;
             meet requirements of section 9.2.1 do not need to have additional tissue available for&#xD;
             prospective genetic sequencing.&#xD;

             CCND3 or CCNE1 or loss of CDKN2A)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with progressive extracranial disease will not be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable corticosteroids for at least 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy within 2 weeks&#xD;
             (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who&#xD;
             have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 2 weeks&#xD;
             earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving other concurrent chemotherapies or immunotherapies for&#xD;
             their cancer (except for patients who will receive letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane,&#xD;
             tamoxifen, fulvestrant, trastuzumab, bisphosphonates, or ovarian suppression therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Leptomeningeal involvement of cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to palbociclib (including abemaciclib)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants receiving any medications or substances that are moderate or strong&#xD;
             inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A isoenzymes are ineligible. Lists including medications&#xD;
             and substances known or with the potential to interact with the CYP3A isoenzymes are&#xD;
             provided in Appendix C, and can also be found within section 5.4. Because the lists of&#xD;
             these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a&#xD;
             frequently-updated list such as http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx;&#xD;
             medical reference texts such as the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this&#xD;
             information. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will&#xD;
             be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new&#xD;
             medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new&#xD;
             over-the-counter medicine or herbal product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effect of palbociclib on a&#xD;
             developing fetus is unknown. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for&#xD;
             adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             palbociclib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
             palbociclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because&#xD;
             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with palbociclib. In addition, these&#xD;
             participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of drugs that are known to prolong the QT interval (See Appendix C)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to undergo MRI scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  QTc&gt;480 msec (based on the mean value of the triplicate ECGs), family or personal&#xD;
             history of long or short QTc prolongation, or Torsade de Pointes (TdP).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled electrolyte disorders that can compound the effects of QTc-prolonging&#xD;
             drug (eg. hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia&#xD;
