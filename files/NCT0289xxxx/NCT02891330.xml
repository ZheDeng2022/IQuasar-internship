  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The postprandial dumping syndrome is a frequent consequence of Roux-en-Y Gastric ByPass due&#xD;
      to the rapid emptying of the stomach remnant in to the intestinal lumen. Dumping-related&#xD;
      symptoms occur very early after eating (within 30 minutes), are not associated with&#xD;
      concurrent hypoglycemia, and are most prominent in the early postoperative period. This&#xD;
      syndrome very debilitating for the patient can be improved by dietary and nutritional&#xD;
      recommendations. We hypothesize that a personalized approach based on dietary and nutritional&#xD;
      recommendations conducted by a nurse would likely to decrease the frequency of dumping&#xD;
      syndrome and improve the postoperative quality of life of patients in the early postoperative&#xD;
      period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Roux-en-Y Gastric ByPass is considered the gold standard of weight loss surgery and is&#xD;
      the most commonly performed bariatric procedure worldwide.The postprandial dumping syndrome&#xD;
      is a frequent consequence of gastrojejunal anastomosis due to the rapid emptying of the&#xD;
      stomach remnant in to the intestinal lumen. Dumping-related symptoms occur very early after&#xD;
      eating (within 30 minutes), are not associated with concurrent hypoglycemia, and are most&#xD;
      prominent in the early postoperative period. The symptoms of dumping syndrome include nausea,&#xD;
      abdominal cramps, diarrhea, dizzy spells, weakness and cold sweats either with or after&#xD;
      eating.This syndrome very debilitating for the patient can be improved by dietary and&#xD;
      nutritional recommendations. We hypothesize that an individualized approach based on dietary&#xD;
      and nutritional recommendations and monitoring of patients conducted by a nurse in the first&#xD;
      three months after surgery would likely to decrease these problems and improve the&#xD;
      postoperative quality of life of patients.&#xD;
