  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the effects of midodrine and droxidopa, two&#xD;
      medications used for the treatment of orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure on&#xD;
      standing), on the veins of the abdomen of patients with autonomic failure. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, and consists of 2 parts: a screening and 2&#xD;
      testing days. The total length of the study will be about 5 days. About 34 participants will&#xD;
      be screened for the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure or Parkinson disease, and&#xD;
      orthostatic hypotension will be studied in a randomized, double-blind, 2-arm parallel design&#xD;
      to compare the effects of droxidopa and midodrine on stoke volume during head up tilt. A&#xD;
      total of 34 participants will be enrolled in the study (17 patients in each arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Procedures: Potential participants will be screened in the Vanderbilt Autonomic&#xD;
      Dysfunction Center (ADC). Medications affecting blood pressure, blood volume and the&#xD;
      autonomic nervous system such as pressor medications, fludrocortisone and carbidopa will be&#xD;
      withdrawn for at least 5 half-lives before studies. Patients will undergo a complete history&#xD;
      and physical examination, ECG, routine clinical laboratory analyses and a blood pregnancy&#xD;
      test for women with childbearing potential. Autonomic testing including a tilt table testing&#xD;
      and a posture study with plasma catecholamines is then performed to determine if they meet&#xD;
      the inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will then be randomized to the droxidopa or the midodrine treatment&#xD;
      group. All patients will be studied on two separate days, two days apart: one day with the&#xD;
      active drug (droxidopa 300mg PO or midodrine 10mg PO) and one day with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each study day, two tilt table tests will be performed. Patients will be instrumented to&#xD;
      measure blood pressure and heart rate (continuously and intermittently), segmental impedance,&#xD;
      cardiac output (inert gas rebreathing technique and/or impedance cardiography), and venous&#xD;
      capacitance. Baseline measurements will then be taken in the supine position for about 30&#xD;
      minutes, and during head-up tilt for ≤10 minutes at 60 degrees. Supine baseline measurements&#xD;
      will include the estimation of splanchnic venous capacitance. At the end of the head up tilt&#xD;
      (HUT), patients will be asked to rate severity of their orthostatic symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then be placed in the seated position (time 0) and will receive a single oral&#xD;
      dose of either droxidopa 300 mg or placebo, followed two hours later by a single oral dose of&#xD;
      placebo or midodrine 10 mg. On the placebo day, both groups will receive a placebo pill at&#xD;
      time 0 and at 2 hours. After ~3 hours of first drug administration, a second tilt table test&#xD;
      will be performed, and outcome measurements will be repeated while supine and during HUT. The&#xD;
      investigators may apply abdominal compression of 40 mmHg with an inflatable binder at the end&#xD;
      of the second HUT. Outcome measurements will be repeated during 5 minutes of compression.&#xD;
