  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effects of three different rehabilitation training&#xD;
      sessions that combine non-invasive brain stimulation (transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation, tDCS) with arm rehabilitation training (repetitive task-specific practice, RTP)&#xD;
      for individuals with unilateral spatial neglect following stroke. This study is designed to&#xD;
      determine the effects of tDCS + RTP on the excitability in the brain, attention to the&#xD;
      affected side, and arm movement ability.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unilateral neglect (neglect) is common after stroke and is characterized by an inattention to&#xD;
      one side of the body or environment. There is growing evidence that disconnections to&#xD;
      fronto-parietal neural networks in the lesioned hemisphere not only cause neglect, but also&#xD;
      cause these same networks to be hyperexcited in the non-lesioned hemisphere. Individuals with&#xD;
      neglect typically experience motor impairments also since the regions of the brain that&#xD;
      control attention also control movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) when paired with repetitive task-specific&#xD;
      practice (RTP) has the potential to modulate cortical activity (fronto-parietal networks) and&#xD;
      facilitate motor and attentional recovery for individuals with neglect since tDCS can&#xD;
      modulate the excitability of targeted cortical regions. tDCS is a form on non-invasive brain&#xD;
      stimulation and RTP is the gold standard post-stroke motor recovery intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is particularly important investigators examine the effect of RTP + tDCS on cortical&#xD;
      modulation in order to understand the underlying mechanism of the intervention and determine&#xD;
      whether RTP+ tDCS (parietal or primary motor cortex [M1]) promotes greater neural modulation&#xD;
      than RTP alone. Traditionally, electrodes are placed on M1 to facilitate motor recovery and&#xD;
      on the parietal lobe to facilitate attentional recovery, however this intervention is&#xD;
      designed to target each of these impairments (motor, attention) and enhance cortical&#xD;
      modulation of fronto-parietal networks. Therefore, investigators must also determine the&#xD;
      optimal electrode montage and placement for pairing tDCS with RTP for individuals with&#xD;
      neglect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the proposed pilot project is to examine the effects of transcranial direct&#xD;
      current stimulation (tDCS) paired with repetitive task-specific practice (RTP) on modulation&#xD;
      of fronto-parietal network connectivity (measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      [TMS]), motor impairment (measured with kinematic assessment), and attentional impairment&#xD;
      (measured with Behavioral Inattention Test) among individuals with unilateral neglect and&#xD;
      hemiparesis post stroke. This three day cross-over design study will examine the optimal&#xD;
      electrode placement and montage using 3 conditions: (1) tDCS to parietal lobe + RTP (2) tDCS&#xD;
      to primary motor cortex + RTP (3) sham tDCS + RTP.&#xD;
