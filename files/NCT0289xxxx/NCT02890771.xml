  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontal disease is considered as inflammatory, multifactorial, and threshold disease&#xD;
      accompanied by destruction of periodontium and eventually the loss of natural teeth.&#xD;
      Periodontal disease is highly prevalent dental disease especially, in developing and&#xD;
      underdeveloped countries affecting more or less 80% of the population. For the prevention of&#xD;
      this highly prevalent dental affliction, still no effective and practical preventive measures&#xD;
      are available which can reduce its high prevalence rate though, lot of research work is going&#xD;
      on.&#xD;

      Various interceptive and therapeutic modalities are available comprising of non-surgical and&#xD;
      surgical therapies. But, these therapies are not available for everyone, due to various&#xD;
      reasons such as low socio-economic conditions of the majority of the population including&#xD;
      poverty, illiteracy, and malnutrition etc. along with low dentist: population ratio.&#xD;
      Moreover, the availability of a dentist and/or periodontist is limited in rural and remote&#xD;
      areas, whereas the prevalence rate of periodontal disease is comparatively higher in these&#xD;
      areas than that of urban areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Looking to these difficulties, the investigators have to think and explore the beneficial&#xD;
      effects by conducting research work on various home care measures which are being used since&#xD;
      many generations, especially in our country and thus people were/are enjoying the benefits&#xD;
      with almost all or many natural teeth, up to last span of their lives.Though, the scientific&#xD;
      evidences of beneficial effects of home care measures for cleaning and massaging of teeth and&#xD;
      gums, respectively are not yet evident significantly. But, traditional uses of various&#xD;
      dentifrices those are still in practices and thus need scientific attentions. Now, the&#xD;
      investigators are in the evidence based era, especially in the field of medical sciences.&#xD;
      Therefore, the number of research studies should be planned and carried out at various&#xD;
      centres in different parts of the country, to ascertain the beneficial effects of traditional&#xD;
      oral hygiene practices such as: Datoons (Neem, Babool etc), leaves of various plants like&#xD;
      Mango, Charcoal powder, Meswak, salt, Mustard oil with Salt, and Turmeric powder and other&#xD;
      such home care dental cleansing materials. After getting the beneficial&#xD;
      information's/evidences accordingly, the uses of specific traditional materials and methods&#xD;
      for the cleansing of the teeth and massaging of the gums can be advocated. And thus,&#xD;
      specifically the developing and underdeveloped countries may be benefitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Out of various home care dental cleansing materials the Turmeric powder is not only being&#xD;
      used as one of important condiments of our kitchen, and at the same time as a medicinal use&#xD;
      since ages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 'Turmeric' is known for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial, immune&#xD;
      stimulant, antiseptic, anti-carcinogenic, and anti-mutagenic properties [1]. Drake [2] and&#xD;
      Han et al [3], observed anti- microbial activity of Turmeric. Roobal Bahal et al [4] stated&#xD;
      that on use of 2% Turmeric gel, significant reduction in the mean plaque index, gingival&#xD;
      index, sulcus bleeding index, probing pocket depth and significant reduction in trypsin like&#xD;
      enzymatic activity of &quot;Red-Complex&quot; microorganisms. Ruchika Jaswal et al [5] conducted a&#xD;
      pilot study to evaluate and compare the clinical effects of topical subgingival application&#xD;
      of 2% whole turmeric gel and 1% chlorhexidine gel as an adjunct to scaling and root planing&#xD;
      (SRP) in patients suffering from chronic periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very few studies, which can be counted on fingers, have been conducted worldwide in this&#xD;
      direction. Hence, this study is being taken to evaluate the efficacy of whole Turmeric Powder&#xD;
      in Gingival Massaging and as an adjunct to Scaling and Root Planing in Patients with Chronic&#xD;
      Periodontitis.&#xD;
