      This is a study to assess the safety of a new candidate Leishmania vaccine ChAd63-KH in&#xD;
      patients with persistent post kala azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase II trial in patients with PKDL, to assess the safety and compare the humoral&#xD;
      and cellular immune responses generated by the candidate vaccine in patients, and observe any&#xD;
      clinical changes in the disease over a 42 day period following vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Eight adult volunteers will receive 1x10(10)vp and the subsequent eight&#xD;
      volunteers will receive 7.5 x10(10)vp. Adolescents will be vaccinated with either 1x10(10)vp&#xD;
      or 7.5 x10(10)vp, to be determined by evaluation of all available data after DSMB &amp; CTSC&#xD;
      review.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a study to assess the safety of a new candidate Leishmania vaccine ChAd63-KH in&#xD;
      patients with persistent post kala azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). With 95% of cases&#xD;
      occurring in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, the Sudan and Brazil, visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a&#xD;
      disease of the poor. With an estimated 40,000 or more deaths annually, mostly children and&#xD;
      young adults, VL ranks second only to malaria amongst parasitic infections for mortality, and&#xD;
      as measured by DALYs lost, it ranks in the top ten infectious diseases globally. No effective&#xD;
      vaccine has yet been developed for VL / PKDL despite significant research efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have recently completed a successful first-in-human clinical trial of a new&#xD;
      therapeutic vaccine for VL / PKDL (ChAd63-KH). This trial demonstrated safety of ChAd63-KH in&#xD;
      healthy UK adult volunteers and immunogenicity against the two Leishmania antigens on par&#xD;
      with that seen to other vaccine candidate antigens in clinical development for other diseases&#xD;
      (e.g. malaria, HCV, Ebola). Following external peer review of the data generated during&#xD;
      LEISH1, the investigators have been awarded further Wellcome Trust funding to progress this&#xD;
      vaccine into Phase II clinical trials in patients with PKDL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The first eight adult volunteers will receive 1x10(10)vp and, following DSMB&#xD;
      and CTSC review, the subsequent eights adult volunteers will receive 7.5 x10(10)vp. Doses&#xD;
      will be administered at a single time point. Adolescents will be vaccinated with either&#xD;
      1x10(10)vp or 7.5 x10(10)vp, to be determined by evaluation of all available data after DSMB&#xD;
      &amp; CTSC review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the safety of a new candidate Leishmania vaccine ChAd63- KH in patients with&#xD;
           persistent PKDL.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the humoral and cellular immune responses generated by the candidate vaccine&#xD;
           in patients with persistent PKDL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To observe any clinical changes in the cutaneous PKDL disease over a 42 day period&#xD;
           following vaccination.&#xD;
