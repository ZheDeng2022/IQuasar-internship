  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dysregulation of blood pressure (BP), secondary to decentralized autonomic nervous system&#xD;
      (ANS) control of the cardiovascular system, often results in chronic hypotension and&#xD;
      orthostatic hypotension (OH) in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI), particularly in those&#xD;
      with high cord lesions (i.e., above T6). While most hypotensive individuals with chronic SCI&#xD;
      remain asymptomatic and do not complain of symptoms associated with cerebral hypoperfusion,&#xD;
      evidence of reduced resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) has been reported in association with&#xD;
      low systemic BP in the SCI and non-SCI populations. Reduced CBF in hypotensive individuals&#xD;
      may lead to cognitive dysfunction, and we reported significantly impaired memory and&#xD;
      marginally impaired attention processing in hypotensive individuals with SCI compared to a&#xD;
      normotensive SCI cohort. Furthermore, we found that CBF was not increased during cognitive&#xD;
      testing in individuals with SCI, which may contribute to impaired cognitive function compared&#xD;
      to non-SCI controls. Although asymptomatic hypotension may have an adverse impact on&#xD;
      cognitive function and quality of quality of life (QOL) clinical management of this condition&#xD;
      is extremely low. In fact, we reported that while nearly 40% of Veterans with SCI were&#xD;
      hypotensive, less than 1% carried the diagnosis of hypotension or were prescribed an&#xD;
      anti-hypotensive medication. The discrepancy between incidence and treatment of asymptomatic&#xD;
      hypotension in the SCI population may relate to a paucity of treatment options which are&#xD;
      supported by rigorous clinical trials documenting safe and effective use of anti-hypotensive&#xD;
      therapy on BP, CBF and cognitive function. We hypothesize these study medications may&#xD;
      increase systolic blood pressure to the normal range and improve cerebral blood flow&#xD;
      velocity. Results and conclusions will not be removed from the record.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study 1: Subjects will visit the laboratory between 3 and 9 times for 4 hours to determine&#xD;
      the BP response to each dose of the 3 study medications (midodrine, pyridostigmine, and&#xD;
      mirabegron). Upon arrival to the laboratory subjects will be randomized to receive midodrine,&#xD;
      pyridostigmine, or mirabegron. Subjects will remain seated in their wheelchair for the&#xD;
      duration of testing. Instrumentation will be applied by study personnel while subject is&#xD;
      seated quietly, this can take up to 20 minutes. Instrumentation includes placement of 3 ECG&#xD;
      electrodes for continuous HR monitoring and finger and brachial BP cuffs. BP, BR and HR will&#xD;
      be recorded for 5-minutes before medication administration (baseline). After baseline, a&#xD;
      small pill will be given with a glass of water. BP, BR and HR will be monitored for 5-minutes&#xD;
      every 30 minutes for 4 hours after drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2: Twenty will visit the laboratory on 4 occasions to determine the effects of three&#xD;
      anti-hypotensive agents, compared to placebo, on BP, CBFv, and cognitive performance on&#xD;
      selected neuropsychological tests. Upon arrival to the laboratory for every visit subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive midodrine, pyridostigmine, mirabegron, or matching placebo.&#xD;
      Neither the study subject nor the investigator will know which is being administered.&#xD;
      Subjects will remain seated in their wheelchair throughout the duration of the study session&#xD;
      and will be closely monitored by study personnel. Instrumentation will include placement of 3&#xD;
      ECG electrodes for continuous heart rate (HR) monitoring, finger and brachial BP cuffs, and a&#xD;
      Doppler ultrasound probe positioned at the left MCA for continuous CBFv monitoring. Subjects&#xD;
      will remain quietly seated in their wheelchair for 30-minutes after instrumentation for a&#xD;
      5-minute recording of continuous HR, BP, and CBFv (baseline). Prior to the baseline data&#xD;
      collection period, the first battery of cognitive tests will be administered. The study&#xD;
      medication will be administered to the subject along with a glass of water approximately&#xD;
      30-minutes after arrival to the laboratory. There will be a 2 hour break period until the&#xD;
      second cognitive battery begins.&#xD;
