    <textblock>
      In so-called at risk families, the child-parent attachment relationship is more difficult to&#xD;
      set up and this can be a barrier to social and emotional development of young children. To&#xD;
      help parents build and sustain this relationship, and to prevent child development disorders,&#xD;
      many parenting programs have been created, usually with frequent home visits by early&#xD;
      childhood professionals. In France, therapeutic interventions at home are little used and&#xD;
      they are not evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Montpellier, an action of this type has been conducted since 2001 by the &quot;Conseil&#xD;
      Départemental de l'Hérault&quot; in collaboration with the University Hospital of Montpellier&#xD;
      including, in addition to home visits, supervision of professionals: the Appui Parental&#xD;
      Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before extending this action to other areas of Herault, the &quot;Conseil Départemental de&#xD;
      l'Hérault&quot;, the &quot;Abri Languedocien&quot; and the University Hospital of Montpellier are conducting&#xD;
      an assessment to know the effectiveness of the program for families under care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This 3-year multicenter prospective study includes 88 children aged 1 to 20 months from&#xD;
      families meeting vulnerability criteria previously defined, 44 benefiting Appui Parental&#xD;
      program (experimental group) and 44 benefiting a regular support (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A paediatric examination on the basis of the Denver scale, parental questionnaires,&#xD;
      questionnaires to professionals and an a video of infant-parent interactions are used. The&#xD;
      data, collected at baseline and 18 months later, will be compared.&#xD;

      Objective: the main objective of this study is to determine the efficiency of Appui Parental&#xD;
      program by evaluating its impact on the development of children aged from 0 to 3 years. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives are to study the effects of the intervention on: the mother-child&#xD;
      interactions, the degree of therapeutic alliance between parent and professionals, the&#xD;
      parenting skills feeling, perceived social support, anxiety and depression of parents,&#xD;
      frequency of legal interventions (placements, educational measures). An assessment of stress&#xD;
      among professionals involved in the study and evaluation of the therapeutic alliance with&#xD;
      families will also be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the supervision included in&#xD;
      the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Scores on Symptom Check List after 18 months of follow up will be significantly&#xD;
      higher in subjects who benefited the Appui Parental program compared to subjects with&#xD;
      conventional parental support. Similarly, it is expected that other developmental assessments&#xD;
      of children have the best results in the Appui Parental Program group than in the control&#xD;
      group. Finally, it is assumed that the mother-child interactions, the parenting skills&#xD;
      feeling, and the therapeutic alliance between parent and professional are better in the Appui&#xD;
      Parental program than in the control group.&#xD;
