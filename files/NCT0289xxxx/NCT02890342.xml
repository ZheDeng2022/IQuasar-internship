      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People s bodies need to break down food into the chemicals. These chemicals are used for&#xD;
      energy and growth. Some people cannot process all chemicals very well. Too much of some&#xD;
      chemicals can cause diseases. One of these diseases is called propionic acidemia (PA). People&#xD;
      with PA can have problems with growth, learning heart, abdomen, and other organs. Researchers&#xD;
      want to better understand how these problems happen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about propionic acidemia and the genes that might contribute to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People at least 2 years old with PA who can travel to the clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some unaffected family members&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a 3 to 5-day hospital visit every year or every few years. Family&#xD;
      members may have just 1 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the family member visit, they may have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples of blood and urine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions about diet and a food diary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doctors and nurses may do additional studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples of saliva, skin and stool&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluid from a gastronomy tube, if participants have one&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental and eye evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
      A kidney test - a small amount of dye will be injected and blood will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consultations with specialists&#xD;
&#xD;
      A test of calories needed at rest. A clear plastic tent is placed over the participant to&#xD;
      measure breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stable isotope study. Participants will take a nonradioactive substance then blow into a bag.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photos taken of the face and body with underwear on&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound of the abdomen&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hand x-ray&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain scan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have other tests if study doctors recommend them. They will get the results&#xD;
      of standard medical tests and genetic tests.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Propionic acidemia (PA) is one of the most common inborn errors of organic acid metabolism.&#xD;
      Although this disorder is now routinely detected in the immediate neonatal period on the US&#xD;
      newborn screen, clinical outcomes are poor despite timely and aggressive medical&#xD;
      intervention. Worldwide, the incidence of PA varies widely. The estimated live-birth&#xD;
      incidence of PA is 1:243,000 in the US, 1:166,000 in Italy and 1:250,000 in Germany. Affected&#xD;
      patients are medically fragile and can suffer from complications such as failure to thrive,&#xD;
      intellectual disability, basal ganglia strokes, seizures, cardiomyopathy, cardiac&#xD;
      arrhythmias, pancreatitis, impaired gut motility, osteoporosis and hematological&#xD;
      complications. The frequency of these complications in the US patients and their precipitants&#xD;
      remain poorly understood. Furthermore, current treatment outcomes have continued to&#xD;
      demonstrate substantial morbidity and mortality in the patient population. Specific&#xD;
      treatments include dietary modification to reduce propiogenic precursor load, levocarnitine&#xD;
      to facilitate excretion of propionate, and oral antibiotics to suppress propionogenic gut&#xD;
      flora. More recently, solid organ transplantation (liver and/or kidney) has been used to&#xD;
      treat PA patients experiencing frequent and severe episodes of metabolic instability.&#xD;
      However, optimal transplant strategy and post-transplant management have not been delineated.&#xD;
      Several survey-based and retrospective studies describing the natural history of propionic&#xD;
      acidemia have been published in the last decade. While these publications added to our&#xD;
      understanding of the clinical course of this disease, these studies have not systematically&#xD;
      focused on the US population using prospective analysis and reflect largely European&#xD;
      experience, where many developed countries do not routinely screen for PA using newborn&#xD;
      screen. Thus, the benefits of newborn screening on the PA outcomes require further&#xD;
      clarification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under proposed NIH protocol, we will prospectively evaluate patients with propionic acidemia&#xD;
      with special emphasis on the US population. Typical inpatient admissions and outpatient&#xD;
      evaluations will last up to 4-5 days and may involve blood drawing, urine collection, stool&#xD;
      collections, genomic studies, ophthalmological examination, cardiology evaluation,&#xD;
      radiological procedures, brain and cardiac MRI/MRS, dietary assessment and neurobehavioral&#xD;
      evaluation. In some patient s skin biopsies will be pursued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objectives will be to describe the natural history of propionic acidemia in the US&#xD;
      patients by delineating the spectrum of phenotypes and querying for genotype, enzymology,&#xD;
      microbiome, and phenotype correlations. The population will consist of patients previously&#xD;
      evaluated at NIH, physician referrals, and families directed to the study from&#xD;
      clinicaltrials.gov, Organic Acidemia Association and Propionic Acidemia Foundation. Patients&#xD;
      will be evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center or via telehealth platforms supported by NIH.&#xD;
      Outcome measures will largely be descriptive and encompass correlations between clinical,&#xD;
      microbiological, biochemical and molecular parameters.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients 2 years of age or older, of any gender and ethnicity, with propionic acidemia&#xD;
             are eligible to enroll in this protocol. Patients diagnosis will be confirmed based on&#xD;
             biochemical and/or molecular and enzymatic testing. Participants of any gender and&#xD;
             ethnicity over 1 month of age are eligible to enroll remotely for collection of&#xD;
             outside records and natural history data. They will be eligible to enroll in the full&#xD;
             study for in-person evaluation at 2 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unaffected family members over 1 month of age, of any ethnicity or race, may be&#xD;
             included in the study as household controls for microbiome studies and/or for genetic&#xD;
             analysis. Studies in unaffected family members may include collection of medical and&#xD;
             family history; if necessary completion of physical examination; drawing of blood for&#xD;
             research purposes include testing of DNA; collection of stool samples for microbiome&#xD;
             studies; collection of dietary history using pen- and- paper or electronic food diary&#xD;
             and questionnaires; collection of saliva for metabolite and DNA analysis. In some&#xD;
             unaffected family members without a known familial cause of propionic acidemia, exome&#xD;
             sequencing or genome sequencing could be performed. Unaffected family members will not&#xD;
             receive direct benefit from taking part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If a participant becomes pregnant while on study, the participant can remain on study.&#xD;
             The only way to learn more about the critical biological differences in those who&#xD;
             affected with propionic acidemia who are pregnant is to continue to follow pregnant&#xD;
             women on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        However, no tests or procedures that are greater then minimal risk will be performed.&#xD;
        Affected subjects who are pregnant may undergo procedures as part of their clinical care,&#xD;
        including blood draws, genetic studies, and consultations, according to the clinical&#xD;
        judgement of the clinical team. However, pregnant participants will be excluded from&#xD;
        procedures such as organ tissue collection, stable isotope studies, GFR testing, and brain&#xD;
        or cardiac MRI until the pregnancy is concluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy volunteers may be eligible to participate in the study if they are between 12&#xD;
             40 years of age, must meet specific BMI criteria (similar to affected individuals&#xD;
             studied).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with propionic acidemia over 1 month of age, of any gender and ethnicity,&#xD;
             undergoing a transplantation surgery at Children s Hospital of Pittsburgh, are&#xD;
             eligible to participate in the tissue collection arm of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The PI/AI may decline to enroll a patient because of poor metabolic control, lack of a&#xD;
             primary metabolic/genetics physician, and intercurrent infection are exclusion&#xD;
             criteria for this protocol, the likelihood that an acutely ill or poorly controlled&#xD;
             patient will enroll will be minimized.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A subset of participants may be enrolled in the tissue collection part of the study&#xD;
             only (i.e. if they are too sick to travel). We can may also arrange limited remote&#xD;
             consultation with our research team and NIH consultants, the participants referring&#xD;
             physician and the participant/their legal guardian through the telephone or an NIH&#xD;
             supported telehealth platform for participants who are unable to safely travel to NIH.&#xD;
             This would not replace a study visit but would be used when travel isn t possible due&#xD;
             to extenuating circumstances (e.g. pandemic). Participants would be encouraged to&#xD;
             follow-up for a more thorough in-person evaluation when they are able to travel to&#xD;
             NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the healthy volunteers, they will be excluded if they have halitosis, cavities,&#xD;
             dental or gingival problems, respiratory diseases (for example, asthma or recent&#xD;
             history of COVID19), use tobacco products (for example, cigarette smoking or chewing&#xD;
             tobacco), or use electronic nicotine delivery systems (for example, use of&#xD;
             e-cigarettes or vaping devices), as this may interfere with accurate measurement of&#xD;
             their volatile organic compounds. NIH staff and their family members&#xD;
&#xD;
        will be eligible to participate in the healthy volunteer portion of the study.&#xD;
