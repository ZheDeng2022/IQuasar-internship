    <textblock>
      Drug addiction is a chronic, devastating, but treatable disorder, for which there exists a&#xD;
      growing armamentarium of evidence-based interventions, including pharmacotherapies and&#xD;
      psychotherapies. A core principle of drug addiction treatment, however, states that no single&#xD;
      treatment is appropriate for everyone; rather, treatments need to be adjusted based on&#xD;
      patient characteristics and response in order to be maximally effective. Ideally, clinicians&#xD;
      would identify a sequence of interventions that works best across different stages of&#xD;
      addiction treatment, from abstinence initiation to relapse prevention. Adaptive treatment&#xD;
      interventions have been used successfully to inform this sequential clinical decision-making&#xD;
      process. For cocaine use disorders (CUD), the most potent intervention currently available&#xD;
      for initiating abstinence is behavior therapy using contingency management (CM) procedures.&#xD;
      Intensive CM has been shown to produce initial cocaine abstinence rates of 40%, unmatched by&#xD;
      all other forms of behavioral or pharmacological treatment, making it a prototypical&#xD;
      first-line therapy for CUD. Importantly, achievement of initial abstinence predicts future&#xD;
      abstinence. For the clinician, these research findings translate into a straightforward&#xD;
      question: Can the investigators drive CM response rates even higher with targeted adjunctive&#xD;
      interventions?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) will provide the data&#xD;
      needed to answer this question. First, the investigators will determine whether Acceptance&#xD;
      and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in combination with CM increases initial treatment response&#xD;
      rates. The investigators hypothesize that four weeks of treatment with ACT+CM will produce&#xD;
      higher abstinence rates than initial treatment combining standard Drug Counseling with CM&#xD;
      (DC+CM). The hypothesized synergism of ACT+CM on primary treatment mechanisms of experiential&#xD;
      avoidance and reward sensitivity, respectively, will be examined. Second, for patients who do&#xD;
      not respond to initial treatment, the investigators will examine whether dopamine-targeted&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy is an effective augmentation strategy. Specifically, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that continued ACT+CM treatment with modafinil augmentation will be most&#xD;
      effective in promoting abstinence relative to treatment combinations involving continued DC&#xD;
      and/or placebo. Third, for patients who respond to initial treatment, the investigators will&#xD;
      assess the relative benefit of continued treatment with ACT+CM, as compared to DC+CM, to&#xD;
      prevent relapse. ACT emphasizes goal-directed actions based on values that are intrinsically&#xD;
      motivating, and is thereby expected to be a more effective intervention for extending the&#xD;
      duration of abstinence following initial treatment with intensive CM.&#xD;

    <description>ACT will assist cocaine patients to notice internal cravings and triggers, abandon attempts to manage these triggers via active avoidance, suppression or other control-based strategies, and to make commitments to engage in behaviors consistent with chosen values or goals. ACT encourages clients to experience thoughts and feelings from an observer perspective, and helps clients not to believe distressing thoughts and feelings as if those thoughts and feelings are literally true and in need of action. ACT treatment will be based on the ACT therapy manual developed and tested previously.</description>

    <description>The investigators will use the same high-magnitude CM schedule shown previously to be feasible and effective in facilitating initial cocaine abstinence. Subjects will earn vouchers for cocaine-negative urine samples collected at scheduled clinic visits each week. Under an escalating reinforcement schedule, voucher values will begin at $15 and increase by $10 for each consecutive negative urine. Bonus vouchers of $10 will be given for three consecutive negative urines. Provision of a cocaine-positive urine or failure to provide a scheduled sample will result in no vouchers earned and will reset the schedule to the initial value of $15.</description>
