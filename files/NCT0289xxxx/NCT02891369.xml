  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The refractory malignant ascites is a complication of advanced stages of many cancer types.&#xD;
      It is characterized clinically by abdominal pressure sensation, shortness of breath and&#xD;
      pelvic pain. Thus, it contributes to decreased quality of life for these patients in&#xD;
      palliative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional treatment is based on paracentesis of ascites. The progression of the disease&#xD;
      leads to increased production of ascites requiring more frequent paracentesis. Main&#xD;
      therapeutic alternatives are constituted by the controversial use of diuretics and the use of&#xD;
      an antibody inhibiting the activity of the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF):&#xD;
      bevacizumab. Catumaxomab, a monoclonal antibody anti-EpCAM and CD3, developed for the&#xD;
      treatment of refractory malignant ascites showed no sufficient clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VEGF is overexpressed in many tumors. VEGF causes an increase in capillary permeability and&#xD;
      capillary filtration surface generating increased protein extravasation. These phenomena are&#xD;
      responsible for an increase of the volume of ascites product. Thus the use of inhibitors of&#xD;
      VEGF, such as bevacizumab, could reduce the production of ascites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of bevacizumab to decrease the volume of ascites product was demonstrated on&#xD;
      small animals in intraperitoneal administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies in humans are few and the doses used are not consistent from one study to another.&#xD;

      Main objective / secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to describe the population, adverse effects, the volume of&#xD;
      ascites product and time between paracentesis in patients receiving bevacizumab in&#xD;
      intraperitoneal through a refractory malignant ascites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology :&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a retrospective study mono centric and non-interventional. data collected&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Name,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  date of birth,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  dates and numbers injection of bevacizumab doses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  side effects,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  type of cancer, TNM classification,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ascites volume collected during paracentesis prior to the introduction of IP&#xD;
           bevacizumab,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  frequency of paracentesis before the introduction of IP bevacizumab,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ascites volume collected during paracentesis after the introduction of IP bevacizumab,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  frequency after paracentesis after the introduction of IP bevacizumab,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  albumin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of lines of chemotherapy received&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WHO Stadium in each course&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date of death&#xD;
&#xD;
      supports&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data collection from CHIMIO® software DxCare® and non-computerized patient records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Series anonymized patient data on Excel®&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circulation mode and data processing and not opposition patient The anonymous data are&#xD;
      entered on a computer file and centralized within the pharmacy department by the investigator&#xD;
      of the Groupe Hospitalier Saint Joseph Paris, Carole METZ, to be processed locally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the statistical analysis, quantitative variables are expressed by their mean, standard&#xD;
      deviations, their minimum and maximum values as appropriate. The variables will be expressed&#xD;
      in numbers and percentages. Descriptive data analyzes, correlations between the study&#xD;
      variables and more specific tests to determine the prognostic value of variable can be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center retrospective cohort within the GHPSJ. Patients are aware of the&#xD;
      potential use of their data in their files for medical research by information contained in&#xD;
      the handbook of the institution for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The list of patients who received bevacizumab injection is obtained from the CHIMIO®&#xD;
           software.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The data collected is validated by a multidisciplinary way oncologists and pharmacists.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection and analysis of data by the internal pharmacy from computerized patient&#xD;
           records (DxCare®) or not computerized.&#xD;
