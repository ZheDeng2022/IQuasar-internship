      The investigators retrospectively reviewed all radionuclide shuntographic tests using&#xD;
      (99m)technetium-pertechnetate (DTPA) performed between August 2005 and December 2015 in&#xD;
      nuclear medicine department of Far Eastern Memorial Hospital. The results of shuntography&#xD;
      were evaluated visually and qualitatively, and correlated with clinical follow-up. The tests&#xD;
      were interpreted as normal and abnormal, including complete distal obstruction, partial&#xD;
      distal obstruction or miscellaneous. Clinical outcomes within 30 days were defined based on&#xD;
      subsequent need for revision, re-implantation or adjustment of shunt pressure. Then the&#xD;
      investigators calculated the sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value&#xD;
      (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and overall accuracy.&#xD;

      Introduction: Cerebrospinal fluid ventriculoperitoneal (V-P) shunts are often used in the&#xD;
      treatment of hydrocephalus. Complications from shunts are not uncommon and can present with a&#xD;
      variety of signs and symptoms, which could be evaluated by clinical examination and&#xD;
      neuro-imaging. The radionuclide cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt study provides a simple,&#xD;
      effective, and low-radiation-dose method of assessing CSF shunt patency. When a discrepancy&#xD;
      between neurological examination and imaging, additional radionuclide shuntography can be&#xD;
      helpful. The purpose of the study was to analyze in the imaging findings and clinical&#xD;
      interpretation of a variety of shuntography results and to determine the applicability of&#xD;
      shuntography in patients with suspected shunt malfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: The investigators include all radionuclide shuntographic tests using&#xD;
      (99m)technetium-pertechnetate (DTPA) performed between August 2005 and December 2015 in our&#xD;
      department. No complications or discomfort were noted in the examinations. The results of&#xD;
      shuntography were evaluated visually and qualitatively, and correlated with clinical&#xD;
      follow-up. The tests were interpreted as normal and abnormal, including complete distal&#xD;
      obstruction, partial distal obstruction or miscellaneous. Clinical outcomes within 30 days&#xD;
      were defined based on subsequent need for revision, re-implantation or adjustment of shunt&#xD;
      pressure. Then the investigators calculated the sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive&#xD;
      predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and overall accuracy. The&#xD;
      investigators would also determine the correlation with operative findings and assessment of&#xD;
      radionuclide shuntography.&#xD;
