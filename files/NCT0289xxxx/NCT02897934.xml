      Cork University Hospital is a designated cancer centre, under the national Cancer Control&#xD;
      Programme treating in excess of 560 new cases of breast cancer each year. Breast surgery is&#xD;
      performed by five specialist breast surgeons, with patients accessing services from either&#xD;
      the National Cancer Screening Programme (BreastCheck) or via referral from family physicians&#xD;
      to the rapid access symptomatic breast assessment unit. Both acute and persistent pain&#xD;
      following incisional breast surgery is a significant problem. In the past, it has been&#xD;
      reported that up to 50% of women undergoing incisional breast surgery experience significant&#xD;
      pain immediately following surgery. One in three women may develop persistent post surgical&#xD;
      pain lasting greater than 3 months. The use of multimodal analgesic regimen to include&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, paracetamol, low dose opiates and importantly local&#xD;
      anaesthetic techniques have seen a significant improvement in post-operative pain management&#xD;
      following incisional breast surgery. Local anaesthetic techniques such as paravertebral&#xD;
      blockade have become commonplace in the management of pain following major incisional breast&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current budgetary difficulties have brought increased pressures to bear upon the use and&#xD;
      availability of hospital beds. This has resulted in a shift from an inpatient model of care&#xD;
      to a day case model. More than 85% of all breast cancer surgery is performed as day cases&#xD;
      (same day admission/discharge). The remainder of breast cancer surgeries require a same day&#xD;
      admission with variable length of stay post-operatively. Pain is a significant determinant of&#xD;
      length of post operative stay. Patients with moderate to severe pain are less independent,&#xD;
      require assistance with basic care, consume opiate analgesics, suffer opiate-related side&#xD;
      effects, are less compliant with post-operative physiotherapy and consume more healthcare&#xD;
      resources than patients with mild or no pain. Therefore the design and implementation of an&#xD;
      effective pain management strategy for women undergoing major incisional breast surgery is an&#xD;
      essential component to the overall perioperative patient care pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2010, patients undergoing major incisional breast surgery through BreastCheck at Cork&#xD;
      University Hospital have received a multimodal analgesic regimen during and following surgery&#xD;
      which is based upon the use of local anaesthetic continuous wound infiltration (CWI). The&#xD;
      efficacy of CWI following mastectomy has been found to be equivalent to the gold standard&#xD;
      paravertebral block. Similarly, the efficacy of CWI in women undergoing axillary lymph node&#xD;
      dissection has previously been demonstrated. The clinical experience of women undergoing&#xD;
      mastectomy with axillary clearance or sentinel node surgery suggest equivalence between&#xD;
      paravertebral analgesia and CWI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since January 2013, women undergoing major breast cancer surgery at Cork University Hospital&#xD;
      have been enrolled in a prospective cohort study to evaluate the efficacy of an enhanced&#xD;
      perioperative pathway. Elements of this pathway include improved process flow with the&#xD;
      establishment of dedicated preoperative assessment and preadmission clinics, day of surgery&#xD;
      hospital admission and an admission lounge adjacent to the operating theatres, standardised&#xD;
      anaesthesia, analgesia and surgical protocols, goal based immediate post-operative recovery,&#xD;
      early independent ambulation and enteral nutrition, active discharge planning and early&#xD;
      assessment of hospital discharge readiness. Although women following major breast cancer&#xD;
      surgery achieve hospital discharge readiness scores early, the length of hospital stay is&#xD;
      determined by institutional and individual clinician convention, rather than objective&#xD;
      assessment of home readiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parallel to work on the enhanced perioperative pathway, clinicians at Cork University&#xD;
      Hospital have devised APP based technology which will be integrated into the perioperative&#xD;
      pathway. Prior to surgery, the APPs will provide both clinician and user generated&#xD;
      educational material relating to first person perspective on perioperative experiences. In&#xD;
      the post-operative phase, the technology will enable clinicians to monitor and interact with&#xD;
      patients remotely, thereby facilitating early hospital discharge. The technology will also&#xD;
      enable patients to communicate anonymously with each other, generating contemporaneous&#xD;
      communities of recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this work are threefold:&#xD;
&#xD;
      to identify, characterise and manage barriers to safe discharge within 23 hours of major&#xD;
      breast cancer surgery; to evaluate the feasibility of discharging a select cohort of patients&#xD;
      at 23 hours following major breast cancer surgery with indwelling CWI as the mainstay of post&#xD;
      operative analgesia to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of CWI in women discharged within 23&#xD;
      hours of major breast cancer surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analgesic efficacy and safety of CWI in women discharged home within 23 hours of major&#xD;
      breast cancer surgery as assessed by patient reported pain scores 24 and 48 hours discharge,&#xD;
      and surveillance to detect adverse events associated with CWI use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of recovery at 24 &amp; 48 hours (QoR 40) Analgesic Consumption at 24 &amp; 48 hours Wound&#xD;
      drain output at 24 &amp; 48 hours Patient Satisfaction Score&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperatively, patients will be screened at the preassessment clinic and their suitability&#xD;
      for 23 hour discharge will be assessed according to institutional norms. The patients will&#xD;
      receive preoperative, nurse delivered education regarding wound care and wound drain&#xD;
      management. A mutually agreed discharge plan will be designed between the patient and the&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team. The patient will receive their perioperative technology device and&#xD;
      become familiar with the educational and communications functionality contained within.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of surgery patients will be admitted to the operating theatre day of surgery area&#xD;
      (DOSA). In DOSA they will have the opportunity to meet the perioperative team again and ask&#xD;
      any outstanding questions. They will then change into a theatre gown and enter the operating&#xD;
      theatre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This patient cohort will receive standard propofol TIVA (T4 TIVA protocol attached). With&#xD;
      standard monitoring in place (pulse oximetry, electrocardiography, non-invasive arterial&#xD;
      blood pressure and inspired and end- tidal partial pressures of O2 and CO2), patients will&#xD;
      receive preinduction Fentanyl 100mcg and Midazolam 2mg. Entropy processed frontal lobe EEG&#xD;
      monitoring will be attached. Anaesthesia will be induced with propofol target controlled&#xD;
      infusion (Marsh Algorithm; 4-6mcg/ml dose range using 2% Propofol) and the lungs will be&#xD;
      assist ventilated in 65% oxygen/air mixture. Airway and intraoperative fluid management is&#xD;
      entirely at the discretion of the responsible consultant anaesthetist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative analgesia:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive Diclofenac 75mg and Paracetamol 1g during surgery. Administration of&#xD;
      intraoperative morphine up to 0.1mg/kg will be at the discretion of the consultant&#xD;
      anaesthetist. All patients will be given PONV prophylaxis with ondansetron 4mg and&#xD;
      dexamethasone 8mg intraoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wound soakage with 40ml of 0.25% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 adrenaline will be performed by&#xD;
      the surgeon, allowing a minimum of 3 minute soakage time prior to wound closure. Two multiple&#xD;
      port catheters will be placed by the surgeon, one directed towards the chest wound and the&#xD;
      other towards the axillary wound. These catheters will then be connected up to the prefilled&#xD;
      INFUSOR single use pump delivering 5 ml/hr of 0.25% bupivacaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively, all patients will be transferred from theatre to the post anaesthesia care&#xD;
      unit (PACU) where they will remain until PACU discharge criteria are met. In the PACU, if&#xD;
      patients experience pain, 10 ml of 2% Lidocaine will be administered through the catheters in&#xD;
      CWI in the first instance. Morphine 2mg IV PRN may be administered as rescue analgesia if&#xD;
      required thereafter. Patients may be administered additional antiemetics (Ondansetron) in the&#xD;
      PACU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following transfer to the ward, all patients will receive a standard analgesic regimen of&#xD;
      Diclofenac sodium, 75 mg PO 12 hourly/ PRN and Paracetamol, 1 g PO/PR, 6 hourly /PRN, and&#xD;
      Oxycodone (Oxynorm) 10mg 4 hourly /PRN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While in hospital, data in relation to patient recovery, pain and complications will be&#xD;
      recorded using Cork University Hospital's perioperative pathway clinical data sheet.&#xD;
      Following discharge, postoperative data will be collected using a bespoke android app&#xD;
      specifically designed to capture outcome measures on the first and second post operative&#xD;
      days. The app gathers anonymised data in relation to pain (slide-rule page analogous to the&#xD;
      visual analogue score), quality of recovery (QoR40 Score), wound drain output in millilitres&#xD;
      and patient satisfaction on a likert-type scale. Data will be collected following discharge&#xD;
      on the first and second postoperative days. Participants will be encouraged to provide&#xD;
      free-text feedback in relation to their healthcare experience. Any adverse events will be&#xD;
      monitored, recorded and treated appropriately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary data with respect to the primary and secondary endpoints will be presented. Where&#xD;
      appropriate, 95% confidence intervals will be calculated.&#xD;
