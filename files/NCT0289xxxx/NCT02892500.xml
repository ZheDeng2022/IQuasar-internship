      This study evaluates the use of corticosteroids acutely as an adjuvant treatment of the high&#xD;
      ankle sprain. Subjects will receive either a corticosteroid or a local anesthetic injection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The term &quot;high ankle sprain&quot; refers to injury to the syndesmotic ligaments of the ankle. It&#xD;
      has become a much more common injury comprising up to 24.6% of all ankle sprains , with an&#xD;
      incidence of 2.4 per 1000 athlete exposures. These can present a significant therapeutic&#xD;
      challenge for the sports physician and typically result in a prolonged morbidity and delayed&#xD;
      return to activity. The literature shows a lack of information for definitive care of these&#xD;
      athletes. Typical recovery for the high ankle sprain is almost twice as long as the more&#xD;
      common lateral ankle inversion sprain with a mean time to return to play of 45 days. There is&#xD;
      also a higher incidence of residual chronic pain comparing high ankle sprains to an isolated&#xD;
      lateral ankle sprain. The current standard for treatment of this injury has been to depend on&#xD;
      symptomatic treatment with an initial phase of rest and protected splinting. This is followed&#xD;
      by the use of NSAID's with a graduated rehabilitation program to reduce swelling, improve&#xD;
      range of motion, and regain strength and proprioception of the ankle. This is followed by&#xD;
      protective taping or bracing and return to activities as tolerated. Inflammation is one of&#xD;
      the body's first reactions to injury. Release of damaged cells and tissue debris occurs upon&#xD;
      injury. These expelled particles act as antigens to stimulate a nonspecific immune response&#xD;
      and to cause the proliferation of leukocytes. Local blood flow increases to transport the&#xD;
      polymorphonuclear leukocytes, macrophages, and plasma proteins to the injured area. A&#xD;
      redistribution of arteriolar flow produces stasis and hypoxia at the injury site. The&#xD;
      resulting infiltration of tissues by the leukocytes, plasma proteins, and fluid causes the&#xD;
      redness, swelling, and pain that are characteristic of inflammation. Initially, the&#xD;
      inflammatory reaction serves several important purposes. The influx of leukocytes facilitates&#xD;
      the process of phagocytosis and the removal of damaged cells and other particulate matter.&#xD;
      Pain and tenderness remind the patient to protect the injured area; however, the inflammatory&#xD;
      reaction eventually becomes counterproductive. The mechanism of corticosteroid action&#xD;
      includes a reduction of the inflammatory reaction by limiting the capillary dilatation and&#xD;
      permeability of the vascular structures. These compounds restrict the accumulation of&#xD;
      polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages and reduce the release of vasoactive kinins.&#xD;
      They also inhibit the release of destructive enzymes that attack the injury debris and&#xD;
      destroy normal tissue indiscriminately. Additionally, new research suggests that&#xD;
      corticosteroids may inhibit the release of arachidonic acid from phospholipids, thereby&#xD;
      reducing the formation of prostaglandins, which contribute to the inflammatory process. There&#xD;
      are no previous prospective, randomized studies that look at utilization of corticosteroids&#xD;
      in treatment of the high ankle sprain. Only anecdotal information is available in simple case&#xD;
      reports for treatment. There was one study looking at treatment with platelet rich plasma&#xD;
      injection which demonstrated shorter return to play times and less long term residual pain.&#xD;
