  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide proof-of-concept that directional stimulation and&#xD;
      directional recording, in an intraoperative setting, is perceivable in a subject. The tests&#xD;
      will be performed using a dedicated intraoperative lead connected to an external&#xD;
      neuro-recorder/stimulator, during a deep brain stimulation implantation surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Deep brain stimulation (DBS) technique involves implanting electrodes using a stereotactic&#xD;
      method and connecting them to a pulse generator to deliver a current in localized areas in&#xD;
      the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimum location for DBS electrodes is determined by pre-operative brain imaging, often&#xD;
      combined with an intraoperative microelectrode recording/stimulating (MER) sequence. Current&#xD;
      MER practice involves inserting micro-recording/stimulating electrodes into guide tubes in&#xD;
      the brain and lowering them towards the target, performing recordings at selected steps. The&#xD;
      recordings differ based on the types of neuronal structures they are passing through.Based on&#xD;
      the recordings, some promising locations are further discriminated by stimulation using&#xD;
      macro-electrodes, and the target for final lead placement is chosen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The spiderSTN lead (Aleva Neurotherapeutics SA, Switzerland) is capable of recording and&#xD;
      stimulating from both its inner and outer surface, allowing the user to steer the direction&#xD;
      of stimulation during the target location phase. This will allow the neurosurgeon greater&#xD;
      flexibility in investigating the balance between therapeutic benefits and stimulation-induced&#xD;
      side effects at a given location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This feasibility study is designed to explore the effect of directional stimulation and the&#xD;
      ability to differentiate between stimulation induced side effects at a given location, during&#xD;
      the DBS surgery. It will be proposed to patients who suffer from Parkinson disease (PD) or&#xD;
      essential tremor (ET) and for whom DBS is indicated according to standard criteria at the&#xD;
      hospital. It will be restricted to a limited number of patients (10), sufficient to assess&#xD;
      the recording and stimulating capacity of the spiderSTN device. The patient undergoes the&#xD;
      normal DBS surgery until the position for the final lead has been chosen. Then the spiderSTN&#xD;
      test phase takes place. Once test phase is completed, the conventional DBS surgery resumes.&#xD;
