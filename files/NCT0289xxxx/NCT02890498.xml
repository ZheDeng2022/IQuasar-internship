      Retrospective analysis of vaginal microbiota in the post-operative course of patient operated&#xD;
      for genital prolapse with vaginal mesh with or without mesh related complication&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose to collect vaginal specimens to obtain exfoliated mucosal cells from women who had&#xD;
      vaginal mesh implantation for POP complicated by mesh erosion into the vagina (cases).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to recruit women who will receive exactly the same clinical investigations (outlined&#xD;
      below), follow up and management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples from patients without complications after mesh surgery will be used as controls since&#xD;
      there are ethical difficulties in obtaining cold-cup swabs from 'normal' women and cystoscopy&#xD;
      for conditions other than OAB or USI in premenopausal women is rare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both cases and controls will be identified by the urogynaecology team based on surgical&#xD;
      outcome reports and follow-up documentation. Cases and controls will be invited to&#xD;
      participate by the research team. Relevant members of the research team (Dr Nikolaus&#xD;
      Veit-Rubin, Pr Renaud DeTayrac, and Mr Vikram Khullar) have extensive experience in&#xD;
      urogynaecological investigation and pelvic floor assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cases and controls will be provided with an information leaflet about the study and will be&#xD;
      asked to sign informed consent for the biopsies and a high vaginal swab will be taken.&#xD;
      Consent will be taken either a trained member of the urogynaecology team. All participants&#xD;
      will complete the 'P-QoL Questionnaire&quot; for symptoms relative to POP. Clinical assessment&#xD;
      will include a comprehensive relevant past medical history, calculation of BMI, urinalysis,&#xD;
      standardized POP-Q Quantification and abdominal examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specimens collected to be analysed will be a high vaginal swab following fully informed&#xD;
      written consent. The specimens of Vaginal swab will be processed to extract and purify the&#xD;
      DNA and then the exact bacterial genomic make up will be sequenced and analysed to identify&#xD;
      the exact species of bacteria within the samples. Further detailed protocol of the mentioned&#xD;
      procedures is outlined in the attached protocol.&#xD;
