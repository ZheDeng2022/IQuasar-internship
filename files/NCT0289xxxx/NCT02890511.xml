      A study of DHP107, a novel oral paclitaxel formulation, to determine maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      and recommended dose for phase II trial in patients with advanced solid cancer and explore&#xD;
      efficacy of DHP107 in patients with gastric cancer&#xD;

      1. Primary objective To determine the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended dose for&#xD;
           phase 2 clinical trial for the repeated administration of DHP107 (oral paclitaxel) on&#xD;
           advanced solid cancer patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To identify the dose limiting toxicity and the safety (toxicity) of DHP107&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To evaluate the efficacy (tumor response rate) of DHP107&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To assess pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of DHP107&#xD;

    <description>Phase I (determining MTD) The patients diagnosed with either advanced or metastatic solid cancers were enrolled. The administered dose was escalated in a step-wise manner by an increment of 2 x 50 mg/m2 at each dose level. Three patients were treated for toxicity evaluation for each dose level.&#xD;
Phase IIa (efficacy evaluation) The safety and efficacy of the corresponding dose was investigated more closely by increasing the patient number to 6 or more patients in the dose tentatively determined as recommended dose for phase IIa clinical trial.</description>
