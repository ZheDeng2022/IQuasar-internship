  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wound complications after sarcoma resection are frequent and potentially devastating problem.&#xD;
      The burden of surgical wound complications in the lower extremity after preoperative external&#xD;
      beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for soft tissue sarcoma is estimated at 43%. A noninvasive&#xD;
      method of predicting complications would be extremely beneficial. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the relationship between preoperative skin oxygenation and wound outcomes in a&#xD;
      multi-center prospective analysis. This information could lead to a change in practice&#xD;
      regarding surgical timing and adjunctive interventions to improve wound healing outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that there are 11,400 new cases of soft tissue sarcoma diagnosed in the&#xD;
      United States annually. Most high-grade sarcomas, and other selected low or intermediate&#xD;
      grade sarcomas, are treated with a limb salvage surgical resection in conjunction with&#xD;
      external beam radiation to optimize local control. The current preference of most practicing&#xD;
      orthopaedic/surgical oncologists and radiation oncologists is to implement the radiation&#xD;
      treatments prior to surgery to diminish the total radiation dose and field size, thereby&#xD;
      optimizing long-term functional results of the salvaged limb. While there are clear&#xD;
      advantages of preoperative radiation, there are well-demonstrated negative consequences with&#xD;
      regard to healing of the surgical wound. Currently there are no reliable clinical criteria to&#xD;
      aid physicians in determining an individual patient's risk of developing a postoperative&#xD;
      wound complication. This fact, combined with the rarity of the sarcoma diagnosis, has&#xD;
      prevented improvement in wound outcomes in sarcoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is designed to close this critical gap in knowledge. The investigators propose&#xD;
      utilizing a preoperative measurement of transcutaneous oxygen (Tc02) at the proposed incision&#xD;
      to classify patients into high- and low-risk categories for development of wound&#xD;
      complications after resection. Measurement of preoperative TcO2 represents a novel&#xD;
      application of a simple, noninvasive method by which to assess skin oxygenation. Given the&#xD;
      results of an already completed pilot investigation (Nystrom 2016), the investigators believe&#xD;
      that this important clinical problem is well suited for a prospective, multi-disciplinary,&#xD;
      multi-institutional investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A successful project would result in an enhanced ability to identify wounds at risk prior to&#xD;
      surgery and allow for additional investigation into perioperative interventions (delay of&#xD;
      surgery until recovery of oxygenation, increasing suture duration, judicious use of muscle&#xD;
      flaps and skin grafts, postoperative hyperbaric oxygen, or treatment with incisional wound&#xD;
      vacuum-assisted closure) that may mitigate this significant adverse outcome.&#xD;
