  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is 5th leading cause of cancer-related death in Korea. It has a dismal&#xD;
      prognosis with very low 5-year survival rate, about 5%. Only 10% of pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      patients is diagnosed in operable status. So, most of patients could not be treated with&#xD;
      curative resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) is defined by defined as surgically unresectable&#xD;
      due to vascular encasement (e.g. celiac trunk or superior mesenteric artery) by tumor, but&#xD;
      have no evidence of distant metastases. In LAPC patients, systemic chemotherapy with/without&#xD;
      radiotherapy was used as a standard therapy, but therapeutic response was very poor. Only&#xD;
      less than 30% of patients showed treatment response, and median survival of LAPC patient was&#xD;
      only 9 months. Thus, more effective treatment modality is needed for LAPC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a soft tissue ablation technique using ultra short but&#xD;
      strong electrical fields to create permanent and hence lethal nanopores in the cell membrane,&#xD;
      to disrupt the cellular homeostasis. IRE does not cause thermally induced necrosis and has&#xD;
      tissue selectivity, so adjacent tissue or vascular structures can be preserved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several clinical trials using IRE were performed to liver, kidney or lung cancer patients. We&#xD;
      will operate IRE procedure to LAPC patients who were previously received standard therapy but&#xD;
      showed no response, using NanoKnife IRE device. We will investigate treatment response and&#xD;
      safety of IRE.&#xD;

    <description>IRE is operated to tumor under laparotomy or CT-guided percutaneous approach. Unipolar (19G) or bipolar (16G) electrode probe is inserted to around tumor. After insertion of probe, short duration (70-90„é≤) of electric current (25~45A) is generated by IRE device (NanoKnife IRE device, AngioDynamics, Queens bury, New York). It is possible to obtain a three-dimensional ablation zone using multiple electrode. IRE can cause apoptosis of tumor cells, without adjacent tissue damage.</description>
