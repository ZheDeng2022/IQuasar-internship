      Primary Objectives: To assess the antitumor activity (proportion of objective response by&#xD;
      RECIST 1.1 criteria) of pembrolizumab with objective tumor response in patients with&#xD;
      persistent, recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer harboring an ultra-mutated or&#xD;
      hyper-mutated (MMR gene-defective) phenotype identified by next generation sequencing (NGS)&#xD;
      and comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP). To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab as assessed by CTCAE in patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic&#xD;
      endometrial carcinoma. Secondary Objective(s): To estimate the duration of progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have had prior therapy with nivolumab, pembrolizumab or with an&#xD;
             anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or any other antibody or drug&#xD;
             specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or immune check point pathways.&#xD;

             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would&#xD;
             limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who are pregnant or nursing. The effects of pembrolizumab on the developing&#xD;
             human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP)&#xD;
             must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. WOCBP&#xD;
             should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks after the last dose of&#xD;
             investigational drug. WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             (minimum sensitivity 25 IV/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the&#xD;
             start ofpembrolizumab. Women must not be breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or&#xD;
             surgically sterile or have undergone definitive radiation) do not require&#xD;
             contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with known brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases are excluded unless&#xD;
             the following conditions are met: Metastases have been treated and there is no&#xD;
             evidence of progression by CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) prior to the&#xD;
             first dose of pembrolizumab administration). There must also be no requirement for&#xD;
             immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg/day prednisone&#xD;
             equivalents) for at least 1 week prior to study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients should be excluded if they have known history of testing positive for human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).&#xD;
             Patients should be excluded if they have a positive test for hepatitis B virus surface&#xD;
             antigen (HBV sAg) or hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV antibody) indicating&#xD;
             acute or chronic infection (e.g., HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that might&#xD;
             recur, which may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive treatment&#xD;
             including systemic corticosteroids, should be excluded. These include but are not&#xD;
             limited to patients with a history of immune related neurologic disease, multiple&#xD;
             sclerosis, autoimmune (demyelinating) neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, myasthenia&#xD;
             gravis; systemic autoimmune disease such as SLE, connective tissue diseases,&#xD;
             scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease (IRB), Crohn's, ulcerative colitis, hepatitis;&#xD;
             and patients with a history of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson&#xD;
             syndrome, or phospholipid syndrome should be excluded because of the risk of&#xD;
             recurrence or exacerbation of disease. Patient with vitiligo, endocrine deficiencies&#xD;
             including thyroiditis managed with replacement hormones including physiologic&#xD;
             corticosteroids are eligible. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other&#xD;
             arthropathies, Sjogren's syndrome and psoriasis controlled with topical medication and&#xD;
             patients with positive serology, such as antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-thyroid&#xD;
             antibodies should be evaluated for the presence of target organ involvement and&#xD;
             potential need for systemic treatment but should otherwise be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
             NOTE: Patients are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes&#xD;
             mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone&#xD;
             replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to&#xD;
             recur in the absence of an external trigger (precipitating event).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with&#xD;
             either corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other&#xD;
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or&#xD;
             topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses &lt;10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are&#xD;
             permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease. Patients are permitted to use&#xD;
             topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids (with&#xD;
             minimal systemic absorption). Physiologic replacement doses of systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroids are permitted, even if &lt;10 mg/day prednisone equivalents. A brief&#xD;
             course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for&#xD;
             treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction&#xD;
             caused by contact allergen) is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients who have had evidence of active or acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal&#xD;
             abscess, abdominal/pelvic fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, GI obstruction and/or&#xD;

             carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone&#xD;
             potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer) unless disease free for a&#xD;
             minimum of 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current&#xD;
             pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Has an active infection requiring intravenous systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Has not recovered from adverse events to &lt;Grade 1 or prior treatment level due to a&#xD;
             previously administered agent. Subjects with Grade &lt;2 neuropathy or alopecia of any&#xD;

&#xD;
         19. Has a known additional malignancy that progressed or required active treatment within&#xD;
             the last five years. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous&#xD;

             cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive children within the projected&#xD;
             duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through 120&#xD;
             days after the last dose of trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Patients should not have used investigational agents or device within 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             first dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:&#xD;
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and&#xD;
