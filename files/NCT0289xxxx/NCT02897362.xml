      This study seeks to characterize sleep physiology in adolescents with and without Attention&#xD;
      deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and its relationship to differential neurocognitive and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes within these groups.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This project will involve recruitment of 30 adolescents with ADHD and a control group of 30&#xD;
      healthy adolescents without psychiatric diagnoses. Participants will participate in 3 phases:&#xD;
      Screening visit, Washout/In-Home Sleep Study, and Neurocognitive Assessment visit. To ensure&#xD;
      consistency in sleep schedules, the three nights of the sleep study will occur on weeknights&#xD;
      during the school year. The neurocognitive assessment will occur during the afternoon&#xD;
      following the final night of sleep assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 2-hour screening visit will be conducted at the Duke ADHD Clinic at 2608 Erwin Road,&#xD;
      Pavilion East, Suite 300, Durham, NC 27705. During the screening visit, participants will&#xD;
      undergo screening to evaluate eligibility for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will enter the 48-hour Washout from stimulant medication (if&#xD;
      applicable) and/or a 7-day washout from melatonin (if applicable). Following this washout,&#xD;
      subjects will enter a 3-night Sleep Study Phase (At Home). Subjects not taking stimulant&#xD;
      medication or melatonin will initiate 3 consecutive nights of ambulatory (in-home) PSG&#xD;
      recording, beginning on the a Monday evening within 4 weeks of the screening visit. Subjects&#xD;
      will be instructed to maintain usual sleep routines/behaviors for all study nights. In&#xD;
      addition, subjects will be asked to complete a &quot;sleep diary&quot; each morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If subject is currently taking stimulant medication, they will be instructed to initiate a&#xD;
      48-hour washout period. If subject is currently taking melatonin, they will be instructed to&#xD;
      initiate a 7-day washout period. Subjects will be instructed to discuss this option with&#xD;
      their prescribing physician prior to initiating the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to return for a three hour neurocognitive assessment on the afternoon&#xD;
      directly following the final night of the sleep study. In order to reduce interference with&#xD;
      school attendance, this visit will be scheduled in the afternoon. Subjects will take breaks&#xD;
      throughout the assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will restart their ADHD medications on the morning following the neurocognitive&#xD;
      assessment (if applicable).&#xD;
