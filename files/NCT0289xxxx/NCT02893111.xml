  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders (NMOSD) is characterized by the pathogenic anti-AQP4&#xD;
      antibody, which can be produced by specific plasma cells. The patients who are not responsive&#xD;
      to rituximab treatment may be due to the presence of short-lived and long-lived plasma cells.&#xD;
      Previous studies confirmed that the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade®, approved for&#xD;
      therapy of multiple myeloma) eliminated both plasmablasts and plasma cells by activation of&#xD;
      the terminal unfolded protein response. Treatment with bortezomib may help deplete plasma&#xD;
      cells producing auto-antibodies. Therefore, the rationale for using bortezomib in NMOSD is in&#xD;
      that bortezomib may help eliminate autoreactive plasma cells and reduce anti-AQP4 antibodies&#xD;
      titers. It is noted that bortezomib may protect astrocytes from NFκB-dependent inflammatory&#xD;
      damage in early events in NMOSD pathogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the drug bortezomib contributes to reduce the&#xD;
      average relapsing rates (ARRs) and alleviate neurological disability in NMOSD patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown in some scientific studies that the the antibody marker specific for&#xD;
      neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD), known as AQP4-IgG, causes inflammation in&#xD;
      brain tissues by activating NF-κB pathway. Bortezomib has already been shown to be effective&#xD;
      in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of bortezomib as add-on therapy to&#xD;
      oral steroids,azathioprine or others for treatment of relapsing NMOSD, which have not reduced&#xD;
      average relapsing rate (ARR) effectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary (most important) objectives of this study are to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether bortezomib reduces relapse frequency in patients with relapsing NMO. The number of&#xD;
      attacks during the one year treatment period will be compared to the number of attacks that&#xD;
      occurred prior to initiation of bortezomib treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety profile of bortezomib in patients with NMO. Whether bortezomib maintains or&#xD;
      improves walking, visual function and quality of life as measured by a variety of established&#xD;
      disability scales. We will also assess the severity of an individual attack and the degree of&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on our preliminary investigations we may evaluate patient cerebrospinal fluid in&#xD;
      the laboratory to see how effective eculizumab is at getting into the cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
      from the blood stream, and to see if the drug reverses the biological effects of the NMO-IgG&#xD;
      antibody.&#xD;
