  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the current study, advanced positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and&#xD;
      positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance (PET/MR) imaging methods will be used to&#xD;
      validate our hypothesis that melanoma patients receiving Dual-Immune Checkpoint Blockade&#xD;
      (DICB) therapy, who ultimately achieve clinical benefit, will have an increase, or &quot;FLARE&quot;,&#xD;
      in tumor FLT and/or FDG uptake from baseline, as seen after cycle#1 of treatment, and that&#xD;
      after 2 cycles of treatment responders will have a decline in FLT and FDG uptake, in&#xD;
      comparison to the patients classified as &quot;non-responders&quot;. In addition, alterations in tumor&#xD;
      apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (DW/MRI) will be evaluated, expecting after cycle#1: transient reductions in ADC due to&#xD;
      lymphocyte proliferation, increased cellularity and restriction of water movement in&#xD;
      responding patients, with these patients tumors having increased ADC at 2 cycles into therapy&#xD;
      associated with tumor necrosis. This study will evaluate rather early PET imaging with FLT&#xD;
      and FDG is a useful imaging biomarker of response to DICB.&#xD;

    <description>-Baseline, Week 3 (between days 14-20), Week 6 (between days 35-41)&#xD;
FDG-PET/CT - Patients required to fast for at least 4 hours prior to FDG administration. Roughly 60 minutes prior to PET/CT imaging, FDG will be administered via IV bolus injection. A CT will be performed immediately before PET imaging. Whole body PET imaging will be performed for a total of about 30 minutes.&#xD;
FLT-PET/CT - Patients required to fast for at least 4 hours prior to FLT administration. Roughly 80 minutes prior to PET/CT imaging, FLT will be administered via IV bolus injection. A CT will be performed immediately before PET imaging. Whole body PET imaging will be performed for a total of about 30 minutes.&#xD;
PET/MR - A limited whole body scan performed immediately following PET/CT imaging when possible. Should be performed at least once at each time-point. This scan will be of a more limited area and be performed for no more than 30 minutes.</description>

             field. Radio-frequency (RF) fields in MR can also cause severe heating of pacemaker&#xD;
             lead tips. Steel aneurysm clips are prone to torque in the strong MR field which can&#xD;
             displace the clips and may damage the vessel, resulting in hemorrhage, and/or death.&#xD;
