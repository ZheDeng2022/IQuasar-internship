  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of low back pain among persons with unilateral lower limb amputation is&#xD;
      significantly higher than the rate experienced by the general public. Chronic pain, including&#xD;
      low back pain, limits functional independence and negatively impacts quality of life. As&#xD;
      such, this project will investigate the role of a biomechanical casual pathway in the&#xD;
      development of low back pain; to do this, the investigators will explore the relationship&#xD;
      between the adopted neuromuscular patterns post-amputation to perform activities of daily&#xD;
      living and the risk of developing spinal tissue damage.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the higher prevalence of low back pain (LBP) among persons with unilateral lower limb&#xD;
      amputation (ULLA) compared to able-bodied individuals, relatively little is known about the&#xD;
      fundamental mechanisms underlying this condition. This research represents a first step&#xD;
      toward investigating lower back biomechanics using advanced computational modeling techniques&#xD;
      to inform the future design of effective interventions for LBP. Specifically, the impact of&#xD;
      trunk neuromuscular patterns adopted by persons with ULLA while performing activities of&#xD;
      daily living on spinal loads and the risk of spinal tissue damage will be investigated. This&#xD;
      will be achieved via secondary biomechanical analyses of a large set of high-quality&#xD;
      kinematics data obtained from individuals with and without ULLA performing the following&#xD;
      tasks: 1) walking at self-selected and controlled speeds, 2) sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit,&#xD;
      and 3) stairs-up and stairs-down. The central hypothesis is that, compared to able-bodied&#xD;
      individuals, trunk movement strategies adopted by persons with ULLA to cope with physical&#xD;
      demands of common daily activities are associated with a complex pattern of internal muscle&#xD;
      forces that result in larger loads on the spine and a higher probability for spinal tissue&#xD;
      damage. Investigators' dataset draws from the Biomechanics Laboratory at Walter Reed National&#xD;
      Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) which has unprecedented access to a large population of&#xD;
      service members with ULLA. Using this unique database, investigators will implement their&#xD;
      novel finite element modeling approach to estimate the internal muscle forces (i.e., adopted&#xD;
      neuromuscular patterns) needed to perform daily physical activities on the basis of&#xD;
      satisfying equilibrium and stability across the entire lumbar spine. Completion of this&#xD;
      project will enable the investigators to determine differences in muscle recruitment, as well&#xD;
      as the resultant effects on spinal loads and the risk of spinal tissue damage, between&#xD;
      persons with and without ULLA. Hence, this pilot project is expected to establish the initial&#xD;
      groundwork for future research involving the design of highly specific interventions aimed at&#xD;
      trunk neuromuscular behaviors during post-amputation rehabilitation to lessen adverse effects&#xD;
      on lower back biomechanics and the potential for LBP.&#xD;

        This project involves secondary analyses of existing data and so will not include a subject&#xD;
        recruitment process. Kinematics data collected at Walter Reed National Military Medical&#xD;
        Center will be used for estimation of internal muscle forces and the resultant spinal loads&#xD;
        and the probability of spinal tissue damage during several basic activities of daily living&#xD;
        using a computational model of the lower back. Following an initial assessment, the&#xD;
        investigators estimate the following available sample sizes for each activity of daily&#xD;
        living: (transfemoral-TFA, transtibial-TTA, and Controls-CTL ) 1) level ground walking at&#xD;
        four different speeds (nTFA= 57, nTTA= 53, nCTL= 32), 2) sitting-to-standing and&#xD;
        standing-to-sitting (nTFA= 29, nTTA= 20, nCTL= 15), and 3) stair ascending and descending&#xD;
        tasks (nTFA= 18, nTTA= 20, nCTL= 15).&#xD;
