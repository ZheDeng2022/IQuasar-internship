  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to quantify the radiation exposure from diagnostic testing and&#xD;
      surgical treatment during routine endourologic procedures for symptomatic urolithiasis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Routine endourologic procedures will be performed at the Childrens Hospital of Pittsburgh by&#xD;
      one of the investigators listed on this study. Fluoroscopic radiation exposure during these&#xD;
      procedures is used to guide the surgical devices that are used to treat the stones. The&#xD;
      investigators will be measuring the radiation effective skin dose by two methods. First, the&#xD;
      investigators will place two &quot;Microdot&quot; thermal leak detectors (TLD) on the patient. These&#xD;
      devices which are the size and thickness of a dime will be within plastic bags taped to the&#xD;
      patients body within the central focus of the fluoroscopy image. At the completion of the&#xD;
      procedure the TLD's will be transferred to the Radiation Safety Office in Oakland to be read&#xD;
      and the dose recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, a flat chamber that is integral with all fluoroscopy machines used at Children's&#xD;
      Hospital will measure the dose-area product (DAP) for each case which will allow us to&#xD;
      calculate the effective dose. This device is a component of the colimeter on the arm of the&#xD;
      x-ray machine used for fluoroscopy. It measures the radiation that is returned to the x-ray&#xD;
      machine and calculates the dose delivered to the patient by comparing the amount delivered to&#xD;
      the patient to the amount returned to the machine. Its use is automatic when any x-rays are&#xD;
      delivered and does not involve any manipulation of the patient or alteration of normal&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No additional procedures or change in duration is necessary for this study&#xD;
