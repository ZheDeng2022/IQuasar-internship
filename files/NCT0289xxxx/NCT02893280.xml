      ACSSLAP is the first island wide audit project in Sri Lanka on ACS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute coronary syndrome is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the world. Even&#xD;
      though up-to-date epidemiological data are not available, as per the institutional level&#xD;
      experiences this is not differ much in the local settings. Having a free health care system,&#xD;
      government of Sri Lanka has to allocate billions of funds and resources from the annual&#xD;
      budget for the maintenance of health care system. Being a developing nation this is a&#xD;
      considerable burden to the economy of the country. However, prioritization during resource&#xD;
      allocation will prevent mal-distribution of limited resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health care system in Sri Lanka should deliver free as well as quality care to the nation.&#xD;
      However, lack of updated guidelines in Sri Lanka for the management for acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome (ACS) is a drawback. American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the European Heart&#xD;
      Association (EHA) have developed evidence based and most up to date guidelines to standardize&#xD;
      clinical practices in the management of ACS. It is recommended to adhere to local or&#xD;
      International guidelines to deliver optimal and quality care to ACS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Sri Lanka, no audits have been conducted in the health sector in relation to patient&#xD;
      management practices in the past. Even though institutional level audits have been carried&#xD;
      out time to time for the purpose of allocating medicines and other diagnostic resources,&#xD;
      island wide large scale audits have not been carried out. Therefore, conducting an audit on&#xD;
      health recourse allocation and patient management clinical practices has become a high&#xD;
      priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators selected ACS as the most important clinical discipline to conduct an audit&#xD;
      based on the institutional level data. This audit is included as a well-designed set of&#xD;
      clinical criteria derived from the Myocardial Ischemia National Audit Project (MINAP) in UK,&#xD;
      SNAPSHOT ACS study in Australia and New Zealand, American College of Cardiology and European&#xD;
      Health Association guidelines. These criteria have been extensively reviewed by a panel of&#xD;
      cardiologists and physicians to customize it according to the local requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will be Coordinated by the Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine,&#xD;
      University of Colombo in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Heart Association, Ceylon College&#xD;
      of Physicians and will be carried out through the Quality and safety Unit of the Ministry of&#xD;
      Health, Sri Lanka. Funding is sought from the Ministry of Health&#xD;

        This audit will be conducted representing the hierarchy of health care delivery system&#xD;
        representing tertiary units, teaching hospitals, district general hospitals up to base&#xD;
        hospital level where at least a physician is available. Sample size will be considered&#xD;
        based on the number of admissions to each hospital. Minimum number from each hospital will&#xD;
        be 30. This number was selected as according to International Network on Rational Use of&#xD;
        Drugs (INRUD) guidelines of the World Health Organization, a minimum of 30 prescriptions&#xD;
        are recommended from each unit and a minimum of 20 units when auditing prescription data to&#xD;
        give a minimum of 600 prescription encounters.&#xD;
