    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, double-blind, randomized trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity&#xD;
      of two heterologous and two homologous prime-boost regimens using MVA-BN(R)-Filo and&#xD;
      Ad26.ZEBOV administered in different sequences at Days 1 and 29 in healthy adult subjects&#xD;
      aged 18 - 45 years. The study will evaluate the 'omics (transcriptomics, proteomics,&#xD;
      lipidomics, metabolomics), antibodies for immunogenicity, CMI, ADCC, and plasmablast&#xD;
      responses to MVA-BN(R)-Filo and Ad26.ZEBOV vaccines. The primary objectives of this study&#xD;
      are: 1) To assess the safety and reactogenicity of each study group. 2) To assess responses&#xD;
      to the study vaccination by study group after the first, second and third dose by&#xD;
      transcriptomics. 3) To assess the peak antibody response to the study vaccination by study&#xD;
      group to filovirus antigens.&#xD;

      of two heterologous and two homologous prime-boost regimens using MVA-BN(R)-Filo and&#xD;
      Ad26.ZEBOV administered in different sequences at Days 1 and 29 in healthy adult subjects&#xD;
      aged 18 - 45 years. The two heterologous prime-boost groups will also receive MVA-BN(R)-Filo&#xD;
      at day 366. Sixty subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1 to one of four study groups (15 per&#xD;
      group). Subjects and study staff will be blinded to a subject's study vaccine assignment&#xD;
      within study vaccination schedule (e.g., enrollment into Group 1 or 4 versus 2 or 3 will be&#xD;
      known). The study will evaluate the 'omics (transcriptomics, proteomics, lipidomics,&#xD;
      metabolomics), antibodies for immunogenicity, CMI, ADCC, and plasmablast responses to&#xD;
      MVA-BN(R)-Filo and Ad26.ZEBOV vaccines. The primary objectives of this study are: 1) To&#xD;
      assess the safety and reactogenicity of each study group. 2) To assess responses to the study&#xD;
      vaccination by study group after the first, second and third dose by transcriptomics. 3) To&#xD;
      assess the peak antibody response to the study vaccination by study group to filovirus&#xD;
      antigens. Secondary objectives are: 1) To assess antigen-specific cell-mediated immune (CMI)&#xD;
      responses to the study vaccination by study group. 2) To assess antibody-dependent&#xD;
      cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) responses to the study vaccination by study group.&#xD;

                            laboratories and if the subject is otherwise eligible. The ECG does not&#xD;
                            need to be repeated as it is not a safety laboratory and unlikely to&#xD;
                            change without clinical event in this age group of volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
                        10. Female subject is pregnant or breast-feeding, or planning to become&#xD;

                        12. Any clinically significant acute or chronic medical condition* that, in&#xD;
                            the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
                              -  E.g., history of seizure disorders, autoimmune disease,&#xD;
                                 immunodeficiency, any spleen disease, active malignancy, active&#xD;

                       subject may rest for 10 minutes in a quiet room, and then blood pressure&#xD;
                       and/or heart rate may be re-measured. Repeated vital signs may be used to&#xD;
                       determine eligibility.&#xD;
