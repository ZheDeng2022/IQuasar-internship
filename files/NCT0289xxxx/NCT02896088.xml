  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the real scope of sealants (AS) is poorly documented in temporary dentition and&#xD;
      its effectiveness has not been demonstrated. Yet it seems reasonable that the AS in temporary&#xD;
      dentition could slow the specific development of carious lesions in early childhood. In&#xD;
      addition, this non-invasive approach could delay the conventional food and thus save&#xD;
      financial costs for more complex treatments. Finally, the installation of AS could afford, as&#xD;
      demonstrated in adult teeth, lowering the cariogenic bacteria prevalence engaged in the&#xD;
      caries process.&#xD;

      caries process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective: To evaluate the effect of AS on caries incidence in the deciduous dentition&#xD;
      obtained over a period of three years, taking into account the risk of caries established&#xD;
      initially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the prevalence and caries attack sites at the end of each year&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Estimate the retention rate (partial or complete) of the AS during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the cost savings of treatment during the trial period&#xD;

    <description>The main variable is the number of new decayed tooth surfaces between the end and the beginning of the research. The caries experience will also be evaluated and expressed by the index 'dmfs' (accumulation of decayed tooth surfaces over those missing or filled due to caries). The secondary variable will be the expression of the retention of AS. The comparison of caries incidence between the two groups of teeth (with and without AS) will take into account the membership of the teeth to the same subject by means of the statistical test Chi-McNemar two. Regression models logistics and Poisson regression will be used to test the effect of independent variables on the appearance of new cavities. The Stata statistical software will be used.</description>
