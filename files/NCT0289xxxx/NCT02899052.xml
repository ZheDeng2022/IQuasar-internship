Part 2: Further evaluate the safety and efficacy profile of the VenKd combination selected after completion of Part 1 in approximately 22 additional participants. Participants may discontinue Kd but may continue receiving venetoclax once daily (QD) as monotherapy.&#xD;
Part 3: Further evaluation of the efficacy of the VenKd combination after completion of Part 1 and Part 2 in 7 additional participants.&#xD;
Part 4, An additional 65 participants t(11;14) positive will receive varying doses of the VenKd combination or carfilzomib and dexamethasone</description>
