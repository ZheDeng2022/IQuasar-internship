  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this investigation is to test the efficacy of two sport&#xD;
      participation formats (individual sport, team sport) on key psychosocial outcomes compared to&#xD;
      a non-sport condition among parents of young children who were not participating in sport at&#xD;
      baseline of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research of this type is important because parents represent a group dealing with numerous&#xD;
      challenges and this is a period of time shown to have the greatest decline in physical&#xD;
      activity. Furthermore, parents could reap great benefits in psychological health through the&#xD;
      increase in physical activity and sport participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that participation will be predicted by sports commitment as per the&#xD;
      tenets of the Sport Commitment Model, and commitment will be predicted primarily by enjoyment&#xD;
      (+), social constraints from family obligations/involvement alternatives (-), followed by&#xD;
      social involvement opportunities/personal investments (+).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is exploring the impact team sports has on psychological well-being of parents&#xD;
      compared to individual sports or &quot;personal time&quot;. Our research questions include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does 1) team sports participation (choice-based from existing adult recreation leagues in&#xD;
      greater Victoria) increase psychosocial outcomes (quality of life, relationship satisfaction,&#xD;
      social functioning, perceived parenting capability, enjoyment) compared with 2) individual&#xD;
      sport participation (choice-based from adult recreation alternatives in greater Victoria),&#xD;
      and 3) a control condition? Hypothesis: The team sports condition will show significantly&#xD;
      larger changes in psychosocial outcomes compared to the two other conditions after&#xD;
      three-months of participation (primary end-point). Furthermore, the individual sports&#xD;
      condition will show significantly larger changes in psychosocial outcomes compared to the&#xD;
      control condition after three-months of participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Research Questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Can participation in the team sports and individual sports conditions be explained by&#xD;
           the constructs of the Sport Commitment model [21]? Hypothesis: Participation will be&#xD;
           predicted by sports commitment as per the tenets of the Sport Commitment Model, and&#xD;
           commitment will be predicted primarily by enjoyment (+), social constraints from family&#xD;
           obligations/involvement alternatives (-), followed by social involvement&#xD;
           opportunities/personal investments (+).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Can group differences among parents with regard to these participation and psychosocial&#xD;
           outcomes be explained through a mediation model? Hypothesis: The covariance of the&#xD;
           assigned conditions on psychosocial outcomes will be explained by sport participation.&#xD;
           In turn, the covariance between participation and assigned conditions will be explained&#xD;
           by salient underlying motives from the Sport Commitment Model. In particular, enjoyment&#xD;
           will explain the differences between both sport conditions but the better psychosocial&#xD;
           outcomes from team sports will be explained by the additional social involvement&#xD;
           opportunities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is there a seasonal, gender, dual/single parent, age of child, or type of sport&#xD;
           difference across primary outcomes by assigned condition? Hypothesis: These are&#xD;
           exploratory research questions with no pre-set hypothesis. Both sport conditions may&#xD;
           have participation lowered by weather conditions in the winter. Men may participate in&#xD;
           sport more due to lower child-rearing expectations but there is limited research to&#xD;
           support this conjecture at this time.&#xD;
