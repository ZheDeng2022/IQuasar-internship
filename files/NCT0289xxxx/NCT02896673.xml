  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome remains a serious condition, with a mortality rate of&#xD;
      between 30 and 50%. The use of mechanical ventilation with small tidal volumes, and by&#xD;
      limiting the plateau pressure in the respiratory tract below 30 cm H2O has been shown to&#xD;
      reduce mortality by approximately 10%, probably by reducing pulmonary hyperinflation and&#xD;
      pulmonary lesions induced by mechanical ventilation. It is therefore now established that the&#xD;
      respirator settings influence patient prognosis. However, around 30% of patients with ARDS&#xD;
      ventilated with these settings supposedly protective continue to present signs of pulmonary&#xD;
      hyperinflation on tomodensitometry, suggesting an additional reduction in the tidal volume&#xD;
      could be required in certain patients. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a new imaging&#xD;
      technique that gathers functional pulmonary information at bedside.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This technique also allows a regional analysis, allowing the complexity of the spatial&#xD;
      distribution of ARDS pulmonary lesions to be understood. The hypothesis is that EIT is a&#xD;
      reliable method to detect at-risk situations of lesions induced by mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      among patients with ARDS.&#xD;
