  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a haematological malignant disease characterized by an&#xD;
      uncontrolled proliferation of immature hematopoietic cells. Over the last two decades,&#xD;
      clinical trials have demonstrated an improved response rate in younger adult AML. Aggressive&#xD;
      induction plus more potent intensification programs with chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy&#xD;
      plus stem cell transplantation (SCT) has improved treatment results. Advances in&#xD;
      understanding disease biology, improvements in induction and consolidation program, and&#xD;
      better supportive care have also all contributed. A number of clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      characteristics influence the response to treatment and, thus, the survival of patients with&#xD;
      AML. Among them, cytogenetic at diagnosis represents the most important prognostic variable.&#xD;
      However, other factors may have a prognostic value and may influence patient's outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaemia and thrombocytopenia are cardinal manifestations of AML. Over the last decades, it&#xD;
      has become apparent that the frequency of allogeneic blood transfusions can modify host&#xD;
      immunity and clinical outcomes. Anaemia has long been recognized as an adverse prognostic&#xD;
      factor in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), which represents a pre-leukemic disease. Red blood&#xD;
      cell (RBC) transfusion need was identified as a strong and independent risk factor for&#xD;
      survival in MDS, for which the presence and severity of anaemia were attributed to a clonally&#xD;
      advanced and biologically more aggressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these data, we retrospectively assessed the prognostic value of RBC and platelet&#xD;
      transfusions at the time of diagnosis and the frequency of transfusions during the first&#xD;
      induction course of chemotherapy in a large unselected group of patients with previously&#xD;
      untreated AML.&#xD;

        An observational, longitudinal, and retrospective study was conducted in 1067 patients (&gt;15&#xD;
        years of age) fulfilling the clinical and laboratory criteria for diagnosis of AML.&#xD;
        Patients were admitted at the Lyon University Hospital over two decades (fromMarch 1985 to&#xD;
        December 2006) and enrolled onto 12 successive therapeutic trials according to age and time&#xD;
        of enrollment. Diagnosis of AML was based on smears of bone marrow aspirates. Leukemic&#xD;
        cells were classified according to the French-American-British (FAB) criteria. FAB M3 AMLs&#xD;
        were not included in the study. AML with 20 % or more myeloid marrow blasts, either de novo&#xD;
        or evolving from a MDS, was eligible in the absence of (i)World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
        performance status &gt;2; (ii) left ventricular systolic ejection fraction below the normal&#xD;
        range; (iii) a creatinine or hepatic enzyme levels &gt;2 ULN, except ifAML-related; and (iv)&#xD;
        uncontrolled severe infection. All participants gave their written informed consent&#xD;
