    <measure>Gait Quality as Indicated by Joint Excursion as Assessed by Kinematic Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>week 5</time_frame>
    <description>During the 10 Meter Walk Test (10MWT), infrared light emitting diode markers will be attached to bilateral lower extremities. The marker data will be recorded using the Northern Digital Inc (NDI) Optotrak Certus motion capture system. Marker data will be processed using custom Matlab program to determine lower extremity joint excursion. Joint excursion is the range of motion of a particular joint, and the range of motion is reported in degrees. After stroke, one side of the body is affected, and joint excursion for various joint angles (of hip, knee, and ankle) are reported for both sides of the body (affected side of body and unaffected side of body).</description>

    <measure>Metabolic Expenditure During Walking</measure>
    <time_frame>week 5</time_frame>
    <description>Change in metabolic expenditure during walking will be indicated by energy expenditure. Energy Expenditure will be measured by the K4 b2 Cosmed as follows: Oxygen cost will be calculated from oxygen consumption as the product of gait speed and body weight. Oxygen consumption will be collected on a breath-by-breath basis measured by a portable metabolic system (K4 b2 Cosmed). Prior to the testing, the system will be calibrated using room air and reference gas mixture. During the testing, the subject will wear a face mask and a heart rate monitor at all times and will be asked to breathe normally.</description>

    <measure>Motor Impairment as Determined by the Fugl-Meyer Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Assessment evaluates and measures recovery of movement in individual post stroke. The Fugl-Meyer has been used in both clinical and research settings and is one of the most widely used quantitative measures of motor impairment. It uses an ordinal scale for scoring of 17 items for the lower limb component and 7 items on the balance component, for a total of 24 items. Each of the 24 items is scored as 0 (cannot perform), 1 (can perform partially), or 2 (can perform fully), with a total score ranging from 0 to 48, with a higher score indicating less impairment.</description>

        <title>Gait Quality as Indicated by Joint Excursion as Assessed by Kinematic Analysis</title>
        <description>During the 10 Meter Walk Test (10MWT), infrared light emitting diode markers will be attached to bilateral lower extremities. The marker data will be recorded using the Northern Digital Inc (NDI) Optotrak Certus motion capture system. Marker data will be processed using custom Matlab program to determine lower extremity joint excursion. Joint excursion is the range of motion of a particular joint, and the range of motion is reported in degrees. After stroke, one side of the body is affected, and joint excursion for various joint angles (of hip, knee, and ankle) are reported for both sides of the body (affected side of body and unaffected side of body).</description>

        <title>Gait Quality as Indicated by Joint Excursion as Assessed by Kinematic Analysis</title>
        <description>During the 10 Meter Walk Test (10MWT), infrared light emitting diode markers will be attached to bilateral lower extremities. The marker data will be recorded using the NDI Optotrak Certus motion capture system. Marker data will be processed using custom Matlab program to determine lower extremity joint excursion. Joint excursion is the range of motion of a particular joint, and the range of motion is reported in degrees. After stroke, one side of the body is affected, and joint excursion for various joint angles (of hip, knee, and ankle) are reported for both sides of the body (affected side of body and unaffected side of body).</description>

Energy Expenditure will be measured by the K4 b2 Cosmed as follows: Oxygen cost will be calculated from oxygen consumption as the product of gait speed and body weight. Oxygen consumption will be collected on a breath-by-breath basis measured by a portable metabolic system (K4 b2 Cosmed). Prior to the testing, the system will be calibrated using room air and reference gas mixture. During the testing, the subject will wear a face mask and a heart rate monitor at all times and will be asked to breathe normally.</description>

          <title>Metabolic Expenditure During Walking</title>
          <description>Change in metabolic expenditure during walking will be indicated by energy expenditure. Energy Expenditure will be measured by the K4 b2 Cosmed as follows: Oxygen cost will be calculated from oxygen consumption as the product of gait speed and body weight. Oxygen consumption will be collected on a breath-by-breath basis measured by a portable metabolic system (K4 b2 Cosmed). Prior to the testing, the system will be calibrated using room air and reference gas mixture. During the testing, the subject will wear a face mask and a heart rate monitor at all times and will be asked to breathe normally.</description>

        <description>Assesses mobility, balance, walking ability, and fall risk in older adults. The test measures the time it takes the subject to perform a sit to stand from a chair with arms, walk to a mark on the ground 10 feet away and return to the seated position in the chair with arms. This test has been used in assessing stroke recovery with high reliability and validity.</description>

        <description>Range of motion will be measured on knee joints using goniometry (goniometry is the use of a device called a goniometer to measure range of motion of a joint in degrees). After stroke, one side of the body is affected.

        <title>Motor Impairment as Determined by the Fugl-Meyer Assessment</title>
        <description>The Fugl-Meyer Assessment evaluates and measures recovery of movement in individual post stroke. The Fugl-Meyer has been used in both clinical and research settings and is one of the most widely used quantitative measures of motor impairment. It uses an ordinal scale for scoring of 17 items for the lower limb component and 7 items on the balance component, for a total of 24 items. Each of the 24 items is scored as 0 (cannot perform), 1 (can perform partially), or 2 (can perform fully), with a total score ranging from 0 to 48, with a higher score indicating less impairment.</description>

          <title>Motor Impairment as Determined by the Fugl-Meyer Assessment</title>
          <description>The Fugl-Meyer Assessment evaluates and measures recovery of movement in individual post stroke. The Fugl-Meyer has been used in both clinical and research settings and is one of the most widely used quantitative measures of motor impairment. It uses an ordinal scale for scoring of 17 items for the lower limb component and 7 items on the balance component, for a total of 24 items. Each of the 24 items is scored as 0 (cannot perform), 1 (can perform partially), or 2 (can perform fully), with a total score ranging from 0 to 48, with a higher score indicating less impairment.</description>
