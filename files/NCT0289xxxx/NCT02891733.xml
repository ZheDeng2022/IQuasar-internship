  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in France and worldwide. 60% of patients&#xD;
      present themselves with a disease diagnosis immediately metastatic non curable.&#xD;
      Adenocarcinomas account for 50% of incident tumors. Treatment is based on the platinum-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy with or without maintenance therapy. When there is to exhaust this first line, a&#xD;
      second line treatment is offered to the patient. Three drugs are allowed in this situation:&#xD;
      docetaxel, erlotinib (inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor for epidermal&#xD;
      growth factor - TKI-EGFR) and pemetrexed (which in fact has become virtually standard in&#xD;
      first online and in combination with platinum in all patients with non-squamous cancer, so&#xD;
      that his place is in second line reduced facto). There is no recommendation for treatment in&#xD;
      third line situation where only erlotinib is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most recently, the nivolumab, anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody (which aims to enable immunutaire&#xD;
      system) saw its demonstrated effectiveness in the second line and beyond in the two Phase 3&#xD;
      trials where it was compared with docetaxel for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma and&#xD;
      non-squamous. The very recent availability in France of the drug under an ATU fact that it&#xD;
      will most likely become a standard second line, which will tend to place the third line&#xD;
      docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, erlotinib will be in 4th line situation. However, in the absence of an EGFR&#xD;
      mutation (which is only seen in more than 10% of Caucasian patients) use of the drug does not&#xD;
      seem appropriate or even harmful. A selection of patients likely to benefit from the&#xD;
      prescription of EGFR TKI-is essential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurotensin (NTS) is a polypeptide of 13 amino acids present and active in the central&#xD;
      nervous system and the periphery. At the peripheral level, neurotensin is secreted&#xD;
      postprandial by endocrine cells in the intestinal mucosa and is involved in the motor&#xD;
      functions of the gastrointestinal tract. The effects of neurotensin pass through the&#xD;
      activation of three subtypes of receptors which, mainly, NTSR1 and NTSR2 which are receptors&#xD;
      coupled to G proteins in the extra-digestive normal tissues, including lung, torque NTS /&#xD;
      NTSR1 n is not expressed physiologically. Rather, this complex is likely to recur in tumor&#xD;
      tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of this effect is derogatory activation torque NTS / NTSR1 of matrix&#xD;
      metalloproteinases which causes the release by the cell membrane ligands &quot;EGF-like&quot; and thus,&#xD;
      activation of HER receptor (EGFR or HER1, HER2 and HER3). Indeed, in experimental tumors&#xD;
      created by subcutaneous injection in athymic mouse cell lines adenocarcinomas NTS + / NTSR1 +&#xD;
      (non-mutated EGFR), treatment with erlotinib - which blocks EGFR pathway - causes a&#xD;
      significant decrease of tumor growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expression of the neurotensin receptor in cancer cells metastatic primary bronchial&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma is not known. Therefore, its pejorative prognostic value is not confirmed in&#xD;
      the metastatic setting.&#xD;

      The objectives of this work purely descriptive, are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the expression by tumor cells of the neurotensin receptor on a retrospective&#xD;
           series of patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consecutively treated between 2010 and 2015 at St. Joseph hospital (about a hundred&#xD;
           patients) and the Saint-Antoine hospital (three hundred patients), holders of a&#xD;
           metastatic and primary lung adenocarcinoma having received all even first-line&#xD;
           chemotherapy with a platinum agent (cisplatin or carboplatin) and pemetrexed (Alimta °)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If possible, the records of patients treated at St. Joseph Hospital and Saint-Antoine&#xD;
           Hospital between 2005 and 2010 as part of clinical trials evaluating the value of&#xD;
           erlotinib will also be sought,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop a score expression NTSR1 taking into account the percentage of tumor cells&#xD;
           expressing the receptor and the intensity of the marking,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate labeling cells by NTSR1 with the clinical course of patients to see if&#xD;
           expression NTSR1 is a factor of poor prognosis in metastatic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Teams involved:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Services:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacy that will establish the list of patients have been treated with the same&#xD;
           chemotherapy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pathological anatomy-to group blades and ensure immunohistochemical staining and&#xD;
           reading,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pneumology and Thoracic Oncology to resume the clinical history of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scientific coordination of the study will be conducted by INSERM UMR-S 1007, cellular&#xD;
      homeostasis and cancer - Reprogramming of biological and alternative therapies responses&#xD;
      (University Center of the Holy Fathers, 45 rue des Saints Pères, 75006 Paris), one team under&#xD;
      the direction of Dr. Patricia Forge, working on the couple NTS / NTSR1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      expected benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beyond two or three conventional chemotherapy line, which will no doubt add - for a&#xD;
      proportion of patients still to be determined - the new immunotherapy drugs, there is no&#xD;
      longer any recommendations for treatment of patients lung cancer metastatic non-small cells.&#xD;
      Erlotinib is an option since there is no limitation in its approval of prescription ond line.&#xD;
      However, in the absence of EGFR mutation, the therapeutic value of the drug appears to be&#xD;
      very low. Preclinical data that investigators obtained in the laboratory are hypothesize that&#xD;
      tumors expressing NTSR1 could meet the same TKI EGFR in the absence of mutation in the&#xD;
      receptor. The planned study will assess the percentage of patients in this situation in order&#xD;
      to prepare the organization of a Phase II study to evaluate the clinical relevance of a TKI&#xD;
      EGFR in this selected population of patients carrying of a non-mutated tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature of the data collected&#xD;
&#xD;
      A file will be drawn from the clinical data found in files: all patients are carriers of&#xD;
      metastatic primary lung adenocarcinoma and having all received the same chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data obtained will be: age, sex, smoking status, number of courses of chemotherapy&#xD;
      received and the response to treatment, the usual chronological parameters for the&#xD;
      establishment of the survival curves. Histological samples will be processed locally in each&#xD;
      of the two hospitals, according to a specific procedure to be determined between laboratories&#xD;
      and INSERM Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of subjects and circulation and processing of data&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the inclusions are carried out within the hospital group Paris Saint-Joseph&#xD;
      and Saint-Antoine hospital. Histological samples will be processed locally in each of the two&#xD;
      hospitals, according to a specific procedure to be determined between pathological anatomy&#xD;
      and INSERM Unit Laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These histological samples will be stored at the Pathological Anatomy Laboratory Groupe&#xD;
      Hospitalier Paris Sani Joseph.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study participant will be identified by a code of inclusion (first name and surname -&#xD;
      year of birth). The concordance table to link the assigned code and the participant's name&#xD;
      will be kept in each of the participating centers, in a file protected by a password specific&#xD;
      to the principal investigator of each center. Data collected from different centers on&#xD;
      anonymous paper media (only the code for inclusion of each patient are included) will be&#xD;
      centralized within the GHPSJ and entered in a database which anonymous access is protected by&#xD;
      the PIN each in the study of GHPSJ. Data processing and statistical analysis will be&#xD;
      performed on the GHPSJ site in collaboration with the Clinical Research Unit of the European&#xD;
      Hospital Georges Pompidou.&#xD;
