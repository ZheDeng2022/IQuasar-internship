    <textblock>
      Living donor (LD) kidney transplantation is currently the best treatment for end-stage renal&#xD;
      disease (ESRD) in terms of life expectancy and quality of life. This method allows preemptive&#xD;
      transplantation, before beginning dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study will be to investigate quality of life and societal&#xD;
      participation in a population of LD kidney transplant recipients comparing preemptive LD&#xD;
      transplantation versus non-preemptive transplantation (performed after a period of dialysis).&#xD;

      Living donor (LD) kidney transplantation is currently the best treatment for end-stage renal&#xD;
      disease (ESRD) in terms of life expectancy and quality of life. This method allows preemptive&#xD;
      transplantation, before beginning dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study will be to investigate quality of life and societal&#xD;
      participation in a population of LD kidney transplant recipients comparing preemptive LD&#xD;
      transplantation versus non-preemptive transplantation (performed after a period of dialysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that in addition to prolonged graft survival, preemptive LD kidney&#xD;
      transplantation is associated with less deterioration of quality of life and better societal&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore propose a cross-sectional population-based study to include all patients who&#xD;
      underwent LD kidney transplantation from 2004 through 2009 in the seven most active kidney&#xD;
      transplantation centers in France. Cross-sectional surveys have been conducted since 2004 by&#xD;
      the biomedicine agency in collaboration with the InVS in order to evaluate quality of life&#xD;
      among ESRD patients. The most recent survey, QUAVIREIN, is in process but has included only a&#xD;
      small number of patients selected at random. We want to broaden the study population beyond&#xD;
      the QUAVIREIN sample in order to include the entire population of LD kidney transplant&#xD;
      recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will thus include all patients who received a LD kidney transplant from&#xD;
      2004 through 2009 who give their informed consent to participate in the study and have a&#xD;
      functional transplant on March 31, 2012. The seven transplantation centers have agreed to&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be identified using the CRISTAL and QUAVIREIN databases. Quality of life,&#xD;
      occupational rehabilitation and societal participation data will be collected with a&#xD;
      self-administered questionnaire sent to all identified patients, excepting (in order to avoid&#xD;
      duplicates) those who have already participated in the QUAVIREIN survey. The methodology and&#xD;
      data collection will be the same as for QUAVIREIN. The Department of Epidemiology and&#xD;
      Clinical Evaluation (CIC-EC) of the Nancy University Hospital Center will be in charge of the&#xD;
      study logistics and organization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis will be tested by applying univariate then multivariate statistical&#xD;
      analysis to the collected data using ad hoc models comparing preemptive transplantation&#xD;
      versus non-preemptive transplantation.&#xD;
