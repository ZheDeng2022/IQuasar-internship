  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: No studies have examined the effect of varenicline for &quot;gradual&quot; smoking cessation&#xD;
      in COPD smokers currently not interested in quitting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To compare the efficiency of varenicline-assisted &quot;gradual&quot; vs. &quot;abrupt&quot; smoking&#xD;
      cessation in low-motivated COPD smokers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Pulmonary outpatient clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Open, randomized pilot smoking cessation trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: COPD smokers with low motivation to quit. Such low motivation will be defined&#xD;
      as a score of ≤ 3 points observed in a 10 cm visual analog scale (0=non motivated; 10=highly&#xD;
      motivated).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions/procedures: Patients will be randomized either to receive varenicline&#xD;
      (uptitrated to 1 mg twice daily) for smoking reduction or smoke as usual for 4-6 weeks before&#xD;
      quitting. After quit-day, the two groups will receive standard 12-week varenicline treatment.&#xD;
      Non-treatment follow-up will continue to 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements: The main outcome measure is carbon monoxide-verified complete abstinence rate&#xD;
      (CAR) 6 months after quit-day. Other measures are: CAR at 3 months; point prevalence at 3 and&#xD;
      6 months; change in motivation; cigarettes/day; differential dropout rate; decline in&#xD;
      pulmonary function; COPD symptoms, episodes of exacerbation and medication; and adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: One hundred twenty-one subjects per group will be necessary to detect CAR&#xD;
      differences between the two groups of 15% at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential study limitations: The main potential limitation is the lack of 1-yr follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance: This study may provide useful preliminary information on the safety and efficiency&#xD;
      of varenicline for &quot;gradual&quot; smoking cessation in low-motivated COPD smokers and it may&#xD;
      assist in the preparation of a larger, more comprehensive trial.&#xD;

      RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) is an inflammatory disease characterized by&#xD;
      progressive airflow limitation that is not fully reversible by the use bronchodilators&#xD;
      .Cigarette smoking is the single most common cause of COPD . It is estimated that 15-20% of&#xD;
      smokers will develop COPD over their lifetime, but higher figures have been reported for&#xD;
      older smokers. Incidentally, previous studies showed that up to 20% of &quot;healthy&quot; smokers&#xD;
      participating in cessation trials might have airway obstruction, most of whom are unaware of&#xD;
      this diagnosis . There is no single explanation for the fact that only a fraction of smokers&#xD;
      develop COPD. Bronchodilator treatment improves symptoms and quality of life of COPD&#xD;
      patients, and new drugs are available for this purpose. Notwithstanding, smoking cessation&#xD;
      remains the only therapeutic intervention likely to slow down the progression of the disease&#xD;
      by preventing further decline of maximal expiratory flows . Thus, smoking cessation is&#xD;
      paramount in the treatment of patients with COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although they know smoking is the cause of their disease, many patients with COPD continue to&#xD;
      smoke. Smoking prevalence rates up to 80 % have been documented in patients with mild to&#xD;
      moderate disease and up to 50% in those with severe disease . Notwithstanding, for various&#xD;
      reasons COPD patients are more resistant to smoking cessation than &quot;healthy&quot; smokers; these&#xD;
      include higher pack-year history and stronger nicotine dependence . In addition, COPD smokers&#xD;
      are less motivated to quit and often suffer from depression, a known cause of failure in quit&#xD;
      attempts . These observations call for new cessation strategies likely to prompt COPD smokers&#xD;
      to attempt to quit smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard way to stop smoking is to quit abruptly on a designated quit-day. However, for&#xD;
      COPD patients, this can be very hard to achieve since, for them, smoking is not only a source&#xD;
      of pleasure but also a longstanding habit, a second nature . An alternative strategy is the&#xD;
      so-called &quot;reduce-to-quit&quot; or &quot;gradual&quot; cessation method. Although it also has a quit-day,&#xD;
      the key difference is that smokers reduce the number of cigarettes/day over several days or&#xD;
      weeks prior to quitting. To help smokers achieve and maintain reduction, pharmacotherapy is&#xD;
      usually offered and, in many countries, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is licensed for&#xD;
      this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surprisingly enough, no studies have been published on the efficiency of varenicline as an&#xD;
      aid for pre-quitting smoking reduction. Indeed, varenicline was found superior to any single&#xD;
      type of NRT (and bupropion) as an aid for smoking cessation in adult smokers. . Second, it&#xD;
      was found to be more efficient than placebo and NRT for &quot;abrupt&quot; cessation in COPD smokers&#xD;
      motivated to quit ]. Finally, varenicline was found to decrease pre-quit enjoyment in general&#xD;
      smokers and increase motivation to quit among healthy smokers who are not willing to make a&#xD;
      serious attempt to quit smoking .&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTION/OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the above considerations in mind, the investigators set out to examine the efficiency of&#xD;
      varenicline-assisted &quot;gradual&quot; vs. &quot;abrupt&quot; cessation in COPD smokers with low motivation to&#xD;
      quit. The investigators hypothesized that, if these patients received the standard 12-week&#xD;
      varenicline treatment, &quot;gradual&quot; cessation would produce higher quit rates at 6 months than&#xD;
      &quot;abrupt&quot; cessation if varenicline was used to assist pre-treatment reduction. A secondary&#xD;
      hypothesis is that varenicline-assisted pre-quitting smoking reduction would increase&#xD;
      motivation to quit compared with usual smoking before quitting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN OVERVIEW&#xD;
&#xD;
      When planning this study, the investigators first idea was to carry out a three-arm,&#xD;
      double-blind, randomized trial. However, the lack of basic information for reliable sample&#xD;
      size calculation and uncertainties about participation rates guided them towards a&#xD;
      preliminary, open, randomized pilot study of COPD smokers with low motivation to quit. The&#xD;
      patients will be recruited among those attending the outpatient clinic of Pulmonary Institute&#xD;
      of the Share Zedek Medical Center, in Jerusalem. Participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive varenicline for smoking reduction or smoke as usual before quitting. Thereafter the&#xD;
      two groups will receive standard varenicline treatment with follow-up extending to 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be heavy smokers (≥15 pack years) of both sexes, aged ≥35 yrs who received&#xD;
      a diagnosis of COPD (FEV1/FVC &lt;70% and FEV1 &lt;80% predicted) with low motivation to quit&#xD;
      smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be computer-randomized either to the &quot;gradual&quot; or &quot;abrupt&quot;&#xD;
      cessation groups at baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is open so both the participants and the medical team will be aware of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION AND PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gradual cessation Patients randomized to the &quot;gradual&quot; cessation group will receive&#xD;
      varenicline (0,5 mg once daily for 3 days, 0,5 mg twice daily for 4 days, and 1,0 mg bid&#xD;
      thereafter) as an aid for smoking reduction. This pre-treatment phase will last 6 weeks at&#xD;
      the end of which all participants must stop smoking altogether. However, patients will be&#xD;
      allowed to quit already as of week 4 if they feel ready to do so. After quitting,participants&#xD;
      will continue to receive varenicline 1,0 mg bid for a further 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smoking reduction: Participants will be recommended to reduce their smoking by 25% in the&#xD;
      first two weeks, 50% in weeks 3-4, and 75% in weeks 5-6; however, this will be given only as&#xD;
      an indication and every subject will be allowed to chose his/her own goal and rate of&#xD;
      progress. To achieve reduction each participant will be offered three structured ways: a)&#xD;
      Scheduled reduction (SR), that is gradually increasing the time between cigarettes (the&#xD;
      inter-cigarette interval); b) Hierarchical reduction - easiest first, that is rating&#xD;
      cigarettes in terms of how difficult it would be to give up then eliminate each in turn,&#xD;
      starting with the easiest one; and c) Hierarchical reduction - hardest first: this is similar&#xD;
      to the previous one but the subject must start by the hardest to give up cigarette first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abrupt cessation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in this group will be asked to smoke as usual for 6 weeks after enrolment then stop&#xD;
      altogether. However, those feeling ready will be allowed to quit as of week 4. Thereafter,&#xD;
      participants will receive the standard 12-week varenicline treatment, starting with a 1 week&#xD;
      titration period as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits and Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten visits will be scheduled: at study entry and at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 18, 24 and 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Support&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only minimal levels of advice and support will be given. However, all subjects will receive&#xD;
      individualized verbal instructions regarding the general conduct of the study and the proper&#xD;
      use of the study medication.&#xD;
