  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Care in ambulatory surgery (CA) is growing in France, despite lagging behind other countries&#xD;
      in North or US Europe. Arthroscopic knee surgery is a minimally invasive surgery eligible for&#xD;
      CA. Currently 71.8% of knee arthroscopy are made in this context. However ligamentoplasties&#xD;
      anterior cruciate are still carried out predominantly in conventional hospitalization (HC)&#xD;
      with a median of 3 to 5.5 days of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two recent prospective studies French single-operator shows the feasibility of reconstruction&#xD;
      of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in ambulatory: no serious events were recorded, the&#xD;
      risks are comparable to those of a HC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, this support requires a structure and a coordinated network between different&#xD;
      medical and paramedical (surgeons, anesthetists, nurse frame, City nurse, doctor,&#xD;
      physiotherapist).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to evaluate (i.e. EPP or &quot;feasibility&quot;) ACL reconstruction in&#xD;
      CA in hospitals, multi-operator.&#xD;

      II. objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      at. primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rating (or &quot;feasibility&quot;) of a management protocol HDJ of ACL reconstruction in a hospital&#xD;
      structure on a multi-operator series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation criteria (absence of EG)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      b. secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Evaluation of the acceptance rates of ambulatory care patients eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Evaluation of the rate and type of complication in our series&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. Evaluation of early postoperative results (postoperative pain, analgesic consumption,&#xD;
      sleep, satisfaction)&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Methodology and duration of the research&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a consecutive series single-center multi-operator prospective regarding the&#xD;
      evaluation of surgical practice cited in goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion of patients will take place over a period of 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of ACL reconstruction in outpatient will be proposed in consultation with the&#xD;
      surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an explanation of the course of treatment a fact sheet on the protocol will be provided&#xD;
      to the patient and his doctor to the patient to decide its support AC or HC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data will be collected by telephone the first 4 days and in consultation with J45.&#xD;
      The revision sheet is provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are aware of the use of their data for medical research through oral information&#xD;
      provided by the doctor at the signing by the patient's consent related to the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected as part of the research are anonymous and unidentifiable (for each subject&#xD;
      is assigned a number); the name of the surgeon is also anonymized.&#xD;
