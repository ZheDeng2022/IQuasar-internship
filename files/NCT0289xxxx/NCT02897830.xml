    <textblock>
      Open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Ixazomib in combination with&#xD;
      Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM). The&#xD;
      patient population will consist of adult men and women up to 65 years, who have a confirmed&#xD;
      diagnosis of MM who meet eligibility criteria.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive induction therapy, comprising three cycles with Ixazomib, plus&#xD;
      Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral Blood Stem Cells (PBSC) will be mobilized within 2 weeks (+/- 1 week) after the&#xD;
      last dose of Lenalidomide, with Cyclophosphamide plus G-CSF or Granulocyte-CSF(Colony&#xD;
      Stimulating Factor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensification: High Dose Melphalan (HDM) will be performed within 3 weeks +/- 1 week&#xD;
      following stem cell harvest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation, patient will enter in the consolidation&#xD;
      phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early consolidation (consolidation part 1) will start 2 months after transplantation and will&#xD;
      comprise 2 cycles of MLN - Rd (MLN R identical to induction therapy but low dose of&#xD;
      Dexamethasone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Late consolidation (consolidation part 2) will consist in 6 additional cycles of Ixazomib&#xD;
      plus Lenalidomide. No Dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance therapy will start within 28 days after the last dose of Lenalidomide in last&#xD;
      cycle of Late Consolidation for thirteen 28-day cycles (approximately 12 months duration)&#xD;
      Patients will be seen at regular treatment cycle intervals while they are participating in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response will be assessed according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG)&#xD;
      criteria until disease progression. All patients will be followed for survival after&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
