      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some people cannot make medical treatment decisions on their own. The people who make&#xD;
      decisions on their behalf are called medical surrogates. Sometimes surrogates cannot predict&#xD;
      which treatment course the person or their loved ones would have chosen. The surrogates often&#xD;
      become distressed because of making these decisions. Researchers think a tool called a&#xD;
      Patient Preference Predictor (PPP) may be able to make the process easier. The PPP would&#xD;
      predict what treatment the person would want. This is based on treatment preferences of&#xD;
      similar people in a similar circumstance. Researchers want to interview surrogates to explore&#xD;
      their views on the PPP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore surrogates views on incorporating a PPP into shared medical decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 18 years or older who:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have acted as a surrogate medical decision-maker within the past 3 years. This includes&#xD;
      decisions about&#xD;
&#xD;
      treatment, medication, hospice care, hospital admission, or discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Are not pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened by meeting with clinicians in person or by phone to discuss the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take part in a focus group. This is a small group of people discussing&#xD;
      their thoughts and opinions. This will last for about 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be served a light meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will provide information about themselves and their views. They will talk about&#xD;
      their past experiences making medical decisions for someone. They will discuss how they felt&#xD;
      about these decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PPP will be explained to participants. They will give their views on it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will audio record the focus group and take notes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will fill out questionnaires.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current clinical practice relies on shared decision-making between clinicians and surrogates&#xD;
      to make treatment decisions for patients who cannot decide on their own. This decision-making&#xD;
      process is meant to promote medical care that accords with the patient s own preferences and&#xD;
      values. However, empirical data suggest that this model faces two significant challenges.&#xD;
      First, both surrogates and clinicians have trouble predicting which treatment course patients&#xD;
      would have chosen. Second, given the nature of the decisions, surrogates often experience&#xD;
      significant emotional distress as a result of making treatment decisions. To address these&#xD;
      concerns it has been suggested that the shared decision-making process might be supplemented&#xD;
      with a Patient Preference Predictor (PPP). A PPP would provide a prediction of which&#xD;
      treatment a given patient would want based on the treatment preferences of similar patients&#xD;
      in similar circumstances. The present study proposes to interview surrogates who have been&#xD;
      involved in making decisions for an incapacitated patient to explore their perspectives on&#xD;
      the PPP and how to incorporate it into medical decision-making for incapacitated patients..&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Experience making at least one medical decision on behalf of an incompetent patient&#xD;
             within the past 3 years. A medical decision for the purposes of this study is defined&#xD;
             as making a decision in a context in which there was more than 1 feasible or&#xD;
             reasonable option.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to speak, understand, or read English&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient on behalf of whom the individual acted as surrogate is deceased for less&#xD;
             than two months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the view of the referring clinician, participation in the study is deemed&#xD;
             excessively burdensome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Candidate for study is pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Court appointed surrogate&#xD;
