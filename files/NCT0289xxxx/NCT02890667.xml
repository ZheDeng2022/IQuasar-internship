      &quot;This study is a population based observational study conducted on the French administrative&#xD;
      databases to estimate cancer incidence in 2012 by using the &quot;ECHANTILLON GENERALISTE DES&#xD;
      BENEFICIAIRES&quot; (EGB, a 1/97th dynamic random sample of the SNIIRAM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EGB database contains anonymous and prospectively recorded data about all beneficiaries'&#xD;
      medical reimbursements. Many algorithm definitions are defined to estimate the incident rate&#xD;
      of cancer in 2012 from the EGB database. The incidence rates obtained by each algorithm&#xD;
      definition are compared to national incidence rates by indirect age and sex standardization.&#xD;
      National incidence rates are obtained from &quot;FRANCE CANCER INCIDENCE ET MORTALITE&quot; (FRANCIM):&#xD;
      the French network of cancer registries.&quot;&#xD;

      &quot;This study is a population based observational study conducted on the French administrative&#xD;
      databases to estimate cancer incidence in 2012 by using the &quot;ECHANTILLON GENERALISTE DES&#xD;
      BENEFICIAIRES&quot; (EGB, a 1/97th dynamic random sample of the SNIIRAM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EGB database contains anonymous and prospectively recorded data about all beneficiaries'&#xD;
      medical reimbursements including age, gender, long-term chronic disease (LTD), date of death,&#xD;
      all out-hospital health-spending reimbursements and all patients' hospitalizations. Many&#xD;
      algorithm definitions are defined to estimate the incident rate of cancer in 2012 from the&#xD;
      EGB database and are applied separately for men and women. These algorithms use information&#xD;
      from either out-hospital care only (LTD status, anticancer specific drugs, outpatient&#xD;
      radiotherapy sessions), or inpatient stays only (primary or related diagnosis of cancer,&#xD;
      cancer-related procedures) or combine both information. The incidence rates obtained by each&#xD;
      algorithm definition are compared to national incidence rates by indirect age and sex&#xD;
      standardization. National incidence rates are obtained from FRANCE CANCER INCIDENCE ET&#xD;
      MORTALITE (FRANCIM): the French network of cancer registries that has collected cancer cases&#xD;
      since 1975 from 21 French registries (general or specific) covering 17 of the 95 French&#xD;
      metropolitan departments. The most recent estimation of the FRANCIM network was published for&#xD;
      2012 and included all cancer locations (C00-C97) excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (C44).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up All patients included are followed from January 1, 2012 until the occurrence of the&#xD;
      first of death, cancer occurrence, moving out of the general insurance scheme or January 1,&#xD;
      2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To allow for comparison with data from cancer registries, only malignant neoplasms are&#xD;
      considered: ICD-10 codes (C00-C97), excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (C44).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of incident cancer cases obtained with each algorithm is compared to the expected&#xD;
      number of cancer cases calculated by using national estimation for the same age and sex&#xD;
      stratum. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) with 95% confidence intervals is calculated&#xD;
      by indirect age and sex standardization. Age- and sex-specific incident rates are compared to&#xD;
      the incident rates in 2012 estimated by FRANCIM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also apply the most accurate algorithm separately for men and women to the&#xD;
      3 most common cancers in the corresponding gender by restricting the involved cancer codes,&#xD;
      procedures and drugs to those related to the cancer of interest. The investigators also&#xD;
      restrict our population to the most-studied age groups in cancer etiological studies (40 to&#xD;
      75 years). All the analyses are performed using SAS Enterprise Guide, version 4.3.&quot;&#xD;
