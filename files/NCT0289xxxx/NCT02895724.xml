    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine if pressurechamber treatment (HBOT) can reduce early&#xD;
      stages of breast cancer related lymphedema, and to explore the mechanisms involved in the&#xD;
      disease progress.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lymphedema (LE) is a potential complication of primary breast cancer treatment and the&#xD;
      influence of LE on the quality of life is well-established. To date there is no established&#xD;
      treatment that can reverse lymphedema. Patients are dependent on compression garments and&#xD;
      manual lymphatic drainage to prevent progression of LE and worsening of discomfort, pain,&#xD;
      upper limb dysfunction/sensation, skin problems and infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a development in treatment of tissue damage after radiation treatment HBOT is used in the&#xD;
      treatment of radiation induced mandibular necrosis, hemorrhagic cystitis or proctitis&#xD;
      following pelvic radiation. The pathology, which correlates to the effect of HBOT include&#xD;
      neovascularization, as well as organization and reduction in fibrous tissue, and new evidence&#xD;
      also shows an increase in the number of lymphatic vessels in irradiated oral mucosa. Some&#xD;
      studies have found that HBOT might also reduce arm edema in breast cancer patients, but&#xD;
      evidence is inconsistent and mainly based on chronic and long existing lymphedema in long&#xD;
      term BC survivors. The investigators argue that the possibility of remodeling of mature&#xD;
      fibrotic tissue is less pronounced when the lymphedema has been present over prolonged&#xD;
      periods of years, limiting the possibility of treatment success. Although HBOT is a lengthy&#xD;
      and time-consuming treatment, it is documented safe in all aspects with little risk of side&#xD;
      effects, and the potential health gains from the treatment are immense.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This explorative HBOT trial was designed to generate hypotheses about the conditions under&#xD;
      which HBOT is effective to reduce lymphedema, and to reveal new aspects of the role of tissue&#xD;
      composition on the effectiveness of HBOT. The early initiation of HBOT is the key factor in&#xD;
      this set up, which is different from the previous studies in the field. To be able to do so,&#xD;
      all participants in a randomized controlled exercise trial (LYCA), who develop lymphedema&#xD;
      during the first year after surgery will be invited to participate in the HBOT trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial was accepted with regards to the experimental use of medical oxygen in a pressure&#xD;
      chamber for the treatment of lymphedema in the National Health and Medicines Authority in&#xD;
      2015; protocol number R96- A6604-14- S22, EUDRACT no: 2015-000604-25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and hypothesis The primary aim in this explorative trial is to examine whether HBOT is&#xD;
      effective in treating early LE. Secondly, the aim is to examine the importance of the&#xD;
      conditions under which HBOT is more effective in treating LE. Effects of HBOT (primary&#xD;
      endpoints) will be evaluated as objective measurements of the affected and contralateral arm&#xD;
      volume assessed by DXA scan and Light perometry. Changes in lymphatic clearance rate before&#xD;
      and after HBOT (secondary endpoint) will be measured by lymphoscintigraphy and biomarkers of&#xD;
      inflammation and collagen levels in blood samples. Other secondary endpoints are patient&#xD;
      reported outcomes of symptoms of lymphedema, physical and psychological function, fatigue,&#xD;
      and quality of life, and will be assessed by questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that HBOT will reduce the volume and symptoms of persistent LE in the&#xD;
      patients receiving this treatment, to a clinically non-significant level. Furthermore, it is&#xD;
      hypothesized that HBOT cause reduced patient reported symptoms of lymphedema and fatigue and&#xD;
      increased physical and psychological function and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LYCA HBOT trial is an explorative and observational study, offering all participants in&#xD;
      the exercise trial, who develop lymphedema, a treatment course with HBOT. In addition, an&#xD;
      equal number of matched control subjects without lymphedema from the exercise trial will be&#xD;
      included for blood sampling and DXA scans. It is planned to start in September 2016 and to be&#xD;
      ended with the last follow up (6 months) of the last participant, in May 2018. Patients are&#xD;
      invited at 12 months follow-up in the LYCA exercise trial if they present with the following&#xD;
      criteria for lymphedema persisting more than 4 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a swelling of the arm on the operated side, corresponding to &gt;3% increase in inter limb&#xD;
           volume change from the baseline measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a score of 2 points or more on numeric rating scale for self reported swelling,&#xD;
           heaviness and tightness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a clinical exam where 2 or more of the following 4 criteria must be present (i-iii are&#xD;
           compared with the unaffected side): i) decreased visibility of subcutaneous veins on the&#xD;
           ventral lower arm or dorsal hand ii) loss of normal contours in the region of the medial&#xD;
           side of the elbow/distal end of the upper arm iii) thicker skin and subcutis on&#xD;
           palpation iv) pitting edema&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HBOT component:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HBOT includes compression to 2.4 Bar (ATA) in a multi-place hyperbaric chamber at&#xD;
      Rigshospitalet. Patients breathe 100% oxygen via a transparent hood for a total of 100&#xD;
      minutes including two 5-minutes periods of de- and ascent. The course of treatment comprises&#xD;
      a total of 40 pressure exposures, distributed as 5 days a week for 8 continuous weeks. The&#xD;
      women will be encouraged to continue exercising 3 times a week throughout the treatment&#xD;
      period, adherence to exercise promoted by mobile phone text messages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis For this explorative trial, no power calculation is carried out, due to the&#xD;
      explorative focus to generate hypotheses. Descriptive statistics will be used to look at&#xD;
      possible tendencies, associations and differences. Arm volume over time will be compared, and&#xD;
      limb volume difference in those women who have carried out the progressive resistance&#xD;
      training compared to the women who received the usual care control condition will be&#xD;
      evaluated. Furthermore, the possible association between effect of HBOT and amount of&#xD;
      exercise will be examined, as will the increase in or level of muscle strength, symptom&#xD;
      burden, body composition, physical function, and health related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In analysis of blood samples of HBOT participants and control subjects, levels of the&#xD;
      biomarkers in question will be compared and contrasted, both at baseline (before HBOT) and in&#xD;
      changes over time (during and after HBOT). Within the groups of controls and HBOT&#xD;
      participants, there are individuals from each LYCA-exercise intervention arm.&#xD;
