      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the treatment with NEO-PV-01 + adjuvant in&#xD;
      combination with nivolumab is safe and useful for patients with certain types of cancer. The&#xD;
      study also will investigate if NEO-PV-01 + adjuvant with nivolumab may represent a&#xD;
      substantial improvement over other available therapies such as nivolumab alone. All eligible&#xD;
      patients will receive NEO-PV-01 + adjuvant and nivolumab while on this trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will enroll patients with metastatic or advanced melanoma, lung, or&#xD;
      bladder cancer. The three agents being used in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A new, investigational, personal cancer vaccine called &quot;NEO-PV-01&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Poly-ICLC (Hiltonol), an investigational adjuvant that is used to help stimulate the&#xD;
           immune system&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A cancer drug called nivolumab (OPDIVOÂ®)&#xD;
&#xD;
      These agents are considered immunotherapy and work by stimulating the immune system to fight&#xD;
      cancer. NEO-PV-01 is a truly personal vaccine therapy in that it is custom designed and&#xD;
      manufactured to include targets for the immune system that are present uniquely on an&#xD;
      individual's cancer. Poly-ICLC is an adjuvant that helps stimulate the immune system and make&#xD;
      the vaccine, NEO-PV-01 more effective. Nivolumab helps T-cells, a certain type of immune&#xD;
      cell, that recognize these targets to reach and attack the tumor. Nivolumab is in clinical&#xD;
      development for treatment of bladder cancer and is approved by the FDA (the U.S. Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration) for the treatment of some lung, skin, kidney, and blood cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find out if treatment with NEO-PV-01 + adjuvant in&#xD;
      combination with nivolumab is safe and effective for patients with melanoma, lung, or bladder&#xD;
      cancer. The study also will see if NEO-PV-01 vaccine + adjuvant with nivolumab can improve&#xD;
      responses compared to available therapies such as nivolumab monotherapy The side effects of&#xD;
      NEO-PV-01 + adjuvant and nivolumab will be monitored and additional research tests will be&#xD;
      done to assess the immune response against each individual's cancer.&#xD;
