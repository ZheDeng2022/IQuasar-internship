  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to investigate if patient involvement in the medication&#xD;
      procedures through elements of the medication system One-Stop Dispensing (use of own&#xD;
      medication, placed in bedside locker, partly or self-administration of medication) and&#xD;
      focused dialogue about medication can maintain or improve the patients' health literacy to&#xD;
      perform the prescribed medical treatment during and after hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is, that involving the patient in the medication procedure and focused&#xD;
      dialogue about the medicine during hospitalization will improve the patients' health literacy&#xD;
      measured by patient adherence, patient knowledge and perceptions of safety about the&#xD;
      medication. It is further expected that more time will be spent together with the patient,&#xD;
      and that the new medication procedures will be cost-neutral.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More people live with chronic diseases and therefore it is important for the healthcare&#xD;
      system to develop and organize initiatives that involve patients in their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Denmark dispensing and administration of medication during hospitalization is a process&#xD;
      where the health staff has completely taken the responsibility from the patient, leaving&#xD;
      unused resources among patients and their relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general non-adherence to medication in patients with chronic medical diseases is a common&#xD;
      problem, which contributes to adverse health outcomes, increase healthcare expenditures and&#xD;
      reduce quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One-Stop Dispensing (use of own medication, placed in bedside locker, partly or&#xD;
      self-administration of medication during hospitalization), which is a medication system&#xD;
      developed in United Kingdom in the 1990s, could be an important part of a shift in the&#xD;
      healthcare system toward increasing patient involvement. Use of own medication and&#xD;
      self-administration aims, among other things, to increase adherence and the patient's&#xD;
      knowledge and understanding of their medication. One-Stop Dispensing has so far only been&#xD;
      tested on elective surgical patients in Denmark, which is why this study set out to&#xD;
      investigate acute hospitalized medical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the effect of the medication system One-Stop Dispensing in Danish medical&#xD;
      patients the investigators planned a study including two designs. An observational before and&#xD;
      after implementing One-Stop Dispensing study and a randomized controlled study for the&#xD;
      intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment for an observational part of the study will begin in April 2016 with data&#xD;
      collection on patients under the traditional medication system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In October 2016 enrolment will then begin for the intervention period including randomization&#xD;
      to a basic intervention including the elements of One-Stop Dispensing or an extended&#xD;
      intervention which besides One-Stop Dispensing also include a dialogue with the patients&#xD;
      about their medication during the hospitalization and at discharge. The data collection will&#xD;
      end in March 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will identify and verify patient eligibility. All participants will need to&#xD;
      provide informed written consent. For recruitment and informed consent, project information&#xD;
      will be discussed with the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline variables will be collected at admission and in the intervention period prior to&#xD;
      randomization. This includes questionnaire and baseline characteristics such as age, sex and&#xD;
      diagnosis. The primary measure is adherence measured at baseline and 1 month after discharge.&#xD;
      Knowledge of the patients' own medication will assessed by a health professional also at&#xD;
      baseline and again at discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will end after one month follow up is completed for all the included patients.&#xD;
