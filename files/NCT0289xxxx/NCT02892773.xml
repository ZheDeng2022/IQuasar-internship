  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand how air is spread throughout study&#xD;
      participants' lungs after abdominal surgery by comparing two lung inflation treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Incentive Spirometry (I.S.) lung expansion therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. EzPAP® lung expansion therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung expansion therapy is routinely used after upper abdominal surgery. Taking deep breaths&#xD;
      after surgery helps lungs to stay inflated. At the University of Virginia, it is at the&#xD;
      physician's discretion as to which treatment will be used to help with deep breathing lung&#xD;
      inflation therapy after surgery. The investigators would like to know which of the lung&#xD;
      inflation therapies is better at helping inflate participants' lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will be using a device called Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) to&#xD;
      measure how effectively air spreads in participants' lungs. This device is not currently&#xD;
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the purpose used in this study, and&#xD;
      therefore, it is considered investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators are inviting eligible participants to consider participating in this study&#xD;
      because doctors order Incentive Spirometry as a standard of care following upper abdominal&#xD;
      surgery. Information gained from monitoring how air is spread throughout participants' lungs&#xD;
      will help investigators to determine if there is a clinical difference and benefit when&#xD;
      comparing Incentive Spirometry and EzPAP lung expansion therapies.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will use a convenience sampling scheme to identify potential study&#xD;
      participants. Documentation of informed consent will be recorded. Electrical Impedance&#xD;
      Tomography (EIT), which provides non-invasive and radiation free monitoring, will be used to&#xD;
      monitor and measure regional distribution of ventilation during Incentive Spirometry (I.S.)&#xD;
      and EzPAP® lung expansion therapy. The PulmoVista 500 EIT device has a reported high patient&#xD;
      safety profile and poses minimal patient risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential benefit for study participants will not be realized directly since the&#xD;
      investigators' aim is to only monitor regional distribution of ventilation in response to&#xD;
      I.S. or EzPAP® lung expansion therapy. While I.S. is considered to be a standard of&#xD;
      post-operative care, there is low quality evidence documenting I.S. effectiveness in&#xD;
      preventing pulmonary complications after upper abdominal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Loss of dorsal lung volume (i.e., atelectasis) is an example of a post-operative pulmonary&#xD;
      complication. EzPAP® is a lung expansion therapy that is used as an alternative to I.S. lung&#xD;
      expansion therapy for increasing dorsal regional lung volume (i.e., Functional Residual&#xD;
      Volume [FRC]) in an effort to prevent or reverse atelectasis. When expiratory positive airway&#xD;
      pressures of 5, 10, and 15 cmH2O was administered to a small group of healthy human subjects,&#xD;
      medical researchers identified that a positive pressure of 15 cmH2O was associated with the&#xD;
      greatest FRC increase when compared to zero pressure and baseline FRC measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While study participants may not benefit directly from this study, investigators anticipate&#xD;
      that important information will be gained from EIT monitoring of regional distribution of&#xD;
      ventilation. Future upper abdominal post-operative surgical patients may benefit from this&#xD;
      study's findings as investigators hope to advance clinical understanding associated with&#xD;
      these therapies with use of EIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure set-up and device calibration will occur according to Draeger provided PulmoVista&#xD;
      500 EIT training and operation manual instructions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study participant preparation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Investigators will assess the participant's thorax to ensure that the skin's&#xD;
                surface is free of body fluids that may prevent or impede electrode contact. Skin&#xD;
                surface will be wiped clean with a dry cloth if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Investigators will select an electrode belt and respective patient cable sizes&#xD;
                after measuring participant's chest circumference with paper measurement tape&#xD;
                placed across the midclavicular line at intercostal space 4 -5. Electrode belt size&#xD;
                will be selected according to chest circumference measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A patient cable of the same electrode belt size will be selected and connected to&#xD;
                the electrode belt before connection to participant. Investigators will align and&#xD;
                snap connect the patient cable snaps over the electrode belt studs by aligning&#xD;
                respective snaps and studs in ascending numerical order from 1 to 16 .&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A light spray of water may be applied to the black electrode surface on the&#xD;
                electrode belt before it is applied to participant if natural moisture from the&#xD;
                skin does not result in sufficient conductivity between the skin and electrodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigators will attach an electrode belt and reference electrode to participant while&#xD;
           they are lying supine in bed. Participant's head of bed will be positioned at&#xD;
           45-degrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The electrode belt/cable combination will be attached around the thorax of each&#xD;
                participant at the level of the 4th - 5th intercostal space, unless mammary tissue&#xD;
                prevents this site of application. An alternative application site will be located&#xD;
                immediately below the mammary tissue if necessary. Left to right belt orientation&#xD;
                will be maintained with color coded patient cable ports signifying left and right&#xD;
                side.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Investigators will snap the electrode belt closed after verifying proper belt&#xD;
                position. The belt's black electrodes should have close contact with the study&#xD;
                participant's skin at this point.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  An adhesive ECG electrode will be place on the study participant's right upper&#xD;
                abdominal quadrant and then the patient cable reference electrode snap will be&#xD;
                attached to the ECG electrode.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The patient cable will then be connected to the EIT monitoring device via a color&#xD;
                coded trunk cable orientation that aligns with the patient cable left and right&#xD;
                orientation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EIT device calibration and signal check&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Investigators will initiate a PulmonVista 500 EIT monitoring device calibration&#xD;
                each day prior to performing new study participant end-expiratory lung impedance&#xD;
                measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A skin-electrode signal check will be performed to ensure that a minimum of 15 of&#xD;
                16 electrodes have sufficient contact with the participant's skin surface and&#xD;
                signal quality is stable. Investigators will use the following status display and&#xD;
                explanation to determine adequacy of electrode contact and signal quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitoring sessions and Lung Expansion Therapy procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Monitoring will be initiated after investigators perform PulmoVista 500 EIT device&#xD;
                setup and calibration prior to one of the three scheduled lung expansion therapy&#xD;
                sessions on day 1, 3, and 5 (if not discharged from hospital) after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Approximate monitoring/measurement duration is 15-minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung expansion therapies will occur as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants will be positioned supine in bed or bedside chair with head of bed or&#xD;
                bedside chair positioned at 45-degrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incentive Spirometry Procedure Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A respiratory therapist will provide instruction on Incentive Spirometry procedure&#xD;
           performance before supervised therapy and monitoring begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to take 10 deep breaths through the incentive spirometer's&#xD;
           mouthpiece, followed by a 60 second pause.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The 10-breath cycle will be repeated three times with respiratory therapist coaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each Incentive Spirometry therapy session will last about 15 minutes three times per&#xD;
           day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EIT monitoring and deep breathing measurements will occur during one of the three&#xD;
           scheduled Incentive Spirometry sessions on day 1, 3, and 5 (if not discharged from&#xD;
           hospital) after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EzPAP® Positive Airway Pressure Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A respiratory therapist will provide instruction on EzPAP® procedure performance before&#xD;
           supervised therapy and monitoring begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to breathe normally through the EzPAP® device's mouthpiece&#xD;
           for 10 breaths, followed by a 60 second pause.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The 10-breath cycle will be repeated three times with respiratory therapist coaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each TID EzPAP® therapy sessions will last about 15 minutes three times per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EIT monitoring and deep breathing measurements will occur during one of the three&#xD;
           scheduled Incentive Spirometry sessions on day 1, 3, and 5 (if not discharged from&#xD;
           hospital) after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • PulmoVista set-up and monitoring sessions will be coordinated in collaboration with&#xD;
           each participant's bedside nurse and a respiratory therapist. Initial setup and&#xD;
           monitoring commitment time is approximately 15 - 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrical Impedance Tomography lung monitoring and measurements will occur during one&#xD;
           of three scheduled EzPAP® therapies on day 1, 3, and 5 (if not discharged from hospital)&#xD;
           after surgery. Participants will continue to receive respective lung expansion therapy&#xD;
           as ordered three times per day, but without EIT monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Regional distribution of ventilation information will be displayed on the PulmoVista&#xD;
           500 device's main monitoring screen during lung expansion therapy. Clinical staff&#xD;
           administering therapy and participants will be blinded from information displayed on the&#xD;
           screen's monitor in an effort to reduce performance bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once lung expansion therapy session has ended, investigators will detach trunk cables&#xD;
           from electrode cables, detach reference electrode snap from adhesive ECG electrode,&#xD;
           unclamp the electrode belt, and then remove belt from the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigators will inspect the electrode belt contact area to assess for evidence of&#xD;
           skin irritation or bruising. Participant's physician will be notified of any significant&#xD;
           findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Displaying changes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once the PulmoVista 500 EIT device is removed from participant's room, the investigator&#xD;
           will change from main screen view to Display change view. Regional distribution of&#xD;
           ventilation information displayed on the PulmoVista 500 EIT device's screen will be used&#xD;
           to record pre and post lung expansion therapy end-expiratory lung impedance changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PulmoVista 500 EIT device will be removed participant's room and returned to a storage&#xD;
           location outside of patient care areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Following each EIT to participant interface disconnect, an alcohol, aldehyde, or&#xD;
                quaternary ammonium based compound will be soaked on a wipe cloth to disinfect the&#xD;
                surfaces of the patient cable, electrode belt, trunk cable, and EIT unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participant's head of bed will be returned to original position or to an elevation&#xD;
                that is preferred by the participant after therapy and monitoring session is&#xD;
                complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participant will continue with assigned lung expansion therapy as scheduled.&#xD;
