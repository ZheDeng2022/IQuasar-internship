    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to test and compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      of four supplementary foods for the treatment of moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) in normal&#xD;
      programmatic settings in Sierra Leone. Study participants will receive one of four test foods&#xD;
      varying in energy and nutrient density as well as amounts provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Super Cereal Plus (SC+) at 800 kcal/d, 215 g/d (Control group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Super Cereal (SC) and oil and sugar at 998 kcal/d - 200 g SC and 20 g oil and 20 g&#xD;
           sugar, per day&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Corn-soy Blend 14 (CSB14) and oil at 978 kcal/day - 150 g CSB14 and 45 g oil, per day&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Plumpy'Sup - 500 kcal/d, 92 g/d&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective, randomised, controlled effectiveness trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. (Impact) To compare the effectiveness of four supplementary foods in the treatment of&#xD;
           moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) in normal programmatic settings in Sierra Leone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. (Cost) To estimate the relative cost-effectiveness (marginal cost per child recovered&#xD;
           from MAM, relative to comparison group, SC+) of implementing the feeding program using&#xD;
           each commodity, taking into consideration costs of procurement/production and&#xD;
           distribution&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. (Process) To evaluate the determinants of effectiveness including: consumption&#xD;
           adherence, preparation compliance, targeting/sharing of supplement, food components and&#xD;
           preparation, adverse effects of foods, water contamination, hygiene and health&#xD;
           behaviors, SES, food security, perceived barriers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recovery from MAM&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Percent of children recovered from MAM (defined as achieving mid-upper arm&#xD;
                circumference (MUAC) ≥ 12.5 cm by 12 weeks once)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Percent default/non-response: children who do not recover after 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Percent relapse: children who become MAM again within 6 months of recovery&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mean number of weeks to recovery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The children with MAM fed Super Cereal and oil and sugar, CSB14 and oil or&#xD;
      Plumpy'Sup will have similar recovery outcomes to those children fed Super Cereal Plus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null: The children with MAM fed Super Cereal and oil and sugar, CSB14 and oil or Plumpy'Sup&#xD;
      will have different recovery outcomes to those children fed Super Cereal Plus.&#xD;
