    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential acute and chronic effect of&#xD;
      ticagrelor versus clopidogrel on arterial stiffness and other vascular risk markers of&#xD;
      interest, the study will consist of two periods: a 24-hour ACUTE period where 60 subjects&#xD;
      with an indication for coronary angiography (CA) with or without percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention (PCI) will be included, and a 30-day CHRONIC period where approximately 60&#xD;
      subjects that will undergo PCI will be included and studied (refer to Section 3 'Study Plan&#xD;
      and Procedures'). The primary objective of this study is to compare ticagrelor versus&#xD;
      clopidogrel regarding their effect on arterial stiffness as assessed by PWV, at 3 hours after&#xD;
      the loading dose of each regimen, in eligible subjects with CAD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is singe-center, randomized, assessor-blinded, active controlled, parallel-group trial&#xD;
      consisting of an 'acute' and a 'chronic' period, aiming at comparing ticagrelor versus&#xD;
      clopidogrel on the reduction of arterial stiffness and wave reflections in patients with CAD.&#xD;
      This Investigator-Sponsored Study (ISS) will be supported by AstraZeneca.&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 subjects fulfilling all study-specific eligibility criteria will be initially recruited&#xD;
      for the 'acute' study period of 24-hour duration. Subjects that will undergo ad hoc PCI will&#xD;
      continue in the subsequent 'chronic' study period of 30-day duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to have 60 subjects in the 'chronic' study period (since some of the 'acute' period&#xD;
      will not undergo PCI), additional subjects that are scheduled for elective PCI will be&#xD;
      recruited until the sample size of 'chronic' study period reaches 60 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study periods [Figure 1, Flow Chart] have as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the 24-hour ACUTE period, 60 subjects with an indication for elective CA with or without&#xD;
      PCI will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three (3) hours before the CA the subjects will be randomized in the two study treatment&#xD;
      arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ticagrelor arm: 30 subjects will receive&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1st maintenance ticagrelor dose of 90 mg at 12 hours. Clopidogrel arm: 30 subjects will&#xD;
           receive&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  600 mg loading dose of clopidogrel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study measurements (arterial stiffness, central blood pressure and endothelial function) for&#xD;
      both study treatment arms will be performed at:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  baseline (0 hours - prior to the loading dose administration)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 hours (after the loading dose of each regimen and before CA), and at&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24 hours (before the administration of the 2nd maintenance dose of ticagrelor and the&#xD;
           1st maintenance dose of clopidogrel).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the 30-day CHRONIC period, 60 subjects that will undergo PCI (stent implantation) will be&#xD;
      studied. Part of this 'chronic' period population will consist of the subjects that were&#xD;
      included in the 'acute' period and proceeded ad hoc to PCI. The remainder will be subjects&#xD;
      being scheduled for elective PCI, who will be enrolled after the completion of the&#xD;
      recruitment in the 'acute' study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 30 subjects will be allocated to ticagrelor loading dose and maintenance dose&#xD;
      (90 mg BID) thereafter and approximately 30 subjects will be allocated to 600 mg of&#xD;
      clopidogrel and maintenance dose (75 mg QD) thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study measurements for the subjects of the 'acute' period that will enter the 'chronic'&#xD;
      period will be performed at:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - 30 days post-PCI (prior to the administration of the morning maintenance dose of the&#xD;
      assigned treatment regimen at the day of study visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study measurements for the additional subjects with indication of elective PCI that will be&#xD;
      enrolled directly into the chronic study period will be performed at:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  baseline (0 hours - prior to the administration of the loading dose of each treatment&#xD;
           regimen and 3 hours before the PCI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30 days post PCI (prior to the administration of the morning maintenance dose of the&#xD;
           assigned treatment regimen at the day of study visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study-related procedures will be carried out in accordance with the institutional&#xD;
      guidelines and common practice.&#xD;
