  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When patients undergo in vitro fertilization (IVF), they often make more embryos than it is&#xD;
      safe to transfer back in the womb all at once. These excess embryos are frozen and stored for&#xD;
      future use. Frozen embryo transfer (FET) is therefore an important option of IVF where there&#xD;
      are extra embryos. FET should take place under ideal conditions when uterine receptivity and&#xD;
      uterine endometrial lining thickness are at the appropriate developmental stage as the&#xD;
      embryo. A common way of preparing the uterus for FET is by using medications (Estrogen and&#xD;
      Progesterone) that imitate a normal menstrual cycle while monitoring the endometrial lining&#xD;
      development by transvaginal ultrasound. Progesterone (P4) may be administered vaginally or&#xD;
      intra-muscularly (IM). The mode of Progesterone administration is based upon local&#xD;
      conventions, experts' opinion and patients' preferences. All the mentioned modalities are&#xD;
      common in the daily practice of IVF clinics across the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current medical literature does not present high quality evidence for the superiority of&#xD;
      one form of Progesterone administration over the other for FET. The investigators know that&#xD;
      in fresh embryo transfer cycles where natural follicles continue to function and produce&#xD;
      Progesterone as corpora lutea, there were no reported differences in pregnancy rates when&#xD;
      luteal vaginal P4 was compared with IM P4 support, but the investigators do not have the same&#xD;
      reassurance regarding frozen embryo transfers. The aim of this study is to compare vaginal&#xD;
      versus IM route of administration of P4 for FET cycle in a well-designed trial. Since many&#xD;
      outcome variables are possible, the investigators have chosen to concentrate in the one that&#xD;
      might shed light on a possible biological difference between the two modes of Progesterone&#xD;
      administration; uterine contractions. Uterine contractions have been previously recognized as&#xD;
      a possible factor that compromises success rates in patients undergoing IVF treatments.&#xD;
      Progesterone is considered a uterine relaxant and its levels in the blood versus the levels&#xD;
      in the uterus differ by its mode of administration: blood levels are higher when given IM&#xD;
      whereas uterine P4 concentrations are higher when given vaginally. The investigators are&#xD;
      interested to see whether IM progesterone in frozen embryo transfers presents a different&#xD;
      uterine contraction pattern than the vaginal administration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized un-blinded clinical trial for comparing uterine contractions frequency&#xD;
      in FET cycles between two medicated protocols of uterine lining programming. This study does&#xD;
      not involve any new medications, nor mode of administration, but merely a designed array for&#xD;
      evaluation of two existing well-established protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women undergoing Frozen embryo transfers (FET) at the blastocyst stage at the Toronto Centre&#xD;
      for Advanced Reproductive Technologies (TCART) will be approached to take part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-study Screening and Baseline Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will be recruited voluntarily at TCART clinic. The attending physician will&#xD;
      screen and identify potential female patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF)&#xD;
      blastocyst FET cycles. The staff physician will explain the general rational. The protocol of&#xD;
      the study and further explanations as well as the actual recruitment will be performed by a&#xD;
      nurse or a fellow who are not part of the treating team. If the patient gives her consent,&#xD;
      she will be randomized (computer generated block randomization) into one of the treatment&#xD;
      groups (vaginal P4 or IM P4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      FET medicated cycle protocol includes ten days of Estrace (micronized 17b-estradiol) starting&#xD;
      on day 3 of the cycle at a dose of 4 mg daily for 5 days followed by 8 mg daily for 5 days.&#xD;
      Routine monitoring takes place after the 10th treatment day - cycle day 13 - and involves a&#xD;
      longitudinal scan of the uterine cavity for endometrial thickness and pattern. This is not a&#xD;
      study visit but a routine one that is part of the investigators standard of care. The study&#xD;
      patients' monitoring will include one additional measurement (uterine contraction frequency&#xD;
      counted by number of contractions per minute). After achieving sufficient endometrial&#xD;
      proliferation (â‰¥7 mm thickness with a triple layer pattern) with estrogen exposure, the&#xD;
      patient starts progesterone use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized into the vaginal progesterone arm will start treatment with 200mg P4&#xD;
      suppositories 3 times a day. Patients randomized into the IM progesterone arm will start&#xD;
      treatment with 50mg P4 IM injection once daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blastocyst transfer is performed on the 6th day of P4 exposure. Standard of care is not&#xD;
      subjected to any change in this study. The usual management though does not include a repeat&#xD;
      Ultrasound imaging on the day of transfer: for the purpose of this study, ultrasound&#xD;
      monitoring will be performed just before the embryo transfer and will document endometrial&#xD;
      thickness, endometrial pattern and endometrial contractility (waves) as counted by number of&#xD;
      contractions per minute. For uniformity of measurement purposes and objectivity, the&#xD;
      monitoring will be performed at TCART by 2 highly qualified ultrasound technicians who are&#xD;
      not involved in patient management and who will be blinded as to the route of P4&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine management will follow the embryo transfer procedure: all patients will continue&#xD;
      Estrace and Progesterone. All of the patients (study and control) will resume vaginal&#xD;
      progesterone (200mg P4 suppositories 3 times a day).&#xD;
