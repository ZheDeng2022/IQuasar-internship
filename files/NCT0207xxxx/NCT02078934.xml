  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Incisional hernias occur in nearly 20% of all laparotomy incisions accounting for almost&#xD;
      400,000 ventral hernia repairs annually in the United States. There is an even higher&#xD;
      incidence of incisional hernia recurrence after prior repair if the patient is obese. Each&#xD;
      subsequent hernia repair leads to increased morbidity and durability. It is not infrequent&#xD;
      that many surgeons will advise overweight or obese patients to lose substantial weight prior&#xD;
      to complex incisional hernia repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, it is quite difficult for any individual to lose more than 8 pounds a month in a&#xD;
      safe, rapid, and sustainable fashion. This is based on losing 2 lbs. per week utilizing diet&#xD;
      and exercise alone. Many patients with incisional hernia are physically debilitated that they&#xD;
      cannot engage in any substantial physical activity to lose weight. Traditional laparoscopic&#xD;
      bariatric surgery (i.e. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and SG), while feasible, is a&#xD;
      technically challenging endeavor since prior abdominal surgeries increase the amount of&#xD;
      intra-abdominal adhesions. Furthermore, there is still a subset of patients who are not&#xD;
      candidates for laparoscopic weight loss surgery because of inability to tolerate&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum due to underlying physiologic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Novel minimally invasive endoscopic technique may help obese patients with an incisional&#xD;
      hernia lose weight in a safe and rapid fashion. Early case reports and small case series on&#xD;
      gastric bypass revision utilizing such endoscopic technique have shown promise in efficacious&#xD;
      weight loss. There have been reports of achieving nearly 20-25% excess weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abu Dayyeh and colleagues have also demonstrated that endoscopic gastric plication as a&#xD;
      primary weight loss procedure is feasible, but their reported follow-up was only 3 months.8&#xD;
      Brethauer, et al. from Cleveland Clinic performed transoral gastric volume reduction for&#xD;
      weight management in 18 patients (TRIM TRIAL). They utilized the Restore Suturing System&#xD;
      (Restore device) and reported a mean decrease in BMI of -4.0 ± 3.5 kg/m2. Mean excess weight&#xD;
      loss was 27.7% ± 21.9% with no reports of adverse events.9 There have also been reports of&#xD;
      not only weight loss but improved insulin sensitivity and secretion.10 Laparoscopic gastric&#xD;
      greater curvature plication afforded a mean 50.7% excess weight loss at 12 months.11&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intent of this study is not to demonstrate endoscopic suturing to be a primary option for&#xD;
      weight-loss surgery. Preliminary reports have shown such procedure is technically feasible&#xD;
      but not durable and the effects of the procedure varied widely among the study&#xD;
      participants.12 The investigators view this technology as a bridge for morbidly obese&#xD;
      patients, who will need subsequent surgery for another surgical disease, to improve their&#xD;
      body habitus and decrease their postoperative morbidity and mortality. The aims of the&#xD;
      investigators study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feasibility of endoscopic gastric sleeve plication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Define the technical aspects of endoscopic suturing for sleeve plication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide long-term follow-up for both weight loss and resolution of their co-morbidities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time from the endoscopic procedure to their incisional hernia repair&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photographic evidence of the stomach after endoscopic plication during the incisional&#xD;
           hernia repair&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several advantages for the proposed study. First it avoids entering the&#xD;
      intra-abdominal cavity. Second, the procedure is performed solely with sutures obviating the&#xD;
      need for stapling which may increase the risk of gastric leak from the staple line.13 Lastly,&#xD;
      it avoids placing endoscopic intra-luminal devices such as intragastric balloons or&#xD;
      duodenal-jejunal sleeves. Limiting factor of such devices is a high rate of premature device&#xD;
      withdrawal due to intolerance. Furthermore, their effects are short-lived as most devices&#xD;
      will need to be removed by 12 weeks and they only offer a mean 23.6% excess weight loss.13,&#xD;
      14&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implications of this study can be far-reaching. Once efficacy is demonstrated where&#xD;
      enough weight loss is achieved that patients can safely and quickly undergo their incisional&#xD;
      hernia surgery, the investigators can then conduct a retrospective case-control cross-matched&#xD;
      study to further delineate its true benefit. If there is a true benefit, then a randomized&#xD;
      control study can be employed in the future.&#xD;
