  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether prostatic arterial embolization (PAE)&#xD;
      compared is an effective and safe treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia in patients with&#xD;
      severe lower urinary tract symptoms not adequately controlled by medical therapy with&#xD;
      alpha-blockers, as assessed by the the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) after 6&#xD;
      months. Patients will be randomized on a 1:1 ratio to PAE or to a sham procedure and&#xD;
      evaluated at 1, 3 and 6 months. Patients randomized to the sham procedure will be offered the&#xD;
      possibility of performing PAE after 6 months. All patients may participate on an optional&#xD;
      6-months extension study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, parallel-group, evaluator-blind, superiority, controlled clinical trial&#xD;
      of PAE versus a sham procedure in patients with BPH with severe LUTS not adequately&#xD;
      controlled by medical therapy with alpha-blockers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has a screening visit at day -14, a baseline visit at day -2, a randomization and&#xD;
      intervention visit at day 0, follow up visits at months 1, 3 and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients initially randomized to the sham procedure and who completed the 6 month follow-up&#xD;
      period will be offered the possibility of performing PAE at no cost. All patients will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in a 6 months post-trial extension study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients over 45 years-old with a diagnosis of BPH associated with severe LUTS defined by an&#xD;
      IPSS&gt;=20 after a minimum of 6 months treatment with alpha-blockers and with a prostate volume&#xD;
      ≥ 40 mL will start a two weeks screening period. Eligible patients will be started either&#xD;
      tamsulosin 0.4 mg q.d., alfuzosin 10 mg q.d. or silodosin 8 mg q.d., which will be maintained&#xD;
      throughout the study period, and have the intervention scheduled for the following 2 days&#xD;
      (study day 0), when they will be randomized to PAE or to a sham procedure if the procedure is&#xD;
      technically feasible&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those patients in whom angiography has shown that PAE is technically feasible will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of the study arms on a 1:1 ratio. Patients in both groups will be submitted&#xD;
      to exactly the same procedure, except that patients randomized to the control group will not&#xD;
      be injected with polyvinyl alcohol particles. Patients will be discharged as soon as their&#xD;
      clinical condition is stabilized&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed at 1, 3 and 6 months with IPSS, QoL, IIEF, BPH-II and will perform&#xD;
      prostatic ultrasonography, uroflowmetry and PSA at month 1 and 6. At 1 month a pelvic NMR&#xD;
      will be performed to evaluate prostate volume and the degree of ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients completing the 6 month follow-up period will be invited to enter a 6 months&#xD;
      extension study. In this extension study, patients will be evaluated at month 12 for all&#xD;
      efficacy variables. Patients initially randomized to the sham procedure who wanted to perform&#xD;
      PAE after the conclusion of the trial will be evaluated only at months 1, 3 and 6 after PAE.&#xD;

    <description>The prostatic arteries are selectively catheterized with a Progreat 2.7 microcatheter and an angiography is performed to confirm that the catheter is in the prostatic artery. Bead Block 300-500 or PVA 100+200 micra particles are slowly injected under fluoroscopic control until the end point is reached. Embolization is considered finished when there is &quot;near stasis&quot; in the prostatic vessels with interruption of the arterial flow and prostatic gland opacification checked in both oblique and AP views. Upon finishing the embolization of the left prostatic arteries, the right prostatic arteries are embolized in the same way.</description>
