      Reminiscence group therapy is a brief and structured intervention that has been shown to be&#xD;
      effective for improving well-being among older adults. Reminiscence helps accepting the&#xD;
      ageing process by solving unresolved issues and past losses; the group setting empowers the&#xD;
      efficacy of the process by giving back to elderly a way to manage their skills in a wider&#xD;
      setting and interact with other people. The sharing of memories reinforces the identity&#xD;
      through active tasks, preparing individuals to cope with the final part of the life. However,&#xD;
      considering reminiscence interventions for older populations, controlled trials adopting&#xD;
      better inclusion/exclusion criteria, standardized measures, and different conditions for&#xD;
      comparing the effect are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to this premise, the trial presents the design of a randomized controlled aimed at&#xD;
      comparing group reminiscence therapy with a group recreational activity in a older&#xD;
      population. It includes two groups of approximately 20 hospitalized elderly: (1) the&#xD;
      Experimental Group, (2) the Control Group. Participants included in the Experimental Group&#xD;
      will receive a group reminiscence therapy of six sessions, while the Control Group will&#xD;
      participate in a recreational group discussion. Between design with repeated measures will be&#xD;
      used to evaluate changes in self-reported outcome measures of depressive symptoms,&#xD;
      self-esteem, life satisfaction, quality of life across baseline, post-intervention and three&#xD;
      months post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What the investigators would like to show with the present trial is the efficacy of a group&#xD;
      reminiscence intervention in a hospitalized population of older adults: focusing on specific&#xD;
      past events and re-living them in a group environment may enhance the self-esteem and quality&#xD;
      of life better than a simple group discussion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present trial is based on a randomized controlled study. The investigators will recruited&#xD;
      40 participants, including two groups of at least 20 hospitalized elderly: 1) the&#xD;
      experimental group 2) the control group. Participants included in the experimental condition&#xD;
      will take part to group reminiscence therapy sessions, while the control group will take part&#xD;
      to recreational group discussions. Psychometric outcomes will serve as quantitative dependent&#xD;
      variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group setting lead by two psychologists is planned for both conditions. Each meeting will&#xD;
      last 60 minutes and 6 participant will take part to it. The real setting will be the nursing&#xD;
      home: a comfortable room will be provided, accessible also to wheel-chairs, participants will&#xD;
      sit in circle. The involvement of each participant is encouraged, trying to stimulate the&#xD;
      discussion/debate in a positive atmosphere. Personal critics, moral judgments or political&#xD;
      statements are stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following, a description of the protocol in details for the experimental and the control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In the experimental condition, everything begins ensuring the participants that all the&#xD;
           memories shared will not be spread out of the group. Every session will deal with a&#xD;
           theme, recalling specific autobiographic experiences; they will be suggested following a&#xD;
           chronological order. Participants are encouraged to bring photos or objects related to&#xD;
           past themes: at the end of each meeting the theme of the following is revealed. The&#xD;
           researchers can also bring materials as cues for reminiscence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In the control condition, Every meeting will offer topics for discussion taken from&#xD;
           newspaper and newscasts: personal opinions are promoted, and links with the daily life&#xD;
           of participants are welcome (everyday activities, personal preferences). The main goal&#xD;
           is to stimulate the social interaction and the communication, without dealing with&#xD;
           personal events from the past nor private memories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-months follow up is planned in order to verify the efficacy of the training over time.&#xD;
