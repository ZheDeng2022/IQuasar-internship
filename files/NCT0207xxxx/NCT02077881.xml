  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial is designed to efficiently identify the regimen limiting toxicity (RLT)&#xD;
      and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the combination of the immunotherapeutic agent&#xD;
      indoximod when administered in combination with standard of care chemotherapy gemcitabine&#xD;
      plus nab-paclitaxel in subjects with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. All subjects&#xD;
      will receive the same standard gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel regimen, plus indoximod in&#xD;
      doses increasing from 600 mg twice daily to, potentially, 1200 mg twice daily.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II trial designed to evaluate the combination of the immunotherapeutic&#xD;
      agent indoximod and the standard of care chemotherapy gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel in&#xD;
      subjects with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. The phase 1 portion is designed to&#xD;
      identify the regimen-limiting toxicity (RLT) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the&#xD;
      combination. The phase 2 portion of the study will evaluate the potential efficacy of this&#xD;
      combination. All subjects will receive the standard 28-day gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel&#xD;
      regimen. Twice daily oral indoximod will be administered concurrently in continuous 28 day&#xD;
      cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase 1 portion, dose escalation of indoximod will begin at 600 mg twice a day and&#xD;
      potentially escalate to 1200 mg twice a day. There will be no intra-subject dose escalation.&#xD;
      Regimen-limiting toxicity will be considered as those toxicities related to indoximod that&#xD;
      significantly limit the administration of the backbone chemotherapy gemcitabine plus&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel. The period for determination of dose-limiting toxicities will be the initial&#xD;
      28 days of treatment. The recommended phase 2 dose will include an assessment of toxicities&#xD;
      that occur at later time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a RP2D is determined, the phase 2 portion of the study will be initiated. In both phase&#xD;
      1 and phase 2, every 2 cycles subjects will have repeat imaging to assess response. Corollary&#xD;
      biomarkers will be assessed at the same interval as will PET-CT after the 1st 8 week cycle.&#xD;
      Up to 18 patients will be enrolled in the phase 1 portion of the study and 80 patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled in the phase 2 portion.&#xD;
