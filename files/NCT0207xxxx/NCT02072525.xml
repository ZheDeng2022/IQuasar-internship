  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect serum samples for use as quality control samples in&#xD;
      GSK assays. The serum samples need to include samples with low, medium and high antibody&#xD;
      titers/concentrations, which cover the assay range.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to source human serum from plasma from healthy adults for use&#xD;
      as control samples in the assays supporting the clinical development of GSK Biologicals'&#xD;
      vaccines for the prevention of invasive infections caused by Neisseria meningitidis,&#xD;
      Streptococcus pneumoniae, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Clostridium tetani and Bordetella&#xD;
      pertussis. At the final visit, a small volume of whole blood will be obtained in addition to&#xD;
      plasma, to allow for head to head comparison of serum obtained from whole blood (off-clot&#xD;
      serum) and from plasma (serum derived from re-calcified plasma). In addition, sera generated&#xD;
      in this clinical trial could potentially be used as control samples for other vaccine&#xD;
      programs to help assure the quality of the analytical methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects 18 through 49 years of age (have not yet achieved 50th birthday) will be randomized&#xD;
      to receive Menveo + Boostrix and subjects 50 to 55 years of age will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      either Pneumovax 23 or Prevnar 13 and will serve as donors of human serum in this study.&#xD;
