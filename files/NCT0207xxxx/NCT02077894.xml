      Objective: The objective of this study is to identify genetic causes of inherited eye&#xD;
      conditions through whole exome or whole genome sequencing. This includes identifying&#xD;
      mutations in known genes or novel genes for recognized conditions, as well as identifying&#xD;
      mutations in novel genes for previously uncharacterized genetic conditions involving the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: We plan to recruit 810 participants, to include both probands with an eye&#xD;
      condition under study and unaffected family members. Ideally unaffected family members will&#xD;
      be parents of a proband.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Participants will be recruited through other pre-existing NIH protocols, such as the&#xD;
      NEI Screening protocol (08-EI-0102), the NEI Ocular Natural History protocol (16-EI-0134),&#xD;
      the Genetics of Inherited Eye Disease protocol (15-EI-0128), and the Genetics of Uveal&#xD;
      Coloboma protocol (13-EI-0049). Self-referred patients or patients referred by an outside&#xD;
      clinician will be screened for eligibility under a pre-existing NIH protocol. Phenotyped&#xD;
      patients eligible for participation and their unaffected family members will undergo genetic&#xD;
      counseling and will provide a blood sample and/or saliva sample for exome or genome&#xD;
      sequencing. Biological relationships will be confirmed prior to exome or genome sequencing.&#xD;
      Sequence data will be analyzed for primary variants associated with the proband s eye&#xD;
      condition and secondary findings (SFs), unless participants choose to opt-out of this part of&#xD;
      the analysis and reporting. All sequence variants deemed clinically relevant will be&#xD;
      validated in a CLIA-certified laboratory and the results will be returned to the participant&#xD;
      in-person or by telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: This is an etiologic study that will generate molecular information about&#xD;
      previously-recognized conditions for which participants did not have a molecular diagnosis,&#xD;
      as well as molecular information for previously uncharacterized conditions involving the eye.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Participant is affected with an eye condition under study, or is a family member&#xD;
                  of an affected individual who will be informative for WES/WGS analysis and&#xD;
                  interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Participant or legal guardian of participant understands and signs the informed&#xD;
                  consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants who cannot comply with study procedures are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants who are minors or participants who are adults and are decisionally&#xD;
             impaired are ineligible if they do not have a legal guardian who can consent and make&#xD;
             decisions on their behalf. Documentation of legal guardianship must be provided for&#xD;
             decisionally impaired adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants who are minors and under joint custody are ineligible if parents are in&#xD;
             disagreement about study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prospective participants or their legal guardians who, based on the judgment of the&#xD;
             team, appear to have impaired ability to understand and appropriately use complex&#xD;
             medical and genetic information, or to cope with potentially life altering medical&#xD;
             information, will be ineligible.&#xD;
