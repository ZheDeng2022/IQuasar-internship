    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if Magnetic Resonance guided High Intensity Focused&#xD;
      Ultrasound ablative therapy is safe and feasible for children, adolescents, and young adults&#xD;
      with refractory or relapsed solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic Resonance (MR)-guided high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is an innovative&#xD;
      technique that allows for non-invasive thermal ablation of tissue. Advantages over&#xD;
      conventional local tumor control such as surgery, radiation, or radiofrequency are that&#xD;
      MR-HIFU is completely non-invasive, non-ionizing, and enables ablation of large tumor volumes&#xD;
      with avoidance of adjacent tissue injury. This study will evaluate the safety and feasibility&#xD;
      of MR-HIFU ablative therapy in children, adolescents, and young adults with refractory or&#xD;
      relapsed solid tumors that are located in bone or soft tissue in close proximity to bone.&#xD;
      Patients ≤ 30 years of age with refractory or relapsed solid tumors with measurable target&#xD;
      lesions that are located in bone or soft tissue in close proximity to bone are eligible.&#xD;
      Tolerability will be defined during the 14 days following MR-HIFU ablation. Patients will&#xD;
      continue to be followed for tumor response and secondary outcomes for up to one year post&#xD;
      ablation treatment.&#xD;
