      The objective of the NAVIGATE X4 Clinical Study is to gather data to establish the safety,&#xD;
      performance and effectiveness of the ACUITY™ X4 quadripolar coronary venous leads and the&#xD;
      RELIANCE 4-FRONT™ ventricular defibrillation leads to satisfy FDA requirements for pre-market&#xD;
      submission. Additionally, data from this study will be used to support post-market approval&#xD;
      requirements for the ACUITY X4 and RELIANCE 4-FRONT leads.&#xD;

             nature. The decision if a desired mandatory governmental registry or observational&#xD;
             study/ registry is in conflict with this exclusion criterion is up to the enrolling&#xD;

          <description>All subjects that signed the informed consent were included.&#xD;
Subjects consent to undergo an implant procedure to receive at least one study device: ACUITY X4 LV lead, RELIANCE 4-FRONT RV lead. Each subject was allowed to be implanted with both leads.&#xD;
ACUITY X4 quadripolar coronary venous lead: The ACUITY X4 leads are intended for chronic left ventricular pacing and sensing. The leads have 3 tip configuration designs (straight tip, short tip spiral, and long tip spiral), which is intended to provide choices for patients with different anatomies.&#xD;
RELIANCE 4-FRONT defibrillation lead: The RELIANCE 4-FRONT leads are designed for right-side heart applications within the ventricle, atrium, and superior vena cava. It is intended for permanent sensing, pacing, and defibrillation when used with a compatible ICD or CRT-D.</description>

          <title>QRS duration</title>
          <description>The QRS duration represents the time for ventricular depolarization (activation), starting at the Q wave and ending at the S wave, as measured from an electrocardiogram (ECG). Q waves are inscribed when the initial QRS vector is directed away from the positive electrode. The R wave is the first positive deflection of the QRS complex. The negative deflection after the R wave is the S wave.</description>
