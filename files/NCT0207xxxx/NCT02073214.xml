  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety of a probiotic foodstuff and its&#xD;
      influence on emergence and development of natural intestinal flora and the clinical status of&#xD;
      premature very low birth weight neonates. The study was also intended to investigate&#xD;
      reduction of colonisation by pathogenic bacteria and to estimate the incidence of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probotic bacteria contained in the investigational product administered directly after birth&#xD;
      are beneficial for the development of normal gut microflora and can prevent or significantly&#xD;
      limit gastrointestinal colonisation by pathogenic bacteria and the development of pathogenic&#xD;
      flora in a hospital setting. Permanent colonisation with commensal flora in very early life&#xD;
      improves gastrointestinal function in premature neonates by reducing the onset of or by&#xD;
      decreasing the severity of the signs and symptoms of feeding intolerance and generalised&#xD;
      bacterial infections, including sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neonates defined as having very low birth weight (VLBW) are found to have a number of&#xD;
      conditions typical for this period of life and body weight at birth. Perinatal and neonatal&#xD;
      infections are relatively common in these babies, which can be attributed to their&#xD;
      immunological immaturity (immature cellular or humoral immune responsiveness) and&#xD;
      insufficient gastrointestinal tract colonisation by non-pathogenic bacteria, the presence of&#xD;
      which depends on the type of delivery, feeding and environment in which the neonates are&#xD;
      nursed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care units, particularly low birth-weight neonates&#xD;
      born prematurely or with congenital disorders, are most susceptible. Probiotics administered&#xD;
      to neonates are known to compete with pathogenic bacteria for essential nutrients and&#xD;
      receptor sites, and to enzymatically modify toxin receptors. They are also known to produce&#xD;
      antimicrobial substances, acidify the intestinal environment and stimulate the immune system,&#xD;
      helping it reach full maturity. These are the reasons why intestinal microflora normalisation&#xD;
      with the help of probiotics can be beneficial for VLBW neonates, especially those requiring&#xD;
      intensive medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a review of clinical studies on the use of probiotics in NEC prevention in neonates,&#xD;
      demonstrated beneficial effects of probiotics in a group of VLBW neonates compared to&#xD;
      placebo. There are scientific reasons to believe that probiotics administered to neonates&#xD;
      modulate the composition of the gut flora colonising the intestinal tract and are beneficial&#xD;
      for the development and maturity of the immune system. In hitherto clinical studies, specific&#xD;
      probiotic strains were found to provide beneficial effects by limiting infections in the&#xD;
      neonatal period, including necrotizing enterocolitis in VLBW neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this multicentre, randomized study was to investigate whether the use of a&#xD;
      probiotic preparation containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus KL53A and Bifidobacterium breve PB04&#xD;
      influence on emergence and development of natural intestinal flora and the clinical status of&#xD;
      premature very low birth weight neonates and reduction of colonisation by pathogenic bacteria&#xD;
      and to estimate the incidence of gastrointestinal disorders. The study took place between&#xD;
      April 2012 and July 2013 in eight study centres in Poland. It was conducted in accordance&#xD;
      with the original protocol and according to ICH-GCP requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of subject's participation in the trial was approximately 49 days, or until they&#xD;
      were withdrawn or discharged from the hospital, whichever came earlier, prior to day 49.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the trial did not concern medicinal product but the foodstuff (food for special medical&#xD;
      purpose) it did not require Authority approval but was only subject to relevant Ethics&#xD;
      Committee approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study only included neonates who fulfilled the eligibility criteria, after obtaining an&#xD;
      informed consent from their parents/legal guardians, to have their baby enrolled in the study&#xD;
      and randomized into one of the two study groups: probiotic or placebo. Investigational&#xD;
      product were administered during the first 48h of life, at the time of the enteral feed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy evaluation was to determine whether the investigational product positively&#xD;
      influences the emergence and progressive development of the natural gut flora and the&#xD;
      clinical status of preterm VLBW neonates. As part of the efficacy evaluation, it was also&#xD;
      examined whether the probiotic agent has the capacity to inhibit pathogenic colonisation and&#xD;
      to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal disorders, as compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety was evaluated by determining whether investigational product in VLBW preterm neonates&#xD;
      increases AE/SAE incidence and influences the type of adverse events and serious adverse&#xD;
      events as compared to placebo.&#xD;
