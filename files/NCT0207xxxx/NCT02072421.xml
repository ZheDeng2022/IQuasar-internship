      The primary objective of the Post-Randomization Phase Cohort Study is to continue to assess&#xD;
      the safety of non-emergency PCI performed at hospitals without cardiac surgery on-site in&#xD;
      patients with myocardial ischemia (other than ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction&#xD;
      [STEMI]).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The MASS COMM Post-Randomization Phase Cohort Study (&quot;Cohort Study&quot; is a prospective,&#xD;
      multi-center, single-arm study of non-emergency PCI performed at non-SOS hospitals in&#xD;
      patients with myocardial ischemia (other than STEMI). The Cohort Study is designed to allow&#xD;
      non-SOS hospitals to continue to perform non-emergency PCI after enrollment to the MASS COMM&#xD;
      trial is completed and before the 30-day and 12-month results are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, all eligible subjects, after enrollment to the MASS COMM randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial is completed and before the final results are available and a decision is reached by&#xD;
      the MA-DPH, will be consented and enrolled into this Cohort Study. Subjects will be followed&#xD;
      through 30 days post procedure.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Angiographic Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The target lesion(s) is (are) de novo or restenotic (including in-stent restenotic)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Target lesions(s) is (are) located in an infarct (if not treated with primary PCI) or&#xD;
             non-infarct-related artery with a 70% or greater stenosis (by visual estimate) greater&#xD;
             than 72 hours following the STEMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Lesions treated with PCI greater than 72 hours following STEMI would be subject to the same&#xD;

        abnormal stress test).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The patient is pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of ST segment elevation myocardial infarction within 72 hours of the intended&#xD;

             cannot be adequately premedicated).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A platelet count less than 75,000 cells/mm3 or greater than 700,000 cells/mm3 or a WBC&#xD;

             not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the current&#xD;
             study endpoints. (Note: Trials requiring extended follow-up for products that were&#xD;
             investigational, but have since become commercially available, are not considered&#xD;
             investigational trials).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior participation in the MASS-COMM Trial, unless the patient has completed the&#xD;
             12-month follow-up for the Trial, and/or prior participation in the Cohort Study,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Within 30 days prior to the index Cohort Study procedure, the subject has undergone a&#xD;
             previous coronary interventional procedure of any kind. Note: This exclusion criterion&#xD;

             the subject's ability to participate in the study or comply with follow-up&#xD;
             requirements or impact the scientific integrity of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Angiographic Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has normal or insignificant coronaries (i.e., coronary lesion(s) less than 50%&#xD;
             stenosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any target vessel has evidence of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. excessive thrombus (e.g., requires target vessel thrombectomy)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. tortuosity (greater than 60 degree angle) that makes it unsuitable for proper&#xD;
                  stent delivery and deployment,&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. heavy calcification.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any target lesion requires treatment with a device other than PTCA prior to stent&#xD;
             placement (e.g. but not limited to, directional coronary atherectomy, excimer laser,&#xD;
             rotational atherectomy, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any lesion that is located in a saphenous vein graft, however, lesions located within&#xD;
             the native vessel but accessed through the graft are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The target vessel is in a &quot;last remaining&quot; epicardial vessel (e.g., &gt;2 non-target&#xD;
             epicardial vessels and the bypass grafts to these territories [if present] are totally&#xD;
             occluded).&#xD;
