  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity usually brings with it disturbances in the body that increase the chances of&#xD;
      developing serious diseases like diabetes and cancer. These disturbances include one or more&#xD;
      symptoms of a condition called &quot;metabolic syndrome&quot; that often leads to diabetes. High levels&#xD;
      of damage to the DNA that makes up our chromosomes have also been observed in obese people.&#xD;
      It is possible that these two disturbances are connected. The goal of this project is to test&#xD;
      this whether consumption of blueberries will improve these abnormalities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unbalanced diets rich in refined carbohydrate calories, saturated fats, and trans fats, but&#xD;
      low in vitamins, minerals, fiber, polyphenolics and Ï‰-3 fatty acids are common in the United&#xD;
      States, particularly among the obese. Insulin resistance and high levels of DNA damage&#xD;
      commonly accompany obesity. There also appears to be a relationship between oxidative&#xD;
      DNA-damage and biomarkers that characterize metabolic syndrome. The bioactivity of&#xD;
      blueberries is usually attributed to their high content of polyphenolics which can reduce&#xD;
      oxidative DNA damage. Since oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA is a suggested causal&#xD;
      factor leading to increased insulin resistance, we will test if blueberry consumption can be&#xD;
      an ameliorative dietary factor for insulin resistance as well. If blueberry consumption both&#xD;
      shifts metabolism away from insulin resistance and reduces DNA damage, it may be a useful&#xD;
      tool to assist in understanding relationships between these two obesity-associated&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
