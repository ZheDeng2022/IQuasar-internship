  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the clinical benefit of employing the 23-valent&#xD;
      pneumococcal vaccine among US military trainees. Secondary objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determining the etiology of clinical pneumonia among U.S. military trainees;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  comparing the serotype distribution of S. pneumoniae (Sp) isolates recovered from&#xD;
           vaccinated and nonvaccinated trainees diagnosed with pneumonia; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  comparing days lost from training due to pneumonia or acute respiratory disease for&#xD;
           vaccinated and nonvaccinated subjects.&#xD;

      Study participants. Given their documented high rates of respiratory illness, US military&#xD;
      trainees were selected for participation. A sample size of 166,744 person-years was&#xD;
      calculated based on the following assumptions: 12% attrition from military training, clinical&#xD;
      pneumonia attack rate of 11 cases per 1000 person-years, 20% of captured pneumonias caused by&#xD;
      Sp, 90% of captured Sp pneumonias caused by a vaccine-covered Sp strain, and 70% vaccine&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment and follow-up. This study was approved by multiple Department of Defense (DoD)&#xD;
      institutional review boards. Using an informed consent process, basic training recruits at 5&#xD;
      recruit training centers (in South Carolina, Missouri, Illinois, and California) were invited&#xD;
      to participate during their first week of training. Pregnancy screening was performed on all&#xD;
      women, and those with positive results were not enrolled. Exclusion criteria included having&#xD;
      previously received the a 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine during the previous 5 years or&#xD;
      having a medical condition that either required or precluded pneumococcal vaccination. Study&#xD;
      participants completed a study questionnaire and were administered a pre-packaged, blinded,&#xD;
      and randomized injection containing either the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine (Wyeth&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals or Merck &amp; Company, Inc.) or saline in a 1:1 ratio. Study injections were&#xD;
      administered at the same time as other recruit in-processing vaccinations, which may have&#xD;
      included vaccines against polio, measles-mumps-rubella, varicella, tetanus-diphtheria,&#xD;
      hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, meningococcal disease (A/C/Y/W135), and influenza. At&#xD;
      the end of recruit training, a questionnaire was administered to capture symptoms and signs&#xD;
      of illnesses which might have been missed captured by the active and passive surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As enrollment continued for more than two years, the person-year contributions of those first&#xD;
      enrolled were greater than those enrolled near the trial's end. The original planned&#xD;
      surveillance period was 1.7 years. This was later extended to 6.7 years from enrollment of&#xD;
      the first participant, for continued monitoring of impact in this large double-blinded trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specimen collection. During the active surveillance period, study participants with suspect&#xD;
      pneumonia were identified by the attending physician. Study personnel obtained three throat&#xD;
      swabs, blood cultures (aerobic and anaerobic), sputum sample (if producible), and acute serum&#xD;
      samples from participants. Attempts were made to also capture a convalescent serum sample 2&#xD;
      weeks after the acute presentation on all radiographically-confirmed pneumonia cases. These&#xD;
      attempts were not always successful. Barriers included: trainee discharge from military&#xD;
      service, difficulty in obtaining access to the recruits when they were in field exercises,&#xD;
      and recruits graduating and moving to new duty stations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory methods. Specimens collected from study participants were examined using classic,&#xD;
      molecular, and serologic laboratory methods at the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC)&#xD;
      Respiratory Disease Laboratory, a College of American Pathologist (CAP) accredited&#xD;
      laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NHRC isolated adenovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus from&#xD;
      pharyngeal swabs using fluorescent antibody antigen tests. Adenovirus and influenza isolates&#xD;
      were typed using standard viral identification techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sputum specimens were inoculated for Sp culture using standard techniques. When Sp species&#xD;
      were identified, capsular serotyping was performed, and standard antimicrobial sensitivities&#xD;
      were assessed. Paired acute and convalescent sera were assessed for IgM and IgG titers to&#xD;
      pneumolysin. Sera were tested with an enzyme immunoassay using a procedure such as described&#xD;
      by Kalin, M, et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Chlamydophila pneumoniae polymerase chain reaction (PCR) study, throat swabs were&#xD;
      collected from patients diagnosed with pneumonia, immediately placed in Chlamydia transport&#xD;
      media, and transported on ice. The throat swabs were used in a direct PCR method, such as the&#xD;
      procedure described by Campbell et al. Amplification products were analyzed by&#xD;
      electrophoresis through a 1.5% agarose gel by standard methods. Sample preparation, PCR&#xD;
      amplification, and analysis of amplification products were performed in separate rooms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess M. pneumoniae, a throat swab was collected and immediately placed into 2.0 ml of M.&#xD;
      pneumoniae transport media (SP-4 broth). Culturing, sub-culturing, and molecular testing was&#xD;
      performed as per previously published protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capturing disease outcomes. Outcome measures included any cause pneumonia, any cause&#xD;
      respiratory disease, recruit training clinical pneumonia (radiographically-confirmed during&#xD;
      the recruit training period), or days lost from training. Active surveillance was conducted&#xD;
      for radiographically-confirmed pneumonias only during the recruit training period (Marines-12&#xD;
      weeks, Navy-8 weeks, Army-9 weeks). Passive electronic monitoring of health care encounters&#xD;
      for outcomes other than recruit training clinical pneumonia took place during recruit&#xD;
      training and at the subsequent duty stations using the DoD comprehensive electronic databases&#xD;
      of outpatient healthcare encounters (SADR), inpatient encounters (SIDR), and encounters at&#xD;
      civilian facilities billed to the DoD (HCSR). ICD-9-CM codes 480 through -486 and 487 were&#xD;
      monitored for these outcomes throughout the entire study period. Meningitis cases (ICD-9-CM&#xD;
      codes 320 through -320.2, 320.9, and 322.9) were also captured through these electronic&#xD;
      databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis. After descriptive investigation of population characteristics,&#xD;
      univariate analyses were performed to assess the significance of associations between&#xD;
      demographic variables with acute respiratory infection, pneumonia, and&#xD;
      radiographically-confirmed pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active surveillance time was calculated from the participant's enrollment date to the&#xD;
      projected completion of training, or diagnosis with radiographically-confirmed pneumonia.&#xD;
      Passive surveillance was calculated from the date of enrollment to June 01 2007, diagnosis&#xD;
      with pneumonia or acute respiratory infection, or separation from active duty service,&#xD;
      whichever occurred first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using regression diagnostics, collinearity among variables was investigated. Cox's&#xD;
      proportional hazard time-to-event modeling was used to evaluate outcomes among study&#xD;
      participants, while adjusting for differences in population characteristics between treatment&#xD;
      arms and accounting for different enrollment dates and active and passive surveillance&#xD;
      periods. The saturated Cox regression model was reduced by a manual backward stepwise&#xD;
      elimination approach removing those variables that were insignificant at Î± = 0.05 level and&#xD;
      not confounding the other measures of association. Additionally, cumulative probabilities of&#xD;
      outcomes from enrollments through end of follow-up periods were graphed. Statistical modeling&#xD;
      to produce adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was&#xD;
      performed using Statistical Analysis System (SAS) software (Version 9.0, SAS Institute, Inc.,&#xD;
      Cary, North Carolina).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crude vaccine effectiveness measures for each outcome were calculated for all participants&#xD;
      and for each branch of service using a 1-relative risk x 100% estimate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Days lost from training were estimated using a survey administered at the end of training to&#xD;
      a convenience sample of 71,692 study participants. Differences between treatment arms were&#xD;
      evaluated using ANOVA.&#xD;
