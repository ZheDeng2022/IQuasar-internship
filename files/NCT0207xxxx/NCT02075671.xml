  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory disorder that is characterized by severe flushing&#xD;
      (transient erythema), non-transient erythema, papules, pustules, and telangiectasia. Topical&#xD;
      therapy is not always effective in treating symptoms of rosacea. Furthermore, rapid&#xD;
      recurrence is common following the use of systemic antibiotics, resulting in the chronic use&#xD;
      of these medications to control the disease. Although the exact pathogenesis of rosacea is&#xD;
      unknown, treatment for this condition has been investigated based on its similarity to acne&#xD;
      and photodamaged skin. Case reports have shown promising results in rosacea patients treated&#xD;
      with methyl aminolevulinate photodynamic therapy (MAL - PDT). Other than a case report which&#xD;
      observed significant improvement of papules, pustules, erythema, and flushing following 5 -&#xD;
      aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) treatment of a patient with rosacea, the&#xD;
      role of ALA-PDT in the treatment of rosacea has not been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have designed a pilot study investigating the efficacy of ALA-PDT in treating&#xD;
      papulopustular rosacea. The objectives of the study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate improvement of the inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, nodules),&#xD;
           erythema, and telangiectasia of rosacea as assessed by the Investigator's Global&#xD;
           Assessment (IGA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate improvement of the inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, nodules) of&#xD;
           rosacea as assessed by the Inflammatory Lesion Investigator's Global Assessment (ILIGA).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate improvement of rosacea associated erythema as assessed by the Clinical&#xD;
           Erythema Assessment (CEA) scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate improvement of the inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, nodules) of&#xD;
           rosacea as measured by a difference in inflammatory lesion count.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate improvement of rosacea as assessed by the Patient Overall Assessment Scale.&#xD;
