      The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines place symptomatic&#xD;
      severe Aortic Stenosis as a class I indication for aortic valve replacement. With the&#xD;
      recently approved Edwards-Sapien TAVR device and the ongoing investigations using the&#xD;
      CoreValve TAVR device, patients ineligible or at high risk for open-heart surgery are now&#xD;
      eligible to undergo TAVR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients selected for TAVR undergo an EKG-gated cardiac Multislice CTA to evaluate aortic&#xD;
      valve anatomy and aortic root dimensions for device sizing, as well as coronary angiography&#xD;
      to define coronary anatomy. Both tests utilize contrast media to visualize anatomy, which may&#xD;
      result in contrast-induced nephropathy in anywhere from 7.5% to more than 50% of patients&#xD;
      depending on associated clinical risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need to consolidate this pre-operative testing whenever possible, and with&#xD;
      real-time 3-dimensional visualization of aortic valve and root anatomy using DynaCT cardiac&#xD;
      acquisition in the cath lab angiography suite during the coronary angiography, there may be a&#xD;
      benefit with reduced contrast load (20 to 35cc for DynaCT, 100cc for CTA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would like to make a comparison of aortic valve and root measurements using CTA and DynaCT&#xD;
      to affirm the accuracy of DynaCT vs the CTA gold standard.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Calcific or degenerative aortic valve disease is one of the most common valvular diseases&#xD;
      among the elderly and, with life expectancy continuing to increase, a major source of burden&#xD;
      on current healthcare. Although patients with aortic stenosis (AS) can remain asymptomatic&#xD;
      for a prolonged period, they do eventually develop symptoms, including angina, exertional&#xD;
      syncope and heart failure, which is associated with a 5-year, 3-year, and 1-year,&#xD;
      respectively, 50% mortality. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association&#xD;
      guidelines place symptomatic severe AS as a class I indication for aortic valve replacement.&#xD;
      Currently, surgical replacement of the aortic valve is the standard of care. However, with&#xD;
      the recently approved Edwards-Sapient TAVR device and the ongoing investigations using the&#xD;
      CoreValve TAVR device, patients ineligible or at high risk for open-heart surgery are now&#xD;
      eligible to undergo TAVR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, patients selected for TAVR undergo an EKG-gated cardiac Multislice CTA to evaluate&#xD;
      aortic valve anatomy and aortic root dimensions for device sizing. Patients also undergo&#xD;
      coronary angiography to define coronary anatomy. Both tests utilize contrast media to&#xD;
      visualize anatomy, which may result in contrast-induced nephropathy in anywhere from 7.5% to&#xD;
      more than 50% of patients depending on associated clinical risk factors. Contrast-induced&#xD;
      nephropathy can, in turn, lead to dialysis and/or increased mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need to consolidate this pre-operative testing whenever possible, and with&#xD;
      real-time 3-dimensional visualization of aortic valve and root anatomy using DynaCT cardiac&#xD;
      acquisition in the cath lab angiography suite during the coronary angiography, there may be a&#xD;
      benefit with reduced contrast load (20 to 35cc for DynaCT, 100cc for CTA). DynaCT conducts&#xD;
      fully automatic aortic root segmentation and overlays 3-dimensional structures onto&#xD;
      2-dimensional fluoroscopy in a few seconds (~5 seconds, 60 frames/second rotational&#xD;
      angiography). The software automatically recognizes and represents the aortic root, detects&#xD;
      and indicates coronary ostia and lowest cusp points of aortic valve (nadir points), and&#xD;
      reconstructs commissure lines of aortic valve. Due to cardiac motion, 3-dimensional images&#xD;
      without motion correction or cardiac gating will look blurred. Therefore, DynaCT&#xD;
      reconstruction motion correction software will be used. The DynaCT motion correction software&#xD;
      is a new algorithm that will correct for this motion and apply it during reconstruction-&#xD;
      allowing the user to spin without using rapid pacing. However, first, a comparison of aortic&#xD;
      valve and root measurements using CTA and DynaCT must be made to affirm the accuracy of&#xD;
      DynaCT vs the CTA gold standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This is a pilot study evaluating patients undergoing TAVR at the New York&#xD;
      University (NYU) Langone Medical Center. Patients will undergo the standard CTA protocol and&#xD;
      invasive coronary angiography performed as part of the pre-operative assessment for TAVR.&#xD;
      However, patients in this study will also undergo DynaCT during coronary angiography,&#xD;
      utilizing 1 acquisition sweep and 20 to 35cc more of contrast media. Measurements of the&#xD;
      major aortic annulus diameter, orthogonal minor aortic annulus diameter, aortic annulus&#xD;
      perimeter, maximum ascending aorta diameter at 40mm above the annulus, sinus of Valsalva&#xD;
      diameters, sinus of Valsalva heights, and aortic root angulation will be made using both the&#xD;
      CTA and DynaCT protocols by a radiologist blinded to patient identity after the study has&#xD;
      reached its target recruitment. Based on these measurements, a trained interventional&#xD;
      cardiologist will select the appropriate TAVR size in a similarly blinded fashion after the&#xD;
      study has reached its target recruitment (i.e. the data collected using DynaCT will not be&#xD;
      used in the clinical decision making process). Data will be compared from both modalities&#xD;
      using appropriate tests of reproducibility and correlation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Technique CTA will be performed per standard methods as part of standard pre-TAVR&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary angiography will be performed via femoral artery access (minimum 6Fr) as per&#xD;
      standard pre-TAVR evaluation. After coronary angiography is performed, a 6Fr pigtail catheter&#xD;
      will be placed in the aorta and 40cc of 50% contrast media diluted normal saline will be&#xD;
      delivered using standard automated injection during dynaCT cardiac image acquisition.&#xD;
      Intravenous delivery of contrast was considered as alternative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As per standard care, intravenous access will be obtained and participants will be hydrated&#xD;
      during the CTA, coronary angiography, and dynaCT procedures.&#xD;
