  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to evaluate the impact of an electronic pharmaceutical record used for&#xD;
      medication reconciliation by a pharmacist associated to the anesthesiologist consultation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      medication reconciliation by a pharmacist using an electronic pharmaceutical record before&#xD;
      the anesthesiologist consultation for planned surgery patients. The clinical pharmacist&#xD;
      communicates the recommendations regarding the drug therapy to the anesthesiologist orally&#xD;
      and using a specific formulary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional anesthesiologist consultation for planned surgery patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anesthesiology consultation is mandatory in France for planned surgery. It is part of the&#xD;
      concept of anesthesia safety. The main goal is to assess the anesthetic and surgical risk&#xD;
      including clinical and drug features likely to interfere with the anesthesia. The medication&#xD;
      reconciliation is a central part of this consultation especially in order to assess the&#xD;
      allergic risk and hemostasis disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, access to comprehensive and reliable data concerning the consumption of health&#xD;
      products by the patient represents a major challenge. The &quot;Dossier Pharmaceutique&quot; (DP) is an&#xD;
      electronic pharmaceutical record including medications (prescribed medications, over the&#xD;
      counter medications, complementary and alternative medicines) delivered by community&#xD;
      pharmacists over a four month period. Hospital pharmacists have access to the DP of&#xD;
      hospitalized patients in order to improve the quality of the medication reconciliation. These&#xD;
      informations regarding medication of the patients will be shared with anesthesiologists.&#xD;
