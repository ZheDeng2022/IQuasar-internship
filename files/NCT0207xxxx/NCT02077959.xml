  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide and pidilizumab&#xD;
      and to see how well they work in treating patients with multiple myeloma that has come back&#xD;
      (relapsed) or has not responded to treatment (refractory). Biological therapies, such as&#xD;
      lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from&#xD;
      growing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pidilizumab, can block cancer growth by blocking the&#xD;
      ability of cancer to grow and spread. Giving lenalidomide with pidilizumab may work better in&#xD;
      treating relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety and efficacy of CT-011 (pidilizumab)&#xD;
      in combination with lenalidomide (Revlimid) and assess efficacy in terms of overall response&#xD;
      rate in patients with relapse/refractory multiple myeloma (MM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) daily on days 1-21 and pidilizumab intravenously&#xD;
      (IV) over 2 hours on day 3. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;
