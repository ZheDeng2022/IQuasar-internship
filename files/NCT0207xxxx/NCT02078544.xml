      The purpose of the study is to identify biomarkers and potentially actionable mutations/&#xD;
      activated molecular pathways and evaluate the impact of molecular profiling information on&#xD;
      patients with gynaecological cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of gynaecological tumour samples will allow us to identify novel and/or&#xD;
           actionable molecular changes that may drive therapeutic strategies for the management of&#xD;
           these cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Molecular profiling will improve the outcome of novel targeted-agent treatment in&#xD;
           clinical trials&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Molecular profiling of paired samples (primary/recurrent and primary/metastatic) will&#xD;
           provide new insights into mechanisms underlying drug resistance and metastasis in&#xD;
           gynaecological cancers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Advances in our understanding of cancer biology has led to a rapid expansion of molecularly&#xD;
      targeted therapeutics in pre-clinical and clinical development over the last decade. The&#xD;
      systematic sequencing of cancer genomes has revealed that individual tumours frequently&#xD;
      harbor multiple &quot;driver&quot; somatic mutations that confer growth advantage and positive&#xD;
      selection. Importantly, many of the altered proteins resulting from the mutations identified&#xD;
      by these studies are in fact actionable, i.e. &quot;druggable&quot;, targets. Hence, evaluating drug&#xD;
      efficacy in tumours selected by a combination of histopathology and molecular analysis has&#xD;
      the potential to result in a greater therapeutic gain. The premises behind personalised&#xD;
      cancer medicine include: i) genetic aberrations exist in human malignancies; ii) a subset of&#xD;
      these aberrations frequently exist across multiple tumour types and have functional relevance&#xD;
      as drivers for oncogenesis and tumour progression; iii) the molecular effects of these&#xD;
      genetic aberrations are potentially actionable targets; and iv) there are medicinal compounds&#xD;
      that can safely and effectively modulate such targets in patients with these tumours. The key&#xD;
      challenge to optimising this personalised approach to cancer therapy is to ensure that&#xD;
      patients with tumours harbouring specific molecular/ genetic aberrations are specifically&#xD;
      matched to a particular drug or combination of drugs. In this respect, molecular analysis of&#xD;
      tumours to identify somatic mutations and/or other genetic aberrations are examples of&#xD;
      enrichment strategies to assist in matching patients to drugs or treatments that have gained&#xD;
      increasing interest in the oncology communityGenetic heterogeneity in gynaecological cancer&#xD;
      underpins the observed variations in patient outcomes. Hence, the ability to characterise the&#xD;
      unique genetic features of each patient's tumour will be a critical step to identifying the&#xD;
      optimal therapeutic strategy for the individual.It is anticipated that once a validated&#xD;
      process for molecular profiling is fully established at NUHS, this will eventually be&#xD;
      integrated into patient care at a much earlier stage. The spectrum and development of&#xD;
      molecularly-targeted agents is rapidly expanding, and it is increasingly likely that the&#xD;
      future of cancer management will require the molecular and histological subtype of one's&#xD;
      tumour to be defined in order to decide on the most appropriate treatment strategy. By&#xD;
      initiating this first step towards the development of a well-validated, cohesive, streamlined&#xD;
      and efficient process for molecular profiling, the eventual aim will be to obtain formal&#xD;
      accreditation so that cancer physicians at NUHS/NCIS, NCC and KKH will be able to&#xD;
      unequivocally use the data for patient care.&#xD;
