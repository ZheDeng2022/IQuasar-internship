      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of goserelin plus fulvestrant 500mg&#xD;
      comparing with goserelin plus anastrozole as first line endocrine therapy for pre- and&#xD;
      perimenopausal HR+ advanced breast cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Premenopausal advanced breast cancer patients who failed tamoxifen treatment are possible&#xD;
      good candidates for ovarian ablation/suppression and aromatase inhibitors.Fulvestrant has&#xD;
      been studied little in premenopausal women despite of its attractive mechanism of actions.&#xD;
      Based on this rationale, we introduced high-dose of fulvestrant with LHRH agonist as a&#xD;
      randomized trial comparing with AI plus LHRH agonist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess efficacy of goserelin plus fulvestrant 500mg comparing with goserelin plus&#xD;
      anastrozole as first line endocrine therapy for pre- and perimenopausal HR+ advanced breast&#xD;
      cancer in terms of progression-free survival(PFS)&#xD;
