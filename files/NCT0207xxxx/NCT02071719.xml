  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rapid development of agents blocking kinases has established the use of molecularly&#xD;
      targeted therapy as the preferred treatment approach for patients with metastatic renal cell&#xD;
      cancer (RCC). Five kinase inhibitors (sunitinib, everolimus, temsirolimus, sorafenib and&#xD;
      pazopanib) are now approved for clinical use. Response rates differ among these agents,&#xD;
      importantly depending on line of treatment. In first-line treatment sunitinib results in 47%&#xD;
      objective response rates, where in second-line after cytokines 34% responds. Thus far, it is&#xD;
      unclear which patient with advanced renal cell cancer will respond to targeted therapy. In&#xD;
      order to select patients for targeted therapies, several profiling approaches have been&#xD;
      explored but to date no adequate and reliable test is available. It is assumed that responses&#xD;
      to targeted agents depend on specific receptor and protein signalling activities in tumor&#xD;
      tissues. Therefore, we propose that protein phosphorylation profiling with phosphoproteomics&#xD;
      may be a potential clinical diagnostic tool to predict for tumor response to targeted&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
