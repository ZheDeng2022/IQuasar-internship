  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this randomized controlled study is to investigate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      mirror therapy supported by telerehabilitation on the intensity, duration and frequency of&#xD;
      phantom limb pain and daily activities compared to traditional mirror therapy and sensomotor&#xD;
      exercises without a mirror in patients following lower limb amputation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 75% of patients after amputation of an arm or leg suffer from chronic phantom limb pain&#xD;
      that still is perceived in the missing limb, leading to limitations in daily activities and&#xD;
      quality of life. The treatment of phantom limb pain is still challenging. Despite many&#xD;
      different pharmacological interventions, the outcomes on the longer-term are in many cases&#xD;
      not satisfying. Alternative, non-pharmacological interventions, such as mirror therapy, are&#xD;
      gaining increased recognition in the treatment of phantom limb pain. In this context,&#xD;
      telerehabilitation plays an important role to support long-term self-management and autonomy&#xD;
      of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the developmental phase of the project, a user-centred design is applied. Patients as well&#xD;
      as physical and occupational therapists are interviewed concerning their preferences and&#xD;
      needs with respect to the design and content of the telerehabilitation. Additionally, two&#xD;
      focus groups with each five participants will be conducted. Subsequently, a prototype of the&#xD;
      telerehabilitation will be developed based on user preferences, available evidence, expert&#xD;
      opinion and already existing systems. This prototype will be tested on its usability and&#xD;
      technical performance in phase three using the thinking-aloud-method and data logging.&#xD;
      Accordingly, a multicenter, randomized controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of the telerehabilitation.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Lower limb amputation&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. At least since one week constant or intermittent phantom limb pain (PLP) with an&#xD;
             average intensity of at least score 3 on the 11-point NRS and a minimum frequency of&#xD;
             one episode of PLP per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Sufficient cognitive, communicative and motor functions to be able to use the&#xD;
             telerehabilitation service, to concentrate for at least 15 minutes on the mirror image&#xD;
             and to follow instructions and questionnaires; this is based on clinical judgment of&#xD;
             recruiting physicians or therapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Duration of inpatient rehabilitation not long enough to ensure the 4-week clinical&#xD;
             intervention phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Bilateral amputation, severe co-morbidity (e.g. stroke) or pain affecting the intact&#xD;
             limb; this prevents engagement in the prescribed exercise programs of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Severe psychiatric disorders that preclude patients from participating in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Intensive course of mirror therapy in the past (&gt; 6 treatments during the last three&#xD;
             months).&#xD;
