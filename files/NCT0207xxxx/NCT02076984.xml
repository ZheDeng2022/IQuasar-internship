      Background: Laparoscopic repair of ventral hernias has gained popularity, since many studies&#xD;
      and a recent meta-analysis have reported encouraging results and recurrence rates similar to&#xD;
      open repair. The choice of the mesh and fixation methods is of paramount importance during&#xD;
      laparoscopic approach, and nowadays, lightweight macropore meshes specifically designed for&#xD;
      laparoscopic approach represent the first choice in several studies, due to the biomechanical&#xD;
      properties and the optimal integration into the abdominal wall. No data with statistical&#xD;
      relevance exist on the choice of fixation methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end point of the present Italian multicentric prospective randomized trial is to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of two different tacks to fix the lightweight&#xD;
      polypropylene mesh (Physiomesh™) during laparoscopic incisional hernia repair: metallic&#xD;
      spiral tacks (Protack™) vs absorbable &quot;U&quot; shaped tacks (Securestrap™)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the Study: 200 patients with ventral hernia will be randomized into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A patients will be submitted to laparoscopic repair by Physiomesh fixed by Protack;&#xD;
      Group B patients will be submitted to laparoscopic repair by Physiomesh fixed by Securestrap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blind randomization will be guaranteed by an on-line software with specific key access for&#xD;
      every surgical unit participating in the study. Patients demographics and characteristics,&#xD;
      preoperative studies, intraoperative and postoperative results and complications, as well as&#xD;
      scheduled follow-up will be recorded and uploaded to the database. Data represented by&#xD;
      continuous variables will be expressed as arithmetic mean +/- standard deviation. Other data&#xD;
      will be expressed as geometric mean +/- 95% confidence interval. Data representing low&#xD;
      incidence events will be expressed as number and percentage of occurrence for each group.&#xD;
      Statistical significance for all analyses will be indicated by a p value of 0.05 or less.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND During the past 50 years, incisional and ventral hernia repair surgery has evolved&#xD;
      from direct suture repair to the use of synthetic mesh in order to obtain a tension-free&#xD;
      repair (1-3). Finally the tension-free concepts have been applied to laparoscopic surgery.&#xD;
      Laparoscopic repair of ventra/incisional hernias has gained increasing popularity, since many&#xD;
      studies and a recent meta-analysis and consensus conferences have reported encouraging&#xD;
      results, in terms of wound infection, hospital stay and post-operative pain with recurrence&#xD;
      rate comparable with open approach (1-7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection (age, sex, comorbidities, obesity, hernia site and size, eventual&#xD;
      recurrence and type of previous abdominal surgery), choice of the mesh (bio-materials, size&#xD;
      and shape) and fixation methods (titanium tacks, absorbable tacks, fibrin glue) are&#xD;
      considered crucial issues in preventing recurrence and complications as well as patients&#xD;
      compliance and acceptance (4-5, 8-9). The choice of the mesh to implant is of paramount&#xD;
      importance, in open as well as in laparoscopic approaches. During the last decade, many&#xD;
      meshes and fixation devices have been proposed and tested as a tool to enhance primary and&#xD;
      incisional/ventral hernias repair (10-11). Light-weight meshes have been proposed in order to&#xD;
      reduce the mesh and/or mesh fixation related complications (12). Decreasing the density of&#xD;
      non-absorbable material a reduced &quot;foreign-body response&quot; has been postulated, resulting in&#xD;
      improved abdominal wall compliance, less mess shrinkage, thus allowing a better integration&#xD;
      in host tissues (13-14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;lightweight approach&quot; is also based on the results of studies concerning the abdominal&#xD;
      wall biomechanics (15-16) suggesting the characteristics of the &quot;ideal mesh&quot; (elasticity,&#xD;
      tensile strength and pressure resistance) similar to the normal abdominal wall. The ideal&#xD;
      mesh, should be elastic enough to comply with the movements and elongation of the different&#xD;
      areas of the abdominal wall, yet rigid enough to avoid the herniation of the mesh itself, and&#xD;
      strong to resist in its position, without degradation, deformation (shrinkage) or creation of&#xD;
      defects, life-long.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the great amount of meshes and materials utilized for laparoscopic repair, macropore&#xD;
      lightweight polypropylene has been demonstrated to be more efficient than other materials&#xD;
      (including heavy weight polypropylene) in terms of inflammatory response and mesh integration&#xD;
      on host tissues (17-21). The other crucial issue inlaparoscopic repair is the choice of the&#xD;
      mesh fixation method: the most commonly used include metal spiral tacks set in a double crown&#xD;
      configuration (22-26). Absorbable tacks have been recently introduced (27) in order to&#xD;
      improve biocompatibility, reduce the risk of endoperitoneal adhesions due to the presence of&#xD;
      metallic tacks, and reduce mid- and long-term postoperative pain. The rationale of the use of&#xD;
      absorbable tacks in laparoscopic incisional/ventral hernia repairusing lightweight macropore&#xD;
      polypropylene meshes is in the biochemical and biomechanical mesh features, since these&#xD;
      meshes become well integrated into the abdominal wall and do not need permanent fixation&#xD;
      devices. To date, only two retrospective studies dealing with the clinical use of absorbable&#xD;
      tacks with lightweight macropore polypropylene mesh have been published (28-29). The authors&#xD;
      report similar results comparing absorbable vs non absorbable tacks in terms of&#xD;
      intraoperative and early post-operative results (29). These studies have the pitfalls to be&#xD;
      retrospective evaluation on a small series of patients, so the reported results still need to&#xD;
      be validated by larger series and prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      THE PRIMARY END POINTS of this prospective multicentric randomized study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  compare mid and long-term results of the use of metallic tacks and absorbable tacks to&#xD;
           fix lightweight polypropylene mesh during laparoscopic incisional/ventral hernia repair,&#xD;
           in terms of hernia recurrence, in order to establish the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
           absorbable tacks;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  compare intraoperative and early port-operative outcomes, in terms of surgical&#xD;
           complications, post-operative stay, return to normal life activities and pain&#xD;
           management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS/STUDY DESIGN The prospective randomized multicentric trial will involve 6 Surgical&#xD;
      Unit having large experience in laparoscopic incisional/ventral hernia repair and in the use&#xD;
      of lightweight polypropylene meshes and both metallic and absorbable tacks (out of the&#xD;
      learning curve).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Referral Centre (General Surgery Unit, ICOT Hospital, Latina, Italy), will coordinate the&#xD;
      study and will be responsible of the data analysys and interim evaluation (12 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      200 patients will be included in the study (see inclusion criteria on table 1), divided into&#xD;
      two groups based on an real-time randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: patients candidate to laparoscopic incisional/ventral hernia repair by&#xD;
           lightweight polypropylrne mesh fixed by metallic tacks;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B: patients candidate to laparoscopic incisional/ventral hernia repair by&#xD;
           lightweight polypropylene mesh fixed by absorbable tacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blind Randomization will be guaranteed by a dedicated website having restricted access by a&#xD;
      password for each surgical unit participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be evaluated by clinical examination, and abdominal CT scan or US scan, in&#xD;
      order to evaluate size and number of the defect(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All devices used in the study (meshes and tacks) will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physiomesh™ (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Inc) a lightweight polypropylene&#xD;
           mesh with double face absorbable layer made to be placed on the peritoneal surface and&#xD;
           prevent adhesions with visceral structures;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Protack™ (Covidien surgical, Mansfield MA, USA), permanent titanium spiral tacks;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Securestrap™ (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Inc), &quot;U&quot;-shaped absorbable tacks&#xD;
           made by polydioxanone, which are completely absorbed within 12-18 months after implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures will be carried out using the same surgical technique to implant and fix the&#xD;
      mesh (overlapping the defect for at least 3 cm on each side), with the tacks set in a double&#xD;
      crown configuration at the distance of 1,5 cm , no use of transfixed sutures or glue. After&#xD;
      surgery, compressive dressing will be placed for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A record form (included at the bottom) will be filled for each patient, and sent to the&#xD;
      coordinating centre after the patient discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 week (clinical evaluation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4 weeks (clinical evaluation at dressing removal)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 months (clinical evaluation or phone interview)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12 months (phone call and eventual clinical evaluation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24 months after surgery (phone call and eventual clinical evaluation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  36 months after surgery (phone call and eventual clinical evaluation)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters will be evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients characteristics (sex, age, comorbidities, personal therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hernia features (location and size)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mesh size&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of tacks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of tacks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Operating time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-operative course&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-operative complications (according to Clavien-Dindo classification)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute Post-operative pain (using the Visual Numeric Scale for pain classification)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Return to life activities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recurrence rates&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronic pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data represented by continuous variables (Age, operating time, etc.) will be expressed as&#xD;
      arithmetic mean +/- standard deviation. Because of its skewed nature, other data, such as&#xD;
      length of hospital stay, pain evaluated by Visual Numeric Scale, will be expressed as&#xD;
      geometric mean +/- 95% confidence interval (CI). Other data, such as wound infection, hernia&#xD;
      recurrence and other events having low incidence, will be expressed as number and percentage&#xD;
      of occurrence for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical significance for all analyses will be indicated by a p value of 0.05 or less.&#xD;
      Analysis will be performed by a dedicated software (SAS latest release for Windows).&#xD;
