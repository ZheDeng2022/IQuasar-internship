      Early detection of pre-cancerous lesions or early stage pancreatic cancer seems to have a&#xD;
      positive impact in survival for patients with an increased genetic risk to develop pancreas&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, following the indication of the swedish guidelines, consecutive patients with&#xD;
      a family history for pancreas cancer underwent a clinical surveillance Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      Imaging (MRI) based. The results of this study were analyzed looking in the patients files&#xD;
      collected during the screening period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is the 4th cause of cancer related deaths in USA and in many of the Western&#xD;
      Countries. The incidence of the disease is almost corresponding to the mortality rate. For&#xD;
      this reason pancreatic cancer can be considered a global lethal disease. Even if treatments&#xD;
      have improved, the resection rate in patients suffering from ductal adenocarcinoma remain&#xD;
      around 30% and the 5 years survival rates is below 20%. Because of the low incidence of&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer in the general population, a population-based screening is not&#xD;
      cost/effective. Anyway in the last two decades, data from literature demonstrate that&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer can be the phenotypic expression of some know genetic syndromes and the&#xD;
      existence of a familial risk to develop pancreatic cancer. In particular for this last&#xD;
      condition, called familial pancreatic cancer (FPC), an increased risk is associated with the&#xD;
      number of family member affected. In prospective epidemiological studies, is demonstrated&#xD;
      that a positive family history of pancreatic cancer is present in about 10% of all&#xD;
      consecutive probands. The identification of a population at risk, the suggestions that an&#xD;
      early surgical treatment of pancreatic cancer can improve the prognosis and, in particular,&#xD;
      the identifications of pre-neoplastic lesions as PanIN and IPMN associated to the natural&#xD;
      history of FPC, contributed to the development on National and International guidelines for&#xD;
      the surveillance of the individual at increased risk. Even do, today, no consensus is reached&#xD;
      on inclusion criteria for a clinical surveillance program, screening modalities and target&#xD;
      lesions. Traditionally individual with a 10 fold relative risk to develop pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      were considered suitable for a screening program. However, more recently, the CAPS group&#xD;
      suggested to include in a surveillance program individuals with a 5 fold higher relative&#xD;
      risk. Early pancreatic cancer, IPMN and PanIN lesions are considered the target lesions of a&#xD;
      clinical screening, however the concrete possibility to detect PanIN lesions during a&#xD;
      surveillance program remain debatable and uncertain.The imaging modality technique used in&#xD;
      the existing programs are, alone or in combination, magnetic resonance (MR), computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), endoscopic retrograde cholagiopancreatography&#xD;
      (ERCP). Anyway a tendency to use low aggressive modalities as MR and EUS is emerging by the&#xD;
      recent recommendations. The results of the clinical studies are quite uncertain and difficult&#xD;
      to compare due to different screening modalities and inclusion criteria. The yield of FPC&#xD;
      screening programs published in literature range from 50 to 1.3%. The cost/effectiveness of a&#xD;
      surveillance program for FPC is not already demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to analyze the preliminary result of a prospective clinical&#xD;
      surveillance program for individuals at risk for pancreatic cancer using a low aggressive, MR&#xD;
      based, screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrollment Patients with an increased &quot;genetic&quot; risk to develop pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      will be enrolled in a MR surveillance program at Karolinska University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were enrolled in the study from 3 different ways: relative of probands treated&#xD;
      for pancreas cancer at karolinska University Hospital and with a positive family history of&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer or with a positive anamnesis of an associated genetic syndrome, subjects,&#xD;
      with a &quot;genetically&quot; increased risk, referred to us from other swedish centers, subjects&#xD;
      referred to us by general partitioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria for the screening All the individuals with a 10 fold higher relative risk&#xD;
      in respect to the general population to develop pancreatic cancer will be included in the&#xD;
      study. In case of suspected known genetic syndromes, only patients with detected&#xD;
      corresponding gene mutations will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening modalities All patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      clinical study after a specific informed consent. Basically a complete familial and personal&#xD;
      anamensis (including the pedegree) and a clinical examination will be obtained from all the&#xD;
      patients. A blood sample will be collected into a bio-bank at Karolinska University Hospital.&#xD;
      An MR/MRCP with secretin will be performed for all the patients. If the result of the MR are&#xD;
      negative (no findings detected) a one year screening, with the same modalities is&#xD;
      recommended. Only patients with some anomaly at the MR will undergo EUS with or without FNA&#xD;
      and/or MDCT scan. Patients with a positive anamnesis suggestive for a known genetic syndrome&#xD;
      will be offered specific genetic tests (BRCA1/2, SPINK1, PRSS1, p16, STK11) and respective&#xD;
      genetic counselling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target lesions of the screening Due to the low specificity and sensibility of the available&#xD;
      technique in order to detect PanIN lesions, the lobulocentric atrophy areas are not&#xD;
      considered a target of our screening. Macroscopic pre-neoplastic lesions (IPMN) or pancreatic&#xD;
      solid mass are considered the only lesions suitable for detection and screening.&#xD;
