      STUDY BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with hematological malignancies (blood-related cancers) often develop&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), which can be made worse by cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preventive (prophylactic) platelet transfusion remains the standard of care for&#xD;
      thrombocytopenic patients. However, bleeding remains a significant problem in these patients,&#xD;
      affecting approximately 20% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia and 34-58% of&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Platelet transfusion refractoriness, the&#xD;
      repeated failure to obtain satisfactory response to platelet transfusions, is a common&#xD;
      problem. Alternatives to platelet transfusions are desperately needed for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA) blocks a process called fibrinolysis that is an essential&#xD;
      step in the bleeding process. EACA is approved by the FDA for the treatment of severe&#xD;
      bleeding-related diseases and complications. A small study has shown EACA to be well&#xD;
      tolerated and associated with low risk of bleeding in patients with hematological&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare EACA versus standard prophylactic platelet transfusion for the&#xD;
      prevention of bleeding in thrombocytopenic patients with hematological malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESCRIPTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is Phase II study to compare EACA versus standard prophylactic platelet transfusion to&#xD;
      prevent bleeding in thrombocytopenic patients with hematological malignancies. Patients who&#xD;
      are eligible to take part must give their written agreement before they can be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 100 patients who will be assigned randomly to take EACA twice daily or&#xD;
      to undergo standard prophylactic platelet transfusion. Patients will be followed for any&#xD;
      bleeding events, need for platelet transfusion, and any side effects experienced. Patients&#xD;
      will complete questionnaires to assess their quality of life while on the study.&#xD;

      Study Treatments: Epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA) vs. standard prophylactic platelet&#xD;
      transfusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Title: Randomized Trial of Epsilon Aminocaproic Acid versus Platelet Transfusions for&#xD;
      the Prevention of Bleeding in Thrombocytopenic Patients with Hematological Malignancies.&#xD;
      (PROBLEMA trial: PRevention Of BLeeding in hEmatological Malignancies with Antifibrinolytic&#xD;
      agents (epsilon aminocaproic acid).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase: Randomized Phase 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible Population: Adult patients with acute or chronic thrombocytopenia in the setting of&#xD;
      hematological malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary and Study Rationale: Compare EACA to standard prophylactic platelet transfusion for&#xD;
      the prevention of bleeding in thrombocytopenic patients with hematological malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: prospective, randomized, controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints: The primary endpoint is to compare the proportion of patients who develop&#xD;
      major (grades 3-4) bleeding in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis and Main Inclusion Criteria: Age &gt; 18 with hematological malignancies. Acute or&#xD;
      chronic thrombocytopenia with platelet counts &lt; 20 x 10⁹/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Patients: 100 patients, 50 patients in each arm&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Patient Participation: 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximate Duration of Study: 3 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage and Administration:1,000 mg twice a day orally&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prohibited Medications/Treatment: Hydroxyurea and procoagulant agents including DDAVP,&#xD;
      recombinant Factor VII or prothrombin complex concentrate are prohibited in patients&#xD;
      receiving EACA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Evaluations: Clinical assessment once weekly during the first 30 days and then monthly&#xD;
      for 6 months, complete blood count and bleeding score twice weekly the first 30 days, and&#xD;
      then according to standard of care or at discretion of treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Population Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Intention to treat (ITT) population: The ITT population includes all patients who&#xD;
                are randomized to the study. Patients will be stratified and analyzed according to&#xD;
                the treatment to which they were assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Safety Population: The safety population includes all patients who have received at&#xD;
                least 1 dose of EACA. Patients included in the safety population will be analyzed&#xD;
                according to the treatment they received.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Per-protocol Population: The per-protocol population includes all patients who are&#xD;
                randomized, receive at least one dose of study drug, and have no major protocol&#xD;
                violations that could be expected to impact response data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Primary Endpoint: is to compare at the end of the study, the proportion of patients&#xD;
                with major bleeding during the study period among patients randomized to receive&#xD;
                either EACA or standard of care prophylactic platelet transfusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Secondary Endpoints include:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Proportion of patients with any bleeding during the study period in each arm&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The total number of units of platelets transfused in each arm at the end of&#xD;
                     the study&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Quality of life as measured in each arm before the study and at the end of the&#xD;
                     study&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Safety in each arm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample Size: This randomized, open-label phase II study is designed to compare the&#xD;
           proportion of patient with major bleeding ever noted during the study. Patients will be&#xD;
           assigned to receive prophylactic EACA (experimental arm) or prophylactic platelet&#xD;
           (standard of care) in a 1:1 fashion. Previous studies suggest that the proportions of&#xD;
           patients with major bleeding will be expected to be 8% and 30% in experimental arm and&#xD;
           standard of care arm, respectively. With one sided Fisher's exact test, the sample size&#xD;
           of 45 patients in each arm will achieve a power of 80% at the significance level of 5%&#xD;
           to test whether prophylactic EACA can prevent major bleeding better than the standard of&#xD;
           care. After adjusting for a 10% drop out rate, the actual required sample size will be&#xD;
           50 patients per arm. Therefore, the total sample size of the study will be 100 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Primary Endpoint Analysis will be performed using a one-sided Fisher's exact test&#xD;
                to compare the proportions of patients with major bleeding during the whole study&#xD;
                between the two arms. The significance level is set at 0.05. This primary analysis&#xD;
                will be based on the ITT population.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Secondary Endpoint Analysis: one-sided t-test will be used to compare the total&#xD;
                number of any bleeding episode noted during the study between the two arms.&#xD;
                Two-sided t-test will be employed to compare the total number of units of platelets&#xD;
                transfused at the end of the study between the two arms. Appropriate statistical&#xD;
                tests (Chi-square test, t-test, Wilcoxon's rank sum test, etc.) will be conducted&#xD;
                to compare the each score of the quality of life between the two arms before the&#xD;
                study and at the end of the study, respectively. The change of each score of the&#xD;
                quality of life from before the study to the end of the study will also be compared&#xD;
                between the two arms. The safety in each arm will be also compared with Fisher's&#xD;
                exact test. The analyses of secondary endpoints will be performed on the ITT&#xD;
                population and the significance level will be kept at 0.05 for all tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety Analysis: All patients receiving at least 1 dose of study drug will be considered&#xD;
           evaluable for safety. Patients will be analyzed for safety according to the treatment&#xD;
           which they received. Listings of laboratory test results will also be generated, and&#xD;
           descriptive statistics summarizing the changes in laboratory tests over time will be&#xD;
           presented. Exposure to study drug over time will also be summarized. The adverse events&#xD;
           incidence rates, as well as the frequency of occurrence of overall toxicity, categorized&#xD;
           by toxicity grades (severity) will be described for each treatment arm and be compared&#xD;
           between two arms using two-sided Chi-square test or t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of Life Analysis: Quality of life and health outcomes measures are being&#xD;
           collected using EuroQoL instruments before the study and at the end of the study. Means&#xD;
           and medians of raw scores of these questionnaires will be summarized for each treatment&#xD;
           group for each domain and be compared between the two arms with t-test or Wilcoxon ranks&#xD;
           sum test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interim Analysis: Three interim analyses are planned after 11 patients in each arm have&#xD;
           been randomized and their results have been obtained. Each interim analysis will focus&#xD;
           on the primary endpoint, the proportion of patients with major bleeding ever noted&#xD;
           during the study. To maintain an overall Type I error rate of 0.05 (1-sided), an O'Brien&#xD;
           Fleming approach will be used which requires a 1-sided p-value &lt; 0.001 at the first&#xD;
           interim analysis (at 25% of total sample size). If this boundary is not crossed, then&#xD;
           the study will continue and the second interim analysis will be conducted at 50% of the&#xD;
           total sample side which requires a 1-sided significance level of 0.004. If this boundary&#xD;
           is not crossed at the second interim analysis then, the study will continue and a third&#xD;
           interim analysis will be conducted at 75% of the total sample side which requires a&#xD;
           1-sided significance level of 0.019. If this boundary is not crossed, the final primary&#xD;
           analysis will be performed after completing 100% of the sample size using a 0.043&#xD;
           one-sided significance level.&#xD;
