  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial compares a recently developed technique, called robotic&#xD;
      laparoendoscopic single-site radical prostatectomy (R-LESS RP), to the current standard of&#xD;
      robotic technique for prostate cancer, robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) in&#xD;
      treating patients with newly diagnosed, locally confined prostate cancer. Both procedures are&#xD;
      types of robotic radical prostatectomy, or the robot-assisted removal of the prostate though&#xD;
      a small incision in the belly. In the standard approach, 4-5 small (1-2 cm) incisions are&#xD;
      made in the lower abdomen to allow the insertion of robotic instruments. In the R-LESS&#xD;
      technique, all instruments are inserted through a single incision. R-LESS RP is less invasive&#xD;
      than RALP and may leave a smaller scar and cause less pain.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate pain and analgesic requirement of R-LESS RP compared to standard RALP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Time to oral intake. II. Time to resume ambulation. III. Hospital stay, counted in whole&#xD;
      days from the day of surgery to the day of discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Perioperative parameters, including: operative time (defined as time elapsed from skin&#xD;
      incision to placement of the final skin suture); estimated blood loss; additional ports;&#xD;
      conversion to standard RALP (in R-LESS RP patients), or laparoscopic, or open surgery; length&#xD;
      of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Intraoperative complications. VI. Postoperative complications, recorded according to the&#xD;
      Clavien classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Body image perception, measured using the body image questionnaire (BIQ). VIII. Scar&#xD;
      evaluation (at suture removal and at 6 month) by using a validated assessment tool, the&#xD;
      Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. Health related quality of life, measured as patients' perception of functioning,&#xD;
      disability, and well-being related to the following eight concepts: physical functioning,&#xD;
      role limitations caused by physical health problems, bodily pain, general health, vitality,&#xD;
      social functioning, role limitation caused by emotional problems, and mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X. Urinary continence, assessing the number of pads used daily. XI. Erectile Function,&#xD;
      assessed by the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients undergo standard RALP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients undergo R-LESS RP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 1 year.&#xD;

    <measure>Scar evaluation, assessed using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Compared using the Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate. Assessed at suture removal and at 6 months. The Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale consists of two scales: the observer scale and the patient scale. Both scales contain 6 items that are scored numerically. Each of the six items on both scales has a 10-step score, with 10 indicating the worst imaginable scar or sensation. The total score of both scales consists of adding the scores of each of the six items (range, 6 to 60). The lowest score, 6, reflects normal skin, whereas the highest score, 60, reflects the worst imaginable scar.</description>
