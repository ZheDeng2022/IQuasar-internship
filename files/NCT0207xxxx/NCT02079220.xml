  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, two-arm, phase II trial to evaluate the anti-tumor activity, safety,&#xD;
      and tolerability of ziv-aflibercept in combination with XELOX chemotherapy in the first-line&#xD;
      treatment of subjects with mCRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two different schedules of ziv-aflibercept in combination with XELOX will be evaluated in&#xD;
      this study: every 2 week schedule (Arm A) and the every 3 week schedule (Arm B). The choice&#xD;
      between arm A and arm B will depend on the investigator's preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A (every 2 week schedule) Dosage and dosage regimen for all study periods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Capecitabine: will be administered 1,000 mg/m2 orally twice a day on Days 1 - 7 of each&#xD;
           cycle, repeating every 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oxaliplatin: will be administered 85 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 of each cycle, repeating every 14&#xD;
           days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ziv-aflibercept: will be administered 4 mg/kg IV on Day 1 of each cycle, repeating every&#xD;
           14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B (every 3 week schedule):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage and dosage regimen for all study periods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Capecitabine: will be administered 850 mg/m2 orally twice a day on Days 1 - 14 of each&#xD;
           cycle, repeating every 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oxaliplatin: will be administered 130 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 of each cycle, repeating every&#xD;
           21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ziv-aflibercept: will be administered 6 mg/kg IV on Day 1 of each cycle, repeating every&#xD;
           21 days.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The study will be limited to subjects with newly diagnosed mCRC without any prior&#xD;
             systemic chemotherapy for metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The diagnosis of metastatic colorectal cancer will be based on histologic or cytologic&#xD;
             confirmation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have the ability to swallow oral medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for&#xD;
             non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as ≥ 20 mm with conventional&#xD;
             techniques or as ≥ 10 mm with spiral CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any prior chemotherapy for mCRC is not allowed. Adjuvant chemotherapy with&#xD;
             oxaliplatin-containing regimen CRC within the last 12 months is not allowed. Adjuvant&#xD;
             chemotherapy with Fluorouracil (5-FU) or capecitabine alone within the last 6 months&#xD;
             is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Total Bilirubin 2 × institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine transaminase (ALT) 2.5 ×&#xD;
                  institutional upper limit of normal (AST and ALT ≤ 5.0 x ULN is acceptable if&#xD;
                  liver has tumor involvement).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) 30 mL/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of the combination of ziv-aflibercept, oxaliplatin and capecitabine on the&#xD;
             developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential&#xD;
             and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth&#xD;
             control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation,&#xD;
             and 6 months after last administration of ziv-aflibercept. Should a woman become&#xD;
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this&#xD;
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled&#xD;
             on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of therapeutic&#xD;
             agents administration and 6 months after last administration of ziv-aflibercept.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwilling or unable to follow protocol requirements or to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any prior chemotherapy for mCRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adjuvant chemotherapy with oxaliplatin-containing regimen CRC within the last 12&#xD;
             months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-FU or capecitabine alone within the last 6 months is&#xD;
             allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CrCl &lt; 30 mL/min&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any peripheral neuropathy of grade ≥ 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with urine protein creatinine ration &gt; 1 or urine protein &gt; 500 mg/24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had radiotherapy within 4 weeks to entering the study or those who&#xD;
             have not recovered from adverse events due to radiotherapy administered more than 4&#xD;
             weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled or symptomatic brain metastases should be excluded from&#xD;
             this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop&#xD;
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic&#xD;
             and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of metastatic disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would require&#xD;
             palliative treatment within 4 weeks of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ziv-aflibercept, capecitabine, and&#xD;
             oxaliplatin are agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with ziv-aflibercept, capecitabine, and&#xD;
             oxaliplatin, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
             ziv-aflibercept, capecitabine, and oxaliplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with ziv-aflibercept, capecitabine, and&#xD;
             oxaliplatin. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections&#xD;
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken&#xD;
             in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Malabsorption syndrome, ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, resection of&#xD;
             the stomach or small bowel, or other disease or condition significantly affecting&#xD;
             gastrointestinal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious or non-healing wound, skin ulcer, or bone fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or active anticoagulation with Coumadin.&#xD;

             study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any grade 3/4 hemorrhage within 3 months prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any pulmonary embolism (PE) within 3 months prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any deep vein thrombosis (DVT) within 3 months prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled hypertension defined as &gt; 140/90 mmHg or isolated systolic hypertension &gt;&#xD;
             160 mmHg on 2 separate days in past 3 months prior to study inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any of the following cardiac conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Documented congestive heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
