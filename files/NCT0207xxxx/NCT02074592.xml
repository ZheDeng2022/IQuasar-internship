    <textblock>
      To improve the quality of fetal ultrasound images, self assessment is less resource consuming&#xD;
      than assessment by an expert reviewer, and may be as effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis, we randomize volunteer experienced ultrasonographers into two&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One group assess their own images (self assessment). The other group has their images&#xD;
      assessed by an expert. Images are audited via the internet in a standardized procedure that&#xD;
      generates feedback with recommendation for change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three to 6 months later, participants are audited again. If the improvement in image quality&#xD;
      turns to be the same in both groups, it will be likely that self assessment is indeed as&#xD;
      effective as assessment by an expert reviewer - at least for professionals experienced in&#xD;
      fetal ultrasound.&#xD;

      Background: Audit and feedback based on image scoring by an expert improve ultrasound image&#xD;
      quality, but is time consuming. Self assessment of ultrasound still images might be an&#xD;
      alternative to assessment by an expert.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective. To compare image quality improvement following self assessment of fetal biometry&#xD;
      images versus audit and feedback by an expert.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. Study design: prospective blinded randomised controlled trial. Inclusions Doctors or&#xD;
      midwifes experienced in the field of fetal ultrasound, are solicited by email to enrol.&#xD;
      Volunteers upload a first set of 30 biometry images (10 cephalic, 10 abdominal and 10&#xD;
      femoral) obtained from 10 consecutive screening scans performed in the second or third&#xD;
      trimester of pregnancy. Abnormal scans are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After uploading the first set of images, ultrasonographers are randomised with a 1:1 ratio *&#xD;
      Arm 1: Ultrasonographers assess their own images online according to a standardized&#xD;
      procedure. They receive an automatically generated report with detailed recommendations for&#xD;
      change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Their images are also audited by an expert, but the result of this audit remains concealed to&#xD;
      the ultrasonographer&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Arm 2: Ultrasonographers do not assess their own images. Their images are assessed by an&#xD;
      expert according to the same standardized online procedure. They receive an automatically&#xD;
      generated report with detailed recommendations for change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up Three to 6 months later, ultrasonographers are asked to upload a second set of 30&#xD;
      biometry images. Images are audited by an expert reviewer using the same standardized online&#xD;
      procedure as for the first set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Online image scoring procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure is the same whether the reviewer is the ultrasonographer himself or an expert.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uploaded images are presented to the reviewer after an automatic black contour concealed the&#xD;
      identity of the patient and ultrasonographer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Images are presented on the left hand side of the screen. Buttons on the right hand side are&#xD;
      clicked according to the presence or absence of quality criteria. Online help provides&#xD;
      specifics on each criterion, together with typical images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scoring criteria are derived from L. J. SALOMON, et al Ultrasound Obstetric Gynecology 2006;&#xD;
      27: 34-40).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each set of images sent by a given ultrasonographer, image quality is evaluated based on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the percentage of images meeting all criteria (IMAC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the mean of a score based on attributing one point per criterion present on a given&#xD;
           image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feed back and recommendations for change A feedback adapted to the scoring results is&#xD;
      generated automatically. It provides the ultrasonographer with the percentage of IMAC, and a&#xD;
      mean score, overall and for each type of image. Whenever a criterion is not met, a pop up&#xD;
      window shows the corresponding image and a short document is displayed, with recommendations&#xD;
      for change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gestational age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic characteristics of professionals enrolled: age, gender, experience in fetal&#xD;
           ultrasound (years), medical doctor vs. midwife, fetal ultrasound practice (screening&#xD;
           only, vs. screening plus referral ultrasound), medical practice other than fetal&#xD;
           ultrasound, continuous medical education in the field of fetal biometry, membership of&#xD;
           the French College of fetal ultrasonography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For each set and type of image:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  percentage of IMAC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mean score&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvement in the mean percentage of IMAC between the first and the second set of images&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvement in the mean percentage of IMAC between the first and the second series of&#xD;
      cephalic images Improvement in the mean percentage of IMAC between the first and the second&#xD;
      series of abdomen images Improvement in the mean percentage of IMAC between the first and the&#xD;
      second series of femur images Difference in mean score, overall and for each image type,&#xD;
      between the first and the second set of images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup analysis may be performed based on ultrasonographers characteristics. The agreement&#xD;
      between self assessment and audit by expert reviewers will be analysed Statistical analysis A&#xD;
      descriptive analysis of data will be done. An equivalence test for quantitative data will be&#xD;
      done to study the main and secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroups analysis will be made for each image type. Agreement between self assessment and&#xD;
      expert audit will be evaluated by intraclass correlation coefficient method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all tests, a value of P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Number of&#xD;
      participants to be included The mean increase in the percentage of IMAC for each&#xD;
      ultrasonographer (Δ% IMAC) is the main outcome. The equivalence in Δ% IMAC between the two&#xD;
      arms will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We choose the following equivalence margins: ± 6.67% (i.e. a difference of 2 IMAC for each&#xD;
      set of 30 images). The standard deviation of Δ% IMAC observed in a previous study was 20.&#xD;
      This study showed a Δ% IMAC of 15% after audit and feedback (i.e. 4 to 5 images improved).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a two sided alpha of 5% and a power of 80%, 156 ultrasonographers are needed in each&#xD;
      group. We thus expect to enrol 320 ultrasonographers in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results. Equivalence in improvement of image quality in the self assessment and the&#xD;
      expert audit group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This would suggest that online self assessment may be as effective as audit by an expert to&#xD;
      improve ultrasound image quality.&#xD;
