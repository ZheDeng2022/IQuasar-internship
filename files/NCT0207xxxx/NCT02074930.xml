  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is an open-label physiological investigation of the allergic skin reactivity to&#xD;
      epicutaneous allergen exposition in 20 allergic patients in two different skin conditions.&#xD;
      The focus of the study is on the skin preparation/condition and not on the specific allergen&#xD;
      or allergy, but for reasons of homogeneity a single allergic disease, birch pollen allergy&#xD;
      was chosen as the basis for the testing. In order to evaluate the effects of the two&#xD;
      different skin preparation techniques an intraindividual comparison of the skin reactivity in&#xD;
      terms of the immediate phase I reaction to serial dilutions of birch pollen extracts was&#xD;
      chosen. The serial dilution approach allows a dose dependent effect evaluation and comparison&#xD;
      of the sensitivity. The differences will be explained mainly by the two different skin&#xD;
      preparations allowing a quantitative comparison of these techniques.&#xD;

      The Objective is the determination of the allergic skin reactivity to epicutaneoulsy applied&#xD;
      birch pollen allergen extract after skin preparation (microporation by P.L.E.A.S.E.&#xD;
      Professional) and standard skin prick test. By using the standard prick test the stratum&#xD;
      corneum is overcome by a single puncture (1 mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Micropores induced by P.L.E.A.S.E. Professional penetrate the stratum corneum less deep but&#xD;
      with a higher density (five pores). It is therefore suggested that a skin preparation with&#xD;
      micropores by P.L.E.A.S.E. Professional previously to the allergen contact may lead to a&#xD;
      higher sensitivity. Less allergen might still elicit a skin reaction which won?t be seen by a&#xD;
      conventional prick skin test. Whereas skin prick test may lead to true-negative (patient&#xD;
      shows no allergic reaction on prick skin test but is an allergy sufferer in clinic),&#xD;
      IgE-determination may lead to false-positives (patient is determined as allergy sufferer but&#xD;
      has no clinical symptoms). So the sensitivity with micropores skin preparation by&#xD;
      P.L.E.A.S.E. Professional could be a good compromise. The preparation of the skin with&#xD;
      P.L.E.A.S.E. Professional leads to a better understanding of the influence of different types&#xD;
      of skin injury patterns on the allergic skin reactivity. Namely, how important is the role of&#xD;
      the exposed area, the depth of injury and the keratinocyte activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be checked in a late phase reaction evaluation.&#xD;
