  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalation (Phase 1a) and expansion (Phase 1b) study to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of KPT-330 and determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) in&#xD;
      patients with solid tumor malignancies. The study drug KPT-330 or Selinexor works by blocking&#xD;
      high levels of exporter proteins in cancer cells so that the tumor suppressor proteins (TSP,&#xD;
      proteins that help to protect cells from becoming cancerous) and growth regulatory proteins&#xD;
      (GRP, proteins that help control the growth of cells) will remain in the nucleus in its&#xD;
      &quot;activated&quot; form. The idea for using this drug is that the blockage of this export of&#xD;
      proteins from the nucleus should result in stopping the growth of tumor cells. Based on its&#xD;
      mechanism of action, KPT-330 is a new class of drug called Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear&#xD;
      Export (SINE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of this research study are to find out more information about the drug such as:&#xD;
      the highest dose of KPT-330 that can be given safely, the side effects it may cause, to&#xD;
      examine how the body affects the study drug concentrations in the blood (called&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics or PK), to examine the effects of this study drug on the body (called&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics or PD) and to gain some information on its usefulness in treating cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits of the study include the chance of disease control for patients with treatment&#xD;
      refractory cancer for which no other standard treatments are available. Common side effects&#xD;
      (35-73%) in humans have mostly been mild and reversible. These include nausea, loss of&#xD;
      appetite, fatigue, vomiting and weight loss.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, phase 1a (dose escalation) and 1b (doses expansion) study to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral Selinexor in Asian patients with advanced solid&#xD;
      malignancies. After the initial screening visit and registration in the study, each patient&#xD;
      will be assigned to 3 different schedules, a starting dose of 50 mg/m2 (Schedule 1) given&#xD;
      once weekly ; 40 mg/m2 (Schedule 2) with a twice weekly dosing schedule and three times a&#xD;
      week at 20mg/m2 (Schedule 3) dosing schedule have been chosen for this study. For Schedule 2,&#xD;
      drug administration will occur twice weekly, on days 1 and 3 of the first two weeks (e.g.&#xD;
      Monday and Wednesday or Tuesday and Thursday) and for Schedule 3, drug administration will&#xD;
      occur three times a week on days 1, 3 and 5 (ie: Monday, Wednesday and Friday). For Schedule&#xD;
      1, one cycle is 4 weeks with 4 doses of Selinexor. In Schedule 2, one cycle is 3 weeks with 4&#xD;
      doses of Selinexor. In Schedule 3, one cycle is 4 weeks with 12 doses of Selinexor. Dose will&#xD;
      be escalated using a 3+3 design. Patients who have difficulty tolerating treatment (e.g., due&#xD;
      to anorexia, nausea, or fatigue) at any dose level may have their dose reduced by 4-10&#xD;
      mg/m(2) increments to a lowest dose of 11 mg/m(2). Aggressive use of supportive medications&#xD;
      is often sufficient to mitigate or eliminate tolerability problems.Supportive care including&#xD;
      antinausea/ anti-emetic therapy, acid suppression (H2-blockers and/or proton pump&#xD;
      inhibitors), glucocorticoids, anti-diarrheal therapy, and other standard treatments may be&#xD;
      administered as per institutional guidelines both prophylactically and for symptomatic&#xD;
      patients. A 3+3 design will be used for the dose escalation. A minimum of 3 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled per cohort. Once 3 patients are enrolled in a cohort and have completed at least six&#xD;
      days of dosing at the target dose, up to 3 additional patients may be added to that cohort.&#xD;
      After up to 6 patients have been accrued to a dose level, that dose level will be closed to&#xD;
      accrual until safety assessment of all the 3 to 6 patients is performed through a safety&#xD;
      cohort meeting at the end of cycle 1. If the dose level is well tolerated during these 4&#xD;
      weeks at the target dose, then dose escalation will be performed in the next cohort. Dose&#xD;
      escalation in the 3+3 design will proceed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least 3 patients will be entered into the cohort. Once 3 patients are enrolled in a&#xD;
           cohort and have completed at least six days of dosing at the target dose, up to 3&#xD;
           additional patients may be added to that cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If none of the patients in this cohort experience DLT during the 4 weeks at the target&#xD;
           dose, dose escalation will be continued as per protocol design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If one of patients experiences first cycle DLT, up to three additional patients will be&#xD;
           added to this cohort (maximum 6 will be evaluated in this cohort) and if no additional&#xD;
           patients experience DLT (i.e. only 1 out of 6 patients in the cohort experience DLT),&#xD;
           dose escalation as per protocol will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If a DLT is observed in 2 or more subjects in a cohort of 3 or 6 subjects at a dose&#xD;
           level, and a lower dose level has not been tested, then an additional 3 subjects will be&#xD;
           enrolled at a lower dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If, following dose escalation, 2 patients in the cohort experience first cycle DLT, this&#xD;
           dose will be labelled as Maximally Tolerated Dose (MTD) and the RP2D will be the&#xD;
           previous dose at which &lt;= 1/6 patients experienced a DLT. If only 3 subjects were&#xD;
           treated at the previous lower dose level, then an additional 3 subjects will also be&#xD;
           recruited for a total of 6 subjects at that dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  However an additional cohort of patients may be enrolled at a dose between MTD and the&#xD;
           dose below it. If dose level 3 is reached and criteria for determining MTD are not met,&#xD;
           further dose escalation for each dose level may occur after discussion with the&#xD;
           investigators, Karyopharm and the PI.If one patient in a cohort develops a DLT in Cycle&#xD;
           1, at least 5 additional patients will be enrolled at that dose level. If there are no&#xD;
           additional DLTs at that dose level, then doses will be escalated by up to 30-40% and all&#xD;
           subsequent cohorts will include &gt;=3 patients. If one DLT occurs in the first 3 patients&#xD;
           enrolled in a cohort, an additional 3 patients will be enrolled. If another DLT occurs&#xD;
           at this dose level (i.e., 2 DLTs/6 patients), this dose will be considered the MTD, and&#xD;
           the RP2D is defined as the dose level below this dose, provided that that dose level is&#xD;
           &lt;=25% lower than the highest (intolerable) dose tested. This protocol is designed to&#xD;
           guide maximal escalation, while ensuring patient safety. In order to achieve this,&#xD;
           during each safety cohort review meeting with the investigators, Karyopharm, and PI, a&#xD;
           decision will be made on the dose escalation scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is defined as the next lower dose level below MTD. The&#xD;
      MTD is the dose level in which &gt; 1 of 3 patients or &gt;= 2 of 6 patients experience DLT,&#xD;
      provided that that dose level is &lt;=25% lower than the highest (intolerable) dose tested. If&#xD;
      the projected RP2D is &gt; 25% lower than the highest dose tested, then an additional cohort of&#xD;
      &gt;=3 patients will be added at a dose that is intermediate between the intolerable dose and&#xD;
      the next lower dose. Once RP2D is reached, approximately 60 patients may be enrolled in the&#xD;
      Dose Expansion cohort. The dose schedule for the Dose Expansion Phase will be the same as&#xD;
      that for the Dose Escalation Phase. There is no maximum duration of participation for any&#xD;
      patient enrolled in this study. However it is anticipated that for patients remaining on&#xD;
      study for prolonged periods, an Extension study protocol will be made available in the near&#xD;
      future.The dose used in the expansion phases of the study will be the RP2D (or lower doses)&#xD;
      as determined in the dose escalation phases of the study.&#xD;
