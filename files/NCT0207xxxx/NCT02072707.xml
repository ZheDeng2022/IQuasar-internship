  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesized that combined endocardial and epicardial VT ablation using&#xD;
      contact sensor irrigated catheter is safe and achieves a lower recurrence rate than&#xD;
      endocardial only ablation in ischemic and non-ischemic patients, for this the investigators&#xD;
      will randomize 20 patients in two groups, one with endocardial only ablation and other with&#xD;
      combined endocardial and epicardial ablation.&#xD;

      Pilot Study Design The investigators will select 20 ischemic or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy&#xD;
      patients with scar related Ventricular tachycardia with indication of VT ablation. After&#xD;
      informed consent, these patients will be randomized to endocardial only (Control Group) or&#xD;
      combined endocardial and epicardial ablation (Treatment Group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria Patients with ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and recurrent&#xD;
      sustained monomorphic VT requiring cardioversion or antiarrhythmic drug administration with&#xD;
      ≥4 episodes in the previous 6 months despite an ICD or antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Patients&#xD;
      without ICD were eligible after 2 episodes of sustained VT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria Creatinine level &gt;2.5mg/dL; LV ejection fraction &lt;10%; NYHA Class IV;&#xD;
      mobile thrombus on LV; absence of vascular access to the LV; life-expectancy of less than 12&#xD;
      months; previous open-chest cardiac surgical procedure; unstable angina; myocardial&#xD;
      infarction in the last 2 months; severe aortic stenosis; severe mitral regurgitation&#xD;
      secondary to leaflet or chordae rupture; pregnancy and age of less than 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ablation Technique In the patients randomized for combined epicardial and endocardial&#xD;
      ablation, subxyphoid puncture will be performed according to previously described technique.&#xD;
      Following successful epicardial access on the combined epi and endocardial ablation and&#xD;
      following the venous puncture on the endocardial only group, a puncture of femoral artery&#xD;
      will be performed. If the patient has peripheral artery disease, the catheter will be&#xD;
      positioned on the left ventricle through transeptal puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroanatomic voltage map will be constructed of the endocardial and epicardial surface.&#xD;
      After map construction, programmed ventricular stimulation of the apex of the RV with S4&#xD;
      extrastimuli will be performed aiming for VT inducibility. If the induced VT is well&#xD;
      tolerated, activation mapping of the VT will be constructed in addition to entrainment&#xD;
      mapping. If the VT is not hemodynamically tolerated, it will be reverted either by Burst or&#xD;
      electrical cardioversion, than substrate modification in the scar combined with pace-mapping&#xD;
      and local abnormal electrograms (late potentials) ablation will be performed. In the patients&#xD;
      in the endocardial only group, only the endocardial surface of the right or left ventricle&#xD;
      will be ablated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the combined epicardial and endocardial group, the choice of the surface to be ablated&#xD;
      will be guided by the tachycardia mapping (mesodiastolic and pre-systolic potentials),&#xD;
      extension of the scar, pace-mapping in both surfaces. ECG criteria suggesting epicardial&#xD;
      surface will also be considered to define the epi or endo surface to be ablated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following ablation, a repeated programmed ventricular stimulation with S4 will be performed&#xD;
      to evaluated reinducibility of the VT. Additional RF applications can be performed according&#xD;
      to clinical criteria, and the procedure will be considered terminate when no VT is inducible&#xD;
      or by clinical criteria. In the endo only group that endocardial scar could not be observed&#xD;
      or following extensive endocardial ablation the clinical VT still remain inducible, and the&#xD;
      ECG criteria suggests epicardial VT will underwent epicardial mapping and ablation and this&#xD;
      will be considered as a Cross-over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: The investigators will evaluate the rate of complications related to irrigated tip&#xD;
      catheter use on epicardial surface. It is expected that the combined epicardial and&#xD;
      endocardial ablation group do not present an increase in the rate of catheter-related&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy: The investigators will evaluate if the procedure was succeeded. The investigators&#xD;
      consider success as follows: (1) Complete Success: prevention of induction of any VT&#xD;
      following ablation; (2) Partial Success: prevention of induction of the clinical VT,&#xD;
      remaining the induction of at least one non-clinical faster VT; (3) Failure: Remaining the&#xD;
      induction of the clinical or initially induced VT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: The investigators will evaluate the rate of complications related to the epicardial&#xD;
      access. It is expected a rate of hemopericardium of no more than 20%, with less than 5% rate&#xD;
      of major complications as procedure related death, cardiac surgery due to cardiac perforation&#xD;
      or blood cell transfusion.&#xD;
