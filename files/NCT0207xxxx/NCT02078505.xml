    <textblock>
      The polycystic ovary syndrome is intimately associated with body weight and nutrition.The&#xD;
      genomic era did not bring a breakthrough to the understanding of the syndrome. The recent&#xD;
      surge of studies on gut microbiome has raised the possibility that the specific diet, which&#xD;
      often affect these women favorably, would change their gut microbiome. Hence, the&#xD;
      investigators will examine their gut microbial population in comparison to normal ovulatory&#xD;
      women and then examine whether a low carbohydrate diet causes favorable change in their gut&#xD;
      microbial population.&#xD;

      - Scientific Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infertility is a major health problem that affects up to 15% of married couples. About half&#xD;
      of these cases are attributable to female factors, among which anovulation is the leading&#xD;
      cause. About 5% of all women of reproductive age are anovulatory due to the polycystic&#xD;
      ovarian syndrome (PCOS). In addition to its effect on fertility, PCOS causes major health and&#xD;
      cosmetic problems and significantly affects quality of life in women. PCOS is associated with&#xD;
      cardiovascular morbidity and Type 2 diabetes mellitus, but it is unclear whether these are&#xD;
      caused by the ovarian dysfunction or result from a common denominator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PCOS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The clinical picture:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The polycystic ovary syndrome consists of anovulation, acne, hirsutism (resulting from&#xD;
      hyperandrogenism), and reversed serum LH to FSH ratio. A large proportion of women with PCOS&#xD;
      are overweight, and a significant proportion of women with PCOS have decreased peripheral&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity. The direct cause to this insulin resistance is still enigmatic. All&#xD;
      these features place women with PCOS as a group of patients related to the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome. Baranova et al. (2011) even stated that &quot;it seems appropriate to consider&#xD;
      polycystic ovary syndrome as the ovarian manifestation of metabolic syndrome&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Genetics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not all women with PCOS have affected relatives but familial clusters are common, and&#xD;
      brothers of women with PCOS have high serum levels of the androgen dehydroepiandrosterone&#xD;
      sulfate. The eventual clinical expression of PCOS results not only from genetic&#xD;
      predisposition but also from nutritional factors. Family studies using several approaches of&#xD;
      analysis suggested up to 40 candidate genes, possibly responsible to the syndrome. Among&#xD;
      these were genes from the steroidogenic pathways, the gonadotrophin receptors signal&#xD;
      transduction pathways, the insulin signal transduction pathway and growth factor signal&#xD;
      transduction pathways. Except for some association of polymorphism in CYP11 with&#xD;
      hyperandrogenism none of these candidate genes were definitively associated with PCOS. The&#xD;
      inheritance pattern of PCOS is not clear, some evidence favor autosomal dominant mode while&#xD;
      others do not support it. Recently the methionine 196 arginine polymorphism in exon 6 of the&#xD;
      TNF receptor 2 gene (676 T--&gt;G) was shown to be associated with hyperandrogenism and PCOS,&#xD;
      but the genotype did not influence any clinical or biochemical variable related to&#xD;
      hyperandrogenism or insulin sensitivity and was not associated with obesity. A role of&#xD;
      Calpain 10 gene in PCOS susceptibility was also suggested, as was that of a variant LH&#xD;
      receptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sex hormone binding gene also showed promise but disappointed. The mode of X-chromosome&#xD;
      inactivation appears to be associated with the risk of sisters for discordancy to PCOD, but&#xD;
      no specific genes are implicated in this respect. As with many complex disorders, the&#xD;
      heritability of polycystic ovarian syndrome has eluded investigators. Although familial&#xD;
      aggregation studies have demonstrated clearly a genetic component to the syndrome, simple&#xD;
      Mendelian models do not characterize its mode of inheritance. Instead, multiple loci and&#xD;
      epigenetic modification may play a role in the phenotype. The candidate gene approach relies&#xD;
      upon improved statistical and technological methods to analyze potential genes based on&#xD;
      biologic plausibility. Pathways that affect steroidogenesis, insulin resistance, gonadotropin&#xD;
      function, and obesity provide potential genes for investigation. Obstacles such as phenotypic&#xD;
      variability, lack of a male phenotype, multiple attempts at analysis, and small sample sizes&#xD;
      hamper these efforts. Genome wide Analysis has become the gold standard for the elucidation&#xD;
      of the genetic background for many diseases. The most recent and comprehensive such analysis&#xD;
      of PCOD vs. controls was conducted by Chen et al (2011), and some candidate gens were&#xD;
      defined, but a mechanistic understanding of possible causality is still far away.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gut Microbiota&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The post genomic era led to several breakthroughs in our understanding of human physiology.&#xD;
      One of the more prominent is the realization that our alimentary tract harbors 100-fold more&#xD;
      living (bacterial) cells than our own body has. This discovery was made possible by the&#xD;
      ability to define the presence of a bacterial strain by its DNA signature, without the need&#xD;
      to culture it. Furthermore, the definition of these strains allows their allocation to major&#xD;
      taxonomic divisions, in turn enabling what is legitimately called &quot;profiling&quot; of gut&#xD;
      bacterial population diversity. Thus a new term has been coined &quot;microbiota&quot; to designate the&#xD;
      total population of our gut microbes. In addition, it is now also possible to define the&#xD;
      presence of specified enzymes and enzyme families in the gut microbiota, enabling in turn an&#xD;
      outline of overall gut microbial metabolic capacity. It is of major interest now to&#xD;
      characterize the varying taxonomic and metabolic profiles, as they pertain to specified human&#xD;
      pathologies and physiological states.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once microbiota profile that is associated with specific human pathology is characterized, a&#xD;
      key question arises as to which is the egg and which is the hen. Namely, which is causative,&#xD;
      the pathological state or the microbiota that has been shown to be associated with it? On&#xD;
      several issues recent studies proven the microbiota to be most likely causative, as&#xD;
      experimental transplantation of microbiota to mice led to the development of a state which&#xD;
      was reminiscent of the human disease. Yet the differences between microbiotas of human&#xD;
      populations on various locations across the globe raises the likely possibility that&#xD;
      ethnicity, diet and other environmental factors have a meaningful effect on gut microbiota.&#xD;
      All told, the study of the association of gut microbiota with many human conditions could&#xD;
      reveal major subjects of interest, mostly towards possible understanding of causality as well&#xD;
      as suggestions as to future corrective measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Women&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women go through several major physiological transitions during their lifetime. The first is&#xD;
      puberty, followed by conception and pregnancy, usually more than once in life, and the last&#xD;
      is menopause. It is likely that these would be associated with dynamic changes in gut&#xD;
      microbiota, as a pioneering study shown recently that pregnant women's gut microbiota is&#xD;
      profoundly altered as compared to that in non-pregnant women. Furthermore, as evidence is&#xD;
      accumulating regarding specific alteration of gut microbiota in several morbid states, it is&#xD;
      likely that woman's pathologies, such as anovulatory infertility associated with PCOS, could&#xD;
      be associated with specific alterations in gut microbiota profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Naturally, the &quot;egg vs. hen&quot; question is of importance should differences between anovulatory&#xD;
      and ovulatory women will be found, and should be tackled almost at the outset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Overall Study Objective Is there a difference in gut microbial population between normal&#xD;
      ovulatory women and women who suffer from PCOS, and if there is, what is its role in the&#xD;
      causation of the syndrome?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is there a difference in microbial population profile between women with PCOS and normal&#xD;
           ovulatory women?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can a carbohydrate-poor diet and physical activity induce a change in the gut microbial&#xD;
           population of women with PCOS?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed Study Design Specific Aim I: Is there a difference in microbial population profile&#xD;
      between women with PCOS and normal ovulatory women? A group of 30 women who will be diagnosed&#xD;
      with PCOS by the standard Rotterdam consensus criteria and 30 normal ovulatory women will&#xD;
      provide stool samples during the 3-5 initial days of their menstrual bleeding. Serum hormone&#xD;
      and metabolic profile will be obtained concomitantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be submitted to DNA sequencing in GGA laboratories (Prof. Dani Bercovich), using&#xD;
      the technique described previously in. The resulting datasets will be analyzed in the&#xD;
      laboratory of Dr. Omry Koren, the Faculty of Medicine in the Galil, using the method he&#xD;
      previously used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caveats and Potential Pitfalls It is possible that gut microbita of the two groups will not&#xD;
      show either a taxonomic difference or a difference in putative metabolic enzyme profile.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, we assume that at least one of these two arms will yield a positive product,&#xD;
      since the polycystic ovary shares characters with the metabolic syndrome, amply documented to&#xD;
      portray a distinct microbial population profile in comparison to healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim II: Can a carbohydrate-poor diet and physical activity induce a change in the&#xD;
      gut microbial population of women with PCOS? A change in diet has been known for many years&#xD;
      to favorably affect the ovulatory function of patients with PCOS, as well as alleviating some&#xD;
      of the associated cosmetic concerns. Most significantly, it is the carbohydrate element of&#xD;
      this diet which is central to this change, alongside with the addition of physical activity.&#xD;
      We will prescribe a carbohydrate-poor diet (appended table) to the study group and a&#xD;
      concomitant physical activity program (45 minutes brisk walk, 4-5 times a week). After two&#xD;
      months of this change of lifestyle we will repeat hormonal and metabolic profile, as well as&#xD;
      obtain a second stool sample. A secondary interest would be to examine whether there exists a&#xD;
      difference in the microbiome between women who would succeed in the diet and those who would&#xD;
      not, whether in the initial bacterial population profile or that which will result from the&#xD;
      diet.&#xD;
