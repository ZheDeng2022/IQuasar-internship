  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase 1, open-label study of DS-8273a to assess its safety and tolerability,&#xD;
      identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose and/or Maximum Administered Dose, and assess its&#xD;
      properties in subjects with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 5 US sites are planned for participation in Part 1 (Dose Escalation) and Part 2 (Dose&#xD;
      Expansion) in subjects with solid tumors or lymphomas.&#xD;
