  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with end stage heart failure have significant symptoms (including fatigue and&#xD;
      shortness of breath) which prevent them from being able to perform most activities of daily&#xD;
      living. Milrinone is one of the inotropic medications that has been studied and used in the&#xD;
      treatment of end stage heart failure. End stage heart failure patients awaiting a heart&#xD;
      transplantation often have to be maintained on IV milrinone 24 hours a day through a chronic&#xD;
      IV line. Two problems arise with this therapy. First, the IV line itself creates an&#xD;
      opportunity for infection and blood clots, in addition to interfering with patient's quality&#xD;
      of life. Second, patients may be exposed to higher levels of milrinone when given IV than are&#xD;
      necessary for maintaining their heart's function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By doing this study the investigators hope to learn if a new way of giving HF patients&#xD;
      milrinone can lower the levels of plasma milrinone which may lessen the chance of medication&#xD;
      side effects, while still preserving the beneficial effects of milrinone. Additionally if the&#xD;
      inhaled route of administration is effective patients may not need to have invasive IV lines&#xD;
      to administer the medication (currently standard practice) which can cause other unwanted&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 5.7 million Americans have heart failure, a leading cause of both morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in the United States. Heart failure was listed as a contributing cause in more than&#xD;
      280,000 deaths in 2008 in the U.S. (1 in 9) and about half of patients diagnosed with heart&#xD;
      failure die within 5 years. Patients with end stage heart failure have significant symptoms&#xD;
      (including fatigue and dyspnea) which prevent them from being able to perform most activities&#xD;
      of daily living. These patients often require repeated or prolonged hospitalizations for&#xD;
      disease management which contributes significantly to the cost of heart failure for the&#xD;
      United States (34.4 billion each year).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Milrinone, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, is one of the inotropic medications that has&#xD;
      been studied and used in the treatment of acutely decompensated heart failure. Several&#xD;
      studies have evaluated chronic intravenous (IV) inotrope use in end stage heart failure for&#xD;
      palliation of symptoms as well as evaluated effect on cost through decreased hospital&#xD;
      readmissions. Hauptman et al and Harjai et al demonstrated significant decreases in hospital&#xD;
      costs due to reductions in days hospitalized and readmissions after initiation of inotropes&#xD;
      including milrinone. However, the concern with IV milrinone use is the possibility of&#xD;
      increased mortality associated with therapy despite improved hemodynamics (increased cardiac&#xD;
      output, decreased filling pressures) and symptoms as was observed with chronic use of oral&#xD;
      inotropes. The OPTIME-CHF study confirmed this concern regarding the use of IV milrinone by&#xD;
      reporting increased mortality in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV&#xD;
      ischemic heart failure without hemodynamic compromise as well as statistically significant&#xD;
      increases in atrial and ventricular arrhythmias when using intravenous milrinone. For this&#xD;
      reason, the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology practice guidelines,&#xD;
      recommend use of IV milrinone only for patients presenting with clinical evidence of&#xD;
      hypotension associated with hypo-perfusion and elevated cardiac filling pressures in order to&#xD;
      maintain systemic perfusion and preserve end-organ performance. Administration of chronic IV&#xD;
      inotropes in heart failure patients with refractory symptoms is categorized as a class IIb&#xD;
      indication (&quot;usefulness/efficacy is less well established by expert opinion&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, non-blinded, open-label, phase I clinical trial. We plan to enroll a&#xD;
      total of ten patients in two blocks of five. Enrollment will be stopped after the first block&#xD;
      of 5 patients to analyze the pharmacokinetics and safety of inhaled milrinone. Patients will&#xD;
      have advanced, end-stage HF - and at the discretion of their treating cardiologist who&#xD;
      ordered the initial right heart catheterization (RHC) for evaluation of HF therapy, patients&#xD;
      will be sent for right heart catheterization (RHC) to determine if inotropic therapy would be&#xD;
      beneficial. If the treating cardiologist decides to initiate inotropic therapy based on&#xD;
      current guideline-recommended therapies after RHC is performed, the patient will be&#xD;
      considered for the trial as long as they meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators goals are two fold:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To demonstrate safety by monitoring for pre-specified adverse clinical events and by&#xD;
           conducting patient reported questionnaires at 24 and 48 +/- 12 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To characterize inhaled milrinone pharmacokinetics. Six plasma samples will be drawn at&#xD;
           pre-specified time intervals related to inhaled milrinone delivery.&#xD;
