      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ixazomib when given in&#xD;
      combination with mitoxantrone hydrochloride, etoposide, and intermediate-dose cytarabine in&#xD;
      treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia that is unresponsive to initial induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy or recurs following an initial complete remission. Acute myeloid leukemia is a&#xD;
      cancer of the bone marrow cells; bone marrow is where blood cells are normally made. Ixazomib&#xD;
      may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as mitoxantrone hydrochloride, etoposide, and&#xD;
      intermediate-dose cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Mitoxantrone hydrochloride,&#xD;
      etoposide, and intermediate-dose cytarabine are standard treatment for relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukemia. Giving ixazomib with mitoxantrone hydrochloride, etoposide, and&#xD;
      intermediate-dose cytarabine may improve the effectiveness of the chemotherapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the&#xD;
      recommended Phase 2 dose of MLN9708 (ixazomib) in combination with mitoxantrone&#xD;
      hydrochloride, etoposide, intermediate-dose cytarabine (MEC) in patients with relapsed/&#xD;
      refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the non-dose limiting toxicities associated with MLN9708 in combination with&#xD;
      MEC in patients with relapsed/ refractory AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe any preliminary evidence of clinical activity of this combination (compete&#xD;
      response [CR] rate) in relapsed/ refractory AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the median cluster of differentiation (CD)74 antigen expression in patients&#xD;
      achieving a response versus those patients not achieving a response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine if gene expression profile pre- and post-treatment correlates with response&#xD;
      to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ixazomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ixazomib orally (PO) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11, mitoxantrone hydrochloride&#xD;
      intravenously (IV), etoposide IV over 1 hour, and intermediate-dose cytarabine IV over 6&#xD;
      hours on days 1-6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4-5 weeks.&#xD;
