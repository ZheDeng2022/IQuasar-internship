      Understanding of an operation and its risks has been shown to give patients more realistic&#xD;
      expectations, increase cooperation and result in higher satisfaction. Traditionally, informed&#xD;
      consent for surgical procedures involve a discussion between the surgeon and the patient, but&#xD;
      many patients easily forget the details of these talks. The investigators wish to investigate&#xD;
      if providing a written pamphlet along with the standard oral discussion improves patients'&#xD;
      ability to remember the details of the operation, improving the quality of the informed&#xD;
      consent process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, we will test whether a group consultation format provides a model for&#xD;
      large-volume, low-variation, low-urgency surgery without reducing ability to recall risks of&#xD;
      surgery or overall satisfaction.&#xD;

      Objective of this study The investigators' study objectives are to see if additionally&#xD;
      providing a written document along with the discussion of surgical risks improves risk recall&#xD;
      for patient seen in consultation for open carpal tunnel release, and if this has any effect&#xD;
      on overall satisfaction after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish this goal, the investigators intend to provide patients with a written document&#xD;
      outlining the same risks as are discussed in consultation and investigate if their recall of&#xD;
      the risks is improved compared to patients who receive discussion alone. The investigators&#xD;
      will also see whether risk recall is affected if patients participate in a group format&#xD;
      informed consent discussion compared to a standard individual discussion. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to do this as a two-part prospective randomized control trial of patients who are new&#xD;
      referrals to the Halifax Infirmary Plastic Surgery Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background The informed consent process The risks and benefits of an operation or procedure&#xD;
      are typically discussed as part of the informed consent process for an initial surgical&#xD;
      consultation. Informed consent is a legal requirement for surgery and is based on the&#xD;
      components of disclosure, comprehension, competence and voluntary choice. Despite this,&#xD;
      patients are often unable to recall the specific risks that were reviewed. Additionally,&#xD;
      failure to understand the possible risks and failure of communication are more common reasons&#xD;
      for patients to seek legal action. Patients have historically reported that they wished they&#xD;
      had received more information about their operation prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased understanding of a procedure and its risks has been shown to give patients more&#xD;
      realistic expectations, increase cooperation and result in higher satisfaction.&#xD;
      Traditionally, obtaining informed consent for surgical procedures has involved an oral&#xD;
      discussion, but this may be insufficient as oral information tends to be poorly retained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research in the field of otolaryngology has shown that written documentation in&#xD;
      addition to oral discussion increases recall of both general knowledge of a procedure and of&#xD;
      the specific risks of a procedure. Siau et al. (2010) found that this effect was even more&#xD;
      pronounced for recall of the risks associated with the operation and that subjectively&#xD;
      patients were found to be happy to have received a pamphlet and found it helpful. Early&#xD;
      research into this subject in general surgery suggested that the optimal time to provide&#xD;
      additional information regarding a procedure is at the time of the initial consultation or at&#xD;
      least one week prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' research is important as it could show that providing a written document&#xD;
      in conjunction with the standard oral discussion improves patients' risk recall in the&#xD;
      informed consent process for open carpal tunnel surgery. In addition, the investigators wish&#xD;
      to look into whether this in turn increases satisfaction with the procedure. Though past&#xD;
      research has drawn a link between comprehension and satisfaction, very little research has&#xD;
      been conducted specifically on this topic. In the future this research could be extended to&#xD;
      other surgical practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to large volumes of patients requiring open carpal tunnel release, wait times following&#xD;
      referral can vary from 30 to 151 days in Nova Scotia, with an average wait time of 59 days&#xD;
      (Patient Access Registry NS, July-September 2013). While open carpal tunnel release surgery&#xD;
      is a very brief procedure with an extremely low rate of post-operative complications (Ono et&#xD;
      al., 2010), the presurgical consultation with each patient takes a large proportion of the&#xD;
      time spent by both patient and surgeon addressing the disease. To address a similar problem&#xD;
      involving extensive information required prior to surgery, the UHN breast reconstruction&#xD;
      program in Toronto is in the process of piloting an educational group intervention, which&#xD;
      includes seminar-style lectures and group discussion, in order to improve shared decision&#xD;
      making in women undergoing post-mastectomy breast reconstruction (Platt et al., 2013). We&#xD;
      seek to implement a similar program for patients scheduled to undergo open carpal tunnel&#xD;
      release.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the Weiss model of medical stigma (Weiss et al., 2006), Carpal Tunnel Syndrome&#xD;
      could be considered a disease with minimal stigma attached. As one would correspondingly&#xD;
      expect, when offered the opportunity to participate in a group seminar style presurgical&#xD;
      consult, many patients have expressed a positive opinion and willingness to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there are no differences between risk recall or general satisfaction in patients who are&#xD;
      part of a group consultation compared to a traditional consult, group consultation may be a&#xD;
      viable tool to shorten wait times for patients undergoing specific kinds of medical and&#xD;
      surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The investigators are testing whether providing a written document in conjunction&#xD;
      with the standard oral discussion improve patients' risk recall in the informed consent&#xD;
      process for open carpal tunnel release and increase patients' subjective satisfaction with&#xD;
      their operation. In addition, the investigators will test whether a group consultation format&#xD;
      provides a model for large-volume, low-variation, low-urgency surgery without reducing&#xD;
      ability to recall risks of surgery or overall satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Selection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators study will be a two-part prospective randomized study, each of 100&#xD;
      consecutive patients being seen for open carpal tunnel release consultation at the Halifax&#xD;
      Infirmary. Inclusion criteria will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was chosen based on previous studies investigating risk recall and a power&#xD;
      calculation with the hypothesis of a mean of 4 items recalled, a standard deviation of 2.5&#xD;
      (alpha 0.05, beta 0.95), giving us a sample size given our hypothesis (n = 40 per study&#xD;
      group).&#xD;
