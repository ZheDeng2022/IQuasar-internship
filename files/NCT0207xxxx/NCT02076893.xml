  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tonsillectomy is the most common pediatric surgical procedure performed in the US, with over&#xD;
      530,000 procedures performed annually in children under 15 years (Baugh et al., 2011). The&#xD;
      postoperative period can be particularly painful. A recent clinical consensus acknowledges&#xD;
      there is no standard analgesic protocol, and calls for further research comparing&#xD;
      postoperative pain medications (Baugh et al., 2011). Tramadol was found to be as effective as&#xD;
      codeine with few reported side effects in a recent double-blinded, controlled trial conducted&#xD;
      by the investigators at Children's Hospitals and Clinics (CHC), and it is currently being&#xD;
      prescribed in the postoperative setting. However, despite its effectiveness for pain control,&#xD;
      there were some children that continued to report pain during the 10-day follow-up period. In&#xD;
      response, the investigators will conduct a randomized, double-blinded controlled trial to&#xD;
      determine whether or not adding scheduled gabapentin to a scheduled tramadol + &quot;as needed&quot;&#xD;
      (PRN) ibuprofen regimen provides better pain control than tramadol + ibuprofen PRN alone&#xD;
      during the post-tonsillectomy period. Using a 10-day take-home diary, caregivers will be&#xD;
      asked to record daily information about their child's postoperative pain and other core&#xD;
      outcomes and domains as recommended in the recent consensus statement put forth by the&#xD;
      Pediatric Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials&#xD;
      (IMMPACT) (McGrath et al., 2008). This study will offer new information regarding the&#xD;
      efficacy and side effects associated with adding scheduled gabapentin to a postoperative pain&#xD;
      management protocol in a pediatric population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Children who receive scheduled tramadol 1mg/kgQ6h with scheduled gabapentin (3 mg/kg/q6h&#xD;
      dose) and PRN ibuprofen will experience better pain relief than children who receive&#xD;
      scheduled tramadol 1mg/kgQ6h with PRN ibuprofen following tonsillectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: Children who receive scheduled tramadol 1mg/kgQ6h with scheduled gabapentin and PRN&#xD;
      ibuprofen will report fewer side effects than children who receive scheduled tramadol&#xD;
      1mg/kgQ6h with PRN ibuprofen following tonsillectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study will include children ages 4 to 15 that are scheduled to undergo a&#xD;
      tonsillectomy (with or without adenoidectomy) procedure at CHC's Minneapolis campus with one&#xD;
      of the three Children's Ear, Nose, Throat and Facial Plastic Surgery surgeons. The three&#xD;
      surgeons will perform the same standardized surgical technique. The study will be&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, and double-blinded. Neither the patient /caregiver(s) nor the&#xD;
      person(s) evaluating the patient postoperatively will know whether the patient was assigned&#xD;
      to Group 1 or Group 2. A random numbers list will be generated to assign sequential patients&#xD;
      to Group 1 or Group 2 in order to eliminate selection bias due to group assignment or&#xD;
      post-operative evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To minimize any potential risks associated with either tramadol or gabapentin when&#xD;
      administered to obese children (i.e, children at the 85th percentile BMI or higher) the&#xD;
      medication dose will be capped at a rate representing the 85th percentile for the child's&#xD;
      age, sex and height.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregivers will be advised to administer the scheduled tramadol for five days along with&#xD;
      scheduled gabapentin (or placebo) for five days. PRN doses of ibuprofen may be administered&#xD;
      throughout the 10-day study period. For postoperative days 6-10, both groups will be advised&#xD;
      to switch to a PRN regimen of ibuprofen and tramadol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregivers will be advised NOT to administer any study medication if the child shows signs of&#xD;
      over-sedation (respiratory rate lower than normal, slurred speech, etc.) or vomiting as a&#xD;
      result of the study drug, AND will be asked to call the Ear Nose &amp; Throat group in case of&#xD;
      severe pain and or side effects (24/7 contact information will be provided). If the patient&#xD;
      displays signs of severe over-sedation (breathing rate less than 12 breaths/minute,&#xD;
      difficulty or inability to be aroused) parents will be advised to call 911. If in doubt, the&#xD;
      caregiver will be asked to call the 24/7 ENT group phone number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all adverse events that arise during the study period, both non-urgent and urgent, the&#xD;
      first point of contact for families will be with Children's Ear Nose &amp; Throat and Facial&#xD;
      Plastic Surgery. If families contact Children's pharmacy with any questions related to dosing&#xD;
      or side effects, pharmacy staff will either contact Children's Ear, Nose &amp; Throat and Facial&#xD;
      Plastic Surgery themselves or refer the family to do so. For severe adverse events&#xD;
      (respiratory depression, over sedation, seizure, etc.) and/or the child is seen by a&#xD;
      physician due to potential drug side effects, the pharmacist will be authorized to break the&#xD;
      blind. If in doubt, the pharmacist can call Children's Ear, Nose &amp; Throat and Facial Plastic&#xD;
      Surgery for guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staff Assessment and Caregiver Diary&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following patient and clinical information will be collected by research staff: patient's&#xD;
      age, gender, race, diagnosis (apnea or chronic tonsillitis), concomitant medication use,&#xD;
      postoperative pain, and tonsil size rated on a scale of 1 to 4 (see Appendix I).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice of outcome domains and measures in this study is based on a consensus paper&#xD;
      developed by the Pediatric Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in&#xD;
      Clinical Trials (PedIMMPACT) expert panel (McGrath et al., 2008). Acute pain domains are&#xD;
      included in the caregiver diary for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A daily diary will be completed by the caregiver and will be used to track the patient's pain&#xD;
      symptoms, side effects, adverse events, and recovery during the first 24 hours and ten days&#xD;
      post-surgery. This diary was developed and modified based on feedback received for the diary&#xD;
      used in the recent clinical trial (Friedrichsdorf, unpublished). In addition, the research&#xD;
      coordinator will contact the caregiver every second day to collect the same data and insure&#xD;
      that the diary is completed. The patient /caregiver data will be compared to responses&#xD;
      provided during the telephone call in order to validate diary entries. Intensity of pain and&#xD;
      discomfort due to pain will be measured utilizing several methods including: a validated pain&#xD;
      scale, documentation of use of analgesics and rescue medications, waking from sleep, time to&#xD;
      ability to eat solid food, and time to return to normal activity. Other outcome measures&#xD;
      include: fluid intake, general satisfaction with treatment, and economic impact of recovery&#xD;
      (e.g., need for additional outpatient care for throat and/or ear pain, bleeding, nausea, or&#xD;
      poor eating).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, pain self-assessment by the children and adolescents will include the Faces&#xD;
      Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) (with anchors 0=no pain and 10=highest pain imaginable) for&#xD;
      children ages 4-10 (Hicks et al., 2001), and NRS-11 (with anchors 0=no pain and 10 = highest&#xD;
      pain imaginable) for children ages 11-15 (note: children age 8-10 years will be asked to&#xD;
      choose either the FPS-R or NRS-11, as both scales are validated for use with children in this&#xD;
      middle age range). The designated caregiver participating in the study will receive training&#xD;
      on pain scale administration. The study coordinator or research associate will call&#xD;
      caregivers every two days during the follow-up period to remind them to complete the diary&#xD;
      and return it in the postage-paid envelope provided by research staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Requirements and Data Maintenance&#xD;
&#xD;
      All paper forms will be stored in a locked file cabinet located in the Pain and Palliative&#xD;
      Care department office. Data will be entered into Excel on a secure, password-protected&#xD;
      Children's server and will be exported to SPSS for analysis. The study coordinator will&#xD;
      maintain all paper and electronic data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks/Benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks There is no additional medical risk associated with post-surgical pain management above&#xD;
      and beyond the usual risks. Neither tramadol nor gabapentin pose any known additional safety&#xD;
      risk. However, because little has been published in the pediatric literature about these two&#xD;
      medications and their application in the postoperative setting, the researchers will form a&#xD;
      small Data and Safety Monitoring Committee comprised of Children's staff members who are not&#xD;
      part of the study. This committee will be responsible for reviewing serious adverse events as&#xD;
      requested by the researchers (e.g., pharmacist, pain expert, etc.). As with any study, there&#xD;
      is a risk of loss of confidentiality due to the possibility that people outside the study&#xD;
      (e.g., staff, other families) may become aware of the child's participation in the study. The&#xD;
      researchers will make every effort to ensure patients' privacy through use of private rooms&#xD;
      for all research-related activities. Paper research forms will be stored in the Pain and&#xD;
      Palliative Care office in a locked file cabinet, and all electronic data will be stored on a&#xD;
      password-protected file on the Children's server.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits There is a possibility that children who receive tramadol plus gabapentin with PRN&#xD;
      ibuprofen during the recovery period will report better pain control, fewer side effects, or&#xD;
      both than the children who receive tramadol plus PRN ibuprofen only. Future children and&#xD;
      their families may benefit from the knowledge gained from the study in terms of improved pain&#xD;
      management during the post-tonsillectomy recovery period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following outcomes will be measured at two, four and 24 hours post-surgery, and then&#xD;
      daily for the duration of the follow-up period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain: Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) or Numerical Rating Scale (NRS-11)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative pain: Parents' Postoperative Pain Measure (PPPM)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre/Postoperative medication use, including any rescue medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient- and caregiver-reported side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep: difficulty falling asleep or difficulty waking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluid intake&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of patients requiring outpatient care for complications of tonsillectomy&#xD;
           including, but not limited to: throat and/or ear pain, bleeding, nausea&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parent global satisfaction with treatment, recorded as 0-10 (0=Very Dissatisfied to&#xD;
           10=Very Satisfied) on a visual analog scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the participants and measurement results&#xD;
      including frequency distribution for categorical data such as gender and any sleep problem&#xD;
      (Yes/No), and mean (standard deviation) or median (range) for continuous data such as age,&#xD;
      fluid intake, pain intensity score and parent global satisfaction with their child's&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of days with pain intensity score greater than 4 will be compared between the&#xD;
      tramadol/ibuprofen group and tramadol/gabapentin/ibuprofen group using a two-sample t-test or&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney test. The PPPM scores and parental global satisfaction with their child's&#xD;
      recovery between two groups will be compared using the two-sample t-test or Mann-Whitney test&#xD;
      as well. Eta correlation coefficients will be calculated to examine the relationship between&#xD;
      PPPM score and the pain intensity score. Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test will be used&#xD;
      to compare the categorical data between two groups such as percent of patients having any&#xD;
      postoperative office visit due to pain/bleeding/nausea and any side effects happened during&#xD;
      the postoperative 10 days. A logistic regression model will be fit with 'patients having &gt;2&#xD;
      days of pain score of &gt; 4' as the dependent variable and other factors such as patient age,&#xD;
      procedure, medication as independent variables in order to identify clinical factors&#xD;
      predictive of postoperative pain following tonsillectomy in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group sample sizes of 30 and 30 achieve 80% power to detect a difference of 2 in days with&#xD;
      pain score &gt; 4 between the Tramadol group and the Gabapentin group with estimated group&#xD;
      standard deviations of 2.7 and with a significance level of 0.05 using a two-sided two-sample&#xD;
      t-test. Assuming a 20% dropout, at least 36 patients will be needed in each group. The&#xD;
      researchers plan to enroll at least 80 parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Environment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place on Children's Minneapolis campus. Data will be stored in the Pain,&#xD;
      Palliative and Integrative Medicine office, currently located in the Medical Doctor's&#xD;
      Building. This study will make use of CHC's outpatient pharmacy services in order to ensure&#xD;
      proper dispensing and blinding.&#xD;
