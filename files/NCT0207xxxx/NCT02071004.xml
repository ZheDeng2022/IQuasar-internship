  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, open label, single dose study, after 5 days of aspirin treatment, in&#xD;
      healthy male and female subjects. It is hypothesized that co-administering DS-1040b with&#xD;
      aspirin at steady state will be safe and well tolerated by healthy male and female subjects.&#xD;
