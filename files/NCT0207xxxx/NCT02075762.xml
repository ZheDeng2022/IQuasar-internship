      The objective of this study is to compare the sample size, architectural preservation and&#xD;
      diagnostic yield of bronchoscopic cryo-probe transbronchial lung biopsy (C-TBBx) in&#xD;
      comparison to bronchoscopic standard transbronchial lung biopsy (S-TBBx) and Video-Assisted&#xD;
      Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) lung biopsy for the diagnosis of interstitial lung disease&#xD;
      (ILD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study in which 20 subjects that have suspected ILD who are&#xD;
      undergoing non-emergent surgical biopsy will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have been referred to the thoracic surgery service for VATS biopsy to diagnose&#xD;
      suspected ILD and meet basic inclusion/exclusion criteria will be approached by the study&#xD;
      investigators and informed of the study. An informed consent will be obtained during the&#xD;
      clinic visit with the thoracic surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the surgical procedure, under general anesthesia in the operating room,&#xD;
      patients will undergo flexible bronchoscopy through the endotracheal tube and obtain 10&#xD;
      standard transbronchial biopsies (S-TBBx) and 5 Cryoprobe biopsies (C-TBBx) with fluoroscopic&#xD;
      guidance. S-TBBx will be performed using standard biopsy forceps (Boston Scientific, Natick,&#xD;
      MA) - 2.0mm diameter. C-TBBx will be performed using the cryoprobe (ERBE, Tubingen, Germany)&#xD;
      -1.9 mm diameter, 78cm in length. This cryoprobe is routinely used in the bronchoscopy suite&#xD;
      for other applications such as foreign body removal and local treatment of carcinoma;&#xD;
      therefore it is a technique already employed by the interventional pulmonologists who are&#xD;
      familiar with its use. Once the biopsies are obtained by the interventional pulmonologist,&#xD;
      the thoracic surgeon will perform video-assisted thoracoscopic biopsy (VATS) biopsy.&#xD;
      Following their procedure, subjects will be monitored in the post-anesthesia care unit as per&#xD;
      standard of care. As part of their ongoing follow-up care, all subjects will be monitored for&#xD;
      any adverse events that may have resulted from either the surgical or bronchoscopic&#xD;
      procedure, specifically bleeding or pneumothorax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All biopsy samples will be analyzed by a specialist in pulmonary pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number and size of all biopsies, architectural preservation of the airways/alveoli, and&#xD;
      pathological diagnosis will be reported by the pathologist. Diagnostic yield will be&#xD;
      calculated for each biopsy technique and compared&#xD;
