      Purpose: The proposed research, if successfully implemented, will result in a low-dose,&#xD;
      low-cost, and highly effective method for screening of lung cancer, leading to reduction of&#xD;
      the lung cancer mortality rate. Using the stationary Digital Chest Tomosynthesis (s-DCT)&#xD;
      system the imaging dose for a full tomosynthesis scan is expected to be only 10% of that from&#xD;
      a low-dose computed tomography (CT). The targeted imaging time of 2s is 1/5 to 1/3 of that&#xD;
      from a current commercial digital chest tomosynthesis (DCT) system at the same imaging dose.&#xD;
      Beyond lung cancer screening, the low-dose and sensitive 3D lung imaging modality will likely&#xD;
      to find applications in areas such as monitoring of pediatric cystic fibrosis patients where&#xD;
      reduction of imaging dose is critical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: One hundred (100) patients undergoing a clinical non-contrast CT for their lung&#xD;
      nodules will be asked to have this procedure (scan) within 2 weeks (+/- 1 week) of their&#xD;
      clinical CT and chest radiograph, with no intervening procedures or therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): The purpose and endpoint of this study is to compare the sensitivity of&#xD;
      the s-DCT system to the conventional chest radiographs with non-contrast chest CT as the&#xD;
      reference standard. One hundred (100) patients undergoing a clinical non-contrast CT for&#xD;
      their lung nodules will be asked to have this procedure (scan) within 2 weeks (+/- 1 week) of&#xD;
      their clinical CT and chest radiograph, with no intervening procedures or therapies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a one arm study of 100 patients with one or more lung nodules based on standard&#xD;
      imaging (chest CT) at UNC Hospitals that consent to undergo an experimental s-DCT to&#xD;
      characterize the number and extent of lung nodules. Most patients will also have undergone a&#xD;
      standard of care (SOC) chest radiograph (CR). The sensitivity of the CR and of the&#xD;
      experimental s-DCT will be estimated separately, using the CT as the gold-standard. The&#xD;
      sensitivities of the CR and the s-DCT will then be compared. In the event that CRs are not&#xD;
      included in the SOC imaging or are unusable (outside of acceptable window (i.e. do not&#xD;
      accommodate s-DCT within 2 weeks) or poor quality), the scout image acquired by CT will be&#xD;
      used in place of a CR. The scout image is a preliminary radiograph that is taken prior to&#xD;
      performing a definitive CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working in collaboration with the University of North Carolina (UNC) Multi-Disciplinary&#xD;
      Thoracic Oncology (MTOP) group, the investigators plan to inform patients that they may be&#xD;
      contacted to participate in this study to evaluate the sensitivity of the s-DCT system, using&#xD;
      the SOC CR and chest CT for comparison. CRs are included to provide a basis for comparing&#xD;
      system sensitivity, representing a minimum standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a patient has been referred, or the investigators have collaborated with the treating&#xD;
      clinic regarding the eligibility of a subject, the patient will be approached by a&#xD;
      coordinator from Radiology to assess interest in participation. The coordinator will either&#xD;
      go to the treating clinic, or will call the patient at home, after he/she have been apprised&#xD;
      of the study by his/her treating physician/nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is interested in participation, he/she will be consented either then (in their&#xD;
      treatment clinic) or when he/she arrives to have his/her s-DCT, but prior to any study&#xD;
      procedures. Review of the consent will take place in the privacy of an exam room, or when&#xD;
      possible, a sample consent form will be sent to the patient via email prior to arriving for&#xD;
      the scan to allow for ample review. Once the patient has consented, women of child bearing&#xD;
      potential (WCBP) will be given a urine pregnancy test in order to ensure that they are not&#xD;
      pregnant. If a urine pregnancy test shows a result positive for pregnancy, the patient will&#xD;
      be excluded from the study per the exclusion criteria because the investigators cannot, in&#xD;
      good conscience, expose a fetus to unnecessary radiation exposure. If the urine pregnancy&#xD;
      test shows that the patient is not pregnant, she may participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study scan, s-DCT, will be performed within two weeks of his/her clinical evaluations by&#xD;
      chest CT and CR. There cannot be any intervening therapies or procedures (i.e. biopsy or&#xD;
      excision of lesions) done in between the SOC imaging and the s-DCT. In the event that CRs are&#xD;
      not included in the SOC imaging or are unusable (outside of acceptable window or poor&#xD;
      quality), the scout image acquired by CT will be used in place of a CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Images will be acquired by a trained radiologist technologist. The technologist will&#xD;
      comfortably position the patient in the supine position on the imaging table. Then, all&#xD;
      patients will have a breath held s-DCT scan in an anterior-posterior direction. Images will&#xD;
      be reconstructed off-line and transferred for review on conventional picture archival and&#xD;
      storage (PACS) workstations. Images will be reviewed by radiologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary objective of this study is to determine the specificity of the s-DCT system in&#xD;
      determining malignancy. In order to assess this objective each patient will be followed for&#xD;
      up to 1 year following study imaging. If a known nodule is biopsied, the malignancy will be&#xD;
      determined as indicated by the pathology report. If the nodule is followed but not biopsied&#xD;
      within 1 year, the nodule will be considered to be not malignant for the purposes of this&#xD;
      research study. However, some instances may occur in which nodules are not biopsied and are&#xD;
      considered malignant. In these instances, subsequent CTs and clinical reports will be used to&#xD;
      determine malignancy during this 1 year follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A reader study will be performed after all patients have been accrued. Each of the 3 scans&#xD;
      per patient will be de-identified. As reading of all tests will take place after the patient&#xD;
      has undergone clinical decision making (treatment versus following), the results of this&#xD;
      study will not affect patient care. A total of 5 radiologist readers, with at least two years&#xD;
      of CT experience will serve as readers. Each reader will separately interpret the CR and&#xD;
      s-DCT study for all patients. For each lesion, readers will measure a cranial caudal (CC)&#xD;
      diameter, to evaluate the system's ability to reproduce CT size measurements. Lesion&#xD;
      identification and averaged measurement of the CC diameter by Thoracic Radiology&#xD;
      subspecialists measured on conventional CT with clinical interpretation will serve as&#xD;
      reference standard for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each reader will separately interpret CR and s-DCT images in random order at two different&#xD;
      reading sessions with a one month wash-out period in between reads. The radiologists will&#xD;
      identify lesions, measure the CC size of the lesion and rate their confidence in deciding a&#xD;
      lesion is present based on radiographic features evaluation, specifically the identification&#xD;
      of lesions.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1 year following imaging</time_frame>
    <description>Specificity for this objective is defined as the ability of the s-DCT system to identify a lesion as non-malignant over the course of 1 year post s-DCT. The gold standard will vary depending on the clinical situation as follows:&#xD;
In the subset of who undergo a biopsy of a suspicious lesion, the pathology report will be the gold standard.&#xD;
If a biopsy is not performed, but CT scan is performed within the 1 year timeframe, and a diagnosis of malignancy based on this nodule is made, the CT scan will be the gold standard.&#xD;
If a biopsy or CT scan is not performed, but the clinical records indicate the lesion is malignant (within the one year timeframe), this will be the gold standard.</description>

        <description>Specificity for this objective is defined as the ability of the s-DCT system to identify a lesion as non-malignant over the course of 1 year post s-DCT. The gold standard will vary depending on the clinical situation as follows:&#xD;
In the subset of who undergo a biopsy of a suspicious lesion, the pathology report will be the gold standard.&#xD;
If a biopsy is not performed, but CT scan is performed within the 1 year timeframe, and a diagnosis of malignancy based on this nodule is made, the CT scan will be the gold standard.&#xD;
If a biopsy or CT scan is not performed, but the clinical records indicate the lesion is malignant (within the one year timeframe), this will be the gold standard.</description>
