    <measure>Change From Baseline in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) Total Score at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>YMRS: an 11-item scale that measured the severity of manic episodes. Four items (irritability, speech, thought content, and disruptive/ aggressive behavior) were rated on a scale from 0 (symptom absent) to 8 (symptom extremely severe). The remaining items were rated on a scale from 0 (symptom absent) to 4 (symptom extremely severe). YMRS total score was sum of score of all 11 items and ranged from 0 (no symptoms) to 60 (extreme severity of symptoms), higher score indicated higher severity of mania.</description>

    <description>AIMS: clinician rated 12-item scale to document occurrences of dyskinesia in participants, specifically tardive dyskinesia.

      <pre_assignment_details>The study was conducted in the United States and Ukraine. Study started on 23 May 2014 and completed on 18 May 2020. Total 171 participants were randomized to treatment, of which 86 received study medication.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Ziprasidone</title>
          <description>Participants were randomized to receive ziprasidone capsules orally once daily for 4 weeks. Dose was titrated over the first 7-14 days of treatment, and the stable dose was maintained for remaining treatment period. Participants with body weight less than 45 kilogram (kg) received 60 to 80 milligram per day (mg/day) and participants with body weight greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 45 kg received 120 to 160 mg/day, as per investigator discretion. Participants after completion or discontinuation of treatment were followed-up to 35 days (5 weeks) after last dose in this study or were eligible to enroll in open label extension study A1281201 (NCT03768726).</description>

YMRS total score was sum of score of all 11 items and ranged from 0 (no symptoms) to 60 (extreme severity of symptoms), higher score indicated higher severity of mania.</description>

It is a semi-structured interview that captures the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors. C-SSRS items were mapped to the following C-CASA categories: completed suicide, attempted suicide (actual attempt; aborted attempt; interrupted attempt), non-suicidal self-injurious behavior, preparatory acts, suicidal ideation (wish to be dead; non-specific active suicidal thoughts; active suicidal ideation with any methods [not plan], without intent to act; active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan; active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent; self-injurious behavior, no suicidal intent). Rows according to C-CASA categories at specified time points are reported in this outcome measure, only when there was non-zero data/values for at least 1 reporting arm.</description>

Dose was titrated over the first 7-14 days of treatment, and the stable dose was maintained for remaining treatment period. Participants with body weight less than 45 kilogram (kg) received 60 to 80 milligram per day (mg/day) and participants with body weight greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 45 kg received 120 to 160 mg/day, as per investigator discretion.

            <description>Participants were randomized to receive ziprasidone capsules orally once daily for 4 weeks. Dose was titrated over the first 7-14 days of treatment, and the stable dose was maintained for remaining treatment period. Participants with body weight less than 45 kilogram (kg) received 60 to 80 milligram per day (mg/day) and participants with body weight greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 45 kg received 120 to 160 mg/day, as per investigator discretion. Participants after completion or discontinuation of treatment were followed-up to 35 days (5 weeks) after last dose in this study or were eligible to enroll in open label extension study A1281201 (NCT03768726).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Body Mass Index (BMI) Z-score at Week 4 and Early Termination Visit</title>
        <description>BMI z-score was reported using the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia z-score calculator. Z-score is a statistical measure to describe whether a mean was above or below the standard. A z-score of 0 is equal to the mean and is considered normal. Lower numbers indicate values lower than the mean and higher numbers indicate values higher than the mean. Higher values are indicative of higher BMI.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Body Mass Index (BMI) Z-score at Week 4 and Early Termination Visit</title>
          <description>BMI z-score was reported using the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia z-score calculator. Z-score is a statistical measure to describe whether a mean was above or below the standard. A z-score of 0 is equal to the mean and is considered normal. Lower numbers indicate values lower than the mean and higher numbers indicate values higher than the mean. Higher values are indicative of higher BMI.</description>
          <population>The safety analysis set included all participants who were randomized and took at least 1 dose of study medication (ziprasidone or placebo). Here 'number analyzed' signifies number of participants evaluable for this outcome measure at specified time points.</population>

        <description>CDRS-R: clinician-rated interview-based scale (with both child and parent or guardian) to assess 17 distinct symptom areas to derive an index of depression severity. Discrepancies between informants responses were resolved by using most impaired rating given by valid informant. Rated on a 7-point scale; range from 1 (no impairment) to 7 (maximum impairment). Higher scores indicated greater impairment.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) - Movement Cluster Score at Weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4</title>
        <description>AIMS: clinician rated 12-item scale to document occurrences of dyskinesia in participants, specifically tardive dyskinesia. Items 1 to 10, scored as 0 (none) to 4 (severe); higher score indicates greater severity. Items 11 to 12 are questions with No or Yes response. Only the sum of the first 7 items were calculated to evaluate AIMS movement cluster score, giving a score range of 0 (none) to 28 (maximum severity), higher score indicates greater severity.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 1, 2, 3, 4</time_frame>
        <population>ITT included all randomized participants who had baseline measurements, took at least 1 dose of study medication (ziprasidone or placebo) and had at least 1 post-baseline visit.</population>

Participants after completion or discontinuation of treatment were followed-up to 35 days (5 weeks) after last dose in this study or were eligible to enroll in open label extension study A1281201 (NCT03768726).</description>
