      A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a system that provides a separate output pathway for&#xD;
      neurological signals whereby they can be interpreted to determine the user's intended&#xD;
      cognitive action. Utilizing EEG-based sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs) generated in the motor&#xD;
      cortex has allowed subjects to control virtual computer cursors in up to three dimensions by&#xD;
      simply imagining the movement of a specified body part. Nevertheless, the scalp EEG signals&#xD;
      are smeared by the volume conduction effect and measurement noise. The overall hypothesis of&#xD;
      this study is that EEG-based virtual object control may help reveal optimal motor imagination&#xD;
      tasks best used in a BCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI's hypotheses include: (1) The use of advanced signal processing techniques will better&#xD;
      reveal characteristics of EEG signals that represent the underlying motor cognitive function&#xD;
      of the subject; (2) BCI systems based on SMR generated using motor imaginations will allow&#xD;
      effective control of a virtual object in real time; (3) EEG imaging techniques will provide&#xD;
      insight into the areas of cortical activation during a motor imagery task that can be&#xD;
      utilized to increase the spatial resolution of non-invasive BCI's.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The goal of the present study is to explore advanced signal processing techniques that will&#xD;
      better reveal characteristics of EEG signals that represent the underlying motor cognitive&#xD;
      function of the subject, and conduct experiments to better control an virtual object on the&#xD;
      computer screen including a cursor or a helicopter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to test the above hypotheses (1) and (2) in a healthy&#xD;
      subject population.This study will determine the ability of subjects with full cognitive&#xD;
      function to control a non-invasive brain-computer interface by imagining a particular&#xD;
      movement. Using non-invasive methods, we will investigate the neural processes that occur&#xD;
      during the motor imagination tasks associated with controlling a virtual object. Using a&#xD;
      variety of motor imaginations, we will determine which tasks are best used for BCI control by&#xD;
      quantitative means of BCI performance and neurological dynamic system analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects for this study will be healthy, English speaking adult volunteers (18-64 years old)&#xD;
      with no history of mental illness, neurological deficit, or traumatic brain injury.&#xD;
