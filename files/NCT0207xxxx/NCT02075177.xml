  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently there is no known effective treatment for recurrent/resistant neuroblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fenretinide is an anticancer agent that may work differently than standard chemotherapy&#xD;
      medicines. It may cause the buildup of wax-like substances in neuroblastoma cancer cells,&#xD;
      called &quot;ceramides&quot; or other chemicals, called 'reactive oxygen species'. In laboratory&#xD;
      studies it was found that if too much ceramide or reactive oxygen species build up in&#xD;
      neuroblastoma cells, they may die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, researchers are testing to see if a drug called ketoconazole, commonly used to&#xD;
      treat fungus infections, can increase fenretinide levels in the body by interfering with the&#xD;
      body's ability to break down fenretinide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being done: 1) to allow patients with recurrent/refractory neuroblastoma&#xD;
      patients who would otherwise not be able to access fenretinide/LXS oral powder for treatment&#xD;
      to do so; 2) to further describe the side effects of fenretinide and ketoconazole when given&#xD;
      by mouth for seven days every three weeks; 3) to determine if a patient's tumor gets smaller&#xD;
      after treatment with fenretinide oral powder plus ketoconazole or fenretinide oral powder&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;

             made in a manner adequate to ensure patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Ceftriaxone (Rocephin®) is NOT permitted for 24 hours prior to the start of the oral&#xD;
             fenretinide course, during the course, and for 24 hours after the completion of seven&#xD;
             day fenretinide course due to concerns of possible adverse effects on the hepatic&#xD;
             clearance of fenretinide. Alternative antibiotics should be used. Other cephalosporins&#xD;
             are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acetaminophen (Tylenol®) is NOT permitted for 24 hours prior the start of the oral&#xD;
             fenretinide course, during the course, and for 48 hours following the completion of&#xD;
             the seven day fenretinide course due to concerns of possible hepatic interactions.&#xD;
             Ibuprofen (Motrin®) should be used for antipyretic control during this time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Palliative radiation is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should NOT receive supplemental Vitamin A, C, or E except as contained in&#xD;
             routine total parenteral nutrition vitamin supplements, or in a single daily standard&#xD;
             dose oral multivitamin supplement, because of possible interference with antitumor&#xD;
             4-HPR-induced, reactive oxygen species and/or ceramide, and due to the unknown effects&#xD;
             of these drugs on retinol levels&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must NOT take any drugs suspected of causing pseudotumor cerebri, which&#xD;
             include tetracycline, nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, phenytoin, sulfonamides (Dapsone&#xD;
             permitted), lithium, amiodarone, or vitamin A (except as part of routine TPN&#xD;
             supplements or as part of a single daily standard dose oral multivitamin supplement).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant use of herbal supplements or other alternative therapy medications IS&#xD;
             CONTRAINDICATED due to potential adverse metabolic interactions of such supplements&#xD;
             with fenretinide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should NOT concurrently take medications that may potentially act as&#xD;
             modulators of intracellular ceramide levels or ceramide cytotoxicity, sphingolipid&#xD;
             transport, or p-glycoprotein (MDR1) or MRP1 drug/lipid transporters, such as:&#xD;
             cyclosporine A or analogue; verapamil; tamoxifen or analogue; chlorpromazine; RU486;&#xD;
             indomethacin; or sulfinpyrazone. Patients should NOT concurrently take medications&#xD;
             that are known P450 inhibitors. Contact Study Chair if there are questions regarding&#xD;
             the suitability of any medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As corticosteroids may impact sphingolipid metabolism, systemic corticosteroids should&#xD;
             NOT be used for emesis control during the course of the study. Systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroids for asthma control are permissible but should be minimized. Inhaled&#xD;
             corticosteroids for asthma control are allowed. Steroids for routine metabolic&#xD;
             deficiency states are allowed. Steroids for CNS lesions are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because gastric acidity is necessary for the maximal dissolution and absorption of&#xD;
             ketoconazole, when actively taking ketoconazole, patients should avoid/minimize&#xD;
             concurrent medications that decrease gastric acid output (such as ranitidine) or&#xD;
             increase gastric pH (such as Tums).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant medication that may prolong cardiac QT interval, especially those with&#xD;
             known interaction with ketoconazole (See Appendices IV, V and VI). A LIST OF THESE&#xD;
             MEDICATIONS SHOULD BE PROVIDED TO THE PATIENT AND FAMILY - PLEASE SEE APPENDICES IV, V&#xD;
             and VI FOR A LIST OF MEDICATIONS THAT SHOULD NOT BE USED WITH CONCURRENT KETOCONAZOLE&#xD;
             OR THAT SHOULD BE USED WITH CAUTION. Please SEE APPENDIX IV for a partial list of&#xD;
             medications potentially prolonging QT interval. Patients may NOT receive therapy with&#xD;
             the medications listed as PROHIBITED in Appendix IV and V. Medications in Appendix VI&#xD;
             may be used with cautions as noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Regulatory:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed consent&#xD;
             (or assent.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All institutional, FDA, and NCI requirements for human studies must be met.&#xD;
