  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combined diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart failure (HF)&#xD;
      is common but often missed because of similarities in clinical presentation, risk factors,&#xD;
      and patient characteristics. The concurrent presence of both diseases worsens the limitations&#xD;
      in exercise capacity and quality of life that patients experience with either disease alone.&#xD;
      This pilot study will test the feasibility of a yoga program conducted in patients' homes&#xD;
      using multi-point interactive videoconferencing (&quot;Tele- Yoga&quot;) for patients with combined&#xD;
      COPD/HF diagnoses. The investigators hypothesize that patients who receive a yoga program at&#xD;
      home, compared to an educational control group, will experience fewer physical symptoms and&#xD;
      better quality of life.&#xD;

    <description>To evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, adherence rate of an 8-week, 1-hr biweekly Tele-Yoga intervention. Feasibility will be determined by the quality of the broadband connection, acceptability measured by participant satisfaction with the Yoga program and adherence measured by the number of times a participant participates in the yoga program.</description>
