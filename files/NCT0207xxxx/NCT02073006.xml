  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Constipation is common in the general population, especially in women and in the elderly.&#xD;
      Hard stool is a complaint often associated with constipation, which suggests that stool&#xD;
      softening would provide a major benefit in the strategy of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigative fibre product is primarily a soluble dietary fibre with added probiotics&#xD;
      and a prebiotic. It is not digested in the small intestine and partly remains undigested by&#xD;
      bacteria in the gut. Also, as probiotics are believed to help restore a healthy gut flora,&#xD;
      reduce pH, assist with digestion of food and reduce gaseous by-products they may aid the&#xD;
      improvement of intestinal motility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to assess if this investigative, fibre product effects the&#xD;
      number of bowel movements per week and if this in turn impacts quality of life and symptoms&#xD;
      of constipation.&#xD;

      Constipation is a common condition. Perception of a healthy bowel movement varies widely&#xD;
      within and among populations but the Rome III Criteria is a standardised tool that diagnoses&#xD;
      functional constipation on the basis of the following symptoms for the last 3 months with&#xD;
      symptom onset at least 6 months prior to diagnosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Must include two or more of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Straining during at least 25% of defecations&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Lumpy or hard stools in at least 25% of defecations&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sensation of incomplete evacuation for at least 25% of defecations&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sensation of anorectal obstruction/blockage for at least 25% of defecations&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Manual manoeuvres to facilitate at least 25% of defecations (e.g., digital&#xD;
                evacuation, support of the pelvic floor)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fewer than three defecations per week&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Loose stools are rarely present without the use of laxatives&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Insufficient criteria for irritable bowel syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional to being extremely uncomfortable, untreated constipation can lead to faecal&#xD;
      impaction (with resulting faecal incontinence), particularly in elderly and confused people&#xD;
      and is believed to be a risk factor for haemorrhoids (piles) and diverticular disease.&#xD;
      However even without a medical diagnosis the undesired symptoms can reduce perceived quality&#xD;
      of life and successful management may involve a number of factors. Standard treatment&#xD;
      consists of disimpaction and the administration of laxatives to achieve a normal bowel habit&#xD;
      of passing a soft stool without pain. The daily use of laxatives long term is often advised&#xD;
      against as it can make your body dependent on them, causing your bowel to no longer function&#xD;
      normally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool softening is a physician's first step in the management of chronic constipation.&#xD;
      Psyllium has been shown to soften stools by increasing stool water content, far more than&#xD;
      most common dietary fibres. It forms a soft gel which eases the stool along the lower&#xD;
      digestive tract ready for evacuation. This bulkier faeces presses on the wall of the&#xD;
      intestine, stimulating the muscles to contract and force the contents forward, a process&#xD;
      known as 'peristalsis'. If there is insufficient fibre in the diet, the faeces will move more&#xD;
      slowly and there will be more time for water to be absorbed from the ingested food into the&#xD;
      rest of the body, leaving the faeces smaller and harder, which in turn is more difficult to&#xD;
      move. Psyllium has the advantage of being much gentler than some common fibres (such as wheat&#xD;
      bran) that can be irritating to a sensitive bowel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies using psyllium in a range of doses of 7g up to 24g a day show positive results in&#xD;
      relation to increasing stool frequency and weight, and improving stool consistency, in turn&#xD;
      improving associated abdominal pain and discomfort. These results were applicable in both&#xD;
      adults and the elderly. Although psyllium works in a much more gentle natural way, in some&#xD;
      studies it was seen to be superior to or comparative to commonly used laxatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probiotics had the added advantage of improving stool frequency and consistency and&#xD;
      accompanying abdominal pain, most likely by their positive effects on the gut microflora&#xD;
      often seen to be imbalanced in those with constipation. These effects were seen in infants,&#xD;
      adults and the elderly with no adverse events such inducing loose stools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, inulin in a range of doses of 1.5g up to 50g a day was seen to improve not only&#xD;
      beneficial bacteria counts but also bowel transit in infants, adults and the elderly and in&#xD;
      one study was again seen to be more effective than a common laxative but without the side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to increase the body of scientific data on psyllium by way of a randomised,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study.&#xD;
