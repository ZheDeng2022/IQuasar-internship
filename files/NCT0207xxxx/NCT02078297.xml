  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to study some mechanisms involved in the dysregulation of the&#xD;
      immune system observed in the skin of subjects with psoriasis. This will be done by analyzing&#xD;
      specific immune cells as well as gene and protein expression in small skin samples (biopsies)&#xD;
      from patients with psoriasis. These results will be compared to the skin of healthy subjects&#xD;
      without psoriasis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 80 subjects with psoriasis not currently using systemic treatment, with at least&#xD;
      one psoriatic plaque on the trunk or proximal limbs and having also more resistant to treat&#xD;
      psoriasis areas will be recruited. These subjects will be classified in the following 5&#xD;
      groups according to the localization of resistant areas: scalp psoriasis (20 subjects),&#xD;
      pustular palmo-plantar psoriasis (10 subjects), non-pustular palmo-plantar psoriasis (10&#xD;
      subjects), elbow psoriasis (20 subjects) and lower leg psoriasis (20 subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Day 0 visit, severity of psoriasis will be evaluated using the body surface area (BSA) and&#xD;
      the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After appropriate washout periods, all 80 subjects will have two skin biopsies: one from a&#xD;
      plaque located on the trunk or proximal limbs and one on a plaque located on an area more&#xD;
      resistant to treatment (scalp, palms/soles, elbow or lower leg). Each biopsy will be split in&#xD;
      half. One part will be used for a limited immunohistochemistry panel and additional staining&#xD;
      will be performed on samples from the pustular palmo-plantar psoriasis and non-pustular&#xD;
      palmo-plantar psoriasis subjects to localize IL-17A and IL-23 producing cells. The other half&#xD;
      will be used for gene expression analysis using Reverse-Transcription-Polymerase Chain&#xD;
      Reaction (RT-PCR) for all subjects including the following genes: IL-23 (p40 &amp; p19), IL-17A&#xD;
      and Human Acidic Ribosomal Protein (HARP). In addition, the expression of other specific&#xD;
      genes of interest will be analyzed using RT-PCR for subjects with pustular palmo-plantar&#xD;
      psoriasis and non-pustular palmo-plantar psoriasis. Moreover, four skin biopsies will be&#xD;
      collected from 10 healthy volunteers for RT-PCR (IL-23 (p40 &amp; p19), IL-17A and HARP). One&#xD;
      biopsy will be collected from the trunk and another one from a palm or a sole. A third and a&#xD;
      fourth biopsy will be collected on additional areas (scalp, elbow or lower limb). Gene&#xD;
      expression in plaques from areas more resistant to treatment (scalp, palms, elbows, lower&#xD;
      legs) will be compared to gene expression in plaques from the trunk or other areas of the&#xD;
      upper and lower limbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 30 subjects out of 80 will also have one or two additional skin biopsies. The 10&#xD;
      subjects with pustular palmo-plantar psoriasis and 10 subjects with non-pustular&#xD;
      palmo-plantar psoriasis will have one additional biopsy of the involved skin of the palm and&#xD;
      one of a plaque on the trunk or limbs for cell isolation and cell analysis in order to&#xD;
      explore the mechanisms involved in the increased expression of IL-17A without concurrent&#xD;
      increase in IL-23. Ten subjects with psoriasis vulgaris on the trunk or upper limbs but&#xD;
      without pustular or non-pustular palmo-plantar psoriasis will also have an additional biopsy&#xD;
      performed on lesional skin. Following inflammatory cells extraction, flow cytometry combining&#xD;
      cell surface markers and intra-cytoplasmic staining will be used to study IL-17A and IL-23 in&#xD;
      T cells, granulocytes/mastocytes/macrophages and Ag-presenting cells. If enough cells are&#xD;
      harvested, three antibody panels will be analyzed in the following order using flow&#xD;
      cytometry: a T cell panel, a granulocytes / mastocytes / macrophages panel and an antigen&#xD;
      presenting cell (APC) panel. All panels with also be evaluated with an anti-CD45 (cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation) antibody and a viability test (Aqua live/dead). Results from flow cytometry&#xD;
      will be compared for biopsies from palms of subjects with pustular and non-pustular&#xD;
      palmo-plantar psoriasis, trunk or proximal limbs of subjects with pustular and non-pustular&#xD;
      palmo-plantar psoriasis and trunk or proximal limbs of subjects with psoriasis vulgaris.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All skin biopsies will be performed at Day 0 visit and an optional study visit (Day 10) will&#xD;
      be performed if suture removal from skin biopsies is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, circulating plasma levels of IL-17A will be measured for all subjects and&#xD;
      healthy volunteers in order to compare IL-17A levels in the 5 groups of subjects with&#xD;
      psoriasis and healthy subjects. Moreover, correlation between IL-17A levels and PASI will be&#xD;
      explored.&#xD;
