        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects have to be at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects have to be able to read, understand, and sign a statement of Informed&#xD;
             Consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects have to be willing and able to return for scheduled follow-up examinations&#xD;
             for up to 6 and 12 months respectively after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Corneal topography should be qualified&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  High contrast, manifest, best spectacle-corrected distance visual acuity correctable&#xD;
             binocular to at least 1.0 (Snellen 20/20 or 6/6) and monocular to at least 0.8&#xD;
             (Snellen 20/25 or 6/7.5). In case of a monocular surgery the eye which should not be&#xD;
             treated must have a best corrected distance visual acuity of at least 0.8 (Snellen&#xD;
             20/25 or 6/7.5).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mesopic pupil size measured with the Zywave II WaveFront Aberrometer must be &lt; 7.0 mm&#xD;
             and photopic pupil size measured with the Orbscan II/ IIz must be &gt; 2.9 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Myopic subjects require a sphere between -0.5 D up to -10.0 D and cylinder between&#xD;
             -0.5 D up to -4.0 D (not corneal astigmatism) and SE up to -12.0 D&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hyperopic subjects require a sphere between +0.5 D up to +4.0 D and cylinder between&#xD;
             +0.5 D up to +4.0 D (not corneal astigmatism) and SE up to +6.0 D.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects for whom the combination of their baseline corneal thickness and the planned&#xD;
             operative parameters for the LASIK procedure would result in less than 250 microns of&#xD;
             remaining posterior corneal thickness below the flap postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hyperopic eyes for which the baseline manifest subjective refraction exhibits a&#xD;
             difference of greater than ± 0.75 D in sphere power, or a difference of greater than ±&#xD;
             0.50 D in cylinder power, or a difference in cylinder axis of more than 15 degrees&#xD;
             compared to the baseline cycloplegic subjective refraction. For manifest cylinder of&#xD;
             less than ±0.75 D, the differ-ence in cylinder axis would not be taken into&#xD;
             consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with anterior segment pathology, including dry eye syndrome and cataracts,&#xD;
             which in the Investigator's opinion would interfere with best spectacle-corrected&#xD;
             visual acuity or a successful treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with evidence of retinal vascular disease. Subjects with any residual,&#xD;
             recurrent, or active ocular disease, or corneal abnormality that in the Investigator's&#xD;
             opinion would interfere with BSCVA or a successful treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with signs of keratoconus or Subjects with unstable central keratometry&#xD;
             readings with irregular mires.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who had previous intraocular or corneal surgery of any kind, including any&#xD;
             type of Excimer laser surgery for either refractive or therapeutic purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have a history of Herpes simplex or Herpes zoster keratitis or history of&#xD;
             glaucoma or glaucoma suspect, corneal edema, or increased IOP &gt; 22mmHg or risk for&#xD;
             angle closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects immunocompromised or carrying diagnosis of connective tissue disease,&#xD;
             clinically significant atopic disease, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and other acute&#xD;
             or chronic illnesses that will increase the risk to the subject or confound the&#xD;
             outcomes of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject taking systemic medications likely to affect wound healing such as&#xD;
             corticosteroids or antimetabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are known to be pregnant, lactating, or who plans to become pregnant over&#xD;
             the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with an ocular muscle disorder including a strabismus or nystagmus, or other&#xD;
             disorders affecting fixation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with cognitive impairments or other vulnerable persons.&#xD;
