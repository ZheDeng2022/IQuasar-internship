        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have symptom(s) of Peyronie's disease (pain, curvature or plaque)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Be judged to be in good health, based upon the results of a medical history, physical&#xD;
             examination, and laboratory profile&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Voluntarily sign and date an informed consent agreement approved by the Institutional&#xD;
             Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC). The subject must also sign an&#xD;
             authorization form to allow disclosure of his protected health information (PHI). The&#xD;
             PHI authorization form and informed consent form may be an integrated form or may be&#xD;
             separate forms depending on the institution&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Be able to read, complete and understand the informed consent and various rating&#xD;
             instruments in English&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Inability to understand study goals and risks&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Inability to understand the informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Inability to achieve erection with or without PDE5 inhibitor use adequate for&#xD;
             penetration if penile curvature is not a limiting factor&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Peyronie's disease symptoms greater than one year duration&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Chordee in the presence or absence of hypospadias Thrombosis of the dorsal penile&#xD;
             artery or vein Infiltration by a benign or malignant mass resulting in penile&#xD;
             curvature Infiltration by an infectious agent, such as lymphogranuloma venereum&#xD;
             Ventral curvature from any cause Presence of an active sexually transmitted disease&#xD;

             immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has previously undergone surgery for Peyronie's disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Fails to have an erection which in the opinion of the investigator is sufficient to&#xD;
             accurately measure the subject's penile deformity&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Has an isolated hourglass deformity of the penis (curvature caused by a plaque that is&#xD;
             noncontiguous with the hourglass deformity may be treated)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Has the plaque causing curvature of the penis located proximal to the base of the&#xD;
             penis&#xD;
&#xD;

             medical therapies at any time during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Has received alternative medical therapies for Peyronie's disease administered by the&#xD;
             oral (including, but not limited to, vitamin E [&gt;500 U], potassium aminobenzoate&#xD;
             [Potaba], tamoxifen, colchicine, pentoxifylline, over-the-counter erectile dysfunction&#xD;
             medications, or steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) or topical routes (including, but&#xD;
             not limited to, verapamil applied as a cream) within 3 months before the first dose of&#xD;
             study drug or plans to use any of these medical therapies at any time during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Has had extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) for the correction of Peyronie's&#xD;
             disease within the 6- month period before screening or plans to have ESWT at any time&#xD;
             during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Has used any mechanical type device for correction of Peyronie's disease within the&#xD;
             2-week period before screening or plans to use any these devices at any time during&#xD;
             the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Has used a mechanical device to induce a passive erection within the 2-week period&#xD;
             before screening or plans to use any of these devices at any time during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Has significant erectile dysfunction that has failed to respond to oral treatment with&#xD;
             phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Has uncontrolled hypertension, as determined by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Has a known recent history of stroke, bleeding, or other significant medical&#xD;
             condition, which in the investigator's opinion would make the subject unsuitable for&#xD;
             enrollment in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Is unwilling or unable to cooperate with the requirements of the study including&#xD;
             completion of all scheduled study visits&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Has received an investigational drug or treatment within 30 days before the first dose&#xD;
             of study drug&#xD;
