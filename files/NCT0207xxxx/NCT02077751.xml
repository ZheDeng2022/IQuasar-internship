      Objective: To gather safety and efficacy BioRBC data from adult subjects who previously&#xD;
      developed transient BioRBC antibody responses by redosing them and observing for adverse&#xD;
      clinical or laboratory (i.e., a positive BioRBC antibody titer) outcomes to determine if RBC&#xD;
      kinetic study results differ from the previous study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: BioRBC survival studies performed in adult subjects who previously developed a&#xD;
      transient BioRBC antibody response will: 1) be associated with no adverse clinical or&#xD;
      laboratory events; 2) experience a second transient, BioRBC antibody response; and 3) display&#xD;
      a pattern of RBC survival that is identical to their prior dosing with BioRBCs at the same&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;

      Summary. Subjects eligible for study include adult study subjects older than 18 years who had&#xD;
      a positive antibody response to BioRBCs in previous BioRBC studies at the University of Iowa,&#xD;
      Adult BioRBC Redosing Safety Protocol Page 3 of 6 but who are now BioRBC antibody&#xD;
      sero-negative. The study will begin after IRB approval. The information summaries and IRB&#xD;
      consent forms used in prior studies did not include a statement indicating that subjects&#xD;
      would not be re-contacted for future research. Written informed consent will be obtained&#xD;
      prior to study. The total number of subjects available for study is 4, i.e., all subjects who&#xD;
      we previously identified as having formed antibodies to BioRBC following autologous BioRBC&#xD;
      transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Removal of subjects. Subjects will be free to withdraw from the study at their discretion.&#xD;
      The investigators will also be free to withdraw study subjects from the study for reasons of&#xD;
      non-compliance, inability to conduct the required study assessments or if the Investigators&#xD;
      determined it was in the best interest of the subject. The reasons for subject withdrawal&#xD;
      will be documented. The Investigators will attempt to collect safety data on withdrawn&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design. This is an open Phase 1 study in which the only 4 subjects we identified as&#xD;
      having developed antibodies to BioRBCs - and who are now negative for these antibodies - will&#xD;
      be re-dosed with BioRBCs. This will be conducted at a single study site at the University of&#xD;
      Iowa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As illustrated in the protocol diagram figure below, following screening and enrolment, each&#xD;
      subject will donate 100 mL of whole blood collected in CPD preservative from which RBC&#xD;
      concentrates will be prepared according to the standard methodology and procedures included&#xD;
      in our original 2006 FDA IND application with only minor modification of study sample times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims. Using a dose of biotin labeled autologous RBCs that is ~30% of our previous&#xD;
      dose we will determine during a 20 wk post-transfusion study period whether study subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Develop a second BioRBC antibody response that is greater than, less than, or equal to&#xD;
           each subject's previous response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Experience a fall in Hb/Hct, rise in reticulocyte count, and/or a decrease in RBC&#xD;
           survival following the appearance of BioRBC antibodies;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Experience clinical signs or symptoms following the appearance of BioRBC antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Have detectable BioRBC enrichment throughout the entire study period (as was possible&#xD;
           previously with a larger BioRBC dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose and duration. A single dose of BioRBCs that will include the same densities of biotin&#xD;
      labeled RBCs as studied previously in survival studies. On the first day of study, a fresh&#xD;
      ~100 mL aliquot of autologous RBC will be collected and labeled with biotin at densities 6,&#xD;
      18, 54 and 128 μg/mL RBC. Immediately after preparing the four populations of BioRBC&#xD;
      densities, the four densities will be combined, mixed, and a gravimetrically determined&#xD;
      weight of the blood infused intravenously. An aliquot of the infusate will be saved and&#xD;
      analyzed to determine the dose of each density administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All labeling will be conducted using approved sterile instruments and materials in a&#xD;
      certified laminar flow containment hood to minimize the potential for bacterial&#xD;
      contamination. Two aliquots of the BioRBC infusate will be saved: 1) one for endotoxin&#xD;
      testing should the subject Adult BioRBC Redosing Safety Protocol Page 5 of 6 develop a&#xD;
      transfusion reaction (we have not encountered this in the ~35 adult subjects we have studied&#xD;
      to date); and 2) the other for aerobic bacteria cultured for any potential contamination&#xD;
      during the labeling process. Although the culture results will not be available prior to the&#xD;
      infusion, they will be available in the event the subject develops symptoms of bacterial&#xD;
      infection, e.g., fever.&#xD;
