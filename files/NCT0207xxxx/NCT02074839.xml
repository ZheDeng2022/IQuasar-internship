  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase I, multicenter study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics and clinical activity of AG-120 in advanced hematologic malignancies that&#xD;
      harbor an IDH1 mutation. The first portion of the study is a dose escalation phase where&#xD;
      cohorts of patients will receive ascending oral doses of AG-120 to determine maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended Phase II dose. The second portion of the study is&#xD;
      a dose expansion phase where four cohorts of patients will receive AG-120 to further evaluate&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of the recommended Phase II dose.&#xD;
      Additionally, the study includes a substudy evaluating the safety and tolerability, clinical&#xD;
      activity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of AG-120 in subjects with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory myelodysplastic syndrome with an IDH1 mutation. Anticipated time on study&#xD;
      treatment is until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Qualified scientific and medical researchers can request access to anonymized patient-level and study-level clinical trial data.&#xD;
Access can be requested for all interventional clinical studies:&#xD;
used for Marketing Authorization (MA) of medicines and new indications approved after 1 January 2014 in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the United States (US).&#xD;
where Servier is the Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH). The date of the first MA of the new medicine (or the new indication) in one of the EEA Member States will be considered for this scope.&#xD;
In addition, access can be requested for all interventional clinical studies in patients:&#xD;
sponsored by Servier&#xD;
with a first patient enrolled as of 1 January 2004 onwards&#xD;
for New Chemical Entity or New Biological Entity (new pharmaceutical form excluded) for which development has been terminated before any Marketing authorization (MA) approval.</ipd_description>
