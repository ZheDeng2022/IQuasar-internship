  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to support the substantial equivalence of the SS-1000 to the predicate device&#xD;
      Pentacam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective -The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the precision of the&#xD;
      SS-1000 and Pentacam in measuring the anterior segment parameters in an eye, including&#xD;
      Corneal Curvature, Corneal Thickness, Anterior Chamber Depth and Cornea Volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the repeatability (intra-instrument) of SS-1000 and Pentacam in measuring&#xD;
           the anterior segment parameters in an eye&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the reproducibility (inter-instrument) of SS-1000 and Pentacam in&#xD;
           measuring the anterior segment parameters in an eye&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the agreement between SS-1000 and Pentacam in measuring the anterior&#xD;
           segment parameters in an eye&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The trial design is a prospective precision trial with the following factors: The trial will&#xD;
      be conducted at one investigational site. The site will have three SS-1000 devices and three&#xD;
      Pentacam devices available. Three certified operators (#1, #2 and #3) will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one set of devices (one SS-1000 and one Pentacam), such that operator effect are&#xD;
      confounded with instrument effect. All participants will have one visit and undergo the same&#xD;
      set of assessments. Each assessment will consist of 2 consecutive readings (M1, M2).&#xD;

      1. Nonsignificant Risk (NSR) Devices&#xD;
&#xD;
           The two devices SS-1000 and Pentacam are considered non-significant risk devices and the&#xD;
           conduct of the trial will adhere to the abbreviated requirements of Investigational&#xD;
           Device Exemption (21CFR812.2, 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Overall Trial Design&#xD;
&#xD;
           The trial design is a prospective precision trial with the following factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The trial will be conducted at one investigational site. The site will have three&#xD;
           SS-1000 devices and three Pentacam devices available. Three certified operators (#1, #2&#xD;
           and #3) will be randomly assigned to one set of devices (one SS-1000 and one Pentacam),&#xD;
           such that operator effect are confounded with instrument effect. All participants will&#xD;
           have one visit and undergo the same set of assessments. Each assessment will consist of&#xD;
           2 consecutive readings (M1, M2).&#xD;
&#xD;
           To ensure the highest physiological stability of the eyes all measurements will be done&#xD;
           at least 3 hours after subject awake (Lattimore MR, 1999). To decrease the diurnal&#xD;
           variation each subject will have, all measurements excluding screening measurements are&#xD;
           performed within a 2 hour window. All measurements are performed in constant dim&#xD;
           lighting conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subject will be advised to keep eyes closed between scans to prevent eye dryness. If&#xD;
           subject experience eye dryness subject will be allowed extra time to recover between&#xD;
           measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1 Trial eye&#xD;
&#xD;
           If subject has one eligible eye with pathology, that eye will be selected as the trial&#xD;
           eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If subject has two eligible eyes, with or without pathology, the trial eye will be&#xD;
           randomly selected by tossing a coin (Head=right eye, Tail=left eye).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The same eye will be used for all measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2 Order of examination&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomization schedule will be generated using a computer and will be used to determine&#xD;
           the order of the devices (SS-1000 vs. Pentacam) and the order of the&#xD;
           instruments/operators (instrument set #1, instrument set #2 or instrument set #3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Masking&#xD;
&#xD;
           The corneal condition (thin, normal and thick) will not be available to the operators&#xD;
           while obtaining data for determination of repeatability and reproducibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Discussion of Design&#xD;
&#xD;
           The trial design serves the purpose to evaluate the agreement and precision (total&#xD;
           precision / repeatability / reproducibility) performance characteristics for SS-1000 and&#xD;
           Pentacam. The precision results will be used for the evaluation of substantial&#xD;
           equivalence between SS-1000 and Pentacam.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This trial is designed to use the same cohort of subjects to minimize between subject&#xD;
           variability. Each subject undergoes examination by 3 operators with 3 instruments each&#xD;
           and 2 replicates in each condition. This design will provide a head-to head comparison&#xD;
           in total precision, agreement, repeatability and reproducibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The between-operators will be confounded but all assessments in the trial are objective&#xD;
           and automatically assessed by both investigational devices. Hence, potential biases&#xD;
           should be at a minimum in terms of interpretation of trial results. Potential biases may&#xD;
           occur due to the fatigue of subjects and/or the operators. Thus, to minimize biases the&#xD;
           order of the devices will be randomly assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To avoid other confounding factors (e.g. visit) subjects will have all assessments done&#xD;
           at one visit, each subject undergoes 12 measurements. The duration of the tests are&#xD;
           estimated to last at least 1 hour which we considered as the upper limit for a subject&#xD;
           before fatigue and eye irritation due to dryness. Once a subject starts to experience&#xD;
           dryness in the eyes, subject will not be able to fixate and keep the eye open without&#xD;
           blinking while the measurement takes place. To prevent eye dryness subject should have&#xD;
           his eyes closed between measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All devices are evaluated using the same set of subjects and allows for direct&#xD;
           comparison of the investigational device and the predicate device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Trial Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 66 eyes from 66 subjects meeting all of the following inclusion criteria and none&#xD;
      of the exclusion criteria will be recruited:&#xD;

&#xD;
                When both eyes of a subject are eligible, one eye will be randomly selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
                To ensure recruitment of eyes with a range of corneal thicknesses, inclusion&#xD;
                criterion no. 5 will be controlled:&#xD;
&#xD;

                     6.3 Subject identification&#xD;
&#xD;
                     All subjects enrolled must be identifiable throughout the trial. This will be&#xD;
                     done by using a 3-digit subject number starting at 001 allocated to the&#xD;
                     subject when enrollment is determine by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     6.4 Subject Withdrawal&#xD;

                     The subject will be advised in the informed consent form that he/she has the&#xD;
                     right to withdraw from the trial at any time without reason. The subject may&#xD;
                     also be withdrawn from the trial at the investigator's or Tomey's discretion&#xD;
                     at any time. In case a subject drops out of the trial or is withdrawn from the&#xD;
                     trial, the withdrawal page in the case report form (CRF) should be completed.&#xD;
                     On the withdrawal page the investigator should record the date of the&#xD;
                     withdrawal, the person initiating the withdrawal and the primary reason for&#xD;
                     withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
