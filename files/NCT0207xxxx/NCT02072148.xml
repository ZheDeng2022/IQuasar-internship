  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In general, patients with Human Papilloma Virus Positive Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell&#xD;
      Carcinoma (HPVOPC) are curable, young and will live for prolonged periods. They are at high&#xD;
      risk for long-term toxicity and mortality from therapy. While the long-term consequences of&#xD;
      chemotherapy and surgery for head and neck cancer are relatively constrained, high-dose&#xD;
      radiotherapy (RT) and chemoradiotherapy (CRT) substantially impact on local tissues and organ&#xD;
      function and result in a significant rate of late mortality and morbidity in patients.&#xD;
      Studies are now being designed to reduce the impact of RT and CRT for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with intermediate stage HPV positive oropharyngeal cancer will be screened for poor&#xD;
      prognostic features and undergo robotic surgery. Patients in whom pathology demonstrates good&#xD;
      prognosis features will then be followed without postoperative radiotherapy. Patients with&#xD;
      subsequent recurrence will be treated with either surgery and postoperative radiotherapy or&#xD;
      postoperative chemoradiotherapy alone. Patients with poor prognostic features (ECS, LVI, PNI)&#xD;
      will receive reduced dose radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy based on pathology. It is&#xD;
      expected that over 50% of patients treated with surgery will have had a curative treatment&#xD;
      and will avoid radiation therapy entirely and long-term survival will not be changed by&#xD;
      withholding radiation therapy to good prognosis patients after surgery. There are exploratory&#xD;
      biomarkers of risk of recurrence that will be collected and studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently few trials examining the role of de-escalation using surgery alone in&#xD;
      intermediate and early T-stage HPV related disease. New surgical techniques have broadened&#xD;
      the range of patients capable of achieving a complete resection and the functional outcomes&#xD;
      in such patients are outstanding. Furthermore, the sensitivity of HPVOPC to chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiotherapy raise the possibility that delayed or salvage treatment in early stage patients&#xD;
      would be highly effective, would result in similar survival outcomes and radiotherapy could&#xD;
      be applied to a much smaller population then current standards call for. Looked at from a&#xD;
      different perspective, the need for post-operative radiotherapy in this younger, HPV+ and&#xD;
      more functional population has not been validated in clinical trials to date.&#xD;

The M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory-Head and Neck (MDASI-HN) module is a validated instrument that provides a brief measure of the symptom distress experienced by the head and neck cancer patients as a result of their disease and/or treatment. This symptom burden instrument was closely associated with the severity of radiation-induced mucositis.&#xD;
The MDA Xerostomia and Dysphagia questionnaires are radiotherapy/head and neck cancer directed questions which have a robust, validated assessment the specific concerns of swallowing and salivary function in head and neck cancer treated patients.</description>
