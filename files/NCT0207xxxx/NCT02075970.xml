    <textblock>
      Neonatal anemia is the most commonly encountered hematologic problem among all neonates cared&#xD;
      for in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). This project seeks to better understand the&#xD;
      pathophysiology and treatment of this challenging and important condition, especially as it&#xD;
      affects premature, critically ill very low birth weight (VLBW) infants who require intensive&#xD;
      laboratory blood monitoring leading to the need for multiple red blood cell (RBC)&#xD;
      transfusions (RBCTX). In the research strategy proposed in Study 1, Aims 1, 2 and 3,&#xD;
      recombinant human erythropoietin (Epoetin Alpha, PROCRIT, provided by Janssen Scientific&#xD;
      Affairs) will first be administered to 1.0 to 1.5 kg VLBW infants; then comprehensive&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) data will be systematically gathered and&#xD;
      analyzed to identify clinical and laboratory covariate parameters differentiating the infants&#xD;
      based on their level of Epoetin Alpha responsiveness. Finally the Epoetin Alpha&#xD;
      responsiveness predictors thus determined will be applied prospectively in the Aim 4 Study, a&#xD;
      2 x 2 design in which VLBW infants will be identified as good or poor Epoetin Alpha&#xD;
      responders, based on the predictors, and then randomly assigned to receive Epoetin Alpha&#xD;
      treatment or no treatment. This will test the central hypothesis: RBCTX can be eliminated in&#xD;
      the majority of good Epoetin Alpha responders by optimal administration of Epoetin Alpha, but&#xD;
      only marginal reductions in RBCTx will occur in the poor Epoetin Alpha responders. This&#xD;
      project challenges the prevailing thinking that the efficacy of Epoetin Alpha dosing in&#xD;
      stimulating erythropoiesis is insufficient to eliminate the need for RBC transfusions in VLBW&#xD;
      infants. Based on extensive preclinical and clinical PK/PD studies by our PPG team, we&#xD;
      contend that previous Erythropoietin treatment studies in VLBW infants were not able to&#xD;
      realize the full potential of Erythropoietin to eliminate RBCTX (in contrast to the very&#xD;
      successful use of Erythropoietin in adult renal failure patients) because previous VLBW&#xD;
      studies were conducted 1) without Epoetin Alpha dosing individualized for the complexities of&#xD;
      neonatal erythropoiesis and PK/PD of Epoetin Alpha and 2) without consistent criteria for RBC&#xD;
      transfusion, Epoetin Alpha dosing, and patient enrollment. Net Epoetin Alpha responsiveness&#xD;
      as reflected in Hb level depends on two components: Epoetin Alpha PD and RBC lifespan (Fig&#xD;
      15). By determining RBC lifespan, we will explain inter-subject variability of Epoetin Alpha&#xD;
      responsiveness resulting from one of these components. The fetal lifespan data will be&#xD;
      examined for its correlation with gestational age. If the correlation is statistically&#xD;
      significant, gestational age will be included in the final selection of covariates for the&#xD;
      population PK/PD model to be developed at the end of Infant Study 1. To fully understand the&#xD;
      correlation of RBC lifespan with gestational age infants ranging from 22-42 weeks gestational&#xD;
      age will be studied. The overall impact of Project 1 will be significant and potentially&#xD;
      transformative: the development of a personalized, mechanism-driven approach built on sound&#xD;
      principles will improve understanding of neonatal anemia and will be applicable to the care&#xD;
      of premature, anemic infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RELEVANCE Project 1 results confirming our hypothesis that PK/PD optimized Epo treatment is&#xD;
      effective in eliminating RBC transfusions administered to a select sub-group of NICU infants&#xD;
      will provide fundamental knowledge about neonatal anemia that will reduce the burden of&#xD;
      illness and disability caused by this condition. In addition, our results will stimulate&#xD;
      researchers to extend our findings to other sub-groups with neonatal anemia, ie, smaller and&#xD;
      sicker infants, and will stimulate novel treatments with similar, new biotechnology-produced&#xD;
      protein drugs.&#xD;

      SPECIFIC AIMS Erythropoietin (Epo) stimulates red blood cell (RBC) production. Erythropoietin&#xD;
      treatment of anemic, very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants has not been as effective&#xD;
      as originally anticipated in eliminating multiple RBC transfusions (RBCTX). This conclusion&#xD;
      is based on Epoetin Alpha dosing studies employing inconsistent RBCTX criteria, and study&#xD;
      designs that did not fully consider Epoetin Alpha's complex pharmacokinetics (PK) and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PD). The hypothesis of this project challenges the conclusion that Epoetin&#xD;
      Alpha therapy cannot reduce RBCTX in VLBW infants to a clinically important extent. This&#xD;
      challenge is based on our novel comprehensive determinations of the PD of endogenous Epo in&#xD;
      VLBW infants, and on our recent computer Epo simulation modeling results predicting that&#xD;
      RBCTX can be eliminated in a select group of VLBW infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective To develop a pharmacodynamically-based, individualized medicine approach&#xD;
      capable of completely eliminating RBCTX in an identifiable group of VLBW infants by optimally&#xD;
      administering Epoetin Alpha.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central Hypotheses Infants with good Epoetin Alpha responsiveness can be identified by a&#xD;
      mechanism-driven, individualized prediction model. Optimized Epoetin Alpha treatment of the&#xD;
      predicted good responders that is based on sound, evidence based PK/PD principles will&#xD;
      eliminate the need for RBCTX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epoetin Alpha responsiveness is determined by two key components: 1) RBC production, which&#xD;
      depends on Epoetin Alpha PD. 2) RBC lifespan. Individualized covariate-based (ie, patient&#xD;
      specific characteristics) prediction of these two components is critical for the development&#xD;
      of an individualized prediction model of Epoetin Alpha responsiveness that will be used for&#xD;
      testing the Central Hypothesis. These important predictors of Epoetin Alpha responsiveness&#xD;
      will be investigated in the following Specific Aims (SA) and Hypotheses (HY):&#xD;
&#xD;
      INFANT STUDY 1 (Years 1-3) performed in VLBW infants with birth weights from 1.0 to 1.5 kg SA&#xD;
      1 Determine clinical and laboratory covariates (ie, patient-specific characteristics)&#xD;
      controlling the large inter-subject variability in Epoetin Alpha's PD using data from Epoetin&#xD;
      Alpha dosing of VLBW infants HY 1 The inter-subject variability in Epoetin Alpha's PD is&#xD;
      predictable by several covariates that are identifiable by our PK/PD modeling approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA 2 Determine the lifespan of fetal RBC in the gestational age spectrum of the study&#xD;
      infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HY 2 There exists a significant inter-subject variability in the lifespan of fetal RBCs in&#xD;
      VLBW infants that is predictable based on gestational age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA 3 Derive an individualized, optimal Epoetin Alpha dosing algorithm and an individualized&#xD;
      prediction model for the Epoetin Alpha responsiveness in VLBW infants from the results in&#xD;
      Specific Aims 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HY 3 Crossvalidation-type computer simulations based on individualized and optimized Epoetin&#xD;
      Alpha dosing in a subgroup of VLBW infants with good Epoetin Alpha responsiveness, identified&#xD;
      by the prediction model, will indicate that RBCTX can be avoided in a select group of VLBW&#xD;
      infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INFANT STUDY 2 (Years 3-4, to be addressed as a modification after completion of study 1)&#xD;
      also performed in VLBW infant with birth weights from 1.0 to 1.5 kg SA 4 Apply the optimal&#xD;
      Epoetin Alpha dosing algorithm and Epoetin Alpha responsiveness prediction model developed in&#xD;
      Infant Study 1 to an Epoetin Alpha dosing study to test the Central Hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HY 4 The subgroup of VLBW infants with good Epoetin Alpha responsiveness will have a higher&#xD;
      proportion of infants that will not have any RBCTX compared to those with poor Epoetin Alpha&#xD;
      responsiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Outcomes SA 1 Among the covariates considered in Specific Aims 1 (e.g. clinical&#xD;
      neonatal/maternal factors, blood cell parameters, cytokines linked to erythropoiesis,&#xD;
      inflammation biomarkers, oxidative stress, iron status, and genetic factors), we will&#xD;
      identify several with statistically significant correlations to Epoetin Alpha's PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA2 The lifespan of fetal RBCs will show similar relationship to gestational age as that&#xD;
      which was observed by us in the ovine fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA3 The model will accurately predict individual Epoetin Alpha responsiveness to optimized&#xD;
      Epo dosing and will provide strong support for our hypothesis that RBCTX can be completely&#xD;
      eliminated in a select group of VLBW infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA4 Infant Study 2 will show that the select group of VLBW infants that are predicted to be&#xD;
      good Epoetin Alpha responders by the combined use of an individualized Epoetin Alpha&#xD;
      responsiveness prediction model and an optimal, individualized Epo dosing algorithm will have&#xD;
      a greater proportion of infants who do not require any RBCTX compared to those predicted to&#xD;
      have poor Epoetin Alpha responsiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A successful completion of the proposed research is potentially transformative and is likely&#xD;
      to be applied to the care of VLBW infants, resulting in a significant overall impact.&#xD;
      Moreover, a successful demonstration of the utility and power of these principles will lead&#xD;
      to improvements in the complex pharmacotherapy of VLBW infants, who are among the most&#xD;
      difficult to study of any patient group.&#xD;
