      Background: Statins are at the forefront of strategies to manage hypercholesterolemia.&#xD;
      However, 10-15% of patients result to be intolerant to any statins, even at low daily doses&#xD;
      and almost one- third of statin users discontinue therapy within one year. Some&#xD;
      nutraceuticals are prescribed as lipid- lowering substances, but doubts remain about their&#xD;
      efficacy and tolerability. In this study we investigated the effects of a nutraceutical&#xD;
      combination consisting mainly of red yeast rice extract 200 mg (equivalent to 3 mg&#xD;
      monacolins), berberine 500 mg and policosanols 10 mg (MBP-NC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In this single centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 60&#xD;
      consecutive outpatients (age range: 18-60 years), with newly diagnosed primary&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia not previously treated, after a run-in period of 3 weeks on a stable&#xD;
      hypolipidic diet, were randomized to receive a pill of MBP-NC (N=30) or placebo (N=30) once a&#xD;
      day after dinner, in addition to the hypolipidic diet. The efficacy and the tolerability of&#xD;
      the proposed nutraceutical treatment were fully assessed after 4, 12 and 24 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      Introduction Many epidemiological studies have shown that serum cholesterol levels are&#xD;
      strongly related to cardiovascular risk [1, 2]. Consequently lowering cholesterol levels is a&#xD;
      fundamental prognostic goal in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events.&#xD;
      The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzime A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, commonly known as&#xD;
      &quot;statins&quot; are at the forefront of strategies to manage hypercholesterolemia, especially in&#xD;
      patients at high or very high risk of cardiovascular diseases, in view of their established&#xD;
      efficacy in reducing cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in both primary and secondary&#xD;
      prevention [3, 4]. However, 10-15% of patients result to be intolerant to any statins, even&#xD;
      at low daily doses and almost one-third of statin users discontinue therapy within one year&#xD;
      from the beginning [4, 5]. Furthermore, the use of statins to reduce cardiovascular risk in&#xD;
      clinical practice is rarely encouraged for primary prevention and some other patients,&#xD;
      especially in primary prevention, refuse statins because of the fear of possible side&#xD;
      effects. Some nutraceutical products may represent an alternative treatment to be considered&#xD;
      for the above mentioned cases, above all in patients with marginally high&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia [4, 6]. Since the use of full- dose nutraceuticals entails some&#xD;
      tolerability concerns, a combination of nutraceuticals with different but synergic mechanisms&#xD;
      of action at lower and safer dosages could be preferable. In particular, in recent years&#xD;
      there has been a growing interest in a nutraceutical combination containing monakolin (the&#xD;
      biologically active component of red yeast rice), berberine and policosanols (MBP-NC). The&#xD;
      cholesterol lowering effect of MBP-NC consumed in conjunction with a standard Mediterranean&#xD;
      healthy diet has been observed in a large Italian study carried out by general practitioners&#xD;
      (GPs) [7], in patients intolerant to more than one statin [8], in patients with metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome or who are overweight [9, 10] and in elderly hypercholesterolemic subjects [11].&#xD;
      Moreover, MBP-NC mixture has been reported to have some direct protective vascular effects,&#xD;
      similar to pharmacological lipid lowering agents, such as improvement in endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction [12] and improvement in aortic stiffness [13]. Another recent study has reported&#xD;
      that a 2-month treatment with MBP-NC improved insulin sensitivity in patients with metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome [14].&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, hitherto the cholesterol lowering effect of MBP-NC has not been evaluated in long&#xD;
      term double-blind placebo controlled studies. The aim of this single centre, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of a 24&#xD;
      week treatment with MBP-NC mixture in low -moderate risk hypercholesterolemic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods Population A cohort of 66 consecutive outpatients with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      primary hypercholesterolemia not previously treated who applied to the Lipid Clinic of the&#xD;
      Department of Internal Medicine at the University of Siena (Italy), were considered for&#xD;
      enrolment in this study. The inclusion criteria were (1) age between 18 and 60 years , (2)&#xD;
      body mass index(BMI) between 18,5 ad 29,9 Kg/m2, (3) serum low-density lipoprotein&#xD;
      cholesterol (LDL-C) above 150 mg/dL and an estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk &lt; 20%&#xD;
      according to Framingham risk scoring. The exclusion criteria were (1) history of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease or coronary risk equivalents, (2) secondary hyperlipidemia caused by&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, renal, liver or thyroid diseases, (3)alcohol consumption of &gt; 40 g/day,&#xD;
      (4) estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk &gt; 20% according to Framingham risk scoring, (5)&#xD;
      muscular diseases or abnormally elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels or drug&#xD;
      treatment with anti-platelet, anti-inflammatory, hypolipidemic agents or hormone replacement&#xD;
      therapy, either on-going or any time in the previous 2 months. Instead, the patients on&#xD;
      stable anti-hypertensive treatment for at least 3 months were included. All the patients were&#xD;
      instructed to maintain their habitual physical activity during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the screening visit, all patients were instructed to follow a hypolipidic diet (low-&#xD;
      cholesterol/ low-saturated fat diet approximately consisting of 55% carbohydrates, 20%&#xD;
      proteins, and 25% lipids) during a run-in period of 3 weeks, after which all patients who met&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria, were randomized to receive a pill of MBP-NC (N=30 ) or placebo (N=30)&#xD;
      once a day after dinner, in addition to the hypolipidic diet. The placebo pills, identical in&#xD;
      taste and appearance to the MBP-NC pills, consisted of inactive compound. Randomisation and&#xD;
      blinding were provided by Rottapharm Madaus S.p.A (Monza, Italy). The composition of the&#xD;
      patented proprietary combination of nutraceuticals investigated was as follows: red yeast&#xD;
      rice extract 200 mg (equivalent to 3 mg monacolins), berberine 500 mg, policosanol 10 mg,&#xD;
      folic acid 0.2 mg, coenzyme Q10 2 mg and asthaxantin 0.5 mg (Armolipid Plus, Rottapharm&#xD;
      Madaus S.p.A, Italy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki, as&#xD;
      revised in 2000 and 2008, and the study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the&#xD;
      University Hospital of Siena. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and anthropometric evaluation All patients underwent physical examination at&#xD;
      baseline and after 4, 12, and 24 weeks of treatment. All the determinations were made at the&#xD;
      Lipid Clinic at 09.00 AM , after an overnight fast of 12 h. Height and weight were measured&#xD;
      to the nearest 0.1 cm and 0.1 Kg, respectively. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms&#xD;
      divided by height squared in meters. Brachial blood pressure was measured by a physician with&#xD;
      a mercury sphygmomanometer after patient had been seated for at least 10 min and the average&#xD;
      of 3 measurements was considered for the analysis. Waist circumference was also measured at&#xD;
      each visit midway between the lowest rib and the iliac crest using an anthropometric tape.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all patients, body composition [fat mass (FM) percentage, fat-free mass (FFM) and fat-free&#xD;
      mass/fat mass ratio (FFM/FM)] was assessed by anthropometry and bioelectrical impedance&#xD;
      analysis (BIA) using a single-frequency 50 kHz bioelectrical impedance analyzer (BIA 101 RJL,&#xD;
      Akern Bioresearch, Florence, Italy). All BIA measurements were carried out by the same&#xD;
      operator according to the standard tetrapolar technique, with patients in a supine position&#xD;
      for at least 20 min. The electrodes were placed on the dorsal surface of the right foot and&#xD;
      ankle and the right wrist and hand. Biochemical measurements In all patients fasting venous&#xD;
      blood samples were drawn at baseline and after 4, 12 and 24 weeks in order to assess serum&#xD;
      levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol&#xD;
      (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). All lipid parameters (TC, TG, HDL-C&#xD;
      and LDL-C) were measured using a colorimetric method (Autoanalyzer Menarini, Florence,&#xD;
      Italy). In order to monitor the safety of the MBP-NC in all patients, at the same time&#xD;
      points, serum levels of glucose, uric acid, CPKw, gammaglutamiltranferase (ɣGT) and&#xD;
      transaminases were also assessed. Tolerability was monitored by recording symptoms.&#xD;
      Medication compliance was assessed by counting the number of pills returned at the clinic&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
