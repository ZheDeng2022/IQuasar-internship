  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of carfilzomib when given&#xD;
      together with rituximab and combination chemotherapy and to see how well they work in&#xD;
      treating patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Carfilzomib may stop the growth of&#xD;
      cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies,&#xD;
      such as rituximab, can block cancer growth by finding cancer cells and helping kill them.&#xD;
      Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either&#xD;
      by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not known if carfilzomib in&#xD;
      combination with R-CHOP is better or worse than R-CHOP alone in treating patients with&#xD;
      diffuse large b-cell lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety of carfilzomib in combination with rituximab-cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
      doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) (CR-CHOP) in patients with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and identify a recommended phase II&#xD;
      dose (RP2D). (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if CR-CHOP improves the rates of 1-year progression free survival (PFS) and&#xD;
      overall survival (OS) in non-germinal center (non-GC) DLBCL patients relative to historical&#xD;
      controls treated with R-CHOP(Phase II) II. To determine response rates (complete and partial&#xD;
      remission) in non-GC DLBCL patients treated with CR-CHOP and compare to historical controls&#xD;
      treated with R-CHOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Because a proportion (~10%) of patients classified as non-GC by immunohistochemical&#xD;
      (IHC) algorithms may not have the activated B-cells (ABC) subtyped of DLBCL, an exploratory&#xD;
      secondary objective will compare the PFS, OS and response rates of the ABC subgroup of&#xD;
      patients with DLBCL as determined by the Gene Expression Profiling with those of the overall&#xD;
      group of non-GC DLBCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of carfilzomib followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) over at least 90 minutes, cyclophosphamide IV&#xD;
      over 30-60 minutes, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 3-5 minutes, vincristine sulfate IV&#xD;
      over 1 minute on day 1, and prednisone orally (PO) on days 1-5. Patients also receive&#xD;
      carfilzomib IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 2, 8 and 9. Courses repeat every 21 days for 6&#xD;
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and at 6, 12, and 24&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

             by echocardiogram or MUGA (Multi Gated Acquisition Scan)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of Carfilzomib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason&#xD;
             and because chemotherapeutic agents used in this study are known to be teratogenic,&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (double barrier method of birth control or abstinence) 2 weeks prior to initiation of&#xD;
             treatment, for the duration of study participation and for 3 months after completing&#xD;
             treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect that she is pregnant while she or&#xD;
             her partner is participating in this study, she should inform the treating physician&#xD;
             immediately. Men must agree to refrain from sperm donation for at least 90 days after&#xD;
             the last dose of carfilzomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written&#xD;
             informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  International Prognostic Index must be documented:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ECOG performance status ≥ 2 (1 point)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Age ≥ 60 (1 point)&#xD;

               -  ≥ 2 extranodal sites (1 point)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) &gt; upper limit of normal (1 point)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ann Arbor stage III or IV (1 point)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more&#xD;
             than 4 weeks earlier&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known CNS involvement by lymphoma. Patients at high risk for secondary CNS involvement&#xD;
             but without neurologic symptoms suspected to be due to lymphoma are allowed to be&#xD;
             enrolled and receive intrathecal chemotherapy including but not limited to&#xD;
             methotrexate, cytarabine and glucocorticoids. Patients who are enrolled and&#xD;
             subsequently identified to have pathologic confirmation of CNS involvement by lymphoma&#xD;
             may be continued on study at the discretion of the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to carfilzomib or other agents (R-CHOP) used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active congestive heart failure (New York heart Association Class III or IV),&#xD;
             symptomatic ischemia, or conduction abnormalities uncontrolled by conventional&#xD;
             intervention or myocardial infarction within four months prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing&#xD;
             or active infection, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because Carfilzomib is a&#xD;
             proteasome inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
             Because there is an unknown, but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with Carfilzomib, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with Carfilzomib. These potential risks may also&#xD;
             apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with Carfilzomib. In addition, these&#xD;
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow&#xD;
             suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving&#xD;
             combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other malignancies within the past 3 years except for adequately treated carcinoma of&#xD;
             the cervix or basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin, or low-risk prostate&#xD;
             cancer after curative therapy, or low risk melanoma if treated with definitive therapy&#xD;
             (such as excision) and expected to have a low likelihood of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had major surgical procedures or significant traumatic injury within&#xD;
             28 days prior to study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are reported to be of direct Asian-Pacific (China, Japan, Taiwan,&#xD;
             Singapore, Republic of Korea, and Thailand) ancestry.&#xD;
