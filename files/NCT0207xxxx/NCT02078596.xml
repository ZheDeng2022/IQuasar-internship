      Though the Disruptive Disorders of Childhood and Adolescence are a major source of morbidity&#xD;
      and fill a large proportion of special education slots, specific pharmacologic treatment is&#xD;
      available only for those children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. Other&#xD;
      disruptive children are usually said to &quot;have&quot; Oppositional Defiant or Conduct Disorder.&#xD;
      These diagnoses are useful descriptively but they do not have specific treatment implications&#xD;
      In the course of treating adolescents with explosive tempers and severe mood swings with&#xD;
      Depakote (divalproex sodium), the investigators learned that younger children manifest&#xD;
      symptoms that seemed identical to those constituting the adolescent disorder. They were in&#xD;
      special education programs and not responding to psychostimulants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators systematically collected data on these children using the same screening&#xD;
      criteria as in our studies of adolescents. Since Depakote has been used to treat seizures in&#xD;
      children for more than twenty years, a great deal was known about its safety profile in the&#xD;
      pediatric population. The investigators treated 7 children, age 7-12, whose recurrent temper&#xD;
      outbursts and chronic mood lability did not respond to individual/family therapy. After&#xD;
      parents signed informed consent and children gave assent, these subjects would receive open&#xD;
      label Depakote in doses sufficient to reach a blood level between 50-100 micrograms/ml for&#xD;
      six weeks. The family received supportive therapy.&#xD;

      The hypothesis to be tested is whether children below age thirteen with the same symptom&#xD;
      cluster targeted in that protocol (explosive temper outbursts and severe mood swings,&#xD;
      Explosive Mood Disorder) will show the same response to open label Depakote that the&#xD;
      adolescents showed. An addition in this protocol is to see if this hypothesis holds under&#xD;
      double blind placebo controlled conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have now completed open treatment with six children and have found that the&#xD;
      same criteria that selected a treatment responsive group of adolescents and adults also&#xD;
      worked for five of these six children. The investigators now propose to test these findings&#xD;
      under double blind conditions. There is no change in the overall safety profile of the&#xD;
      treatment. The only change is the addition of a placebo phase. All children will receive&#xD;
      active treatment at some point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators hypothesize that the clinical syndrome of temper and&#xD;
      irritability will tend to resolve with development and that families will not exhibit&#xD;
      bipolarity in first degree relatives but will exhibit temper outbursts. This hypothesis will&#xD;
      be studied in a follow-up study.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND The disruptive disorders of childhood and adolescence are conduct,&#xD;
      oppositional-defiant, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders. Of these, only the&#xD;
      latter has a specific pharmacologic treatment. The other two reliably describe problem&#xD;
      behaviors of special education classes, chemical dependency units and family courts but have&#xD;
      few treatment implications. In a previous communications, the investigators described&#xD;
      adolescent subjects with temper outburst and severe mood swings. The investigators labeled&#xD;
      the syndrome Explosive Mood Disorder (EMD) and drafted tentative criteria for temper outburst&#xD;
      and irritable mood swings (see Inclusion Criteria for EMD). The goal of this study is to&#xD;
      demonstrate that Depakote can help a certain type of problem child, one whose disruptiveness&#xD;
      is associated with mood dysregulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized the subjects' mood dysregulation and aggressive disinhibition&#xD;
      to be &quot;limbic&quot; pathology. The limbic system is heavily implicated in behavior and emotion,&#xD;
      and work by previous investigators suggested episodic dyscontrol can result from limbic&#xD;
      irritability. Since carbamazapine and valproic acid are used in limbic seizures and bipolar&#xD;
      spectrum disorders, the investigators predicted subjects would improve on divalproex sodium&#xD;
      (Depakote), the enteric coated form of valproic acid. The investigators treated thirteen&#xD;
      patients meeting the above criteria criteria with open label divalproex sodium. In all cases,&#xD;
      there were strikingly beneficial results, including a sharp decline in the frequency and&#xD;
      severity of temper outbursts and the severity of mood swings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The typical patient would progress from irritation to screaming, door-slamming, property&#xD;
      destruction or fighting explosively, i.e., without intermediate steps. When not exploding,&#xD;
      the patient's affect and frustration tolerance would fluctuate throughout the day. The mood&#xD;
      could be irritable, normal or silly but always unpredictable. The patients had chronic&#xD;
      interpersonal difficulties, especially with authority figures, thus serious problems with&#xD;
      family, school and work were common. They tended to end up with deviant peers, since others&#xD;
      could not tolerate the unpredictable interactions. Though some of patients met criteria for&#xD;
      Conduct or Oppositional Defiant Disorder, these diagnoses were too heterogeneous to describe&#xD;
      the Depakote responders. Cyclothymia and Bipolar II Disorder did not capture the chronic,&#xD;
      maladaptive interactions with peers and authority figures. Intermittent Explosive Disorder&#xD;
      missed the above plus the connection to mood dysregulation. Borderline Personality implied a&#xD;
      specific type of interpersonal pathology (idealization, devaluation, manipulation) that was&#xD;
      not necessarily present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The closest match the investigators found in the literature to our patients was &quot;Emotionally&#xD;
      Unstable Character Disorder&quot; (EUCD). This diagnosis described young adults with extreme&#xD;
      irritability, mood swings, chronic maladaptive behaviors, and a clear response to a mood&#xD;
      stabilizing agent (lithium carbonate). However, even this diagnosis does not capture the&#xD;
      explosiveness which is prominent in the sample of Depakote responders. The investigators&#xD;
      therefore decided to use the term Explosive Mood Disorder (EMD) to capture the temper&#xD;
      outbursts and the mood lability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Campbell reported hospitalized conduct disordered children with affective (as opposed to&#xD;
      predatory) aggression improvement on lithium and Findling reported similar findings in&#xD;
      similar outpatients treated with risperidone. The key feature of irritable mood swings is not&#xD;
      directly addressed in these studies. In addition, other studies of childhood aggression in&#xD;
      Autism, Tourette Syndrome, Bipolar Disorder and mental deficiency suggest a role for&#xD;
      risperidone. Nonetheless, it is still not clear what alternative pharmacological treatments&#xD;
      for temper driven by irritable mood swings are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators treated ten subjects who met screening criteria for EMD with open label&#xD;
      Depakote 1000mgs. Baseline evaluation included a full medical and psychiatric interview, the&#xD;
      Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatry-III-R and a&#xD;
      record of the total number of explosions during the previous week and thirty days. The latter&#xD;
      estimate was obtained from as many sources as possible. At minimum, the patient and one&#xD;
      parent had to each give an estimate. As many other sources as possible were also asked to&#xD;
      estimate the lability of the patient's mood during the previous week and thirty days. Each&#xD;
      week the same information would be obtained about the previous week and a global assessment&#xD;
      made as to whether the patient was unimproved, minimally improved, much improved or very much&#xD;
      improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve adolescents agreed to participate, and two dropped out before receiving an adequate&#xD;
      trial. The other ten adolescents showed clear improvement in mood and number of explosions,&#xD;
      with the latter typically declining by 90-100%. All ten adolescent patients were judged at&#xD;
      least much improved by the psychiatrist, parents and patient. These results were later&#xD;
      replicated under double-blind, placebo controlled conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Teachers and parents approached the investigators with children under the age of 13 and asked&#xD;
      us to treat them. The investigators obtained permission to collect open label data on those&#xD;
      youngsters. The completion of open-label data has led to the current study.&#xD;
