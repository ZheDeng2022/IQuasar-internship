  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) may have application in a&#xD;
      promising tool for identification of myocardial inflammation in patients with dilated&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy (DCM).Therefore, the purpose of the study is to confirm the hypothesis of the&#xD;
      fixation of FDG in non cardiomyocyte cells in a number of patients with DCM, to specify the&#xD;
      frequency and describe the different binding profiles in comparison with MRI data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will perform an ethologic evaluation of a non ischemic DCM with in a cardiac MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have with in 4 weeks after the MRI a 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET. A&#xD;
      high fat and low carbohydrate diet and an heparin injection will be prescribed to patients&#xD;
      before this FDG PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be identified as FDG+ or FDG -. The clinical status of the patient will be&#xD;
      completed by a 12 months evaluation.&#xD;
