        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Voluntarily provide informed consent, or have a legally authorized representative&#xD;
             (LAR) provide informed consent with subject assent, in accordance with local&#xD;
             regulations and governing Institution Review Board (IRB) requirements prior to any&#xD;
             procedures or evaluations performed specifically for the sole purpose of the study&#xD;
             (other than the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to assess capacity to provide&#xD;
             informed consent). Capacity to provide informed consent will be determined by the MoCA&#xD;
             and investigator judgment according to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with scores of greater than or equal to 21 on the MoCA and, in the&#xD;
                  judgment of the investigator, have the capacity to provide valid informed&#xD;
                  consent, can give consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with scores of less than 21 but greater than or equal to 18 on the MoCA&#xD;
                  and, in the judgment of a mental health professional (independent of the&#xD;
                  investigator) have the capacity to provide valid informed consent, may give&#xD;
                  consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with scores less 21 but greater than or equal to 18 on the MoCA, who&#xD;
                  lack the capacity to give valid informed consent, in the judgment of a mental&#xD;
                  health professional (independent of the investigator), will need an LAR to&#xD;
                  provide informed consent with assent by the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with scores of less than 18 on the MoCA will have an LAR provide&#xD;
                  informed consent with assent by the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have a clinical diagnosis of HD, confirmed by either CAG repeat number of greater than&#xD;
             or equal to 39 or a positive family history (a first degree relative with a clinical&#xD;
             diagnosis of HD) if CAG repeat number is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Are age greater than or equal to 18 and less than or equal to 65 years at the&#xD;
             screening visit (Visit 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have a UHDRS Total Functional Capacity greater than or equal to 7 at Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. If currently taking antipsychotic medication(s), have been on a stable regimen for at&#xD;
             least 60 days prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Are fluent in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. If female, are either a) not of childbearing potential (i.e., surgically sterilized or&#xD;
             post-menopausal for more than 1 year) or b) have a negative pregnancy test and if&#xD;
             sexually active must agree to use a medically reliable form of contraception&#xD;
             throughout the study. Acceptable methods of contraception include a reliable&#xD;
             intrauterine device, hormonal contraception or spermicide in combination with a&#xD;
             barrier method.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. If male, are either a) not of reproductive potential or b) if sexually active must&#xD;
             agree to use a medically reliable form of contraception throughout the study.&#xD;
             Acceptable methods of birth control include spermicide in combination with a barrier&#xD;
             method, or subjects' female partner is willing to use medically acceptable methods of&#xD;
             birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Have normal clinical laboratory test results and ECG, or results with minor&#xD;
             deviations, which are not considered to be clinically significant by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have a history or presence of significant cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal,&#xD;
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, or neurological disorders other than HD which, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, increases the risk of the study drug or may confound the&#xD;
             interpretation of study measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have unstable or severe depression, in the opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have alcohol or drug abuse or dependence, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical&#xD;
             Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have received treatment with an investigational drug or device within 60 days prior to&#xD;
             Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Are pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have serum alanine transaminase or aspartate transaminase greater than two times upper&#xD;
             limit of normal at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Have hemoglobin, white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, or platelet count&#xD;
             outside the normal range at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Are an employee of Omeros, an investigator, or study staff member, or their immediate&#xD;
             family member.&#xD;
