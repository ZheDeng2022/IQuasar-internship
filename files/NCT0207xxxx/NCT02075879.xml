    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of a nurse-led case management programme&#xD;
      on home exercise training for haemodialysis patients. We hypothesised that: a. There is no&#xD;
      significant difference in physical functioning between participants receiving the nurse-led&#xD;
      home exercise training programme and those receiving the comparison care. b. There is no&#xD;
      difference in depression between participants receiving the nurse-led home exercise training&#xD;
      programme and those receiving the comparison care. c. There is no difference in quality of&#xD;
      life and health perception between participants receiving the nurse-led home exercise&#xD;
      training programme and those receiving the comparison care. d. There is no difference in&#xD;
      physical activity levels between participants receiving the nurse-led home exercise training&#xD;
      programme and those receiving the comparison care. e. There is no difference in perceived&#xD;
      benefits and barriers of exercise between participants receiving the nurse-led home exercise&#xD;
      training programme and those receiving the comparison care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was a randomized controlled trial conducted in two haemodialysis units of two&#xD;
      tertiary hospitals in Nanjing, China. Participants were randomly assigned to either study&#xD;
      group or comparison group. Participants in both groups received the in-center exercise&#xD;
      training (20 minutes) before haemodialysis sessions weekly for 6 weeks and were instructed to&#xD;
      perform exercise at home. The in-center training was focused on flexibility and strengthening&#xD;
      exercise. Patients were encouraged to have cardiovascular exercises at home which will&#xD;
      improve their cardiovascular conditions and endurance. The list of cardiovascular exercise&#xD;
      included brisk walking, bicycling, jogging. Participants in the study group were instructed&#xD;
      to start walking or brisk walking at low duration and gradually progress to a maximum of 30&#xD;
      minutes daily per week. To facilitate exercise progression, the nurse case managers discussed&#xD;
      exercise benefits, explored exercise barriers and developed mutual goals with patients. The&#xD;
      nurse motivated them and checked the exercise behaviors to ensure adherence to the&#xD;
      recommended exercise regime. The nurse case managers interviewed the study group patients&#xD;
      weekly for six weeks and biweekly for another six weeks. Participants in the comparison group&#xD;
      only participated in the in-center exercise training. The comparison group patients received&#xD;
      usual care from the nurse without the interviews and mutual goals developed.&#xD;

      The duration of interventions was 12 weeks. In-center exercise training sessions were&#xD;
      available for all participants once a week for 6 weeks. Each session lasted about 20 minutes.&#xD;
      Participants were instructed to perform flexibility and strength exercise in centres prior to&#xD;
      the haemodialysis session. The researcher performed exercises with the participants and&#xD;
      emphasised the importance of self-monitoring during the sessions. Symptoms (such as chest&#xD;
      pain, dyspnea, dizziness, and leg cramps) and vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, and&#xD;
      pulse) were checked before exercise and monitored during the entire exercise session.&#xD;
      Participants were instructed to self-monitor exercise intensity. The exercise programme was&#xD;
      pause immediately if the patient was feeling short of breath, chest pain or pressure,&#xD;
      irregular heartbeats, leg cramps, dizziness or lightheadedness, blurring of vision, or any&#xD;
      discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group During the study period, participants in the intervention group received&#xD;
      additional face-to-face interviews conducted by the designated case managers every week for&#xD;
      six weeks and biweekly for another six weeks. During interviews, patients were instructed to&#xD;
      start aerobic exercise, such as walking, jogging, cycling, or brisk walking at home at low&#xD;
      duration and gradually progress to a maximum of 30 minutes daily per week. Apart from aerobic&#xD;
      exercise, patients were recommended to perform strength exercises twice a week and&#xD;
      flexibility exercises for every day. The key elements of the interview included: 1)&#xD;
      assessment of patients' knowledge and exercise behaviour; examining patients' attitudes and&#xD;
      feelings about being physical activity; 2) explore patients' barriers to exercise and&#xD;
      perceived benefits; 3) patient education on the benefits of exercise if needed; 4)&#xD;
      development of mutual goals in an exercise plan; 5) explain the purpose of a recording&#xD;
      exercise log and instruction in correct way to keep an exercise diary; 6) discuss the&#xD;
      available supports and resources that could motivate patients to initiate and maintain&#xD;
      exercise, e.g., centre-based exercise programme, support from family members, health care&#xD;
      providers, peer patients, and so forth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the follow-up interviews, case managers reviewed the exercise log with participants,&#xD;
      discussed unpleasant experiences related to exercise, exercise progress, and provided&#xD;
      encouragement. According to the progress participants made, the exercise goals and plan were&#xD;
      renewed or revised. Referrals were made as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison group Participants in the comparison group were advised to participate in the&#xD;
      in-centre exercise training programme which was available before haemodialysis sessions once&#xD;
      a week for different shifts of patients. The training session lasted about 20 minutes and&#xD;
      only flexibility and strength training were provided. During the training sessions, patients&#xD;
      were advised to increase their daily activity levels.&#xD;
