  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of trametinib in treating patients&#xD;
      with cancer that has spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or&#xD;
      controlled with treatment (advanced) with or without liver (hepatic) dysfunction. Trametinib&#xD;
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking proteins needed for cell growth. When these&#xD;
      proteins are blocked, the growth of cancer cells may be stopped and the cancer cells will&#xD;
      then die. Hepatic dysfunction is frequently found in patients with advanced cancer and&#xD;
      usually prevents patients from receiving standard treatments or from participating in&#xD;
      clinical trials. Patients may also need dose adjustments or absorb drugs differently.&#xD;
      Trametinib may be a better treatment for patients with advanced cancers and hepatic&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To provide appropriate dosing recommendations for patients with varying degree of hepatic&#xD;
      dysfunction receiving trametinib (mild, moderate and severe).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of&#xD;
      trametinib in advanced cancer patients with varying degrees of hepatic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of trametinib in advanced cancer&#xD;
      patients with varying degrees of hepatic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To document the non-DLTs associated with the administration of trametinib in patients with&#xD;
      varying degrees of hepatic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To document any antitumor activity associated with trametinib treatment of patients&#xD;
      enrolled on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore and characterize predictive biomarkers for individual cancer patients&#xD;
      utilizing genomic sequencing technologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive trametinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.&#xD;

             study requirements&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
