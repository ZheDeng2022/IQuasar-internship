    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective randomized study is to evaluate the perioperative effects of&#xD;
      inhalational anesthesia (desflurane) and intravenous anesthesia (propofol) on hemostasis in&#xD;
      patients undergoing splenectomy with liver cirrhosis guided by the new technology (ROTEM) and&#xD;
      the traditional laboratory hemostatic markers.&#xD;

      After obtaining approval from the Institutional Research Ethics Committee and informed&#xD;
      written consent, thirty adult patients aged 25- 55 years of either sex, American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiologists (ASA) class II- III (Child A) suffering from cytopenia scheduled for&#xD;
      elective splenectomy will be recruited. Pancytopenia is defined as anemia (hemoglobin &lt; 13.5&#xD;
      g/dL-male; &lt;12 g/dL-female); leucopenia (total leukocyte count &lt; 4,000/mm3) and&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt; 150,000/mm3). Child B and C, Hb &lt; 10 g/dL platelet count &lt;&#xD;
      50,000/mm3, White Blood Cells (WBCs) &lt; 2,000/mm3, prothrombin time [PT] &gt; 16 s and INR &gt; 1.7,&#xD;
      extremes of age, obese patients (body mass index &gt;35 kg m-2), and those using oral&#xD;
      anticoagulants, other antithrombotic drugs, or oral contraceptives, will be excluded from the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be premedicated with 0.05 mg kg-1 i.v midazolam half an hour before&#xD;
      operation. In the operating room, continuous pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram, non-invasive&#xD;
      arterial blood pressure, PECO2, end-tidal anesthetic agent, neuromuscular monitoring, core&#xD;
      temperature (Infinity Kappa, Dräger, Lübeck, Germany) and hourly urine output will be&#xD;
      monitored throughout the operation. Depth of anesthesia will be monitored by using Bispectral&#xD;
      index (BIS). All IV fluids will be warmed, and a warm air blanket (Bair Hugger) will be&#xD;
      applied to every patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty eligible patients will be allocated randomly to one of two equal groups (15 patients&#xD;
      each) according to a computer generated randomization list: group D; maintenance of&#xD;
      anesthesia with inhaled desflurane at 1 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC); group P,&#xD;
      maintenance of anesthesia with target-controlled infusion (TCI) propofol with a target plasma&#xD;
      concentration of propofol between 2 and 5 µg ml-1. The concentration of volatile anesthetics&#xD;
      or the rate of infusion of injected anesthetics will be titrated to maintain the BIS&#xD;
      numerical value between 40-50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia will be induced in both groups using i.v. fentanyl 1.5- 2 µg kg-1 and propofol 2-&#xD;
      2.5 mg kg-1. Atracurium 0.5 mg kg-1 will be administered for neuromuscular block and&#xD;
      continued according to the response to train-of-four peripheral nerve stimulation. After&#xD;
      intubation, patients will be mechanically ventilated with 30% oxygen in air throughout&#xD;
      surgery using a low flow system (1L min-1) to adjust an end-tidal carbon dioxide (PECO2)&#xD;
      between 30- 35 mmHg. Acetated Ringer's solution will be given as a preload and maintenance at&#xD;
      a rate of 5-7 ml kg-1 h-1. Patients' systolic arterial pressures will be maintained at 100&#xD;
      mmHg or 70% of the preoperative value, whichever is higher. Hypotension will be treated with&#xD;
      i.v. crystalloid fluid loading or intravenous boluses of ephedrine as appropriate. No colloid&#xD;
      transfusion will be allowed. Transfusions of red blood cells will be used to maintain&#xD;
      hemoglobin levels equal to or above 8 g dl-1. Platelets or fresh frozen plasma will be&#xD;
      infused only when indicated by ROTEM. At the end of surgery, neuromuscular blockade will be&#xD;
      antagonized with 0.05 mg kg-1 neostigmine and 0.02 mg kg-1 atropine. Postoperative analgesia&#xD;
      was provided by intravenous infusion of 1 gm acetaminophen and IV meperidine 1 mg kg-1 every&#xD;
      12 hours. Patients are given an anti-emetic ondansetron 4 mg postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five blood samples will be collected; before operation, after ligation of splenic artery,&#xD;
      immediate post-operative, 24 hours and three days after the operation. Each time, five ml of&#xD;
      venous blood will be collected and assessment of the following parameters will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete blood picture:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hemoglobin Concentration (by electronic cell counter).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hematocrit (by electronic cell counter).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Platelet count (by electronic cell counter).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Red blood cells (by electronic cell counter).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. White blood cells (by electronic cell counter).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening hemostatic tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prothrombin Time (PT) (by conventional method).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. International Normalized Ratio (INR) (by conventional method).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) (by conventional method).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific hemostatic tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Soluble platelet selectin (sP-selectin) [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)].&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fibrinogen level (coagulation method).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. D-dimer level (ELIZA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each sample time (0.3 ml blood) will be taken for measuring the following ROTEM variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The time until initial fibrin formation (clotting time CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The kinetics of fibrin formation and clot development (clot formation time (CFT) and α-&#xD;
           angle).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ultimate strength and stability of the fibrin clot (maximum clot firmness MCF).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clot lysis (fibrinolysis). The previous parameters provide information about platelet&#xD;
           activation, fibrin formation and clot retraction (all stages of the developing and&#xD;
           resolving clot). Blood samples are activated extrinsically (by tissue factor) and&#xD;
           intrinsically (by contact activator) via commercially available tests. Furthermore,&#xD;
           fibrinogen levels will be assessed by measuring clot strength (MCF) in the presence of&#xD;
           platelet inhibition (e.g., fib-TEM). This modified MCF represents the fibrin clot that&#xD;
           developed in the absence of any platelets, i.e., the functional fibrinogen [6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine laboratory tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Serum creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT),aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin, bilirubin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine investigations will be performed pre-, post-operative and on the third day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up of each patient will be done at out-patients clinic after one month to have&#xD;
      thorough clinical examination, liver and kidney function tests, Child's Turcotte Pugh (CTP)&#xD;
      score assessment, laboratory hematological tests and ROTEM assessment. This is important to&#xD;
      assess post-operative complications, efficacy of splenectomy in improving cytopenia, and the&#xD;
      influence of splenectomy on the natural course of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No previous study was conducted to assess the effects of anesthetic agents on hemostasis&#xD;
      during splenectomy with liver cirrhosis guided by ROTEM. Thus the calculation of the sample&#xD;
      size is difficult and also the reagents required for ROTEM are expensive so we designed this&#xD;
      thesis to be a pilot study. A sample size was chosen to be 15 patients in each group.&#xD;
      Comparison between the two groups will be performed using Mann-Whitney test, while comparison&#xD;
      within each group will be performed using Wilcoxon sign rank test. Comparison between&#xD;
      repeated measures in both groups was performed using ANOVA. The data are considered&#xD;
      significant if p values are ≤ 0.05. Statistical analysis will be performed with the aid of&#xD;
      the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) computer program, version 12 windows&#xD;
      (IBM, USA).&#xD;
