      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects and safety of Ruxolitinib, a Janus kinase&#xD;
      1 (JAK1) and Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitor for the treatment of tumor-associated cachexia&#xD;
      in chronic wasting diseases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome characterized by tissue wasting, loss of body weight,&#xD;
      particularly of lean body (muscle) mass (LBM) and to a lesser extent adipose tissue,&#xD;
      metabolic alterations, fatigue, reduced performance status, and very often accompanied by&#xD;
      anorexia leading to a reduced food intake. Cachexia accompanies the end stage of many chronic&#xD;
      diseases and especially cancer and therefore is also termed &quot;cancer-related anorexia/cachexia&#xD;
      syndrome&quot; (CACS). Clinically, cachexia is defined as an unintentional 5% resp. 10% loss of&#xD;
      body weight over a 6-month resp. 12-month period that is directly associated with an&#xD;
      underlying disease. The progressive loss of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle despite&#xD;
      adequate feeding results in weakness, reduced ambulation, diminished quality of life, poor&#xD;
      response to therapy, and often death due to respiratory failure or infection. At the time of&#xD;
      cancer diagnosis, 80% of patients with upper gastrointestinal cancers and 60% of patients&#xD;
      with lung cancer have already had substantial weight loss. Currently, there are no approved&#xD;
      effective treatments for the treatment of cachexia. Understanding the molecular mechanisms&#xD;
      responsible for muscle wasting is necessary to develop targeted therapies that play a central&#xD;
      role in signal transduction initiated by cytokines (e.g., interleukin and interferon&#xD;
      signaling), growth factors, and hormones for these most vulnerable patients. Key features of&#xD;
      CACS are increased resting energy expenditure (REE), increased levels of circulating factors&#xD;
      produced by the host immune system in response to the tumor, such as proinflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines, or by the tumor itself, such as proteolysis-inducing factor. Inflammation is a&#xD;
      unifying mechanism for the entire cluster of sickness behaviours (asthenia, increased&#xD;
      slow-wave sleep, mood alteration, lethargy, depression, anorexia, fever, anhedonia, cognitive&#xD;
      impairment, hyperalgesia and decreased social interaction), including lipolysis and muscle&#xD;
      proteolysis. Inflammation is generated in the brain, by the tumor, by tissues in the locale&#xD;
      of the tumor and by a diversity of host cells including skeletal muscle, adipose tissue,&#xD;
      cells of the immune system, and liver. The specific identity of the inflammation mediators&#xD;
      participating in cancer cachexia is emerging. Both host and tumor-derived factors have been&#xD;
      shown experimentally to contribute to muscle wasting. There is evidence that a chronic,&#xD;
      low-grade, tumor-induced activation of the host immune system, which shares numerous&#xD;
      characteristics with the &quot;acute-phase response&quot; found after major traumatic events, septic&#xD;
      shock or chronic inflammatory diseases with an excessive production of proinflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines, is involved in CACS. Proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor-alfa (TNF-a) play a central role in the pathophysiology of CACS, although the&#xD;
      mechanisms by which they might induce muscle wasting are unknown. A goal of anorexia-cachexia&#xD;
      therapy is to interfere with these responses to inflammation and so to restore positive&#xD;
      energy balance and to promote the gain of skeletal muscle mass. Understanding the specific&#xD;
      management of the initiating inflammatory pathways is crucial to that end. Recently a study&#xD;
      reported that a &quot;Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STAT)&quot; protein (STAT3)&#xD;
      activation is a common feature of muscle wasting, activated in muscle by IL-6 in vivo and in&#xD;
      vitro, by different types of cancer, and by sterile sepsis. Moreover, STAT3 activation is&#xD;
      necessary and sufficient for causing muscle wasting. Conversely, the same authors showed that&#xD;
      inhibiting STAT3 pharmacologically with Janus kinase (JAK) or STAT3 inhibitors or genetically&#xD;
      reduced muscle atrophy downstream of IL-6 or cancer. Epidemiological studies suggest that as&#xD;
      many as 25% of all cancers may be due to chronic inflammation. The connection between&#xD;
      inflammation and cancer consists of an extrinsic pathway, driven by inflammatory conditions&#xD;
      that increase cancer risk, and an intrinsic pathway, driven by oncogenic alterations that&#xD;
      result in creation of an inflammatory microenvironment that resolves in neoplasias. Immune&#xD;
      cells play key roles in connecting inflammation and cancer by producing various growth or&#xD;
      angiogenic factors, proteinases, chemokines, and cytokines that create a pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      tumor microenvironment. This milieu stimulates cell migration, proliferation, survival,&#xD;
      angiogenesis, and metastasis, and facilitates the subversion of adaptive immunity, thus&#xD;
      favoring cancer progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These theoretical considerations as well as pharmacological results and data from animal&#xD;
      models indicated that the JAK/STAT pathway is a primary mediator of muscle wasting in cancer&#xD;
      cachexia and other conditions of high IL-6 family signaling. Thus JAK/STAT pathway could&#xD;
      represent a novel therapeutic target for the preservation of skeletal muscle in cachexia. On&#xD;
      the basis of this rationale, we want to carry out an open label phase II study with the aim&#xD;
      of testing the efficacy and safety of a treatment based on a pharmacologic inhibition of the&#xD;
      JAK/STAT3 pathway with Ruxolitinib in patients with CACS. Ruxolitinib represents a novel&#xD;
      orally bioavailable, potent, and selective inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2 developed primarily for&#xD;
      the treatment of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs). A key feature of MPNs is the&#xD;
      dysregulation of JAK/STAT signaling.&#xD;
