      Mind-Body Awareness Training (MBAT), in the forms of various yoga and meditative practices,&#xD;
      has become increasingly prevalent due to an increase in awareness of the potential health&#xD;
      benefits, and improvements in concentration that this training can provide to practitioners.&#xD;
      In the present study, we investigate the role of Mind-Body Awareness Training (MBAT) in the&#xD;
      initial learning of a sensorimotor (SMR) based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI's hypothesis is that MBAT will improve performance in SMR based BCI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this protocol, we will test the PI's hypothesis that MBAT including yoga will improve the&#xD;
      ability for subjects to concentrate on control the SMR thus improving the performance of BCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited for short term MBAT and then undergo BCI training. The performance&#xD;
      of subjects with MBAT will be compared with those without MBAT to test the hypothesis.&#xD;
      Procedures involved include 6 weeks yoga classes with at least 3 classes per week, and a EEG&#xD;
      brain noninvasive brain computer interface study.&#xD;

    <description>During the course of the study over 5-10 weeks, we will quantitatively examine three main components of data: the proportion of subjects that achieve a pre-determined threshold of one-dimensional BCI competency as a time to event analysis, how subjects performed on average in each metric (accuracy, speed, etc.) over the course of the study (5-10 weeks), and subject learning over time during the course of study (5-10 weeks).</description>
