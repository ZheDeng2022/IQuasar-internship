    <textblock>
      Early initiation of enteral feeding, achievement of full enteral feeding and cessation of&#xD;
      parenteral nutrition are extremely important in the very premature infant. This way it is&#xD;
      possible to achieve good post-natal growth and developement while minimizing the metabolic&#xD;
      and infectious complications of parenteral feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There isn't much information in literature regarding the impact of enteral feeding on&#xD;
      intestinal blood flow and intestinal regional oxygenation in the preterm infant. There is&#xD;
      also no consensus regarding the best regimen of delivering the enteral nutrition - bolus&#xD;
      feeding or continuous feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to compare the intestinal regional oxygenation before and after two&#xD;
      feeding regimens - bolus feeding and continuous feeding - in clinically stable preterm&#xD;
      infants born before 32 weeks gestation. The evaluations will be performed using NIRS&#xD;
      technology (Near Infrared Spectroscopy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study may help to assess which feeding regimen is gentler to the immature intestines&#xD;
      (i.e. alters less the splanchnic blood flow and oxygenation) and therefore the preferred way&#xD;
      to feed preterm infants.&#xD;

      infants born before 32 weeks gestation. The evaluations will be performed using NIRS&#xD;
      technology (Near Infrared Spectroscopy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to assess 20 clinically stable, appropriate for gestational age&#xD;
      preterm infants, born before 32 weeks of gestation and receiving full enteral feedings at&#xD;
      least 1 week prior to enrollment with no signs of feeding intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All 20 participants evaluated constitute the 2 study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group 1 = Bolus feeding - before and after one bolus feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group 2 = Continuous feeding - before and after one continuous feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study may help to assess which feeding regimen is gentler to the immature intestines&#xD;
      (i.e. alters less the splanchnic blood flow and oxygenation) and therefore the preferred way&#xD;
      to feed preterm infants.&#xD;
