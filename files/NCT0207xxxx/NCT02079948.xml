    <textblock>
      This study will be the first to test whether a selected anti-inflammatory agent,&#xD;
      methotrexate, reduces inflammation in a human body, improve cognitive and physical function,&#xD;
      and reduce pain levels in older adults at risk for functional decline, due to systemic&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      If you decide to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (much like the flip&#xD;
      of a coin) to receive either methotrexate or placebo. A placebo is a substance that looks&#xD;
      like and is given in the same way as an experimental treatment but contains no medicine, for&#xD;
      example [a sugar pill, an injection of saline (salt water)]. A placebo is used in research&#xD;
      studies to show what effect a treatment has compared with taking nothing at all. If you are&#xD;
      assigned to receive placebo, you will not receive the benefits of the methotrexate, if there&#xD;
      are any, nor will you be exposed to its risks, which are described below under &quot;What are the&#xD;
      possible discomforts and risks?&quot; Studies have shown, however, that about 1 in 3 persons who&#xD;
      take a placebo do improve, if only for a short time. You and the physician and other persons&#xD;
      doing the study will not know whether you are receiving placebo or methotrexate, but that&#xD;
      information is available if it is needed. Also, you will have a 50% chance of receiving&#xD;
      methotrexate and a 50% chance of receiving placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methotrexate lowers folate (vitamin B9) levels in the body, so when someone takes&#xD;
      methotrexate, he/she needs to take folic acid. To make sure that methotrexate lowers levels&#xD;
      of inflammation in the body and not folate, study participants in both groups will be given&#xD;
      folic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the remainder of the description of what will be done, both the methotrexate and the&#xD;
      placebo will be called &quot;study treatment.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given a study letter that describes the study. You will be asked to show this&#xD;
      letter to your doctors and other medical specialists, so they know that you are participating&#xD;
      in a study with study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to take your study drugs every morning by mouth on an EMPTY STOMACH before&#xD;
      breakfast. The study capsules containing methotrexate and the placebo will look the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the methotrexate group will slowly increase the amount of methotrexate they&#xD;
      take in the first month up to the 15 mg/week. In the first week, participants will take 5&#xD;
      mg/week (i.e., 1 capsule on Day 7), in the second and third week they will take 10 mg/week&#xD;
      (i.e., 2 capsules on Day 7), and in the fourth week they will take 15 mg/week (i.e., 3&#xD;
      capsules on Day 7). On Days 1-6, participants will take 1 folic acid capsule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the placebo group will slowly increase the number of placebo capsules they&#xD;
      take in the first month. In the first week, participants will take 1 placebo capsule on Day&#xD;
      7, in the second and third week they will take 2 placebo capsules on Day 7, and in the fourth&#xD;
      week they will take 3 placebo capsules on Day 7. On Days 1-6, participants will take 1 folic&#xD;
      acid capsule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Store study medications at room temperature between 59° to 86°F (15° to 30°C) and keep them&#xD;
      away from light.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Keep these and all medicines out of the reach of children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to take the study drugs for 6 months, and your participation in the study&#xD;
      will last approximately 8 months. The investigators will ask you to attend 12 study visits at&#xD;
      the research center located at the Institute on Aging - Clinical &amp; Translational Research&#xD;
      Building (IOA - CTRB):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Baseline Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Baseline Functional Magnetic Imaging (fMRI) Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 1-Month Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 2-Month Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. 3-Month Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. 4-Month Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. 5-Month Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. 6-Month Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. 6-Month fMRI Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Follow-Up Visit I&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Follow-Up Visit II&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also call you approximately 9 times during the study to ask you how&#xD;
      you feel and to find out if you remembered to take all your study drugs.&#xD;
