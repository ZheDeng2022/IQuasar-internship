  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls are a significant issue for older adults with vision impairment. Medical conditions&#xD;
      such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration that result in vision impairment&#xD;
      negatively impact balance. Falling is 1.7 times more likely among older adults with vision&#xD;
      impairment. In 2010 there were 9,146,026 older adults treated in emergency rooms for&#xD;
      unintentional falls and injuries from falls are expected to cost the nation an estimated&#xD;
      $54.9 billion dollars by 2020. Falls can lead to death, depression, and loss of independence.&#xD;
      However, impaired balance is a modifiable risk factor for falls. A practical yet innovative&#xD;
      falls prevention program has been developed that is designed to enhance balance and&#xD;
      proprioception among older adults. This program, UExCEL (UNE-Exercise and Conditioning for&#xD;
      Easier Living) Balancing Act, consists of simple exercises that can be done at home (15&#xD;
      minutes duration-3 times a week) during normal daily activities, requires only one brief&#xD;
      training session, and no equipment. This study aims to establish an evidence base documenting&#xD;
      the positive impact of Balancing Act exercises on balance and falls prevention for older&#xD;
      adults with vision impairment. A randomized controlled trial of older adults with vision&#xD;
      impairment (best corrected vision of 20/70 or worse) will be conducted over a 6-month period&#xD;
      (control group n = 35 and Balancing Act intervention group n = 35) to determine the impact of&#xD;
      Balancing Act on falls, fear of falling, pain, and activity levels. Factors that can be&#xD;
      expected to affect its adoption and sustained use such as cost in the community and social&#xD;
      support networks in the home will also be investigated. It is hypothesized that the Balancing&#xD;
      Act intervention will decrease the number of falls experienced by older adults who have&#xD;
      vision impairment by improving their gait and balance, reducing their fear of falling,&#xD;
      increasing their physical activity, and reducing their pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the research are to: 1) Evaluate the impact of Balancing Act on standing&#xD;
      balance control and proprioception for older adults who have vision impairment, using the&#xD;
      Tinetti Gait &amp; Balance Test, a validated tool for evaluating gait and balance and predicting&#xD;
      fall risk; 2) Evaluate the impact of Balancing Act for older adults with vision impairment on&#xD;
      falls, fear of falling, physical activity, and pain; and 3) Improve adherence to the&#xD;
      Balancing Act exercise program by facilitating social networks. Data will be analyzed&#xD;
      through: 1) a descriptive assessment of the baseline demographic characteristics of sample&#xD;
      members, covariates, and outcome variables, as well as 2) a repeated measures design&#xD;
      examining the impact of the intervention on study participants.&#xD;
