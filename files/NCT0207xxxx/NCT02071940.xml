    <textblock>
      KIT (receptor tyrosine kinase) mutations occur in 15% of acral and mucosal melanomas. PIANO&#xD;
      is a single arm, phase II, open-label, multicentre study to evaluate the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      (plus molecular basis of such effects) of the KIT inhibitor PLX3397 (developed by Plexxikon)&#xD;
      in advanced KIT mutated acral and mucosal melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial a total of 24 patients (9 in the first stage and 15 in the second stage) will&#xD;
      receive treatment over a 24 month recruitment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following consent and successful screening, patients will receive PLX3397 capsules 1000mg/day&#xD;
      as monotherapy, and will remain on therapy as long as they are deriving clinical benefit.&#xD;
      Patients will be seen every 4 weeks during treatment to monitor response and toxicity.&#xD;
      Routine blood tests will be carried out at all visits and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      sampling (1 x 8 milliliter(ml) whole blood sample) will be done pre-dose on Day 1 and Day 15,&#xD;
      frozen and stored locally and sent to Plexxikon's vendor for central analysis at the end of&#xD;
      the study. Imaging will be carried out every 12 weeks to monitor response. The first 9&#xD;
      patients will also receive two [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET scans (baseline and at Day&#xD;
      15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      From specific named participating sites, 12 patients will provide additional (optional)&#xD;
      consent to take part in translational research. 5 of these patients will have a fresh tumour&#xD;
      biopsy taken at baseline, at day 15 and upon disease progression. The same 5 patients plus an&#xD;
      additional 7 patients (to give a total of 12 patients) will also donate blood samples at&#xD;
      baseline, 2 weeks, 12 weeks and on disease progression for the evaluation of circulating&#xD;
      tumour cells and circulating free tumour DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed up every 6 months until death or for 12 months after the last&#xD;
      patient has discontinued study treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PIANO trial is an open-label, single-arm, multicentre phase II trial of PLX3397 in&#xD;
      advanced acral and mucosal melanoma. All eligible patients will receive PLX3397 1000mg/day as&#xD;
      monotherapy and will remain on treatment as long as they are deriving benefit (at the&#xD;
      treating Investigator's discretion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of PLX3397 by review of the&#xD;
      number of patients who are progression-free at 6 months. Additional objectives include&#xD;
      assessing the safety of PLX3397, overall survival and (for a sub-set of patients) biomarker&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 24 eligible patients may be treated in this study. In order to recruit 24&#xD;
      patients, it is expected that a total of approximately 240 patients will need to be consented&#xD;
      and screened for the KIT mutation, as only KIT mutant patients are eligible (and this is&#xD;
      estimated to be 10-15% of this patient population). An interim analysis by the Independent&#xD;
      Data Monitoring Committee will be done after 9 patients have been recruited and if less than&#xD;
      2 out of the 9 patients have demonstrated progression free survival at 6 months the trial&#xD;
      will be terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As only KIT mutant patients are eligible for inclusion, the very first step following consent&#xD;
      is for patients' KIT mutation status to be tested. Only patients who have KIT mutations are&#xD;
      eligible. Wherever possible, archival tissue samples taken at the time of diagnosis will be&#xD;
      requested but if a suitable sample is not available or if following testing no result is&#xD;
      obtained an additional fresh tumour sample would be collected via a biopsy. The tissue sample&#xD;
      will be sent to specialist laboratories for KIT testing and the results of this test take 1-2&#xD;
      weeks. If the patient is found to have a KIT mutation which is not associated with PLX3397&#xD;
      resistance, they will return to clinic to complete the following study parameters and&#xD;
      investigations upto 4 weeks prior to the start of treatment except those examinations which&#xD;
      are marked with an (*) ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic details&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical and surgical history including discussions of current medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumour evaluation according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)&#xD;
           criteria v1.1 using CT or MRI scans of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis within 28 days of&#xD;
           scheduled start of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs and standard physical examination (to include blood pressure, pulse,&#xD;
           temperature, height and weight)*&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status*&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory investigations: full blood count, biochemistry (Urea &amp; Electrolytes,&#xD;
           creatinine, calcium, albumin, liver function tests, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH),&#xD;
           glucose, phosphate) and clotting screen*&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women of childbearing potential will have a urine or serum pregnancy test( within 72&#xD;
           hours of study entry)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiograph (ECG)*&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient undergoes a protocol-specified screening procedure as part of standard of care&#xD;
      and the procedure occurs within 4 weeks then this data may be used for screening purposes and&#xD;
      the test would not need to be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the screening visit confirms that the patient is still eligible to take part in the study,&#xD;
      they would return to clinic for a &quot;baseline visit&quot; and the following procedures would occur:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination (including blood pressure and weight)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine or serum pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiograph (ECG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG Performance status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory investigations: full blood count, biochemistry (U&amp;Es, creatinine, calcium,&#xD;
           albumin, liver function tests, LDH, glucose, phosphate) and clotting screen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 x 8ml whole blood sample (Pharmacodynamics/pharmacokinetics (PK/PD)analysis) to be&#xD;
           sent to Plexxikon's vendor for central analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse event (including treatment toxicity) assessments (see section 9.1 for definition&#xD;
           of an adverse event).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of concurrent medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PLX3397 prescription&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PET scan (first 9 patients only)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If the baseline visit is &lt; 7 days since screening these investigations will not&#xD;
                need to be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient would then return to clinic at day 15, day 29 (week 4), week 8 and then every 4&#xD;
      weeks in year 1 and every 8 weeks thereafter (until discontinuation of PLX3397). All visits&#xD;
      have a window of +/- 3 days. The following procedures would be done at these visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination (including blood pressure and weight).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiograph (ECG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG Performance Status (PS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory investigations: full blood count, biochemistry (U&amp;Es, creatinine, calcium,&#xD;
           albumin, liver function tests, LDH, glucose, phosphate) and clotting screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 x 8ml whole blood sample (PK/PD analysis) at Day 15 only (sent to Plexxikon's vendor&#xD;
           for central analysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse event (including treatment toxicity) assessments until 30 days after&#xD;
           discontinuation of PLX3397.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of concurrent medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of compliance with study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT or MRI scans of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis at week 12, week 26 and every 12 weeks&#xD;
           thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine or serum pregnancy testing in women of childbearing potential on every visit (&#xD;
           except day 15 on treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PET scan after 2 weeks of therapy (day 15 Â±3 days) - first 9 patients only&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the patient has discontinued the PLX3397 they then enter the follow-up phase of the&#xD;
      study. Patients will be followed up until death or for 12 months after the last patient has&#xD;
      discontinued study treatment. Patients can be followed up by telephone call every 6 months to&#xD;
      assess current status and subsequent therapies. Alternatively follow-up can be in clinic&#xD;
      especially in the case of complaints which may indicate late toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Translational Research&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset of patients from named sites (The Christie National Health Service (NHS) Foundation&#xD;
      Trust and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust) will also be asked to provide additional,&#xD;
      optional consent to take part in translational research. 5 patients will have biopsies taken&#xD;
      at 3 timepoints (baseline, at day 15 and on disease progression) and blood samples taken at 4&#xD;
      timepoints (baseline, at day 15, week 12 and on disease progression). In addition, a further&#xD;
      7 patients will give blood samples only (to give a total of 12 patients giving blood&#xD;
      samples). Wherever possible translational blood samples will be taken at the same time as the&#xD;
      standard trial blood samples which confirm that the patient is still eligible for study&#xD;
      inclusion.&#xD;
