        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males and females 18 to 49 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be in good general health as confirmed by a medical history and physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and a negative&#xD;
             urine pregnancy test on the day of each study vaccination, must not be breast-feeding,&#xD;
             and are required to use one of the following methods of contraception during the first&#xD;
             3 months of the study: hormonal (e.g., oral, transdermal, intravaginal, implant, or&#xD;
             injection); double barrier (i.e., condom, diaphragm with spermicide); intrauterine&#xD;
             device (IUD) or system (IUS); vasectomized partner (6 months minimum); abstinence; or&#xD;
             bilateral tubal ligation (if no conception post-procedure). These precautions are&#xD;
             necessary due to unknown effects that LEISH-F3 + SLA-SE or LEISH-F3 + GLA-SE might&#xD;
             cause in a fetus or newborn infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The following screening laboratory values must be within the normal ranges or not&#xD;
             clinically significant as determined by the PI and Medical Monitor (MM): sodium,&#xD;
             potassium, BUN, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, fasting&#xD;
             glucose, total WBC count, hemoglobin, and platelet count.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The following serology tests must be negative: HIV 1/2 antibody, hepatitis B surface&#xD;
             antigen (HBsAg), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative urine test for recreational drugs and alcohol per Clinical Research Unit&#xD;
             standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Urinalysis not clinically significant as determined by the study clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be capable of completing a study memory aid in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must give informed consent, be able and willing to make all evaluation visits, be&#xD;
             reachable by telephone or personal contact by the study site personnel, and have a&#xD;
             permanent address.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of possible infection with Leishmania or previous exposure to Leishmania&#xD;
             vaccines or experimental products containing SLA or GLA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Veterans who served in the military in the Middle East (Iran, Iraq), Afghanistan, or&#xD;

             products within the past 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., oral or injected steroids, such as&#xD;
             prednisone; high dose inhaled steroids) or cytotoxic therapies (e.g., chemotherapy&#xD;
             drugs or radiation) within the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received a blood transfusion within the past 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donated blood products (platelets, whole blood, plasma, etc.) within past one month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received any vaccine within past 1 month and no planned immunizations while on study&#xD;
             with the exception of seasonal influenza vaccine which should not be given between Day&#xD;
             0-84 or Day 138-168 due to 30-day washout period prior to immunology blood draws.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of autoimmune disease or other causes of immunosuppressive states.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or evidence of any acute or chronic illness (including cardiovascular,&#xD;
             pulmonary, neurological, hepatic, rheumatic, hematological, metabolic, or renal&#xD;
             disorders, controlled hypertension), or use of medication that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Principal Investigator, may interfere with the evaluation of the safety or&#xD;
             immunogenicity of the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Rash, tattoos, or any other dermatological condition that could adversely affect the&#xD;
             vaccine injection site or interfere with its evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI, that in the opinion of the Investigator, poses a health risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypertension (systolic &gt;150 or diastolic &gt;95).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of significant psychiatric illness with current use of medication.&#xD;
