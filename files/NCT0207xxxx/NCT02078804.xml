    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of death in Sweden. There are approximately 6000 new&#xD;
      cases each year in Sweden and the disease specific mortality is more than 40%. There risk is&#xD;
      about 1% to develop CRC between 60-70 years of age making 60-year olds a suitable target&#xD;
      population for colorectal cancer screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Swedish ministry of health and social affairs proposed a national study on the efficiency&#xD;
      of colorectal cancer screening in the Swedish population regarding mortality, but also what&#xD;
      screening method to be used. Eighteen participating counties of Sweden now fund the study to&#xD;
      be launched in 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the Register of the total population individuals 59-62 years of age will be randomized&#xD;
      and invited by mail to screening. Thirty- thousand five hundred individuals will be invited&#xD;
      to primary colonoscopy and 60 000 individuals will be invited to high sensitive FIT&#xD;
      (approximately 10% positive) and if positive to a subsequent follow-up colonoscopy. If test&#xD;
      negative a second round of FIT will be asked for in two years. In total 183 000 randomized&#xD;
      individuals will not be invited to screening, but followed in the Swedish Cancer register and&#xD;
      serve as controls. The inclusion period I set to five years (five years with the second round&#xD;
      of FIT) generating approximately 5 000 colonoscopies yearly the first three years and 1200&#xD;
      year four and five at a compliance rate of 35% in the colonoscopy arm and 50% in the FIT arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up time is set to 15 years with the primary endpoint disease specific mortality, but&#xD;
      also incidence. Secondary outcomes by others to be studied are in short quality assurance&#xD;
      variables of colonoscopy, participants and non-participants experiences of the invitation and&#xD;
      the screening procedure, health economy measures of the CRC-screening study and when&#xD;
      implemented in clinical care.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: The primary purpose of cancer screening is to reduce mortality from the disease&#xD;
      in the population by finding the cancer at an early and treatable stage. The cancer has to be&#xD;
      an important health problem to be a suitable target for screening. With approximately 6 000&#xD;
      new cases each year in Sweden (Cancer register), colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most&#xD;
      common cancer in Sweden and the five-year survival rate is close to 60%, but when detected at&#xD;
      an early stage the rate is 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both larger precursor stages - the adenomatous polyp (Muto, Vogelstein) - and cancers could&#xD;
      be detected by sensitive methods to analyze blood in the stool. Removal of adenomas has a&#xD;
      protective effect against colorectal cancer development (Winawer, Muller, Thiis-Evensen) and,&#xD;
      consequentially, a colorectal cancer screening program also have the potential of decreasing&#xD;
      the future incidence of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening test must be free from unwanted side effects, inexpensive, but also simple to&#xD;
      take and easy to interpret (Armitage). Furthermore, a high sensitivity and specificity is a&#xD;
      prerequisite for a screening test to be used in a program of the average risk population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indirect tests: The most commonly used screening test has been the guaiac based fecal occult&#xD;
      blood test (Hemoccult®). Four larger RCTs have demonstrated a 16% decreased in CRC mortality&#xD;
      with the test in screening (Mandel, Kronborg, Hardcastle, Lindholm). More advanced fecal&#xD;
      immunological tests (FITs) with higher sensitivity, but only a marginally increase in&#xD;
      specificity, are now available. FIT demonstrates presence of human blood only and no dietary&#xD;
      restrictions are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct tests: The main advantages with endoscopy are the direct visualization of the&#xD;
      colorectum and the possibility of obtaining tissue samples from suspected cancer lesions for&#xD;
      histopathology and removing adenomatous polyps. Recently, three RCTs with sigmoidoscopy as&#xD;
      the primary screening test have demonstrated both a reduced disease specific mortality of&#xD;
      around 30%, but also a reduced incidence of CRC of as much as 40% (Atkin, Segnan, Schoen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to now, there are no larger randomized controlled studies of the average risk population&#xD;
      published demonstrating a disease specific mortality reduction with colonoscopy as the&#xD;
      primary screening test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance: compliance is the proportion of individuals offered a screening test and actually&#xD;
      take the test (Armitage). The compliance to a screening program is a major determinant of the&#xD;
      programs effectiveness - only those who participate can contribute to the mortality reduction&#xD;
      achieved by the screening program and with low participation the number of deaths prevented&#xD;
      will be few.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A call for a Swedish study of colorectal cancer screening: The Swedish minister of Health and&#xD;
      Social affairs, Göran Hägglund, funded a task force in 2011 in order to design a study of the&#xD;
      effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening of the average risk population of Sweden. The&#xD;
      present study was designed based on what data was needed to get better outcome of colorectal&#xD;
      cancer screening in Sweden. All counties participate except for Stockholm and Gotland, due to&#xD;
      the already implemented CRC-screening program with Hemoccult®, and the county of&#xD;
      Västernorrland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods - study population: In total 200 000 individuals and residents of Sweden&#xD;
      will be randomized from the Register of the total population (Register of the total&#xD;
      population). The randomized individuals will turn 60-years old the calendar year of&#xD;
      randomization. Thirty thousand five hundred individuals will be invited to a primary&#xD;
      screening colonoscopy, 60 000 individuals will be invited to high sensitive FIT and, if&#xD;
      positive, to a subsequent colonoscopy and 183 000 persons will serve as controls. The&#xD;
      inclusion period is set to five years with a repeated test after two years in the FIT arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invitation procedures - FIT: All individuals randomized to FIT as primary screening test will&#xD;
      by regular mail receive an invitation to participate in the study. The invitation includes a&#xD;
      brochure with information about the incentives of the study and the need for a follow-up&#xD;
      colonoscopy in case of a positive test. The invitation contains a FIT-kit for two separate&#xD;
      test samples and instructions on how to take the test. With the invitation is a pre-paid&#xD;
      return-envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonoscopy: All individuals randomized to the colonoscopy arm will receive an invitational&#xD;
      letter by regular mail including the brochure with information about the incentives of the&#xD;
      study. The invitee will be informed that they shortly by mail will receive an appointment for&#xD;
      colonoscopy, sent from the endoscopy clinic in their area of residency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controls: The individuals randomized to the control arm will not be contacted and informed&#xD;
      about participation as controls in the study. If any individuals would contact the Head&#xD;
      secretariat to ask about if they are controls, information will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions - FIT-arm: We plan two rounds of FIT, one the first year and one the third&#xD;
      year. We will follow the findings and perform interim analyses and suggest that further&#xD;
      rounds of FIT are carried out if the scientific committee deems it necessary. Two tests per&#xD;
      round will be asked for without dietary restrictions. If 50% of the invitees comply and send&#xD;
      their FIT test to the laboratory (experiences from the ongoing screening program in the&#xD;
      counties of Stockholm and Gotland) and 10% are positive, this will generate approximately 1&#xD;
      200 colonoscopies for each year in the FIT-arm except for year four when the number of&#xD;
      generated colonoscopies is estimated to 2 400 due to the second round re-testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonoscopy-arm: A primary screening colonoscopy will be carried out once and with an&#xD;
      estimated adherence of about 35%, approximately 10 000 colonoscopies will be carried out. The&#xD;
      examination will be performed with or without sedation following a standard bowel cleaning&#xD;
      preparation. The endoscopy centers will be accredited and the quality of the examiners will&#xD;
      be investigated. The preparations of the bowel will be standardized. All details will follow&#xD;
      the European guidelines (von Karsa, Rembacken).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a thorough evaluation of each endoscopist from a quality aspect according to&#xD;
      set guidelines. This will be carried out by using a specific quality register in the&#xD;
      IT-system where data on the success rate of the colonoscopist, findings and side effects will&#xD;
      be entered from all the estimated 17 000 colonoscopies. In the study registry, adverse&#xD;
      advents such as pain, bleeding and perforations will also be collected. The register data&#xD;
      will continuously be cross-linked with data from the National Patient register (Patient&#xD;
      register) and the Swedish Causes of Death register (Cause of death register) in order to find&#xD;
      severe adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: Follow-up time is set at 15 years after inclusion and invitation for the primary&#xD;
      endpoints colorectal cancer mortality and incidence with interim analysis at 5 and 10 years.&#xD;
      Data of all 200.000 individuals randomized from the population register will be obtained from&#xD;
      the Causes of Death register (19) and the Cancer register (1). Regarding secondary outcomes,&#xD;
      information will be retrieved from other national registries such as the Patient register&#xD;
      (18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations: The study has been processed and approved by the regional Ethics&#xD;
      Review Board at Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden (No. 2012/2058-31/3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses: The lifetime cumulative mortality in colorectal cancer in Sweden is&#xD;
      about 1% after 15 years. With a 80% power and a 2.5% significance level according to the&#xD;
      Bonferroni method the present study need to randomize 30 500 persons in the colonoscopy arm,&#xD;
      60 186 in the FIT arm and 183 372 in the control arm. Based on previous studies, we estimate&#xD;
      that the reduction in mortality to about 30% for those examined with FIT and a subsequent&#xD;
      colonoscopy and approximately 35% for individuals who are examined with a primary&#xD;
      colonoscopy. The compliance is estimated to about 50% in the FIT-arm and approximately 10% of&#xD;
      them will have a positive test and invited to follow-up colonoscopy with 80-90% adherence&#xD;
      rate. Compliance with primary colonoscopy is estimated to 50% and there is supposed to be a&#xD;
      very low contamination from opportunistic screening.&#xD;
