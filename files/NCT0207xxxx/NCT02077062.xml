      Experimental studies using post hepatectomy animal models have been used to study the&#xD;
      mechanism of liver regeneration. Hepatectomy for various diseases and living donor liver&#xD;
      transplant provide a good human model to study in vivo mechanism of liver regeneration. These&#xD;
      studies are necessary for the clinical application of the knowledge obtained by animal&#xD;

      hepatic failure, cirrhosis and cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis: Expression of mediators of post hepatectomy liver regeneration (PHLR) is not&#xD;
      different between hepatectomy (study group) and non hepatectomy group (control group).&#xD;

      Aim: To study the mechanism of post hepatectomy liver regeneration(PHLR) and compare&#xD;
      expression of mediators of PHLR between hepatectomy (study group) and a non-hepatectomy group&#xD;
      (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient and method: This prospective non randomized trail will be conducted on two group of&#xD;
      patients- hepatectomy (Study) group and non-hepatectomy (control) group and minimum 10&#xD;
      consecutive adult (18 year or more) patients will be recruited in each group according to&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria given below. Informed consent will be obtained from the&#xD;
      patients in both the groups. Peripheral (from a forearm vein) venous blood (6 ml) will be&#xD;
      collected a day before surgery and at different intervals after surgery (day 1, day 3,7, 2&#xD;
      weeks, 6 weeks and 6 months). A small branch of portal vein will be cannulated a 20 gauge&#xD;
      intravenous catheter for measurement of portal pressure and collection of portal venous blood&#xD;
      (6 ml) at the start (after entry inside the abdomen) and at the end (before closure of the&#xD;
      abdomen). Patients in hepatectomy (study) group will undergo trucut (needle) biopsy from the&#xD;
      remnant liver. Mediators of liver regeneration will be measured by standard methods in blood&#xD;
      samples from both groups. The liver tissue from study group will also be analysed for factors&#xD;
      related to initiation of PHLR.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Introduction :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver is a vital organ which serve various metabolic and protective functions necessary for&#xD;
      the maintenance of life and it has got inherent potential to regenerate and restore volume&#xD;
      after its partial resection. Liver regeneration after hepatectomy occurs mainly by&#xD;
      proliferation of mature hepatocytes (Fausto N 2003 &amp; 2004); changes in portal haemodyanmics&#xD;
      and cytokines (IL-6, TNF- α ) considered as most important trigger factors for this process.&#xD;
      (Abhshagen K et al 2012, Scotte M et al 1997) It is proposed that increased delivery of&#xD;
      portal blood to remnant liver produces shear stress injury leading to release of factors like&#xD;
      NO and VEGF which activate the regeneration cascade (Marabushi et al 2004). Cytokines (IL-6&#xD;
      and TNF-α), NO and VEGF act on pro HGF (inactive hepatocyte growth factor) to convert it into&#xD;
      active HGF which act through Met receptors to further activate STAT-3 which is a key mediator&#xD;
      of early phase of PHLR. (Abhshgen K et al 2008,Cresman DE et al 1996, Cressman DE1997, Sudo K&#xD;
      et al 2008, Borowicak M et al 2004, Paranjpe S et al 2007) Increased delivery of portal blood&#xD;
      to remnant liver also increases per unit availability of amino acids, pancreatic hormones,&#xD;
      gut derived endotoxins and other hepatotrophic factors, all these may act directly to&#xD;
      activate DNA replication. ( Bucher NL et al 1977, Riehle KJ et al 2011) Administration of&#xD;
      amino acid mixture to intact rats induces a wave of hepatocyte replication, and its&#xD;
      deprivation blocks PHLR. (Mead JE et al 1990) Insulin, Glucagon and Growth hormone also have&#xD;
      a significant impact on liver regeneration. (Bucher NLR 1976, Shi min luo et al 2004, Amal ZS&#xD;
      et al 2011 ) The capability of liver to regenerate after its partial resection permits us to&#xD;
      perform hepatectomy for living donor liver transplantation, hepatic neoplasms and biliary&#xD;
      cancers. Hepatectomy for these conditions also provides us a good model to study the in vivo&#xD;
      mechanism of liver regeneration in human beings. These studies are important for the clinical&#xD;
      application of the knowledge obtained by experimental studies on post hepatectomy animals.&#xD;
      These studies will help us to know the mediators of various phases of post hepatectomy liver&#xD;
      regeneration (PHLR) and will guide future research to develop new approaches for the&#xD;
      prevention and management of life threatening post hepatectomy complications like &quot;Small for&#xD;
      size syndrome&quot;, hepatic failure. These trails will help to understand in vivo control of&#xD;
      cellular proliferation and may prove vital to develop new therapeutic approaches to treat&#xD;
      cirrhosis and cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis: Expression of mediators of post hepatectomy liver regeneration (PHLR) is not&#xD;
      different between hepatectomy (study group) and non hepatectomy group (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To study the mechanism of post hepatectomy liver regeneration(PHLR) and compare&#xD;
      expression of mediators of PHLR between hepatectomy (study group) and a non-hepatectomy group&#xD;
      (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study the mediators of PHLR in human model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare expression of mediators PHLR between hepatectomy (study group) and non&#xD;
           hepatectomy (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study initial changes of PHLR in liver tissue. Patient and method: This prospective&#xD;
           non randomized trail will be conducted on two group of the patients- hepatectomy (Study)&#xD;
           group and non-hepatectomy (control) group and minimum 10 consecutive adult (18 year or&#xD;
           more) patients will be recruited in each group according to inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
           criteria given below. Informed consent will be obtained from the patients in both the&#xD;
           groups. Peripheral (from a forearm vein) venous blood (6 ml) will be collected a day&#xD;
           before surgery and at after the surgery on post operative day 1, 3,7, 14 (2 weeks), 42&#xD;
           (6 weeks) and 180 (6 months). A small branch of portal vein will be cannulated a 20&#xD;
           gauge intravenous catheter for measurement of portal pressure and collection of portal&#xD;
           venous blood (6 ml) at the start of the surgery but after the entry inside the abdomen&#xD;
           and at the end of surgery but before closure of the abdomen. Collection of the blood&#xD;
           sample from a peripheral vein (forearm vein), measurement of portal pressure and&#xD;
           collection of portal blood will be done in both the study groups but patients in the&#xD;
           hepatectomy (study) group will undergo an additional procedure i.e trucut (needle)&#xD;
           biopsy from the remnant liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver biopsy specimen will be preserved in formalin solution and transferred to the pathology&#xD;
      lab to detect initial changes during PHLR and their possible mediators, normal liver tissue&#xD;
      present in resected specimen will serve as self control. Blood from peripheral vein and small&#xD;
      branches of portal vein will be collected in standard vial used for this purpose and&#xD;
      transferred to the laboratory for the analysis to detect mediators of the liver regeneration.&#xD;
      The analysis of blood sample will be done by using ELISHA method. Measurement of portal&#xD;
      pressure will be done by canulation of small branch of portal vein (e.g. Gastro epiploic&#xD;
      vein) after the entry inside the vein this intravenous catheter will be connected to a&#xD;
      digital pressure recorder via a connecting tube filled with normal saline. This digital&#xD;
      pressure recorder is available in each of the anaesthesia work station ( Make: Drager) and it&#xD;
      usually gives measurement in mm Hg, the pressure recording will be done before and after the&#xD;
      surgery to observe effect of surgery on portal pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Adult patients (18 years or more) with malignant neoplasms of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract which requires either partial resection of liver (study group) or&#xD;
      resection of other parts of gastrointestinal tract (control group) and are willing to&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria- Patients who are not willing to participate in the study. Patients with&#xD;
      conditions which can affect expression of mediator of PHLR ( e.g. immunosuppression, chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis, cirrhosis, portal hypertension, pregnancy, contraceptive use ), patients who are&#xD;
      found to have advance or inoperable disease on during surgery will be excluded from study and&#xD;
      data collected from them will not be included in analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: Minimum 10 patients in each group Design: prospective non randomized trail Place&#xD;
      of the study: Department of Gastrointestinal surgery, GBPH and MAMC, New Delhi Duration: 2&#xD;
      years. Follow Up: 6 months Funding: The investigators will apply for funding from the&#xD;
      government agencies. Mediator of PHLR to be analysed in peripheral blood by ELISA method -&#xD;
      IL-1 IL-6, T N F-α, TNF-β, HGF (hepatocyte growth factor), GH (growth hormone), Insulin and&#xD;
      Glucagon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examination of liver biopsy specimen (Immunohistochemistry): mitotic index ( Ki 67), EPCAM,&#xD;
      STAT-3, receptor for HGF, VEGF, NKAM and CD133.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods: All data will be entered in Microsoft excel and statistical calculations&#xD;
      will be performed using SPSS software. In order to compare the means of the expression of&#xD;
      various tissue factors in liver tissue before and after hepatectomy the investigators shall&#xD;
      be using paired t test if the distribution of variables is normal and Wilcox-on sign rank&#xD;
      test for a non normal distribution. For comparing the expression of mediators of liver&#xD;
      regeneration in serum of patients in study and control groups the investigators shall be&#xD;
      using independent t test for a normal distribution and Mann Whitney test for a non normal&#xD;
      distribution. In order to study the averages of serum levels of mediators of liver&#xD;
      regeneration at different points of time before and after the surgery the investigators shall&#xD;
      be using ANOVA for a normal distribution and Friedman test for a non normal distribution&#xD;
      followed by post hoc test. P value of 0.5 or below will be used to derive significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature review:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver regegenration after hepatectomy is a very complex and orderly process which involves&#xD;
      proliferation of mature hepatocytes to regain liver volume, exact mechanism of liver&#xD;
      regeneration has not been unfolded till now but evidences based on animal research (rat,&#xD;
      mice, dog etc) indicates that acute change in portal haemodynamics, cytokines, growth factor&#xD;
      (HGF,TGF,EGF), hormones (like GH, Insulin, nor adrenaline) are actively involved in this&#xD;
      process which controlled by hundreds of genes. (Fausto N 2012 and Michelopoulos 2010)&#xD;
      Marabushi et al (2004) proposed that acute increase in amount of portal blood delivery to the&#xD;
      remnant liver produces a shear stress injury which leads to production of nitric oxide (NO),&#xD;
      activation of calcium channel and release of VEGF; all of them play a key role in initiation&#xD;
      the regeneration process. Bucher NL (1964) observed that haemodynamic changes in portal blood&#xD;
      flow are directly related to the extent of hepatectomy, increase in portal pressure after 90%&#xD;
      hepatectomy is much higher that after 70% hepatectomy. Sato et al (1997&amp;1999) reconfirmed the&#xD;
      findings of Bucher NL and also observed a progressive increase of portal pressure with the as&#xD;
      liver regeneration progresses and its decline towards its completion. Experimental studies by&#xD;
      various researchers like Wang and Lautt (1998), Cantre D et al (2008,)Schoen JM et al (2001)&#xD;
      and Mei Y et al (2011) further confirmed role of NO in activation of factors responsible for&#xD;
      hepatocyte proliferation. VEGF released from sinusoidal endothelium is response to shear&#xD;
      stress injury stimulate HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) to act on c-met receptors and initiate&#xD;
      hepatocytes proliferation. (Paranjpe S et al 2007,Borowiak M et al 2004) Portal hypertension&#xD;
      associated with cirrhosis doesn't lead to shear stress associated injury due to&#xD;
      capillarization of sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs) and loss of sieve plates. (Sato et al&#xD;
      1997 &amp; Vollmer et al 1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suenaga M (1983) studied the role of portal blood in liver regeneration after partial&#xD;
      hepatectomy in dogs and noticed that adequate amount of portal blood is necessary for hepatic&#xD;
      regeneration and high concentration of amino acids in the portal blood has a positive impact&#xD;
      on regeneration process. In another study Skov OP et al (1988) noted that portal blood&#xD;
      contains high amount of EGF (epidermal growth factor), pancreatic hormones (Insulin,&#xD;
      glucagon) and other growth factors which participate actively in liver regeneration. Bucher&#xD;
      NL ( 1976 and 1977) observed that Insulin and glucagon both facilitate liver regeneration and&#xD;
      DNA synthesis after hepatectomy but some non- portal factor is required for this as both of&#xD;
      them failed to induce hepatocyte proliferation in an intact liver but they can induce&#xD;
      hepatocyte proliferation in hepatectomized and eviscerated rats. In addition to these two&#xD;
      (Insulin and Glucagon) other hormones like Growth hormone, Nor adrenaline, serotonin etc are&#xD;
      also participate in this process. ( Amal ZS et al,2011; Shi Min Luo, 2004) IL-6 and TNF-α are&#xD;
      two factors which are vital to the initiation of PHLR, portal blood contains gut derived&#xD;
      factors like lipopolysaccharides, complement factors, and intercellular adhesion molecules&#xD;
      which activate Kupffer cells to release IL-6 and TNF-α which act in paracrine manner to&#xD;
      initiate regeneration.(Fausto N 2006, Michelopoulos 2007, Cressman DE et al 1996, Feingold KR&#xD;
      et al 1988, Sudo K et al 2008, Yamada Y et al 1997, Cornell RP et al 1985). Il-6,TNF-α, VEGF,&#xD;
      NO initiate regeneration by activating HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) which a potent&#xD;
      hepatocyte mitogen. (Diaz JJ et al 2011, Cantre D et al 2008, Rai RM et al 2005). HGF along&#xD;
      with epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor(FGF),transforming growth&#xD;
      factor(TGF), hepatotrophic hormones, and several other known and unknown factors controls&#xD;
      hepatocyte proliferation and propagation. (Fausto N 1993, Fausto N and Mead JE 1989).HGF bind&#xD;
      Met receptor on hepatocytes and activate their growth and proliferation.(Borowick et al 2004)&#xD;
      HGF, EGF and TGF alfa are potent in vitro mitogens as they can induce hepatocyte&#xD;
      proliferation in a normal liver even in absence of other factors and in presence of the&#xD;
      factors like cytokines they can stimulate proliferation a significant proportion of&#xD;
      hepatocytes. ( Block GD et al 1996,Webber EM et al 1998) TGF-α can induce DNA synthesis and&#xD;
      c-myc expression when added to rat hepatocyte culture. (Skouteris GG and Menamin MM 1992)&#xD;
      Inflammatory mediators like Prostaglandin (PGE-2) also play some role in liver regeneration&#xD;
      as its level increases after hepatectomy in rats, and this process is dependent on c-AMP;&#xD;
      addition of prostaglandins to hepatocyte culture have been found to o increases DNA&#xD;
      synthesis. (Tsujii H et al, 1993) EGF can stimulates neonatal rat hepatocyte in primary&#xD;
      culture to enter into S and M phases, which can be detected as early as 4 hours and peaks&#xD;
      between 12 to 16 hours thereafter it declines and this effect can be modulated by serum&#xD;
      factors and administration of glucagon and insulin further amplifies the growth. (Draghi E et&#xD;
      al, 1980) HGF has a considerable role in PHLR , after binding met receptor it activates&#xD;
      STAT-3(signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) which mediate induction of early&#xD;
      response genes and Met mutant mice have shown impaired liver regeneration.( Borowiak M et al&#xD;
      2004) Huh CG et al in 2004 by their study on Met mutant mice showed that HGF/C-Met signalling&#xD;
      pathway play a central role in development, liver regeneration and tumorigenesis. HGF/Met&#xD;
      pathway regulates expression of many genes related to cell cycle and apoptosis, including&#xD;
      p53, cyclin E, and cyclin B, in order to promote cell cycle and inhibit apoptosis in the 24&#xD;
      hour following partial hepatectomy. ( Paranjpe S et al 2007) STAT-3 (signal transducer and&#xD;
      activator-3) is a transcription factor which regulates various primary growth response genes&#xD;
      after hepatectomy and it can be activated by various growth factors and cytokines.(Li W et al&#xD;
      2002) STAT -3 DNA binding activity increases in remnant liver within 30 minutes of PH&#xD;
      (partial hepatectomy) and peaks to 30 fold within 3 hours and this increase does not occur&#xD;
      after sham surgery. (Cressman DE et al, 1995) Several proto-oncogenes are also involved in&#xD;
      initiation and completion of liver regeneration, out of these c-fos, c-jun and c-myc are&#xD;
      important genes. C-fos and c-jun transcript levels increase in the liver almost immediately&#xD;
      after hepatectomy and return to normal by 2 hour. This is followed by elevation of the c-myc&#xD;
      m RNA which reaches to peak at 2 hours and dips to basal level at 4hours. (Fausto N et al&#xD;
      1989; Morello D, 1989) In a further study Morello D et al (1990) found that the Increase in&#xD;
      c-myc RNA after hepatectomy is many fold higher than that after sham surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the factors mentioned above several cells like Oval cell, Macrophages ,&#xD;
      Platelets and Stem cell (CD133+) also participate in PHLR directly or indirectly.(Evarts RP&#xD;
      et al 1987, Nakamura T et al 1986, Fausto N 2004, Xiang S et al 2012) In a study by amEsch JS&#xD;
      (2012) CD 133+ stem cells infusion improved hepatic reserve and overall outcome after&#xD;
      extended hepatectomy. T-cells can also affect liver regeneration and mice deficient in T-cell&#xD;
      and lymphotoxin has decreased capability of liver regeneration. ( Anders SA et al 2005,&#xD;
      Tumanov AV et al 2009) Oval cells are less sensitive inhibition by TGF-beta, which can&#xD;
      significantly inhibit proliferation mature hepatocytes so these cells (oval cells) provide an&#xD;
      alternative route for liver regeneration. (Lenanh NN et al 2007) TGF beta is an inhibitor of&#xD;
      uncontrolled heaptocyte proliferation and TGF beta m RNA expression reaches at peak towards&#xD;
      the completion of cell division and mitosis, it also has inhibitory effect on EGF activity.&#xD;
      (Nquyen LN et al 2007, Braun L et al, 1988, Fausto N et al 1990). In a study by Romero GJ et&#xD;
      (2005) TGF beta receptor knockout heptectomized mice showed increased hepatocyte&#xD;
      proliferation and increased liver mass to body ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scotte M et al (1997) studied cytokine expression in liver following minor and major&#xD;
      hepatectomy in rats and found that TNF and IL-1 increases after minor and major hepatectomy&#xD;
      while IL-6 up regulation is more prominent after major (80%) hepatectomy. Li J et al (2009)&#xD;
      compared regeneration profile after major(2/3rd) and minor(1/3rd) hepatectomy in rats, gene&#xD;
      expression profiles at 4, 12, and 30 hours after hepatectomy shown similar up and down&#xD;
      regulation although some genes showed preferential expression after major hepatectomy. Masson&#xD;
      S et al (1999) also studied impact of extent of resection on liver regeneration in rats and&#xD;
      concluded that regenerative response occurs whatsoever the extent of hepatectomy but the&#xD;
      course of regeneration and expression of growth factors differs according to the volume of&#xD;
      resected liver. M Nagino et al (2011) observed that liver regenerates rapidly in first two&#xD;
      weeks after major hepatectomy and thereafter it progresses slowly and stops when it reaches&#xD;
      3/4th of original liver volume, which usually occurs at 6 month to 1 year after the&#xD;
      hepatectomy. They also noticed that factors like extent of resection, body surface area,&#xD;
      portal vein resection, portal vein emobilisation and ICG clearance are associated with&#xD;
      regenerating liver volume after the hepatectomy.&#xD;
