  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Botulinum toxin type A (Botox A) has shown great success in treating certain urologic&#xD;
      conditions. A recent study has documented that Botox injected around the ureteral orifice (or&#xD;
      place where the tube that connects the kidney to the bladder enters the bladder), during&#xD;
      placement of a ureteral stent (small rubber tube that facilitate drainage of urine from the&#xD;
      kidney to the bladder), resulted in a marked decline in the amount of stent pain experienced&#xD;
      by patients. This finding was quite remarkable as stents are commonly used in many Urologic&#xD;
      conditions, and these stents produce a remarkable degree of patient discomfort. Despite the&#xD;
      great improvement in pain reduction, the irritative voiding symptoms [frequent need to void,&#xD;
      urgency, burning with urination (dysuria) or nighttime voiding (nocturia)] were not&#xD;
      ameliorated by the Botox injections in the ureteral orifice. However, it has already been&#xD;
      well documented that in other clinical settings, administrations of Botox into the bladder&#xD;
      muscle, has been shown to reduce these irritative symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to determine if pain and irritative lower urinary tract&#xD;
      symptoms related to ureteral stent placement will improve after the injection of Botox around&#xD;
      the ureteral orifice and in the bladder itself.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this prospective randomized single blinded controlled pilot study for&#xD;
      patients undergoing unilateral ureteral stent insertion for benign urologic conditions is to&#xD;
      determine if pain and irritative lower urinary tract symptoms (frequency, urgency, dysuria,&#xD;
      nocturia) related to ureteral stent placement will improve after the injection of&#xD;
      intradetrusor Botox (BTX) A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of BTX have been used for a number of medicinal purposes, including reducing&#xD;
      wrinkles, migraine headaches, and excessive sweating. The use of BTX in urology and, more&#xD;
      specifically, the lower urinary tract, is increasing. Botox is currently actively being used&#xD;
      as a treatment strategy for use in Urologic conditions including neurogenic and&#xD;
      non-neurogenic overactive bladder (OAB), detrusor sphincter dyssynergia, interstitial&#xD;
      cystitis, urinary retention, and prostate disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BTX serotypes. The seven distinct serotypes of BTX are designated A, B, C1, E, F, and G;&#xD;
      BTX-A (Botox [Allergan, Inc., Irvine, Calif] and Dysport [Ipsen, Inc., Europe]) and BTX-B&#xD;
      (Myobloc (Solstice Neurosciences, Inc., Malvern, Pa) are available commercially. Each&#xD;
      serotype of botulinum toxin works by inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters, most&#xD;
      notably acetylcholine, from the presynaptic neuromuscular junction (2). The result is&#xD;
      inhibition of muscular contractions and paralysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In August 2011, the FDA recently approved the use of Botox injections for urinary&#xD;
      incontinence secondary to neurogenic overactive bladder, a condition defined as unihibited&#xD;
      bladder contractions causing voiding and creating symptoms of urinary frequency. The cause of&#xD;
      the neurogenic overactive bladder in the patients studied was spinal cord injury and multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis. Numerous prospective clinical trials have demonstrated a statistically significant&#xD;
      difference of symptoms in patients receiving Botox injections into the overactive detrusor&#xD;
      muscle compared to placebo groups. Botox injections were found to effectively relieve urinary&#xD;
      incontinence and urinary frequency for a nine-month duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of standard clinical care, intravesical injection of Botox is currently used to&#xD;
      ameliorate voiding symptoms in conditions where patients experience severe irritative&#xD;
      symptoms and is currently seeking FDA approval for the treatment of overactive bladder in&#xD;
      patients without a neurologic etiology. As a follow up study, we will evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      of combined periureteral and intravesical Botox injection for reduction of pain and&#xD;
      irritative voiding&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective randomized single blinded controlled study for patients undergoing&#xD;
      unilateral ureteral stent insertion for a benign urologic conditions is to determine if pain&#xD;
      and irritative lower urinary tract symptoms (frequency, urgency, dysuria, nocturia) related&#xD;
      to ureteral stent placement will improve after the injection of intradetrusor Botox A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study in detail:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be informed regarding the content of the study and informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained. Patients who require stent placement will be screened based on their past medical&#xD;
      history and will be included in the study if they do not fit any of the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      The participation in the study will require 3 visits in addition to pre-op visit when the&#xD;
      consent will be obtained: stent placement, stent removal, and 2 week post-op follow up.&#xD;
      Patients will only have one pre-operative visit prior to ureteral stent placement. Patients&#xD;
      will be randomized to one of two groups, experimental and placebo. The experimental group&#xD;
      will include ureteral stent placement with three peri-ureteral injections of Botox A and&#xD;
      fourteen site-specific intradetrusor injections of Botox A. The placebo group will involve a&#xD;
      ureteral stent placement with no injection. Based on a randomization sequence from an&#xD;
      electronic randomizer, patients will be placed in either Botox injection group or placebo (no&#xD;
      injection) group. Patients will be consented at the pre-operative visit, which is usually up&#xD;
      to seven days prior to the procedure. After informed consent is obtained, patients will be&#xD;
      asked to complete a visual analog pain scale and a ureteral stent symptom questionnaire which&#xD;
      can either be turned in during the pre-operative visit or alternatively, if the patient&#xD;
      prefers to review the study prior to deciding to participate, can be turned in during the day&#xD;
      of stent placement in the pre-operative area at UC Irvine Douglas Hospital before the&#xD;
      procedure start time, giving the patient ample time to consider study participation. Baseline&#xD;
      post-void residual will also be taken at the pre-operative visit. All stents will be inserted&#xD;
      in a retrograde fashion as per standard of care. As standard of care, retrograde contrast&#xD;
      injection following the procedure will be done to assess ureteral and renal anatomy. Jaime&#xD;
      Landman, MD., and Gamal Ghoniem, MD., will be administering all Botox injections. Three 1mL&#xD;
      Botox A injections (10U/mL) will be placed medial, lateral, and inferior to the ureteral&#xD;
      orifice. Fourteen 1mL injections (5U/mL) will be placed into the detrusor muscle: three&#xD;
      injections at the trigone avoiding the bladder neck, away from the peri-ureteral injections&#xD;
      (10U/mL), and eleven injections distributed evenly across the remainder of the bladder. A&#xD;
      total of 100 units (1 vial) of Botox A will be used per patient. 100 units of Botox A will be&#xD;
      diluted with 10cc's of 0.9% PFNS, 3 cc's will be drawn for the peri-ureteral injections (30&#xD;
      units), then 7 ccs of 0.9% PFNS will be added to the vial to bring to 14cc's. The rest of the&#xD;
      Botox A (70u) will be injected into the detrusor muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures will be planned for day surgeries and will be given one pre-operative dose of&#xD;
      Kefzol for urinary tract infection prophylaxis as standard of care to all patients. The&#xD;
      patient will subsequently be evaluated one hour after the procedure in the recovery room with&#xD;
      a visual analog pain scale only. Subsequently, two post-operative evaluations will occur: On&#xD;
      the day of stent removal, usually post-operative days (POD) 3 - 9, and POD 14 follow up, The&#xD;
      patient will also be assessed during the second follow-up evaluation on POD's 3 - 9 for the&#xD;
      possibility of urinary tract infection or urinary retention. A post-void residual will be&#xD;
      taken during the 2 week follow-up to assess for urinary retention. On POD 14 visit, a USSQ,&#xD;
      medication diary, visual pain analog scale will be collected from the patient. Post-operative&#xD;
      evaluation will consist of a visual analog pain scale and a ureteral stent symptom&#xD;
      questionnaire (USSQ) to assess pain, lower urinary tract symptoms, and quality of life. In&#xD;
      addition, a narcotic diary will be kept by patients to determine the quantity and duration of&#xD;
      oral narcotic required during the time the stent is in place. The narcotic diary is important&#xD;
      in the study to assess the pain the patient is experiencing in addition to the visual pain&#xD;
      analog scale that will be used. A standardized post-operative pain regimen will include&#xD;
      Percocet (5mg Oxycodone/325mg Acetominophen) 1 - 2 tablets prn every 4 hours. Pain regimen of&#xD;
      Percocet is standard of care and will not be used specifically for research purposes.&#xD;
