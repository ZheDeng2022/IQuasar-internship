      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the safety of omitting the routine postoperative eye clinic review following&#xD;
      phacoemulsification cataract surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 300000 cataract extractions are performed annually in the NHS in England,&#xD;
      requiring a similar number of post-operative visits, the majority of which result in no&#xD;
      change in management. A conservative estimate of 70% of visits being unnecessary suggests a&#xD;
      potential saving to the NHS of approximately Â£10M annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What's involved:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves some questionnaires during the duration of the study. These include&#xD;
      questionnaires relating to the quality of life of the patient (conducted before the&#xD;
      operation, and at the 3 month research clinic) and a patient satisfaction questionnaire.&#xD;
      There is also a research clinic 3 months following the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What are the risks/benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no real personal benefits to patients on the trial. The trial aims to provide very&#xD;
      important information regarding the safety of discharging patients immediately after surgery.&#xD;
      However the trial could potentially save many thousands of unnecessary hospital visits each&#xD;
      year.&#xD;

      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The method presented is based on the method employed successfully by one of the applicants in&#xD;
      an earlier stuy of the first day postoperative review following cataract surgery which has&#xD;
      been peer-reviewed and published in the scientific literature. An earlier draft has been&#xD;
      presented to a patient panel and has the benefit of external review by a potential steering&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing routine elective phacoemulsification cataract surgery will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either a routine review at 4-6 weeks post-operatively (routine care) or to be&#xD;
      discharged from the cataract service immediately post-operatively. All patients will be&#xD;
      advised to see their own optometrist at 4-6 weeks for new spectacles if appropriate and will&#xD;
      then be reviewed in a research clinic at 3 months post operatively.&#xD;
