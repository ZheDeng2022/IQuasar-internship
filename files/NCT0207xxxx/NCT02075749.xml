      Abstract:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) had proven efficacy in pain relief,&#xD;
      correction of nutritional status and improving the performance status. However, lack of&#xD;
      standardization is the major obstacle for any scientific evaluation of any CAM trial.&#xD;
      Mucositis is a major complication of irradiation in head and neck (H&amp;N) tumors, the addition&#xD;
      of chemotherapy to irradiation may enhance this dose limiting problem. Licorice is a strong&#xD;
      demulcent that had been effectively used in treatment of peptic ulcer. The main purpose of&#xD;
      this study was to compare the therapeutic safety and efficacy of T. and L. mucoadhesive films&#xD;
      on oral mucositis in terms of pain control and/or ulcer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Materials: the study was a double-blind, randomized prospective trial of two&#xD;
      types of mucoadhesive films in the management of oral mucositis occurred during head and neck&#xD;
      cancer ( HNC ) radiotherapy. oral mucositis was assessed using a quantitative scale (WHO&#xD;
      scales) and symptoms were assessed using visual analogue scales (VAS). 60 patients were&#xD;
      enrolled in the study; there were 30 patients in the Triamcinolone (T) and 30 in the Licorice&#xD;
      (L) group. In the T- group, patients received triamcinolone acetonide mucoadhesive films&#xD;
      containing 1mg of the drug and patients in the L- group received licorice mucoadhesive films,&#xD;
      an herbal agent. Data were collected at baseline, then twice a week for 4 weeks.&#xD;
