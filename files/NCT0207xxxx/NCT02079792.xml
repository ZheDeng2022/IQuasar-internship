    <textblock>
      Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common disorder of the nose characterized by stuffy nose,&#xD;
      discoloured nasal discharge, sinus congestion or pressure and decreased sense of smell,&#xD;
      present for over twelve weeks. Anti-inflammatory steroid medication is often used to treat&#xD;
      sinus inflammation in CRS. These steroids are sometimes delivered using a spray device that&#xD;
      creates a mist to deliver steroid medication deep into the nose. However, the distribution&#xD;
      and efficacy of sprayed medication can be affected by the position of the patient's head.&#xD;
      This study aims to determine which of two head positions is best for delivering steroid to&#xD;
      the sinuses.&#xD;

      1. PURPOSE&#xD;
&#xD;
           The purpose of this study is to determine if the Lying Head Back or Head Down and&#xD;
           Forward head position for administering topical atomized nasal medication results in&#xD;
           greater distribution and efficacy of budesonide administered via the mucosal atomization&#xD;
           device in chronic rhinosinusitis patients who have had previous sinus surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators hypothesize that endoscopic sinonasal mucosal scores will be lower&#xD;
           (improved) in patients oriented in the LHB than the HDF position while applying&#xD;
           medication after 12 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. JUSTIFICATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Topical medications administered by nebulizers are frequently utilized for patients&#xD;
           suffering from refractory CRS. Nebulizers are useful as they atomize medication to&#xD;
           increase contact with surrounding mucosa. This technique is most useful for widespread&#xD;
           inflammation of the olfactory cleft, ethmoid, sphenoid and frontal sinuses where&#xD;
           increased inflammation may obstruct drainage pathways. Obstructed sinus ostia may&#xD;
           prevent mucosal clearance, impair ciliary function and subsequently contribute to&#xD;
           infection. Topical medication, such as steroid therapy is a safe and effective method to&#xD;
           locally reduce inflammation. The success of atomized nasal medications is dependent on&#xD;
           multiple factors such as gravity, obstructive features of sinonasal anatomy and patient&#xD;
           interpretation of the preferred delivery method. Several delivery methods for topical&#xD;
           nasal therapies have previously been evaluated to determine the optimal head position&#xD;
           for administration. However, a review of the literature suggests that the optimal method&#xD;
           of administering atomized nasal steroids to the paranasal sinuses in human subjects has&#xD;
           yet to be determined. It has been previously suggested that successful distribution of&#xD;
           intranasal steroid sprays requires topical agents to contact and remain on desired&#xD;
           mucosa to prevent disease reoccurrence. In a prospective single-cohort study, healthy&#xD;
           subjects were recruited to evaluate the distribution and clearance rate of&#xD;
           fluorescein-labeled nasal spray distributed using a squeeze bottle, nasal gel or nasal&#xD;
           spray device. The investigators found there was no significant difference in clearance&#xD;
           rate between the delivery methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This trial provides the preliminary evidence to support further investigation on the&#xD;
           rate of distribution from intranasal steroid administration in CRS patients. The&#xD;
           findings cannot be generalized to a wider CRS population, as patients enrolled were&#xD;
           healthy with no history of CRS or sinus surgery. Similarly, the investigators did not&#xD;
           report the head position utilized to administer the treatment. Therefore, there remains&#xD;
           no formal consensus for the optimal head position for CRS patients suffering from&#xD;
           recurrent symptoms for the distribution and clearance rate of intranasal steroid&#xD;
           medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinician experience at the St. Paul's Sinus Centre (SPSC) has recommended that patients&#xD;
           should orient themselves in the Lying Head Back (LHB) position to effectively treat&#xD;
           edematous mucosa of the ethmoid roof and frontal sinus recess. These instructions are&#xD;
           based on evidence collected in a previous cadaveric trial completed at our centre (in&#xD;
           press). Our team evaluated the effect of head position on the distribution of&#xD;
           fluorescent nasal spray within the paranasal sinuses of cadaver specimens. The&#xD;
           investigators utilized two commonly instructed head positions, the Lying Head Back (LHB)&#xD;
           or Mygind position and the Head Down and Forward (HDF) or Moffat's position. In this&#xD;
           trial the investigators oriented cadaver specimens in either study position and&#xD;
           evaluated the presence of fluorescent nasal spray across eleven clinically relevant&#xD;
           anatomical areas. the investigators concluded that the LHB position had significantly&#xD;
           greater frequency of distribution (OR = 1.85, 95% CI: 3.0, 6.9, p&lt; 0.001) to all&#xD;
           evaluated areas than the HDF position. This trial was limited by a number of factors,&#xD;
           which include a small sample size (n=20). Similarly, cadaveric specimens cannot be&#xD;
           generalized to humans, as moist and ciliated mucosa, and nasal polyps are not&#xD;
           represented. Therefore, it remains controversial the optimal head position for the&#xD;
           deposition of intranasal medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary objective of this clinical trial is to compare endoscopic sinonasal mucosal&#xD;
           inflammation between patients oriented in the LHB and HDF position after 12 weeks of&#xD;
           treatment. Subject sinus cavities will be assessed by a validated endoscopic mucosal&#xD;
           staging system first at baseline, then at 6 and 12 weeks of treatment. Total scores will&#xD;
           be compared between the treatment groups. The Lund-Kennedy (LKES) and Philpott-Javer&#xD;
           (PJES) endoscopic staging systems will be utilized to quantify the severity of sinonasal&#xD;
           disease. The Principal Investigator will complete all endoscopic evaluations and will be&#xD;
           blind to treatment allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The secondary objectives of this trial will be to compare LKES and PJES scores to&#xD;
           compare sensitivity to change during the treatment period and degree of correlation&#xD;
           between total scores and change in scores between the scoring systems. Inter-rater and&#xD;
           intra-rater reliability will be calculated and compared for each scoring system. The&#xD;
           purpose of this secondary outcome is to validate the PJES with the &quot;gold standard&quot; and&#xD;
           widely used LKES, in terms of overall score and sensitivity to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. RESEARCH METHOD:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Parallel, single-blind, randomized controlled trial of subjects previously randomized to&#xD;
           LHB or HDF treatment arms (from Part 1) in order compare endoscopic sinonasal mucosal&#xD;
           scores after 12 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be recruited for the study&#xD;
           at the clinic. After study patients voluntarily consent to participate in the study,&#xD;
           data collection will begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
           Treatment Arm #1: Administering topical fluorescent-labeled nasal spray in the LHB&#xD;
           position.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Treatment Arm #2: Administering topical fluorescent-labeled nasal spray in the HDF&#xD;
           position.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adult patients suffering from refractory CRS symptoms post-FESS will be randomized to&#xD;
           either Treatment Arm #1 or #2 in equal ratio. The sequence will be computer generated by&#xD;
           the trial statistician. The sequence will be ordered random-permuted blocks to ensure&#xD;
           allocation remains concealed. The sequence will be maintained in a computer located in&#xD;
           the St. Paul's Sinus Centre (SPSC) with strict passwords necessary for access.&#xD;
           Non-transparent sealed envelopes with treatment assignments will be kept in a secure&#xD;
           environment and accessible only to study personnel at the SPSC. When study personnel are&#xD;
           notified of a potential candidate, inclusion and exclusion criteria will be evaluated.&#xD;
           When consent has been provided the next consecutive envelope will be taken and treatment&#xD;
           group assigned. After treatment is assigned, the patient will preserve the envelope to&#xD;
           ensure the Principal Investigator remains blinded to their treatment allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Part 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
           As patients will be required to orient themselves in the appropriate study positions,&#xD;
           blinding will not be feasible for subjects. However, the Principal Investigator and two&#xD;
           additional senior Rhinologists evaluating endoscopic images for mucosal disease severity&#xD;
           will be blinded to each subject's allocated head position.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be randomized to a head position group, either the Lying Head Back (LHB)&#xD;
           or Head Down and Forward (HDF) position. Patients will remain in the allocated group and&#xD;
           administer their medication in their respective head position for 12 weeks. As above,&#xD;
           patients will not be blind to which position they have been randomized. However, the&#xD;
           Principal Investigator and two additional senior Rhinologists will be blind to which&#xD;
           position the subject had been oriented throughout the treatment period (12 weeks).&#xD;
           Images of each sinus cavity will be captured at baseline and after 12 weeks and&#xD;
           evaluated using the LKES and PJES scoring systems. Total scores and change in scores&#xD;
           will be compared. The randomization sequence will not be broken until the final analysis&#xD;
           is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Conduct of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Baseline and Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adult CRS patients having previously received FESS, who meet the inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
           criteria and provide consent will be randomized to either the LHB or HDF positions to&#xD;
           administer a budesonide topical nasal corticosteroid spray to their sinus cavities.&#xD;
           Baseline characteristics will be collected from patient charts as outlined above. Each&#xD;
           subject in both study groups will receive a sterile 3ml syringe fixed with a Mucosal&#xD;
           Atomization Device (MAD) tip (Wolf-Tory Medical, Salt Lake City, UT). This device is&#xD;
           advantageous as its produces a fine mist, increasing the surface area for absorption&#xD;
           within the paranasal sinuses.4 Budesonide is a well-tolerated, glucocorticoid steroid&#xD;
           that is primarily used for treatment in asthma and nasal polyposis.20 At SPSC, it is&#xD;
           standard practice to prescribe budesonide to treat postoperative sinonasal inflammation&#xD;
           utilizing the MAD. From discussion with senior Rhinologists at SPSC, patients are&#xD;
           typically instructed to administer treatment twice a day for 6-12 weeks. However, dosage&#xD;
           and frequency may be modified to suit individual circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the purpose of this trial, patients will be instructed to load each syringe with 2cc&#xD;
           of the budesonide (1mg in 2cc saline) solution to be distributed to the right and left&#xD;
           sides of the nose. A designated research assistant will collect baseline data and&#xD;
           describe and demonstrate the allocated study position in a separate room from the&#xD;
           Principal Investigator. To ensure that positioning has been correctly communicated,&#xD;
           subjects will then orient themselves in the appropriate position with guidance from&#xD;
           research staff if required. Subjects randomized to the LHB position will be instructed&#xD;
           to lay supine on the clinical table, with their head hanging over the edge of the bed as&#xD;
           far as possible without discomfort (Figure 1). Subjects randomized to the HDF position&#xD;
           will be instructed to kneel down, placing the top of their head on the ground and&#xD;
           forehead close to the knees with the nostrils facing upwards (Figure 2). Once&#xD;
           positioned, subjects will insert the MAD-syringe at a 45-degree angle into the nasal&#xD;
           valve, direct the tip to the lateral epicanthus of the ipsilateral orbit and depress the&#xD;
           syringe plunger completely. Subjects will remain positioned for 60 seconds. At this time&#xD;
           a designated research associate will be measure the angle of the subjects head in&#xD;
           relation to the horizontal plane, using an analog protractor. As all subjects may not be&#xD;
           able to orient themselves in a single standardized angle, the investigators will note&#xD;
           the angle most comfortable to determine a range of possible orientations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects will be instructed to administer budesonide 1mg/2cc nebules daily for 6 weeks&#xD;
           using the MAD syringe, in the head position allocated to which they were randomized at&#xD;
           the baseline visit. After this time, subjects will return to SPSC for endoscopic&#xD;
           examination of their sinus cavities. Bilateral nasal endoscopy will be performed using a&#xD;
           2.3mm Karl Storz rigid nasal endoscope. The Principal Investigator capturing images of&#xD;
           the sinus cavities will be blind to which head position group the subject was&#xD;
           randomized. Each sinus cavity will be assessed independently with images captured and&#xD;
           stored on a password-protected, centrally located computer. Once endoscopic images are&#xD;
           captured for patients returning after 12 weeks of treatment, three independent senior&#xD;
           Rhinologists will score each sinus cavity according to the LKES and PJES criteria.18,19&#xD;
           This will be completed twice, with a 1-week break between assessments. Responses will be&#xD;
           tabulated on separate, password-protected spreadsheets with each Rhinologist receiving a&#xD;
           study code to prevent identification. A blind statistician will summarize the data and&#xD;
           compare the total and change in endoscopic scores between the treatment groups.&#xD;
           Secondary analysis will be completed to determine the extent of correlation and&#xD;
           sensitivity between the LKES and PJES responses. Inter and intra-rater reliability will&#xD;
           also be computed to determine the extent of agreement between the scoring systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following data will be collected at the initial clinic visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Baseline characteristics will be collected including age (years), sex (male or&#xD;
           female), number of cigarettes per day (count), height (centimeters), weight (kilograms),&#xD;
           handedness (right or left), number of prior sinus surgeries (count), preoperative&#xD;
           disease severity (Lund-Mackay CT Score).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following data will be collected at the 6 and 12 week follow-up visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  PJ Endoscopic scores&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  LK Endoscopic scores&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  SNOT-22 scores&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size determination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      From our recent trial evaluating the LHB and HDF positions in human cadavers, the incidence&#xD;
      of total spray distribution was 76% and 41% in the LHB and HDF positions. Incorporating these&#xD;
      findings, the investigatorsperformed a sample size calculation using a Type I error (alpha)&#xD;
      of 5%, Type II error (beta) of 20% and an effect size of 73%. The effect size was calculated&#xD;
      using the incidence proportions from our centre's previous trial in cadaver specimens, which&#xD;
      was identified as clinically relevant and practically achievable. A two-proportion&#xD;
      calculation was used to compare the average distribution of all anatomical sites between the&#xD;
      head position groups. The calculation revealed a necessary sample size of 30 patients per&#xD;
      group. Based on clinical experience of the Principal Investigator it is estimated that 60% of&#xD;
      patients requiring sinus surgery (n=400/year) will be eligible for enrollment (n=280/year).&#xD;
      Accounting for 70% enrollment of eligible subjects (n=196/year), the investigators estimate&#xD;
      that 16 patients can be recruited every month. Adjusting for a dropout rate of 20%, the&#xD;
      investigators will increase our total sample size (n=60) by 6 patients. the investigators&#xD;
      estimated that our desired sample size adjusting for loss-to-follow-up (n = 66) will be&#xD;
      achieved in 4 months (Figure 3). Patients will be recruited in equal ratio to the&#xD;
      experimental and control groups (33 in each arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics of the two groups will be reported. Descriptive statistics will be&#xD;
      reported included mean, median, standard deviation and range. These will be reported for age,&#xD;
      height, weight, number of prior surgeries and preoperative disease severity. The proportion&#xD;
      of males and females, right and left handed subjects and frequency of blood clots and&#xD;
      adhesions present prior to the intervention will also be described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Study Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject sinus cavities will be assessed using the LKES and PJES scales. Measurements will be&#xD;
      made at baseline and 5 weeks after treatment. The LKES assesses each sinus (ethmoid,&#xD;
      maxillary, sphenoid, frontal) for the presence of polyps (0=absent, 1=present in middle&#xD;
      meatus only, 2=beyond middle meatus); presence of edema, scarring or crusting (each evaluated&#xD;
      as 0=absent, 1=mild, 2=severe) and presence of discharge (0=absent, 1=clear and thin, 2=thick&#xD;
      or purulent). A total, bilateral score is calculated for all sinuses evaluated. The PJES is a&#xD;
      similar scoring system that evaluates each sinus cavity individually to yield a total&#xD;
      bilateral score out of a total of 80. Additional points are awarded for the presence allergic&#xD;
      mucin or purulent discharge. Two endoscopic scores will be recorded for each subject, using&#xD;
      both scales for baseline and 5 weeks post treatment. The difference in baseline and 5 week&#xD;
      results will be calculated for each subject and summed together to yield an average change&#xD;
      for the LHB and HDF groups. Outcome data will be summarized by mean, median, standard&#xD;
      deviation and interquartile range. The Students t-test will be used to test if the changes in&#xD;
      endoscopic scores are significantly different between the treatment groups. Pearson's (R)&#xD;
      correlation will be calculated to determine the extent of linear association between the LKES&#xD;
      and PJES results. From a previous study evaluating the association between endoscopic scoring&#xD;
      systems, an a priori decision has been made to categorize R &lt; 0.49 as a weak correlation,&#xD;
      0.50 &lt; R &lt; 0.69 as a moderate correlation and R &gt; 0.70 as a strong correlation. Linear&#xD;
      correlation will be calculated in terms of absolute score and change in score between the&#xD;
      study time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the extent of clinical agreement between the senior Rhinologists evaluating each&#xD;
      subject, intra and inter-rater kappa scores will be calculated. It has been determined a&#xD;
      priori that scores &lt; 0 will be assigned no agreement, 0.01 - 0.20 poor agreement, 0.21-0.40&#xD;
      slight agreement, 0.41-0.60 fair agreement, 0.61-0.80 good agreement, 0.81-0.92 very good&#xD;
      agreement and 0.93-1.00 excellent agreement.&#xD;
