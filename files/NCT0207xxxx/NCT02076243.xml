  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator initiated phase II study to assess the efficacy of a chemotherapy&#xD;
      called nab-paclitaxel as first line cytotoxic chemotherapy in subjects with unresectable&#xD;
      locally advanced or metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). All subjects receive&#xD;
      the treatment by vein weekly and receive the same dose of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of developing cutaneous SCC is approximately 10% in a lifetime. The vast majority&#xD;
      are treated surgically and do not recur. However a small percentage become unresectable over&#xD;
      time or metastasize distantly in the body. Unresectable and metastatic cutaneous SCC has a&#xD;
      poor prognosis and oncologists often choose a whole body therapy without the benefit of&#xD;
      prospective efficacy data. Very little prospective investigation into the efficacy of&#xD;
      specific chemotherapy regimens as a function of line of therapy has been performed in this&#xD;
      patient population. Nab-paclitaxel is type of chemotherapy that has demonstrated activity in&#xD;
      other types of cancer such as lung and head and neck cancers. The primary objective of this&#xD;
      study is to determine the response rate (percentage of subjects with tumor shrinkage) to&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel treatment in subjects with cutaneous SCC who have not received cytotoxic&#xD;
      chemotherapy in the unresectable or the metastatic settings.. Secondary objectives are the&#xD;
      progression free survival (time until tumor starts to grow), safety, assessment of the&#xD;
      percentage of subjects whose tumor expresses a protein called SPARC, and correlating the&#xD;
      expression of SPARC with response to treatment. To determine if the tumor expresses SPARC&#xD;
      part of a prior standard biopsy such as that performed to establish the diagnosis of SCC will&#xD;
      be used. SPARC is a protein that is overexpressed in a range of different cancer types and&#xD;
      may alter the environment around the tumor possibly in a way that may make the SCC more&#xD;
      responsive to treatment with nab-paclitaxel.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-melanoma skin cancers represent the most common type of cancer in the United States with&#xD;
      cutaneous SCC comprising 20% of these malignancies. The risk of developing cutaneous SCC is&#xD;
      approximately 10% in a lifetime. This risk increases with age and varies according to the&#xD;
      latitude in which one lives. The incidence rate in the United States is increasing as a&#xD;
      result of multiple factors including altered sun exposure patterns and population aging.&#xD;
      Early detection is critical as the vast majority are cured by definitive localized therapy&#xD;
      with an overall 5-year cure rate of greater than 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the vast majority of cutaneous SCCs are treated surgically with curative intent the&#xD;
      estimated case fatality rate ranges from 1-5% depending on reported study. If regional lymph&#xD;
      nodes are involved a standard treatment approach is lymphadenectomy followed by the&#xD;
      consideration of adjuvant therapy (radiation +/- chemotherapy). However a subset of these&#xD;
      patients ultimately will develop unresectable or distantly metastatic recurrences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unresectable SCC is treated using systemic approaches usually encompassing cytotoxic&#xD;
      chemotherapy. However clinical investigation to determine efficacy of specific agents has&#xD;
      been very limited and not studied in a rigorous fashion. Efficacy data stems largely from&#xD;
      case reports and limited case series and from a very small number of phase II trials. As for&#xD;
      targeted therapies, treatment with cetuximab demonstrated limited activity (RR 11%) in a 36&#xD;
      patient phase II trial. Many oncologists tend to treat with platinum agents, taxanes and 5-FU&#xD;
      based regimens. However no standard exists. As such there is a need to explore more&#xD;
      systematically the efficacy of specific chemotherapeutic agents with the goal of developing a&#xD;
      standard treatment approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nab-paclitaxel is an intriguing option to use for treatment given demonstrated efficacy in&#xD;
      other malignancies with SCC histology. In clinical practice many oncologists use paclitaxel&#xD;
      despite the lack of rigorous clinical investigation. The use of paclitaxel is limited by&#xD;
      toxicities associated with the solvent Cermaphor EL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nab-paclitaxel is an albumin bound form of paclitaxel. In other malignancies such as breast&#xD;
      cancer nab-paclitaxel is associated with improved response rates and time to progression&#xD;
      relative to paclitaxel. Nab-paclitaxel based chemotherapy has demonstrated efficacy in other&#xD;
      malignancies with SCC histology including head and neck carcinoma and NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine), also known as osteonectin and BM-40, is&#xD;
      a 43kD secreted extracellular matrix glycoprotein first identified in 1984 and noted to have&#xD;
      high binding affinity for albumin. SPARC further affects angiogenesis by interacting with&#xD;
      growth factors such as VEGF and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). It binds with platelet&#xD;
      derived growth factor (PDGF) inhibiting binding to its receptors. SPARC interacts with bFGF&#xD;
      and inhibits the migration of endothelial cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overexpression of SPARC has been found in many tumor types including breast, melanoma, brain,&#xD;
      colon, skin and several others and is associated with increased tumor invasion and&#xD;
      metastasis. For example, in melanoma SPARC expression is clinically correlated with&#xD;
      aggressiveness and metastatic phenotypes. In melanoma models SPARC is associated with&#xD;
      decreased E-cadherin and increased N-cadherin expression, suggesting that it may regulate&#xD;
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the earlier stages of malignant transformation. SPARC&#xD;
      expression has also been associated with increased breast cancer cell invasiveness. The&#xD;
      absence of SPARC has been shown to suppress the development of UV-induced squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma in a mouse model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another tumor promoting mechanism of SPARC is in its interaction with inflammation. There is&#xD;
      evidence that SPARC may play a role in dampening the immune response to tumor cells. Melanoma&#xD;
      cells lacking SPARC expression induced neutrophil recruitment, increased chemotactic factors&#xD;
      such as IL-8, GRO, and leukotrienes and resulted in tumor cell rejection. This observation&#xD;
      decreased neutrophil recruitment in the presence of SPARC has also been noted in other models&#xD;
      including SPARC null versus wild type mice. SPARC may regulate the apoptotic pathway of&#xD;
      neutrophils involving Fas ligand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPARC is able to affect tumor progression at several levels. It plays a role in&#xD;
      epithelial-mesenchymal transformation. It promotes tumor growth and metastasis by inhibiting&#xD;
      immune surveillance and promoting angiogenesis and it is correlated with metastatic cell&#xD;
      aggressiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overexpression of SPARC in many tumors and the tumor microenvironment and its high&#xD;
      binding affinity for albumin make an albumin-bound drug delivery attractive. Via the gp60 and&#xD;
      caveolae-mediated albumin transport pathway albumin is transported from the blood vessel into&#xD;
      the tumor. Albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) was approved by the FDA in January 2005&#xD;
      for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Nab-paclitaxel takes advantage of this&#xD;
      transport carrying paclitaxel into tumor cells. There it may be preferentially retained in&#xD;
      tissues overexpressing SPARC. SPARC has been shown to be overexpressed in squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinomas of the head and neck (61%, versus 0% in normal head and neck tissue).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of intra-arterial nab-paclitaxel has been examined in locally advanced squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma of the head and neck with response rates of 75-78%. A retrospective analysis showed&#xD;
      that SPARC upregulation in the tumor tissue was associated with increased response in 16&#xD;
      patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who received intra-arterial&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single arm phase II study assessing the efficacy of treatment with nab-paclitaxel&#xD;
      (abraxane) administered weekly (days 1,8, and 15 of 28 day cycle) to patients with&#xD;
      unresectable locoregional or distantly metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). A&#xD;
      Simon 2 stage design will be used. If no responses are seen in the first 12 patients it will&#xD;
      be concluded that the response rate is no greater than 3% and the trial will be stopped for&#xD;
      futility at the end of stage one. Otherwise the trial will enroll 9 more patients for a total&#xD;
      of 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the development of unresectable locally advanced or distantly metastatic&#xD;
      cutaneous SCC confers a very poor prognosis. While various types of systemic therapy are used&#xD;
      by oncologists choices are based on anecdotal experiences and a limited number of case series&#xD;
      and small phase II studies. Nab-paclitaxel has demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity&#xD;
      in several malignancies of SCC morphology. Taxanes are often used as systemic treatment for&#xD;
      unresectable cutaneous SCC. This study will allow for prospective evaluation of the activity&#xD;
      of abraxane as first line systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy (a defined line of cytotoxic&#xD;
      therapy) in the treatment of advanced SCC. The hypothesis of this phase II study is that&#xD;
      abraxane will demonstrate significant anti-tumor activity a defined by a primary endpoint of&#xD;
      best overall response rate. It is hypothesized that increased SPARC expression will correlate&#xD;
      with response to nab-paclitaxel treatment and serve as a biomarker for treatment response.&#xD;
