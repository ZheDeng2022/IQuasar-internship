      This study involves a drug called Exparel that has been approved by the US Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA), for application directly to wound sites. EXPAREL® is a long acting pain&#xD;
      reliever. It is being given in this study to see if it provides safe and effective pain&#xD;
      relief after ankle surgery. Because it is a long acting drug, it may lessen pain relief for&#xD;
      as much as 72 hours after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPAREL® has not been approved by the FDA for administration by popliteal block, which is the&#xD;
      method the study doctors will use to give the patients the drug. Giving the drug by popliteal&#xD;
      block involves inserting a small tube in to the back of the knee to deliver the drug. The&#xD;
      study doctors wish to determine if patients undergoing ankle surgery and receiving this drug&#xD;
      have less pain and less need for narcotic medication.&#xD;

      Managing postoperative pain remains a paramount topic in anesthesiology, since a significant&#xD;
      amount of patients continue to report discomfort after their inpatient and outpatient&#xD;
      surgeries. Orthopedic lower limb surgeries are known to induce prolonged pain after the&#xD;
      procedure requiring the increased use of multi-modal analgesia. Popliteal fossa nerve block&#xD;
      targeting the sciatic nerve has been utilized to effectively control postoperative pain and&#xD;
      to lower opioid requirements for patients undergoing foot and ankle surgeries.The sciatic&#xD;
      nerve divides into its tibial and common fibula branches approximately 4 to 13 centimeters&#xD;
      above the popliteal crease. The tibial nerve innervates the heel and the plantar aspect of&#xD;
      the foot, while the common fibula nerve, also known as the common peroneal nerve, supplies&#xD;
      the lateral aspect of the leg and the dorsum of the foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bupivacaine, a local anesthetic and analgesic, is currently used as an agent to address&#xD;
      postsurgical analgesia. However, administering a large dose of bupivacaine for nerve blockade&#xD;
      has been reported to lead to complications such as infection, hematoma, vascular puncture,&#xD;
      toxicity and, even severe systemic side effects. EXPAREL® (multi-vesicular liposomal&#xD;
      bupivacaine) is a multi-vesicular liposomal form (DepoFoam drug delivery systems) of&#xD;
      encapsulated bupivacaine that allows for the slow diffusion of the drug over an extended&#xD;
      period of time of 72 hours, versus the 8 hour duration of Bupivacaine Hydrogen Chloride&#xD;
      (HCl). EXPAREL® has been shown to provide successful prolonged analgesia after wound&#xD;
      infiltration during several surgical procedures.In addition to the long lasting pain relief,&#xD;
      studies also highlight the improved clinical outcomes of patients and lower economic costs&#xD;
      associated with liposomal bupivacaine when compared to bupivacaine Hydrogen chloride.&#xD;
      However, studies evaluating the use of EXPAREL® for nerve blocks are limited. Richard et. al.&#xD;
      demonstrated the safety of EXPAREL® to Bupivacaine and saline on the brachial plexus of dogs&#xD;
      and rabbits revealing no irritation or tissue damage even at high doses. Furthermore, after&#xD;
      administering liposomal bupivacaine via single epidural injections into humans, Viscussi et.&#xD;
      al. reported longer sensory blockade and shorter motor blockade compared to bupivacaine HCl,&#xD;
      enabling quicker recovery and mobility for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this study is to (1) evaluate the efficacy of the study drug&#xD;
      EXPAREL® with respect to the safety and duration of the postoperative analgesic effect on&#xD;
      five subjects following single dose injection via a popliteal nerve block. Based on the data&#xD;
      analysis from this case series, a decision will be made as to whether a large randomized,&#xD;
      double-blinded, prospective study is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Materials The purpose of the popliteal nerve block with the use of EXPAREL® will&#xD;
      be explained to the potential subject. Demographic information will be obtained including&#xD;
      age, gender, past medical history, past surgical history, hospitalizations, current&#xD;
      medications, allergies, and history of drug and alcohol abuse. Preoperative baseline pain&#xD;
      score, motor strength and sensation will be documented by a study team member, prior to&#xD;
      carrying out study procedures. The Visual Acuity Scale (VAS) will be explained to the&#xD;
      patient. A Semmes Weinstein monofilament exam with a size 5.07 monofilament will be performed&#xD;
      to rule out any occult nerve injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of surgery all eligible subjects will receive a single dose of study drug EXPAREL®&#xD;
      1.3% 20 ml (266mg) will be administered within 1 hour prior to the surgical procedure as a&#xD;
      popliteal nerve block. This block will be done by a trained anesthesiologist, using an&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided technique (Mindray model # M-7). Prior to induction of anesthesia, standard&#xD;
      monitoring devices such as non-invasive blood pressure, EKG and pulse oximetry for oxygen&#xD;
      saturation will be started. Bispectral Index (BIS) will be maintained in a range of 30-60.&#xD;
      Continuous vital sign monitoring will be done intraoperatively. All patients will be&#xD;
      administered midazolam 0.5 mg to 4 mg/kg to achieve anxiolysis. Induction of anesthesia will&#xD;
      also include Lidocaine 1.5mg/kg, Propofol 1.5-3 mg/kg, Fentanyl 1-2mcg/kg. If indicated the&#xD;
      muscle relaxant of the anesthesiologists choice: either Succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg, Rocuronium&#xD;
      0.6mg/kg or Nimbex 0.2mg/kg to titrate Train of Four (TOF) at 1-2 twitches until 30 minutes&#xD;
      prior to the end of the surgical procedure. Anesthestic maintenance with 0.8 to 1.5 Minimum&#xD;
      Alveolar Concentration (MAC) of sevoflurane as indicated by end tidal concentration in oxygen&#xD;
      and air mixture of 50% each and fraction of inspired oxygen ( FiO2) may be increased if&#xD;
      oxygen saturation is less than 96%. The use of fentanyl will be permitted during surgery.&#xD;
      However, intraoperative administration of any other narcotics or analgesics (including&#xD;
      intrathecal opioids), local anesthetics, or anti-inflammatory agents is prohibited, unless&#xD;
      needed to treat an adverse even (AE). The amount of fentanyl used will be recorded.&#xD;
      Ondansetron0.1mg/kg will be used as an antiemetic prior to reversal of muscle relaxant with&#xD;
      neostigmine and glycopyrrolate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon extubation, the patient will be transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). At&#xD;
      this time quality of the regional block will be assessed. Motor strength will be rated as&#xD;
      follows: 2=no voluntary movement, 1=some muscle weakness and 0=no muscle weakness. The&#xD;
      sensory block (cold test) will be evaluated by the following criteria: 2=no sensation,&#xD;
      1=decreased sensation and 0=normal sensation. All blocks rated as 0 for both sensory and&#xD;
      motor testing, will be considered failed blocks and will be excluded from the data collection&#xD;
      for the remainder of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive rescue medication upon request for pain control whether they remain&#xD;
      in the data collection or not. Patients will be treated with intravenous Hydromorphone 0.5mg&#xD;
      for a pain score ≥ 4 out of 10 on the VAS scale for a maximum of 2 divided doses. Vital signs&#xD;
      (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and pulse oxymetry) will be continuously&#xD;
      monitored in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) and recorded as to the standard protocol&#xD;
      that is every 5 minutes for the first 15 minutes, 15 minute intervals for the next hour and&#xD;
      then every 30 minutes until discharge. Pain score and sedation scores will be obtained using&#xD;
      the VAS and Ramsay sedation scale, respectively. All pain scores will be assessed with&#xD;
      patient in the resting position. No patient will be discharged from the PACU with a VAS &gt;than&#xD;
      4 out of 10. If this cannot be achieved with the rescue medication indicated above the&#xD;
      patient will be started on Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA). PCA orders are as follows&#xD;
      Hydromorphone 0.02mg every 6 minutes, no basal rate, and no four-hour maximum. Neurological&#xD;
      and sensory assessment will be assessed on arrival, at 60 minutes and at 120 minutes. Those&#xD;
      parameters assessed will include numbness of tongue, lips and mouth, metallic taste, problems&#xD;
      with hearing or vision, muscle twitching and does the subject feel cold in the innervated&#xD;
      dermatomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time to discharge readiness from PACU will be documented. After PACU discharge oxycodone&#xD;
      5mg/325mg acetaminophen 1 or 2 tablets every 6 hours will be offered for breakthrough pain.&#xD;
      The doses and timing of all pain medications will be recorded while hospitalized and the&#xD;
      subject's will be provided a diary to record pain and medication taken at home. The research&#xD;
      coordinator will follow-up with the patients on post-operative days for those who have been&#xD;
      discharged to home, in order to ensure that questionnaires and diaries are completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On POD 1, POD 2 and POD 3, a pain questionnaire will be completed addressing the quality of&#xD;
      postoperative pain relief, pain scale, and incidence and severity of any side effects,&#xD;
      including palpitations, nausea, vomiting as well as burning, numbness, tingling, and rebound&#xD;
      pain. Peripheral neuropathy sequelae will be assessed subjectively via the questionnaire. The&#xD;
      subject will also be evaluated for amount of pain medication required and any opioid side&#xD;
      effects will be documented. On POD 3 the subject will be asked to provide an overall opinion&#xD;
      of the pain control using a 5-point Likert scale.&#xD;
