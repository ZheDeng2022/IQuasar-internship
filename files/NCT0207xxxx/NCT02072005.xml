  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to conduct a 9-patient feasibility and acceptability study&#xD;
      of mSMART (with future studies focusing on improved medication adherence). The sample will&#xD;
      include daily smokers who are already taking a prescribed medication. There will be no change&#xD;
      in any medication regimen in this study, and the sample will include smokers either with or&#xD;
      without a psychiatric disorder. Subjects will be asked to use a smartphone application, or&#xD;
      &quot;app&quot; (i.e. mSMART) that will provide information about their medication and when to take it.&#xD;
      Along with smart phone, the participants will be asked to utilize an electronic pillbox (i.e.&#xD;
      GlowCap) to further assist with medication compliance.&#xD;

      Subjects will be 9 nicotine dependent male and female smokers who take at least one&#xD;
      prescribed medication regularly. This sample will allow for psychiatric comorbidity, though&#xD;
      is not required. They will be asked to carry a smartphone for 7 days and use a smartphone&#xD;
      application, also called an &quot;app,&quot; (i.e. mSMART) that will provide information about their&#xD;
      medication and when to take it. Along with smart phone, the participants will be asked to&#xD;
      utilize an electronic pillbox (i.e. GlowCap) to further assist with medication compliance.&#xD;
      The study consists of a Screening Visit (~4Â½ hours), Training Visit (~1 hour), and 1&#xD;
      Follow-Up Session (~2 hours). Post the Training visit, subjects will then complete the week&#xD;
      observation period. During that time, subjects will complete experimenter-prompted&#xD;
      assessments to assess factors that may interfere with medication adherence (e.g., psychiatric&#xD;
      symptoms, such as forgetfulness). As part of the 'app', reminders will be sent to subjects to&#xD;
      take their medication (e.g., the reminders will be programmed to accommodate multiple times a&#xD;
      day dosing within dosage schedule windows). Subjects will also be provided with an electronic&#xD;
      pillbox that will dispense the subject's medication over the 7 day observation period. After&#xD;
      the 7 day period, subjects will return the smartphone at the follow-up visit. Primary outcome&#xD;
      variable measured will be medication adherence as an indicator of feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of the mSMART app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an observational study since participants will already be taking a medication&#xD;
      prescribed by their own physician. The sample is a non-treatment seeking sample of adult&#xD;
      cigarette smokers. Participants will not be asked to modify their smoking behavior or&#xD;
      medication use in any way. Participants will receive two devices (i.e., [1] the smartphone&#xD;
      with mSMART and [2] GlowCap) over the seven day observation period of smoking behavior and&#xD;
      medication adherence. The ultimate goal of mSMART is to assist with medication adherence and&#xD;
      is thus an intervention, although the goal of this study is to assess how acceptable and&#xD;
      feasible it is in a sample already adherent to their medications. We do not predict any&#xD;
      changes in smoking behavior or medication adherence once participants are provided with&#xD;
      mSMART or GlowCap. GlowCap is being used to allow the investigators to measure times at which&#xD;
      the medications were taken.&#xD;

        Participants will be 15 adult, nicotine dependent smokers for a target completion sample of&#xD;
        9. Subjects will be allowed to meet criteria for a current comorbid psychiatric disorder&#xD;
        (e.g., Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder [ADHD], Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder,&#xD;
        Major Depressive Disorder), though non-psychiatric smokers will be included as well.&#xD;
        Participants will be taking some form of prescribed psychiatric medication or nicotine&#xD;
        replacement therapy in pill form.&#xD;
