      Dose escalation part: to determine the highest dose of alpelisib administered on a daily&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose/recommended dose&#xD;
      for expansion (MTD/RDE) of alpelisib in combination with everolimus, and of alpelisib in&#xD;
      combination with everolimus and exemestane, and additionally to describe safety, preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy and the magnitude of the alpelisib-everolimus interaction. The study was conducted&#xD;
      in patients with metastatic and/or recurrent solid tumors including renal cell carcinoma&#xD;
      (RCC), pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET), and advanced solid tumors previously treated&#xD;
      with an mTOR inhibitor, to evaluate everolimus and alpelisib, and in postmenopausal females&#xD;
      with HR-positive HER2-negative advanced breast cancer to evaluate everolimus, alpelisib and&#xD;
      exemestane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a Phase Ib, open-label, multi-center, dose-finding study. The initial dose level of&#xD;
      alpelisib was 300 mg every day (qd) and everolimus was initially administered at 2.5 mg qd.&#xD;
      The dose-finding study (escalation phase) was followed by an expansion phase where safety and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of the doublet (alpelisib and everolimus) as well as of the triplet&#xD;
      (alpelisib, everolimus and exemestane) were assessed in selected subject populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alpelisib, everolimus and exemestane were administered orally once daily on a continuous&#xD;
      dosing schedule and dosed on a flat-fixed dose and not by body weight or body surface area,&#xD;
      starting on Day 1 in a 28-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the doublet escalation phase, alpelisib was administered at 300 mg or 250 mg in&#xD;
      combination with 2.5 mg everolimus. In the triplet escalation phase, alpelisib was&#xD;
      administered at 200 mg in combination with 2.5 mg everolimus and 25 mg exemestane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the doublet expansion phase, alpelisib was administered at 250 mg in combination with 2.5&#xD;
      mg everolimus. In the breast cancer expansion phase, alpelisib was administered at 200 mg in&#xD;
      combination with 2.5 mg everolimus and 25 mg exemestane or alpelisib was administered at 250&#xD;
      mg in combination with 25 mg exemestane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No fixed treatment duration was specified. Patients in the study were planned to receive the&#xD;
      treatment until disease progression (assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
      (RECIST v1.1)), unacceptable toxicity, death, or discontinuation from study treatment for any&#xD;
      other reason.&#xD;

    <description>To determine the MTD and/or RDE of alpelisib in combination with everolimus, and the MTD and/or RDE of alpelisib in combination with everolimus and exemestane.&#xD;
A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is an adverse event or abnormal laboratory value assessed as being unrelated to disease, disease progression, inter-current illness, or concomitant medications, and that occurs within the first 35 days of treatment with alpelisib plus everolimus or alpelisib plus everolimus plus exemestane and meets any of the pre-defined criteria.</description>
