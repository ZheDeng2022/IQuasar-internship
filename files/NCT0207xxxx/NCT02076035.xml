      It is still unknown the pathogenesis of low back pain and a lot of hypothesis were discussed&#xD;
      for a long time. Because non-invasive imaging modalities greatly underestimate the prevalence&#xD;
      of epidural pathogenesis an endoscopic examination of the epidural space has been advocated&#xD;
      as both a diagnostic and therapeutic modality. It seems that immune-inflammatory factors play&#xD;
      a more substantial role in pain status. Myeloscopic investigation have shown how&#xD;
      morphological pictures of the epidural area in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) are&#xD;
      much more complex and heterogeneous than what can be identified with traditional&#xD;
      investigation suggesting a biochemical involvement. Endoscopy of the epidural space&#xD;
      (epiduroscopy) is a minimally invasive technique, used to directly visualize pathological&#xD;
      features inside of the lumbar spinal canal to locate tissues responsible of eliciting pain&#xD;
      and the presence of any pathological structures within the vertebral channel, such as fibrous&#xD;
      adherences, inflammatory processes, severe fibrosis and/or stenoses, in order to realize an&#xD;
      effective therapeutic approach in a lot of different CLBP status as those due to spinal&#xD;
      stenoses or failed back surgery syndrome. To deepen the molecular causes of interindividual&#xD;
      variability of epiduroscopy outcomes in terms of decrease of pain, it is useful to analyze&#xD;
      the DNA variants encoding IL6 and IL1 cytokines and to relate them with gene expression&#xD;
      levels and with the cytokine dosage. By this technique, it is possible to analyze in the&#xD;
      biopsy of the epidural tissue the specific expression of the cytokines: there is already&#xD;
      evidence that inflammatory factors may be involved in the genesis of LBP. At this regards, it&#xD;
      would be really important to compare systemic cytokine levels before the epiduroscopy with&#xD;
      those detected immediately post procedure and after one month, to understand if the cytokines&#xD;
      could play a key role and be a biomarker of the epiduroscopy outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning DNA polymorphisms, it has been demonstrated, in many disease-state meta-analyses,&#xD;
      that the IL6 variant rs1800795 affect gene transcription and influences the IL-6 levels.&#xD;
      Moreover, interleukin 1 (IL-1) is a major factor controlling the inflammatory response. The&#xD;
      IL-1 gene family includes the IL-1α, IL-1β and the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) genes&#xD;
      that mediate immune and inflammatory responses. SNPs in IL-1α, IL-1β and IL1Ra modify bone&#xD;
      mineral density promoting intervertebral disc disease (IDD). The simultaneous carriage of the&#xD;
      IL-1bT3954 and the IL-1Ra A1812 alleles significantly enhances the risk of low back pain&#xD;
      (LBP) occurrence, the number of days with pain, and the number of days with limitations in&#xD;
      daily activities due to pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study suggested that methylation status of a single CpG site in the IL6 promoter is&#xD;
      related to IL6 messenger RNA levels and that lower methylation contributes to the risk of&#xD;
      developing Rheumatoid Arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will try to identify if it there is a correlation with success of the&#xD;
      epiduroscopy approach in terms of freedom from pain with genic expression and cytokine&#xD;
      dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the investifators will compare the cytokine gene expression and the DNA methylation&#xD;
      status of IL6 promoter in patients with favorable outcome and in no responders, to study the&#xD;
      role in gene expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is addressed to detect if the genetic variability might be used in near future in&#xD;
      clinical setting, to predict the success of epiduroscopy.&#xD;

      locate tissues responsible of eliciting pain and realize an effective therapeutic approach in&#xD;
      a lot of different CLBP status as those due to spinal stenoses or failed back surgery&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimally invasive endoscopic exploration of the lumbar epidural cavity in patients suffering&#xD;
      from chronic low back pain has been used to identify the presence of any pathological&#xD;
      structures within the vertebral channel, such as fibrous adherences, inflammatory processes,&#xD;
      severe fibrosis and/or stenosis. The need to visually inspect the epidural space originally&#xD;
      arose as conventional imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has been shown to be&#xD;
      significantly less sensitive in identifying epidural pathology compared with direct&#xD;
      visualization. In a cohort of failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) patients, 80% of those&#xD;
      having severe epidural fibrosis diagnosed with epiduroscopy had a normal MRI examination.&#xD;
      More, when used to identify the exact spinal level of painful pathology, neither clinical&#xD;
      examination nor MRI evaluation strongly correlated with the endoscopy findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of a disposable and easily steerable small video-guide, high-resolution&#xD;
      optics and specifically designed tools such as mechanical dissectors, electric knife and&#xD;
      graspers, makes this technique as a valid option to diagnose and treat epidural pathology in&#xD;
      the lumbar region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To deepen the molecular causes of interindividual variability of epiduroscopy outcomes in&#xD;
      terms of decrease of pain, it is useful to analyze the DNA variants encoding IL6 and IL1&#xD;
      cytokines and to relate them with gene expression levels and with the cytokine dosage. By&#xD;
      this technique, it is possible to collect a biopsy of the epidural tissue (usually performed&#xD;
      during epiduroscopy) analyzing the specific expression of the cytokines: there is already&#xD;
      evidence that inflammatory factors may be involved in the genesis of LBP. At this regards, it&#xD;
      would be really important to compare systemic cytokine levels before the epiduroscopy with&#xD;
      those detected immediately post procedure and after one month, to understand if the cytokines&#xD;
      could play a key role and be a biomarker of the epiduroscopy outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning DNA polymorphisms, it has been demonstrated, in many disease-state meta-analyses&#xD;
      that the IL6 variant rs1800795 affect IL6 gene transcription and influences the IL-6 levels&#xD;
      ensuring the statistical robustness of the associations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, interleukin 1 (IL-1) is a major factor controlling the inflammatory response. The&#xD;
      IL-1 gene family includes the IL-1α, IL-1β and the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) genes&#xD;
      that mediate immune and inflammatory responses. The IL-1Ra molecule has been shown to be a&#xD;
      powerful anti-inflammatory agent inhibiting the activities of IL-1 α and IL-1β. Moreover,&#xD;
      SNPs in IL-1α, IL-1β and IL1Ra modify bone mineral density promoting intervertebral disc&#xD;
      disease (IDD). Literature data showed that the simultaneous carriage of the IL-1bT3954 and&#xD;
      the IL-1Ra A1812 alleles significantly enhances the risk of low back pain (LBP) occurrence,&#xD;
      the number of days with pain, and the number of days with limitations in daily activities due&#xD;
      to pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will try to identify if it there is a correlation with success of the&#xD;
      epiduroscopy approach in terms of freedom from pain with genetic and cytokine expression&#xD;
      patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the investigators will compare the cytokine gene expression and the DNA methylation&#xD;
      status of IL6 promoter in patients with favorable outcome and in no responders, to study its&#xD;
      role in gene expression. In fact, a recent study suggested for the first time that&#xD;
      methylation status of a single CpG site in the IL6 promoter is related to IL6 messenger RNA&#xD;
      levels and that lower methylation contributes to the risk of developing Rheumatoid Arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is addressed to detect if the genetic variability might be used in near future in&#xD;
      clinical setting, to predict the success of epiduroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this study consists in identifying whether a particular genotype associated&#xD;
      with inflammation is able to detect which patients will have a positive epiduroscopy outcome,&#xD;
      in terms of decrease of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve it, the investigators will investigate the frequency of some IL1 and IL6 gene&#xD;
      polymorphisms: we will analyze and compare IL1β, IL1Ra, IL6 and IFNγ blood cells gene&#xD;
      expression (before, immediately post the epiduroscopy and after one month) with that obtained&#xD;
      by epiduroscopy biopsy cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also measure IL1β, IL1Ra, IL6 and IFNγ levels from patient serum&#xD;
      before the epiduroscopy, immediately post the procedure and after 1 month.&#xD;
