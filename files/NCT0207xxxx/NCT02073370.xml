  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia related mobility dysfunction was a preventable presentation in transitional&#xD;
      variation of frailty. However, the definition, associated risk factors, clinical course and&#xD;
      outcome of sarcopenia in Taiwanese older adults are still under-clarified and need for&#xD;
      further study.&#xD;
