    <textblock>
      To evaluate treatment tolerability, adherence and quality of life (QoL) over 1 year in MS&#xD;
      (Multiple Sclerosis) participants who have been switched - due to persistent tolerability&#xD;
      issues, particularly injection problems - from a subcutaneous injectable disease-modifying&#xD;
      treatment (DMT) given several times a week (Rebif, Betaferon or Copaxone) to once weekly&#xD;
      Avonex 30 μg given intra-muscularly. Avonex will be applied by the injection device Avonex&#xD;
      Pen.&#xD;
