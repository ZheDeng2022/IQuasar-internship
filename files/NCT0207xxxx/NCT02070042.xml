  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to evaluate whether the addition of Omega-3 fatty acids to oxybutynin, a standard&#xD;
      first-line treatment for overactive bladder syndrome, will improve symptoms and quality of&#xD;
      life. Secondarily, we will evaluate whether Omega-3 fatty acids help reduce the adverse&#xD;
      effects of oxybutynin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary: Omega-3 will enhance the beneficial role of oxybutynin in the treatment of&#xD;
           overactive bladder (OAB)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary: Omega-3 will reduce the side effects of dry eyes and constipation associated&#xD;
           with oxybutynin&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder (OAB) is a troubling condition affecting over 17 million people in the&#xD;
      U.S. with an estimated prevalence of 16.9% among women. The cost of this burden nationally&#xD;
      was estimated at $66 billion in 2007. The morbidity of the disease impacts quality of life&#xD;
      scores and increases risks of falls and fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First-line therapeutic modalities for OAB focus on anticholinergic medications and behavioral&#xD;
      modification. However, the indirect impact of these medications on the gut and salivary&#xD;
      glands, have been troubling. Resultant side effect profiles with anticholinergic medications&#xD;
      have caused a high rate of cessation, with some studies showing as low as 14% of patients&#xD;
      still taking their medication at a one-year follow up. Given the burden and morbidity&#xD;
      associated with this highly prevalent condition among women, our aim is to improve our&#xD;
      therapeutic options, while possibly reducing subsequent side effects. As such, there is&#xD;
      potential to revolutionize treatment for this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Omega-3 fatty acids have been evaluated with success in treating many medical conditions.&#xD;
      Specifically, diseases with an inflammatory component, such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis, and rheumatoid arthritis have seen promising improvements with the addition of&#xD;
      Omega-3 fatty acids. Other studies have shown a beneficial role in the treatment of dry eyes,&#xD;
      depression, burn injuries, and even cancer. Although not previously explored in the setting&#xD;
      of irritative bladder conditions, we believe that Omega-3 fatty acids may be helpful in&#xD;
      interventions for OAB via several purported mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and inflammation have both been implicated in the biochemistry of&#xD;
      overactive bladder. Reduction in PGE2 may be paramount in reducing the symptoms of overactive&#xD;
      bladder. In fact, a proposed mechanism of action of the success of anticholinergic&#xD;
      medications, commonly first line treatment for OAB, is reduction of PGE2. Animal models have&#xD;
      demonstrated that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be used to decrease&#xD;
      micturition frequency, which is thought to be a result of the anti-inflammatory process. In&#xD;
      humans, anti-inflammatory medications have been shown to decrease nocturia and even cause&#xD;
      urinary retention in high doses. Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to have&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory actions and the ability to reduce PGE2. We therefore, have reason to&#xD;
      believe it may be an effective adjunct to current therapy to improve overactive bladder&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, Omega-3 fatty acids have been implemented in the treatment of dry eyes and&#xD;
      animal studies have shown their role in increasing intestinal motility.Hence, we propose that&#xD;
      Omega-3 fatty acids may help alleviate the common side effects of dry eyes and constipation&#xD;
      associated with common anticholinergic therapies.&#xD;
