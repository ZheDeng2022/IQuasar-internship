  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our research is part of the global effort to develop a vaccine against HIV. We aim to develop&#xD;
      a non-invasive, needle-free 'transcutaneous' vaccine. It will be a water-based solution which&#xD;
      is placed on the surface of the skin of the upper arm, after the hairs have been stripped&#xD;
      away. The active component of the vaccine - DNA which contains genes derived from the virus -&#xD;
      will enter through the hair follicles from which the hair has been stripped. The DNA will get&#xD;
      into cells, which will use the HIV genes to make copies of virus proteins. These proteins&#xD;
      will stimulate the body's immune system and, we hope, make it able to protect against HIV&#xD;
      infection. The research is to assess the safety of this approach, and how good it is at&#xD;
      stimulating the immune system. We will combine the 'transcutaneous' vaccine with an&#xD;
      'intramuscular' version which is injected into the muscle of the thigh, and compare this&#xD;
      combination with: intramuscular plus 'intradermal' (injection into the skin); and&#xD;
      intramuscular with added 'electroporation' - use of a pulse of electricity to increase uptake&#xD;
      of DNA vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will invite healthy men and women to take part in this research. Volunteers will first be&#xD;
      assessed to ensure they are eligible to participate. A total of 30 will be enrolled and each&#xD;
      will receive three vaccinations over the course of 12 weeks. We will assess the effects of&#xD;
      the vaccinations by recording any symptoms experienced by the volunteers, and by analysing&#xD;
      samples of their blood. The research will take place at the St Mary's Hospital campus of&#xD;
      Imperial College London, UK. The DNA component of the vaccine is an experimental substance,&#xD;
      so we will monitor very closely the wellbeing of the men and women who participate in the&#xD;
      research.&#xD;

      CUTHIVAC 001 is a randomised Phase I study aimed at exploring the safety and immunogenicity&#xD;
      of different modes of delivery of a GTU® DNA plasmid vaccine (GTU®-multiHIV B clade) in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers. Within the study Transcutaneous (TC) delivery and intramuscular (IM)&#xD;
      delivery with electroporation will be compared to more conventional intradermal (ID) and&#xD;
      intramuscular (IM) routes. The investigational HIV-1 vaccine GTU®-MultiHIV B clade encodes&#xD;
      for a MultiHIV antigen which is a synthetic fusion protein consisting of full-length&#xD;
      polypeptides of Rev, Nef, Tat, p17 and p24 and containing more than 20 Th and CTL epitopes of&#xD;
      protease, reverse transcriptase (RT) and gp160 regions of the HAN2 HIV-1 B clade. 30 healthy&#xD;
      male and female volunteers 18 to 45 years old who are at low risk of HIV infection are to be&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will serve as the reference for the proportion with T-cell responses. Preclinical&#xD;
      data using lower doses suggest that there may also be antibody (Ab) responses.&#xD;
      Electroporation (EP) has been shown to significantly increase the immunogenicity of DNA.&#xD;
      Vaccine is provided in sealed vials at 2.0mg/ml and there are practical limitations on the&#xD;
      volumes that can be administered via each route. To deliver 4mg at each timepoint,&#xD;
      participants will all individuals will be given two IM injections of 2.0mg GTU®-MultiHIV DNA&#xD;
      IM (one into each leg) at each visit. The dose will be given in 1.0ml of sterile PBS injected&#xD;
      into the upper thigh muscle. The maximum volume that can be given ID is 0.1ml per injection,&#xD;
      and therefore the maximum dose that can be administered ID is 0.2ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals in Group 2 will receive 0.2ml by TC, a novel needle-free method of vaccine&#xD;
      delivery which has previously been shown to favour CD8+ T-cell and IgA Ab responses without&#xD;
      compromising overall immunogenicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity in response to three&#xD;
      immunisations with a DNA- GTU® MultiHIV B clade vaccine administered via the ID, TC and IM&#xD;
      routes, with and without electroporation in a variety of combination regimens.&#xD;
