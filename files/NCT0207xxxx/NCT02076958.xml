  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the proposed project is to identify an optimal implementation strategy using a set&#xD;
      of evidence-based interventions that aim to increase early detection of breast, prostate, and&#xD;
      colorectal cancer among African Americans as a model. These three interventions will be&#xD;
      packaged and interwoven into a single branded project, Project HEAL (Health through Early&#xD;
      Awareness and Learning) which will be delivered through trained Community Health Advisors&#xD;
      (CHA) in African-American church settings. The implementation and sustainability will be&#xD;
      evaluated using the RE-AIM Framework. Fourteen African American churches in Prince George's&#xD;
      County, MD will be randomized to a traditional classroom training approach or an online&#xD;
      training approach, in which the CHA training approach and level of technical assistance is&#xD;
      varied (in-person classroom training of CHAs + monitoring/evaluation + technical assistance&#xD;
      and training vs. online training of CHAs + monitoring and evaluation only, respectively). By&#xD;
      varying the training methodology and level of technical assistance, we will be able to&#xD;
      determine what level of technical assistance leads to successful implementation and&#xD;
      sustainability. We will also identify church organizational capacity characteristics that&#xD;
      lead to successful implementation and sustainability. The specific aims of this research are&#xD;
      to: (1) Package the three interventions into a single branded project (Project HEAL), develop&#xD;
      a local cancer screening resource guide, and pilot test the materials and training. (2)&#xD;
      Implement Project HEAL in 14 churches in Prince George's County, Maryland. We will evaluate&#xD;
      the implementation outcomes involving treatment fidelity and identify church organizational&#xD;
      capacity characteristics that led to successful implementation. We will compare the two&#xD;
      implementation strategies (traditional vs. online) to determine the optimal level of&#xD;
      technical assistance necessary for successful implementation. (3) Evaluate the sustainability&#xD;
      of Project HEAL over a two-year period of time. We will identify church organizational&#xD;
      capacity characteristics that led to sustainability, and compare the two implementation&#xD;
      strategies (traditional vs. online) to determine the optimal level of technical assistance&#xD;
      for successful sustainability.&#xD;
