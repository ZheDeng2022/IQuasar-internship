    <textblock>
      This research will serve as a follow-up on the review of Title II commodities performed by&#xD;
      the Food Aid Quality Review at Tufts University in October 2011. The study in Burkina Faso&#xD;
      will test the relative effectiveness and cost effectiveness of four supplementary foods in&#xD;
      the prevention of MAM and stunting in normal programmatic settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the effectiveness of four alternative supplementary food commodities in&#xD;
           preventing stunting and wasting, and promoting linear growth in children 6 - 23 months&#xD;
           in the context of a preventive supplementary feeding program in Burkina Faso.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To estimate the relative cost of implementing the supplementary feeding program using&#xD;
           each commodity&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To estimate the relative cost/effectiveness of implementing the program using each&#xD;
           commodity.&#xD;

      Phase II of FAQR in Burkina Faso will assess the recommended improvements in the four arms of&#xD;
      the study: CSB14 prepared with FVO, RUSF1, CSB+, and SC+.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a cluster-randomized, effectiveness trial. The study will use a mixed&#xD;
      method technique of quantitative and qualitative data collection. The design of the study is&#xD;
      quasi-experimental: food distribution sites (FDPs) (and the communities they serve) will be&#xD;
      grouped into four clusters that are geographically contiguous with each other and&#xD;
      sufficiently distant from each other so that the Beneficiaries are unlikely to have contact&#xD;
      with each other. The four groups of food distribution points will be randomly assigned to one&#xD;
      of four arms, defined by the specific food to be provided:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Corn Soy Blend 14 (CSB14) (with whey protein concentrate and enhanced micronutrient&#xD;
           profile), prepared with fortified vegetable oil (FVO); 75g CSB14/day, 22.5g FVO/day&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ready-to use supplementary food 1 (RUSF1); 100g RUSF/day&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Super Cereal Plus (SC+)( has an enhanced nutrient profile, non-fat dry milk, and oil&#xD;
           already embedded into the CSB); 122g SC+/day&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Corn Soy Blend Plus (CSB+) prepared with FVO; 75g CSB+/day, 22.5g FVO/day The CSB+ arm&#xD;
           will act as a control&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is implemented using the food distribution points providing supplementary&#xD;
      food (CSB14, CSB+, RUSF, SC+) to children once they reach six months of age, and children&#xD;
      from 6 to 23 months. This study will enroll all children as they turn six months of age and&#xD;
      follow them through their 23rd month of age. Variables to be tracked include: age, sex, arm&#xD;
      of study/commodity received ,Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC), height for age, weight for&#xD;
      age, weight for height, month-to-month linear growth and weight gain, incidence of stunting&#xD;
      (height for age below -2 Standard Deviations (SD)), incidence of wasting (weight for height&#xD;
      below - 2 SD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 24 months, children stop receiving supplementary food. The study will continue to monitor&#xD;
      these variables for at least an additional 6 months (through the age of 30 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will collect information on the following additional variables from Beneficiary&#xD;
      Mothers/Caretakers, Health and Nutrition Promoters (HNPs), Community Health Agents (CHAs),&#xD;
      store owners who sell products comparable to those distributed, and PVO staff members.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mothers' knowledge, attitude, and practices with respect to compliance with instructions&#xD;
           about the preparation and use of the supplementary food&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time and money costs to Beneficiary Mothers/Caretakers of participating in the feeding&#xD;
           program&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Household Characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Environmental characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Community characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perceived barriers and factors facilitating Title II program effectiveness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Logistics and cost of procuring, warehousing and distributing the food to the food&#xD;
           distribution point&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Time Points Data collection will be ongoing. It is expected that in order to&#xD;
      reach our sample size, the study will need to enroll children on a rolling basis when they&#xD;
      turn 6 months old for one year. All children will receive a food ration for 18 months, until&#xD;
      they turn 2 years old. During this time period, the study will collect growth measurements&#xD;
      (height, weight, MUAC) on every enrolled child at monthly intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study, qualitative and quantitative data will also be collected from&#xD;
      Beneficiary Mothers/Caretakers, Health and Nutrition Promoters (HNPs), Community Health&#xD;
      Agents (CHAs), and PVO staff members as described above. We will conduct qualitative open&#xD;
      ended interviews with PVO staff members in their professional capacities, to learn of any&#xD;
      challenges or strengths in implementing the procurement and distribution of new commodities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also randomly select a small subsample of Beneficiary Mothers/Caretakers for in-home&#xD;
      observations. The purpose of these observations is to observe aspects of the family's&#xD;
      preparation and consumption of the ration that they would be unlikely to be able to report&#xD;
      during focus groups or individual interviews, because respondents may not be conscious of&#xD;
      their actions. Examples include: giving tastes of the ration to children while it is being&#xD;
      cooked; how quickly the ration is covered after feeding; whether children are able to take&#xD;
      tastes of leftover rations. We would follow a commonly used model of asking families to have&#xD;
      a guest observer stay with them for up to a week during waking hours. The observer would&#xD;
      collect information on these aspects of preparation and consumption methods and on other&#xD;
      observable behavior (e.g. how many times a day the ration is made, whether covered while&#xD;
      cooking, after cooking, after serving).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will collect a small (2 tablespoon) sample of prepared ration from all individually&#xD;
      interviewed Beneficiary Mothers/Caretakers. This will be used for laboratory assessment of&#xD;
      the proportion of FVO in the porridge to validate our estimates of the CSB : Oil ratio as&#xD;
      reported by the mother.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to highlight which food product best prevents stunting and&#xD;
      MAM, in the most cost effective way, thereby ultimately affecting future effective and&#xD;
      efficient policy in food aid programs.&#xD;
