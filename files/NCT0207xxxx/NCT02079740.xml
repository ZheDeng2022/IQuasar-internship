    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of trametinib and navitoclax&#xD;
      and how well they work in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other&#xD;
      places in the body (advanced or metastatic). Trametinib and navitoclax may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the dose-limiting toxicities of trametinib in combination with navitoclax,&#xD;
      and the maximal doses at which both drugs can be safely administered together. (Phase Ib) II.&#xD;
      To determine the response rate of the combination of trametinib and navitoclax in subjects&#xD;
      with KRAS or NRAS mutation-positive advanced or metastatic solid tumors in disease-specific&#xD;
      expansion cohorts. (Phase II) III. To confirm the safety and tolerability of trametinib and&#xD;
      navitoclax in combination at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) determined in the Phase 1b&#xD;
      portion. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the pharmacokinetics of both drugs administered together. (Phase Ib) II. To&#xD;
      assess for evidence of response to therapy. (Phase Ib) III. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      response to therapy in tumor biopsies. (Phase Ib) IV. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      response to therapy in tumor biopsies (first 15 patients enrolled overall). (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive trametinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and navitoclax PO QD on days 1-28.&#xD;
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      If unacceptable toxicity is observed, patients may receive trametinib PO QD on days 1-14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of trametinib and navitoclax on the developing human fetus are unknown.&#xD;
             For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men with a female partner of&#xD;
             child bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception using one of the&#xD;
             methods listed below prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation,&#xD;
             and up to 4 months following completion of therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence from sexual intercourse (minimum one complete menstrual cycle&#xD;
                  prior to study drug administration)&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Hormonal contraceptives (oral, parenteral, transdermal or vaginal ring) for at&#xD;
                  least 3 months prior to study drug administration; if the subject is currently&#xD;
                  using a hormonal contraceptive, she should also use a barrier method during this&#xD;
                  study and for 1 month after study completion&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intrauterine device (IUD)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Double-barrier method: male condom plus diaphragm or vaginal cap with spermicide&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Men with a female partner of childbearing potential must have either had a prior&#xD;
                  vasectomy or agree to use effective contraception; additionally, male subjects&#xD;
                  (including those who are vasectomized) whose partners are pregnant or might be&#xD;
                  pregnant must agree to use condoms for the duration of the study and for 4 months&#xD;
                  following completion of therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7&#xD;
             days prior to initiation of treatment; women will be considered not of childbearing&#xD;
             potential if they are surgically sterile (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy)&#xD;
             and/or post-menopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 months); should a woman become&#xD;
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this&#xD;
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately; the potential hazard to&#xD;
             the fetus should be explained to the patient and partner (as applicable)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of another malignancy; exception: patients who have been disease-free for 3&#xD;
             years, or patients with a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer or&#xD;
             any carcinoma in situ and/or patients with indolent second malignancies, are eligible;&#xD;
             consult the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) medical monitor if unsure whether&#xD;
             second malignancies meet the requirements specified above&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any major surgery, extensive radiotherapy (&gt; 15 days of treatment), chemotherapy with&#xD;
             delayed toxicity, biologic therapy, or immunotherapy within 21 days prior to first&#xD;
             dose of study treatment and/or daily or weekly chemotherapy without the potential for&#xD;
             delayed toxicity within 14 days prior to first dose of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of other investigational drugs within 28 days (or five half-lives, whichever is&#xD;
             shorter; with a minimum of 14 days from the last dose) preceding the first dose of&#xD;
             study drug(s) and during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events;&#xD;
             exception: patients with brain metastases will be allowed on study if they have&#xD;
             clinically controlled neurologic symptoms, defined as surgical excision and/or&#xD;
             radiation therapy followed by 21 days of stable neurologic function and no evidence of&#xD;
             central nervous system (CNS) disease progression as determined by computed tomography&#xD;
             (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 21 days prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs&#xD;
             chemically related to trametinib, or excipients or to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), or to&#xD;
             compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to navitoclax&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of a prohibited medication; the following medications or non-drug&#xD;
             therapies are prohibited:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Other anti-cancer therapy while on study treatment; (note: megestrol [Megace] if&#xD;
                  used as an appetite stimulant is allowed)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Concurrent treatment with bisphosphonates is permitted; however, treatment must&#xD;
                  be initiated prior to the first dose of study therapy; prophylactic use of&#xD;
                  bisphosphonates in patients without bone disease is not permitted, except for the&#xD;
                  treatment of osteoporosis&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Because the composition, pharmacokinetics (PK), and metabolism of many herbal&#xD;
                  supplements are unknown, the concurrent use of all herbal supplements is&#xD;
                  prohibited during the study (including, but not limited to, St. John's wort,&#xD;
                  kava, ephedra [ma huang], ginkgo biloba, dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA], yohimbe,&#xD;
                  saw palmetto, or ginseng)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Due to the expected dose-limiting toxicity of thrombocytopenia, the following&#xD;
                  concomitant medications are not allowed during navitoclax administration:&#xD;
                  Warfarin, clopidogrel (plavix), ibuprofen, tirofiban (aggrastat), and other&#xD;
                  anticoagulants, drugs, or herbal supplements that affect platelet function are&#xD;
                  excluded, with the exception of low-dose anticoagulation medications (such as&#xD;
                  heparin) that are used to maintain the patency of a central intravenous catheter;&#xD;
                  aspirin will not be allowed within 7 days prior to the first dose of navitoclax&#xD;
                  or during navitoclax administration; however, subjects who have previously&#xD;
                  received aspirin therapy for thrombosis prevention may resume a low dose (i.e.,&#xD;
                  maximum 100 mg QD) of aspirin if platelet counts are stable (&gt;= 50,000/mm^3)&#xD;
                  through 6 weeks of navitoclax administration; all decisions regarding treatment&#xD;
                  with aspirin therapy will be determined by the investigator in conjunction with&#xD;
                  the medical monitor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Preclinical studies indicate that navitoclax is metabolized by CYP3A4, is a moderate&#xD;
             inhibitor of CYP2C8, and is a strong inhibitor of CYP2C9; therefore, caution should be&#xD;
             exercised when dosing navitoclax concurrently with CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 substrates;&#xD;
             common CYP2C8 substrates include paclitaxel, statins, and glitazones, whereas CYP2C9&#xD;
             substrates include phenytoin and warfarin; when possible, investigators should switch&#xD;
             to alternative medications or monitor the patients closely (particularly in the case&#xD;
             of medications that have a narrow therapeutic window such as warfarin; use of warfarin&#xD;
             is specifically prohibited while on study); CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole and&#xD;
             clarithromycin are not allowed 7 days prior to the first dose of navitoclax or during&#xD;
             navitoclax administration&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to&#xD;
