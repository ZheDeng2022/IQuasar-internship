&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement via the trans-axillary,&#xD;
             subclavian, or direct aortic route&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pregnant or nursing subjects and those who plan pregnancy in the period up to 1 year&#xD;
             following index procedure. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must have a&#xD;
             negative pregnancy test done within 7 days prior to index procedure per site standard&#xD;
             test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with known diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) within 72 hours&#xD;
             preceding the index procedure (according to definition) or AMI &gt; 72 hours preceding&#xD;
             the index procedure and creatine kinase and creatine kinase fraction have not returned&#xD;
             to normal limits at the time of procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who are currently experiencing clinical symptoms consistent with new onset&#xD;

             heparin/bivalirudin, clopidogrel/ticlopidine, nitinol, stainless steel alloy, latex,&#xD;
             and/or contrast sensitivity that cannot be adequately pre-medicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients with a history of a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the&#xD;
             prior 6 months.&#xD;
