    <textblock>
      Purpose: The purpose of this study is 1) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of currently&#xD;
      available multichannel cochlear implant systems for newly implanted adults with an indication&#xD;
      based on open-set sentence recognition that expand criteria currently used by Center for&#xD;
      Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), and 2) to assess the correlation between measures of&#xD;
      speech recognition in candidates for cochlear implants and their utility in predicting&#xD;
      audiologic and quality of life outcomes after implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Adults (â‰¥ 65 years of age) and CMS-eligible as a primary source of medical&#xD;
      insurance coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): Evaluate objective and subjective outcomes of cochlear implantation in&#xD;
      a patient population that does not meet current CMS candidacy criteria.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Informed Consent will be obtained prior to enrollment in the study, and will include an&#xD;
      interview to discuss study expectations, potential risks and benefits and the study&#xD;
      evaluation schedule. The Informed Consent Form may be taken home and reviewed by the&#xD;
      candidate and the candidate will be given the opportunity to ask questions about it and/or&#xD;
      the study prior to signing the form. The candidate will then be given a copy of the signed&#xD;
      Informed Consent Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Informed Consent Forms will include a detailed list of procedures included in the&#xD;
      pre-operative evaluation process. The Informed Consent document will be reviewed and signed&#xD;
      by the relevant parties prior to any study-related evaluation taking place. Testing completed&#xD;
      as part of normal clinical practice, such as the audiogram is acceptable prior to signing the&#xD;
      consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information regarding each participant's hearing history will be collected and may be&#xD;
      obtained from the participant directly or from their medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Preoperative evaluation includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assessment of the candidate's suitability for the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Establishment of baseline data if the candidate proves to be appropriate for study&#xD;
           inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During preoperative testing, the patient will utilize hearing aids that have been verified as&#xD;
      appropriate by the participant's managing audiologist. Clinicians will base the&#xD;
      appropriateness of the hearing aid fitting on the recommendations of the American Academy of&#xD;
      Audiology Task Force (2006). This includes real ear measures to verify accuracy of the&#xD;
      hearing aid settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidacy Assessment will include&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Air conduction thresholds for each ear with insert earphones at 125, 250, 500, 750,&#xD;
           1000, 1500, 2000, 3000,4000, 6000, and 8000 Hertz (Hz) Bone conduction thresholds for&#xD;
           each ear at 125, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 4000Hz&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. AzBio Sentences Test (Quiet) - One complete recorded list at 60 dB(A) presented to the&#xD;
           sound field with the right ear aided, left ear aided, and bilateral aided while using&#xD;
           amplification that has been verified as appropriate by the participant's managing&#xD;
           audiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Measures Speech Perception Testing will include&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Consonant Nucleus Consonant (CNC) Monosyllabic Word Test (Quiet) - One complete recorded&#xD;
           list presented at 60 dB(A) in the conditions of right ear aided, left ear aided,&#xD;
           bilateral aided&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Telephone Testing will be performed using the ear to be implanted pre- implant. City of&#xD;
           New York (CUNY) Sentences will be administered via live voice while the participant&#xD;
           couples the ear to be implanted to his/her hearing aid using settings typical for phone&#xD;
           use by that participant. If the participant is unable to use the phone, the test will&#xD;
           still be administered with the telephone placed over the hearing aid microphone. No&#xD;
           additional assistive listening devices (i.e. handset amplifier) or speaker phone&#xD;
           settings will be used. Stimuli will be presented a single time only and feedback will&#xD;
           not be provided. The examiner will use a conversational level and rate. The participant&#xD;
           will repeat as much of the sentence as possible, guessing when necessary. Sentences will&#xD;
           be scored for number of words repeated correctly and a percent of total words correct&#xD;
           will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Self-Assessment Questionnaires: Patients will be instructed to complete three&#xD;
      questionnaires as they pertain to how they presently hear in everyday listening situations.&#xD;
      These questionnaires will also be administered 6 and 12 months post-activation. :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health Utility Index (HUI3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Short Form-36 with utility transforms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) Form A&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Procedure: The recommended surgical procedure as outlined in the appropriate&#xD;
      surgical manual for the device selected for implantation (provided by the device&#xD;
      manufacturer) will be followed by the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative Procedures will be tailored to the needs of the patient, and will vary&#xD;
      depending on the type of cochlear implant the patient receives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activation should take place 2-4 weeks following surgery, or as soon as the surgeon has&#xD;
      determined that the patient is able to participate in such an appointment and should include&#xD;
      the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Check incision site for signs of irritation or infection. Perform otoscopy. Refer&#xD;
           patient to cochlear implant surgeon if there are concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Check adhesion of the speech processor magnet to ensure appropriateness of magnet&#xD;
           strength. Increase or decrease magnet strength as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform listening check of speech processor microphone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform impedance testing (Telemetry)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recommended mapping parameters are provided to clinicians as defaults to begin with, but&#xD;
           may be modified as needed based upon the recipient's response to sound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scheduled follow up appointments for recipients will vary depending on the recipient's&#xD;
      response to sound, clinic schedule, and distance traveled to the clinic by the recipient. In&#xD;
      addition to device activation, it is recommended the audiologist try to meet with patients&#xD;
      one, three, six, and twelve months post-activation. Formal testing will be performed six and&#xD;
      twelve months post-activation per the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recommended procedures to include in each mapping appointment have been provided to&#xD;
      audiologists and include discussion of experience using the device, clarification of any&#xD;
      questions regarding device use, listening check of speech processor microphone, impedance&#xD;
      telemetry, psychophysical measures,loudness balancing,creation of new speech processor&#xD;
      programs if levels have changed, and informal assessment of speech recognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients should be referred to a speech-language pathologist for formal aural&#xD;
      rehabilitation/training if, at the three month interval he/she demonstrates no open-set&#xD;
      speech recognition of numbers, colors, or sentences; demonstrates difficulty adjusting to the&#xD;
      sound quality of the cochlear implant; if there is a question regarding the presence of&#xD;
      coexisting communication difficulties related to a change in cognitive status rather than&#xD;
      hearing impairment; or if the recipient requests additional rehabilitation and training that&#xD;
      the audiologist is not able to provide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative assessments will be performed at the six and twelve month test intervals and&#xD;
      will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Audiometric Testing to include aided cochlear implant sound field warble tone thresholds&#xD;
           at 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz (if a hearing aid is used, the hearing aid&#xD;
           will be removed and the contralateral ear will be plugged with a foam plug)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Speech Perception Testing will be performed with the CI alone and/or when using the CI +&#xD;
           HA (if patient reports utilizing a hearing aid in the ipsilateral or contralateral ear&#xD;
           at least 4 hours each day). Test will include the CNC Word Test (Quiet) - one complete&#xD;
           list presented at 60 dB(A), and AzBio Sentences in Quiet - one complete list presented&#xD;
           at 60 dB (A). Formal evaluation of performance using the hearing aid alone is not&#xD;
           included in this study. Testing will include measures to evaluate performance when using&#xD;
           the implant alone and when the patient utilizes a hearing aid plus the cochlear implant&#xD;
           if the recipient reports that he/she utilizes a hearing aid (either in the ipsilateral&#xD;
           or contralateral ear) a minimum of 4 hours each day. These measures include&#xD;
           administration of CNC Words and AZ Bio Sentences in the bimodal condition of CI+HA at&#xD;
           the 6 and 12 month post-activation intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Self-Assessment Questionnaires described above will be re-administered six and twelve&#xD;
           months post-activation. Patients will be instructed to complete each questionnaire as it&#xD;
           pertains to how they presently hear in everyday listening situations (e.g. when using&#xD;
           the CI alone or when using the CI + HA if they use a hearing aid with the CI at least 4&#xD;
           hours each day).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Telephone testing as described above but using CI alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinicians will provide participants with traditional rehabilitation, such as orientation to&#xD;
      the device, description of strategies to improve hearing, use of assistive devices and&#xD;
      accessories to improve performance, listening and communicating over the telephone, and&#xD;
      counseling regarding speech recognition outcomes and expectations for performance.&#xD;
      Audiologists will provide written materials regarding sources for independent rehabilitation&#xD;
      and training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISKS AND BENEFITS The pre-specified success criteria for this protocol will be determined&#xD;
      based on sentence recognition performance in the best aided condition. Individual levels of&#xD;
      margin of effectiveness will be assessed based on post-operative scores on CNC Words and AZ&#xD;
      Bio Sentences. A statistically significant improvement in pre- to postoperative performance&#xD;
      (six to twelve months postactivation) on scores in the best aided condition will be based on&#xD;
      the binomial distribution of Thorton and Raffin, 1978 and the binomial distribution model&#xD;
      provided by Spahr et al., 2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks involved within this study include, but are not limited to, the risks associated with&#xD;
      all cochlear implant surgery. It is anticipated that all study participants may permanently&#xD;
      lose any residual hearing in the ear to be implanted. The potential benefits of cochlear&#xD;
      implantation include improvement in the participant's ability to understand speech in quiet&#xD;
      and in noise, with or without lip-reading, and to better detect speech and other&#xD;
      environmental sounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To monitor device safety (reported through adverse events), medical and audiological&#xD;
      observations and procedures, such as adverse device effects and unanticipated adverse device&#xD;
      effects, are to be reported to the center's Institutional Review Board (IRB) and also to the&#xD;
      study coordinating center. Information on all device malfunctions and adverse events will be&#xD;
      obtained from the investigational sites and maintained by event type. The surgeon and&#xD;
      audiologist will complete a postoperative Adverse Event Questionnaire at each postoperative&#xD;
      test interval if any adverse events have taken place. The questions in the adverse event form&#xD;
      elicit information regarding any surgical, medical, and device-related complications for each&#xD;
      study participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse device effects refer to any undesirable clinical or medical occurrence associated&#xD;
      with use of the device or participation in the study. Adverse device effects will be reported&#xD;
      if observed, even if they were acknowledged as risk factors in the Informed Consent Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unanticipated adverse device effects refer to any event not identified above that represents&#xD;
      a serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused&#xD;
      by, or associated with, a device if that effect, problem or death was not previously&#xD;
      identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or&#xD;
      application, or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates&#xD;
      to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators are to inform their respective Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and the study&#xD;
      coordinator immediately if an unanticipated adverse device effect is suspected (no more than&#xD;
      10 working days after the investigator learns of the effect). If the case is determined to be&#xD;
      an unanticipated adverse device effect, the investigator will fill out an Unanticipated&#xD;
      Adverse Device Effect Form. The study coordinator will report the results of an evaluation of&#xD;
      the unanticipated adverse device effect to the FDA and all other reviewing IRBs and&#xD;
      investigators within 10 working days after first receiving notice of the event.&#xD;
