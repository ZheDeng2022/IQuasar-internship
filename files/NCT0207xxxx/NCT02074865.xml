  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main challenge of the ChARLI program is to assess the clinical burden of severe neonatal&#xD;
      and childhood bacterial infections in low-income countries,in particular those caused by&#xD;
      antibiotic resistant bacteria. This program will address both healthcare associated, as well&#xD;
      as community acquired infections. Beside its main challenge, the ChARLI program will also&#xD;
      allow the assessment of the economic burden of these infections, the improvement of their&#xD;
      medical care and then ultimately help to set public health interventions and guide public&#xD;
      health measures necessary to combat bacterial infections and bacterial resistance in&#xD;
      children. It will also lead to set up more basic research investigation to better understand&#xD;
      how pathogenic and epidemic may be the resistant clones in these countries and to experiment&#xD;
      innovative strategies devoted to prevent these infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to achieve these objectives, an international paediatric cohort will be created, and&#xD;
      monitored a platform. This will be done first within the Institut Pasteur International&#xD;
      Network (IPIN) and possibly extended in some others low income countries where the IPIN has&#xD;
      no center. This constituted initiative will represent the first international pediatric&#xD;
      program of its size to be located in low-income countries and specifically focusing severe&#xD;
      bacterial infections and bacterial resistance to antibiotics&#xD;

      At birth, for therapeutic management of the newborns in the presence of a risk factor for&#xD;
      infection :gastric fluid, external auditory canal swabs, anal swabs, placental biopsy. Before&#xD;
      empirical antibiotic treatment: blood cultures, blood sampling for CRP determination.In the&#xD;
      presence of particular warning signs of infection chest X ray and lumbar puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the follow-up, for therapeutic management of the newborns if the child has a suspected&#xD;
      infection : urine samples, blood for blood cultures and Blood formula and C-reactive protein&#xD;
      (CRP) detrmination; rhinopharyngeal fluid samples, lumbar puncture in febrile children under&#xD;
      the age of three months; and thick blood smears if the child has a fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples based on the presence of particular warning signs of infection: stool samples, eye or&#xD;
