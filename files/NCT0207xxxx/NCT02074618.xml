      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of physiotherapy based on the practice&#xD;
      of supervised exercise on functional capacity and life quality of patients with chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease.&#xD;

      This quasi-experimental study, with repeated measures design, was held in the ambulatory of&#xD;
      physical therapy, in a public hospital, which serves 15 cities in the South and Southeast of&#xD;
      the state of Pará (Brazil) and has structure of hemodialysis, outpatient, wards and intensive&#xD;
      care units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For inclusion in the study, the patient should have age over 18 years, make part of the&#xD;
      hospital's hemodialysis program, receive medical prescription for practice of physical&#xD;
      activity, and sign an informed consent. The present study was carried out in accordance with&#xD;
      National Health Council Resolution nº 196/96 of the Brazilian Ministry of Health, and&#xD;
      approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Tropical Medicine Foundation of Tocantins&#xD;
      (protocol No. 023/2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contraindications to physical activity practice were considered exclusion criteria: recent&#xD;
      myocardial infarction; uncontrolled arrhythmias; uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure &gt; 200mmHg and diastolic blood pressure &gt; 120mmHg); unstable angina; severe&#xD;
      decompensate diabetes (blood glucose &gt; 300 mg/dL); left ventricle dysfunction; presence of&#xD;
      neurological or motor dysfunction that was impeditive for implementation of the protocol of&#xD;
      physical activity. Other exclusion criteria were: tumor; pregnancy; stopping treatment in the&#xD;
      first 6 weeks for more than 3 consecutive sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of each exercise session, if the patient had any symptoms that prevented the&#xD;
      exercises performance, it was canceled. After the start of the session, break criteria were&#xD;
      considered: the account of intense physical tiredness, chest pain, dizziness, paleness,&#xD;
      syncope, pre-syncope, dyspnea disproportionate to the intensity of the effort, arrhythmia and&#xD;
      hypotension or hypertensive response. When any of these symptoms was detected, the patient&#xD;
      was transferred to hemodialysis service for medical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data were analyzed in the program Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS)&#xD;
      version 20.0 for Windows and are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. The Wilcoxon test&#xD;
      was used for comparison of the averages of the values obtained at the beginning of the&#xD;
      program and in reevaluation after six weeks. In all analyses, a statistical significance&#xD;
      level of 0.05 was considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, an interview was conducted with the patient, to collect data as the previous and&#xD;
      current history, co-morbidities, medications, postural changes, vital signs. In the initial&#xD;
      contact and after six weeks, in addition to anthropometric data, the following evaluations&#xD;
      were carried out in order to assess the effects of the exercise protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Six-minute walk test (6MWT): measurement of functional capacity, which was carried out&#xD;
           following the recommendations from the American Thoracic Society. This test has already&#xD;
           been used in patients with chronic kidney disease in different studies found in&#xD;
           literature; Reboredo et al. found a strong correlation between the distance obtained in&#xD;
           6MWT and peak oxygen consumption, suggesting that this test is a simple and inexpensive&#xD;
           alternative for assessing the functional capacity of patients with chronic kidney&#xD;
           disease who are undergoing hemodialysis treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sit-to-stand test: test initially described as a measure of strength of lower extremity,&#xD;
           it is currently also considered a balancing test and has already been validated in&#xD;
           patients with chronic kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life assessment: the generic questionnaire Short-form 36 (SF36), translated&#xD;
           into Portuguese was used for evaluation of life quality. Johansen et al. considered that&#xD;
           the physical component of the SF36 is valid to assess physical performance in patients&#xD;
           with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis. Other authors such as Bohlke et al. and&#xD;
           Arenas et al. used this test in patients with chronic kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all the sessions the following measurements were performed: body weight and blood&#xD;
      pressure, heart rate and peripheral oxygen saturation in the pre, during and post session.&#xD;
      The exercises were: heating and stretching during 5 minutes, followed by aerobic physical&#xD;
      exercise on treadmill and/or bike (about 30 minutes), muscle strengthening exercises (15 to&#xD;
      20 minutes), cooling and stretching (5 minutes). The time for aerobic and strengthening&#xD;
      varied according to the tolerance of the patient. The resistance exercises have been&#xD;
      conducted for the major muscle groups of the lower limbs. All these activities were performed&#xD;
      under the supervision and guidance of a physiotherapist responsible for research. The session&#xD;
      had total duration of about 60 minutes - 5 minutes for the daily assessment of the patient,&#xD;
      and the 55 minutes remaining divided among the exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program of resistance and aerobic training was initiated at low intensity and with a slow&#xD;
      progressing according to the patient's tolerance. In aerobic exercise, for greater&#xD;
      effectiveness of the training, the literature recommends moderate intensity, which&#xD;
      corresponds with 50 to 70% of the maximum heart rate and the score of Borg scale around.&#xD;
      These were the criteria considered in this study. Patients were instructed to keep the most&#xD;
      constant as possible the speed during exercise on treadmill or cycle ergometer. For muscle&#xD;
      strengthening exercises, the number of repetitions varied from 1 to 4 sets of 10 to 15&#xD;
      repetitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercises were held three times a week on alternate days to hemodialysis sessions.&#xD;
      According to the literature, it is recommend at least three weekly sessions of 45 to 90&#xD;
      minute supervised exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The equipment for carrying out the exercises and evaluations were blood pressure device,&#xD;
      stethoscope, pulse oximeter, treadmill, cycle ergometry, mats, pillows, lingbar, dumbbells,&#xD;
      elastic bands (Theraband ®), shin pads, therapeutic balls, chairs, two steps stairs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection was performed by only one physiotherapist. After the end of the period of&#xD;
      data collection, the patients remained in rehabilitation service to continue the practice of&#xD;
      physical activity.&#xD;
