      The purpose of this trial is to o assess feasibility of a protocol comparing conservative&#xD;
      (trigger guided) vs. liberal (target guided) approach to fluid resuscitation in patients with&#xD;
      septic shock after initial fluid resuscitation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fluid resuscitation is a key intervention in treatment of sepsis, but exact indications for&#xD;
      fluid and amount of fluid administered is not established. Current guidelines for fluid&#xD;
      therapy beyond 6 hours are vague and ungraded and most observational studies suggest harm&#xD;
      with increasing positive fluid balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective To assess feasibility of a protocol comparing a conservative (trigger guided) vs.&#xD;
      liberal (target guided) approach to fluid resuscitation in patients with septic shock after&#xD;
      initial fluid resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Multicentre, parallel group, centrally randomised, open label trial with adequate&#xD;
      generation of allocation sequence, and adequate allocation concealment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size 150 included patients we will be needed to show a 1.7 L difference in fluid&#xD;
      volumes between the groups based on the mean volume of resuscitation fluid given within first&#xD;
      5 days observed in the 6S trial of 5.3 L (SD 3.7 L) with a maximal type 1 and 2 error of 5%&#xD;
      and 20% (power=80%), respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding The trial is publicly funded by the Danish Council for Strategic Research&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Plan for the Classic Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures The outcome measure &quot;Amount of resuscitation fluid given during ICU stay&quot;&#xD;
      has been changed from a secondary outcome measure to a co-primary outcome measure, which&#xD;
      differs from the Classic Trial protocol. The Classic Trial intervention period is entire ICU&#xD;
      stay and we consider it appropriate to have an outcome measure addressing this as co-primary&#xD;
      outcome measure. This change has been approved by the Danish Ethical Committee and the Danish&#xD;
      Health and Medicines Authorities (Applied for June 19 2015).Multiplicity issues will be&#xD;
      addressed (see Analyses section).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical tests will be 2-tailed. Multiplicity adjustment. Dealing with multiplicity,&#xD;
      the parallel gate keeping method with truncation parameter lambda = 0 will be used to adjust&#xD;
      the observed (raw) P values for primary and secondary outcomes (Dmitrienko A, Tamhane AC,&#xD;
      Bretz F. Multiple testing problems in pharmaceutical statistics. Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC&#xD;
      biostatistics series (2010)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      By this approach the null hypotheses are divided into two families: F1 including null&#xD;
      hypotheses related to the two co-primary outcomes and F2 including null hypotheses related to&#xD;
      the secondary outcomes. The raw P values are then adjusted. If at least one of the adjusted P&#xD;
      values in family 1 is less than the chosen level of significance the hypotheses in family 2&#xD;
      are also tested. If not the hypotheses in family 2 are all accepted without test. However, in&#xD;
      all events all raw P values as well as the adjusted ones will be presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lambda may be varied between 0 and 1. If the effect sizes of the primary outcomes&#xD;
      (corresponding to the null hypotheses of F1) are uniformly high a lambda near 1 will help&#xD;
      improve the overall power. On the other hand if the effect sizes are expected to vary across&#xD;
      the endpoints, the overall power is likely to be maximized when lambda is small (Dmitrienko&#xD;
      A, Tamhane AC, Bretz F. Multiple testing problems in pharmaceutical statistics. Chapman &amp;&#xD;
      Hall/CRC biostatistics series (2010)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect a degree of correlation between the two co-primary outcome measures somewhat in&#xD;
      between full correlation and no correlation, so a conventional adjustment of the significance&#xD;
      level (0.05/2=0.025) may result in a too conservative adjustment. Thus, we have chosen to&#xD;
      adjust the level of significance by a factor in between a full Bonferroni adjustment and no&#xD;
      adjustment at all, that is 0.05/1.5=0.033. In the above procedure the raw P values and not&#xD;
      the significance level are adjusted and usually α (the significance level) is chosen to be&#xD;
      0.05. In family 1 the smaller raw P value is adjusted by multiplying it with 2. Therefore, we&#xD;
      implement the above adjustment solving 2*0.0.033 ≤ level of significance =&gt; level of&#xD;
      significance = 0.066 to secure that a raw P value ≤0.033 for a co-primary outcome will imply&#xD;
      that the corresponding null hypothesis will be rejected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Revised power calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multiplicity adjustments for the co-primary outcome measures infer changes in the power&#xD;
      calculations. The revised power calculations are based on 150 included patients with α=0.033&#xD;
      and β=0.80:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measure 1.1: Power to show a 1.8 L (opposed to 1.7 L with α=0.05) difference in fluid&#xD;
      volumes between the groups based on the mean volume of resuscitation fluid given within first&#xD;
      5 days observed in the 6S trial of 5.3 L (SD 3.7 L) Outcome measure 1.2: Power to show a 4.1&#xD;
      L (opposed to 3.7 L with α=0.05) difference based on mean of 8.0 L (SD 8.1 L) total&#xD;
      resuscitation fluid volume during ICU stay days in the 6S trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We regard the revised power to be sufficient to address the research question; thus, the&#xD;
      sample size will not be changed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Analysis of outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two analyses will be done for the co-primary outcome measures (1,2):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. an analysis adjusted by the stratification variable (site) - primary analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. an analysis adjusted by the stratification variable and baseline covariates ((a) surgery&#xD;
           during current hospitalisation but prior to randomisation Y/N, (b) Age, (c) more than 5&#xD;
           L of fluid (crystalloids, colloids and blood products combined) given in the 24 hours&#xD;
           prior to randomisation Y/N, (d) highest dose of noradrenalin in the 24 hours prior to&#xD;
           randomization, (e) estimated weight at randomisation For exploratory outcome (10) we&#xD;
           will perform both an unadjusted analysis (for log rank test) and an analysis adjusted by&#xD;
           the stratification variable site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The remaining outcome measures will only be analysed adjusted by the stratification variable&#xD;
      (site).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-primary outcomes (1,2), secondary outcomes (3-6) and exploratory outcome (15) will be&#xD;
      analysed using the general linear model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exploratory outcomes (9) and (13) will be analysed using logistic regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exploratory outcome (10) will be analysed using Kaplan Meier survival plots and the log&#xD;
      rank test. Adjusted analysis will be done using Cox regression model stratified by site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome (7) will not be compared between intervention groups , because major&#xD;
      protocol violations can only occur in the conservative (Trigger-guided) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes (8), and exploratory outcomes (11), (12) and (14) will be analysed using&#xD;
      the Poisson distribution with link = log and offset or the negative binomial distribution&#xD;
      with link=log and offset as appropriate. As a sensitivity analysis the two groups will also&#xD;
      be compared using a non-parametric test (van Elteren test adjusted for site) and major&#xD;
      differences in the results obtained by the two approaches will be discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Sensitivity analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes will be analyzed using each of the two per-protocol populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Populations Intention-to-treat population: All randomised patients except those who withdraw&#xD;
      their consent for the use of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Per-protocol population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All randomised patients except patients having one or more protocol violations defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. One or more resuscitation fluid boluses given without fulfilment of one or more of the&#xD;
           Classic-criteria in the Conservative (Trigger-guided) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Use of colloids (either Albumin or synthetic colloids) for resuscitation OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Monitoring revealed that one or more in- or exclusion criteria were violated OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Stopped/withdrawn patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Patients with more than 5 L of fluid (crystalloids, colloids and blood products combined)&#xD;
      given in the 24 hours prior to randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the subgroup analysis will be presented if P of test of interaction between&#xD;
      subgroup indicator and intervention group indicator for primary outcome is &lt; 0.05. The&#xD;
      P-value of the test of interaction will be presented regardless.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing Data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing primary outcome data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We do not expect missing data on the co-primary outcome measures (1,2). Only complete case&#xD;
      analysis will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing secondary outcome data We do not expect missing data on the secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures 7 and 8. Only complete case analysis will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data on secondary outcomes 3-6: Since the predictors (centre indicator and&#xD;
      intervention indicator) will not be missing only the outcome may be missing. In this case a&#xD;
      complete case analysis will be unbiased since the cases with outcome missing carry no&#xD;
      information. However, auxiliary variables (i.e. variables not included in the analytical&#xD;
      model such as e.g. other outcomes) may be correlated with the outcome and their inclusion in&#xD;
      the analysis will improve the efficiency. This possibility is best dealt with using a&#xD;
      structural equation model for the regression analysis with direct maximum likelihood&#xD;
      estimation and inclusion of the auxiliary variables (the SAS proc calis for continuous&#xD;
      dependent variable may be used). However, the data may still be missing not at random.&#xD;
      Therefore, a sensitivity analysis estimating the range of potential bias that may be caused&#xD;
      by data missing not at random is done where the missing values in one group are replaced by&#xD;
      the minimum value in the whole material and the missing values in the other group are&#xD;
      replaced by the maximum value in the whole material and vice versa. The corresponding P&#xD;
      values will be estimated. The standard error of each of the two estimates of the regression&#xD;
      coefficient will be replaced by the corresponding standard error from the complete case&#xD;
      analysis (or the direct ML analysis if auxiliary variables are used) if it is smaller than&#xD;
      the former&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing baseline data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluids given prior to randomisation Yes/no Some patients may have missing data on fluids&#xD;
      given prior to randomisation. In this case it is a regression of each of the co-primary&#xD;
      outcomes on centre, and the above mentioned baseline covariates of which only fluids given&#xD;
      prior to randomization Yes/no has missing values. As long as the probability of missing data&#xD;
      on the predictor is independent of the outcome a complete case analysis will give unbiased&#xD;
      results even if the probability depends on the missing predictor values (i.e., data are NMAR)&#xD;
      (Allison PD Missing data Sage publications (2001)). Therefore, if the mean values of the&#xD;
      outcome do not differ significantly (P &lt; 0.10) between those patients with missing values and&#xD;
      those without missing values a complete case analysis will be done. If not multiple&#xD;
      imputation of the missing baseline variable will be done using monotone logistic regression.&#xD;
