    <textblock>
      This is a follow-up cohort study of 6 years old children born preterm in Denmark from&#xD;
      2004-2008, and at four different neonatal units. During hospitalisation they received breast&#xD;
      milk with fortification. At time of discharge there were made 3 different nutrition groups;&#xD;
      if possible they were randomised into one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Breastfeeding solely&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Breastfeeding with fortification&#xD;
&#xD;
           If breastfeeding was not possible they were put in group 3 and were bottle fed with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Preterm formula&#xD;
&#xD;
      This nutrition intervention went on for 4 month. At the age of 6, the children will be&#xD;
      invited to come for an ambulant control and other examinations regarding growth, allergy and&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome.&#xD;

      Project background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is based on a follow-up of a cohort of very preterm infants born before week 32, as&#xD;
      at discharge from the neonatal departments were randomized to a protein supplement or not&#xD;
      while breastfeeding after discharge. If the preterm child was not breastfed, it received a&#xD;
      premature infant formula after discharge. Since we have three groups of prematures, which are&#xD;
      fed differently after discharge, it is useful to follow up at 6 years of age and specifically&#xD;
      examine the following areas:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic syndrome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike the past, the survival rate of very preterm infants is now high. Most is expected to&#xD;
      survive. The question is the extent to which these children have increased morbidity compared&#xD;
      with children born at term, and their quality of life is affected by the fact that they are&#xD;
      born prematurely. There has previously been shown a link between children born SGA and later&#xD;
      development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, ischemic heart disease and&#xD;
      cerebrovascular disasters. Too rapid catch-up growth also increases the possible risk of&#xD;
      developing metabolic syndrome in the mature child. The question is whether this is also the&#xD;
      case in children born prematurely and whether the risk is the same. The problem is just that&#xD;
      you want to provide them with adequate amino acids for protein synthesis, as they approach&#xD;
      the growth of peers fetuses and also ensure the development of the brain with essential fatty&#xD;
      acids, but maybe they can not tolerate a too rapid &quot;catch-up&quot; - growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study comparing preterm born children aged 4-10 years with mature children born of the same&#xD;
      age found that the group with preterm births had increased systolic and diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressure and higher insulin levels. This was true regardless of whether the children were&#xD;
      born SGA and AGA at birth. This concluded that there were metabolic abnormalities in preterm&#xD;
      similar to those found in children born at term but SGA. The same article mentions the&#xD;
      concept of &quot;fetal programming&quot;. This covers a hypothesis which suggests that a fetus at risk&#xD;
      in the uterus will adapt best to survive, and this adjustment will be permanent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same team has published an article, which have found impaired insulin sensitivity in&#xD;
      preterm infants (SGA and AGA) compared to mature AGA children. Insulin sensitivity is&#xD;
      greatest in the mature AGA. Next comes the mature SGA and eventually the premature. To show&#xD;
      the importance of this area, they point out that out of those who have diabetes mellitus type&#xD;
      2, 35% has had low birth weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In trying to find a way it will be interesting, and very relevant, to see if diet the first&#xD;
      months of life have an impact on these metabolic complications later in life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allergy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is unknown whether preterms are at increased risk of developing allergic symptoms.&#xD;
      Breastfeeding reduces the risk of developing allergic diseases, while cow milk-based infant&#xD;
      formulas increase the risk. The preterm infants in this study completed during&#xD;
      hospitalization with fortifier containing cow's milk protein, and the preterm infant formula&#xD;
      is cow milk based. It is therefore interesting to see if there is an increased incidence of&#xD;
      allergic symptoms in one of the groups. An article formed on the basis of a study of two&#xD;
      groups of children, one group consisted of children with a birth weight less than 1500 g, and&#xD;
      the second group consisted of children with a birth weight over 2500 g, describes that there&#xD;
      was no difference in the incidence of atopy. Another study studied the incidence of food&#xD;
      allergies in an area of 13,980 children, and found that 4.23 % were diagnosed with this at&#xD;
      the age of six. There was no difference in the incidence of categorization in GA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first study mentioned above studied also the appearance of wheezing. This was done using&#xD;
      spirometry. The result was that the lifetime risk of preterm births was 43% for developing&#xD;
      wheezing, while it was only 17% in mature births. Besides wheezing low GA at birth was&#xD;
      associated with decreased lung capacity, reduced forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced&#xD;
      expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and asthma. A relevant question is whether children&#xD;
      develop these respiratory symptoms solely on the basis that they are born preterm or&#xD;
      nutritional type influences the risk of its development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Growth and catch-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies have gradually studied prematurely born children's growth compared to some&#xD;
      control children - especially in the first period after discharge from the neonatal units. As&#xD;
      we know, human milk has the best composition in relation to children's needs. There has been&#xD;
      made a study on nutrition of preterms with human milk against fortified human milk which&#xD;
      states that those who get pure milk, are at greatest risk of malnutrition by discharge and&#xD;
      that it is a good strategy to provide breast milk multinutrient enrichment. In the study&#xD;
      mothers milked out half of their daily quantity for enrichment. Though, they request&#xD;
      long-term studies to determine the long-term effects of it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other studies have followed prematurely born children up to 20 years of age and 11 years of&#xD;
      age and were compared with a control group of normal weight, not preterm births. Outcome was&#xD;
      height, weight, BMI. In one case also head circumference. One study concludes that all very&#xD;
      low birthweight children (VLBW) were smaller than the control group. In particular SGA boys&#xD;
      were smaller. The second study concluded that extremely immature children have poor growth in&#xD;
      early childhood, but they have catch-up until 11 years of age. All prematures remain less&#xD;
      than the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comparison of both nutrition after discharge and follow-up beyond 1 year of age will be&#xD;
      very interesting to be able to optimize nutrition and growth of extremely premature infants,&#xD;
      both AGA and SGA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan is a study that reveals body composition of&#xD;
      bone, muscle and fat. A study of whether the scanning can be used to detect body composition,&#xD;
      concluded that DEXA is a good tool for this. It is a quick (minutes) survey that provides&#xD;
      minimal radiation, and it is interesting because a scan of the 3 groups in this project will&#xD;
      elucidate whether there is a difference in body composition and thus whether a nutritional&#xD;
      type provides better basis for the best growth. The same study, which was built on an RCT&#xD;
      (randomized controlled trial) of 33 children with GA less than 35 weeks and a birth weight&#xD;
      below 1,750 grams who received either 1) standard replacement or 2) enriched compensation for&#xD;
      2 months after discharge, found no difference in body composition or weight gain. It calls&#xD;
      for larger studies with longer follow-up. Another study, just as this PhD project, divide the&#xD;
      children into several groups depending on Nutrition (1: enriched substitute 2: standard&#xD;
      replacement 3: human breast milk), found by DEXA scanning at 6 months of age, group 1 had&#xD;
      lower fat mass and group 3 had lower lean (muscle) mass and higher fat mass. So, there is a&#xD;
      difference in body composition depending on nutrition. It may sound logical, but will it&#xD;
      affect children later in life? - and if so, in what way? From the above examples of previous&#xD;
      studies, one can conclude that the optimal nutrition of preterms is under development and&#xD;
      there is a continued lack of clarification of how preterm infants grow after discharge and&#xD;
      whether one type of nutrition is better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nutrition after discharge does affect premature children's growth in the first years of&#xD;
           life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Catch-up growth proceeds after 1 year of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The growth pattern for prematures born SGA is different from prematures born AGA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is no increase in allergies between prematures, who was fed with premature formula&#xD;
           or enriched mothers milk before and after discharge compared with mothers milk without&#xD;
           enrichment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Premature children fed with a preterm formula have an extended risk for developing&#xD;
           metabolic syndrome on basis of excessive growth the first months of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is possible that premature SGA children have greater risks of developing metabolic&#xD;
           syndrome on the basis of excessive growth the first month of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fat mass and lean mass vary among prematures depending on the nutrition the first month&#xD;
           after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the project:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigate whether there are long-term effect on growth after cessation of enrichment&#xD;
           of breast milk in 2, 3 and 6 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine the relationship between protein intake to 4 months of age (corrected) and blood&#xD;
           pressure, HbA1c and serum cholesterol by 6 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Uncover the incidence of allergy symptoms from the eyes and nose, skin, stomach /&#xD;
           intestinal and respiratory tract incl affected lung function in children born&#xD;
           prematurely.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Elucidate whether there is an increased risk of metabolic syndrome in children born&#xD;
           prematurely and nourished in different ways.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Investigate whether preterms have different fat distribution and nutrition up to 4&#xD;
           months corrected age affect them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Illuminate catch-up growth in children born prematurely and up to 6 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Weight, height, head circumference, blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Registration of any allergy symptoms and airway symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Blood tests for diabetes, screening for metabolic syndrome and allergies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Questionaires to investigate allergy symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A dexa scan to see the body composition of fat, muscle and bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children were randomized when they could eat (breast or bottle) at gestational age 34-42.&#xD;
      Twins and triplets were randomly assigned to the same group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At randomization an impartial person in the department the child was hospitalized in, pulled&#xD;
      an envelope with information on what kind of nutrition, the child should have after discharge&#xD;
      and up to 4 months of corrected age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Originally, there were strength calculations prior to randomization in the project. This&#xD;
      showed that there were needed 85 children in each feeding group. A total of 320 children in&#xD;
      the original project were enrolled. However, there has been a waiver until 1 year of age, and&#xD;
      there are 278 children remaining to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wilcoxon rank-sum test or t-test for continuous variables, and if categorical variables&#xD;
      chi2test will be used to compare the nutritional groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple logistic regression models will be used to compare the clinical relevant variables&#xD;
      that have possible influence on the growth of various dietary groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Growth will be analyzed from Z-score and delta z-score and will be calculated from a relevant&#xD;
      reference for comparing nutritional groups growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allergy risks and metabolic syndrome will be calculated using the above methods and odds&#xD;
      ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      From 2004 - 2008 there were formed three groups of preterm children at clinical&#xD;
      randomization. A Ph.D. dissertation was made subsequently dealing with preterm growth up to 1&#xD;
      year of age, nutrition and composition of breast milk of mothers of preterm babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between the ages of 2 and 3 years, children have come to control for a follow-up Ph.D. The&#xD;
      children become 6 years from July 2010 - 2014, where they also will be invited to a follow-up&#xD;
      check on the current Ph.D. project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children will be followed up in their respective departments / hospitals in Kolding,&#xD;
      Skejby, Holbæk and Odense.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For inclusion in the randomized controlled study parents signed an acceptance which included&#xD;
      follow-up at 6 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial randomized controlled study was approved by the Ethics Committee 1 July 2004 (J.&#xD;
      Nr.VF20030208). As part of the 6-year follow-up, there is added and approved Protocol 1-8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, permission from the Data Inspectorate of the original project with change in&#xD;
      2007 (J. No 2007-41-1349) is extended until 2016.&#xD;
