    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and immunogenicity&#xD;
      of an influenza A vaccine (vaccine: FP-01.1), as compared to placebo, in healthy volunteers&#xD;
      following a dose of influenza A virus.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to further investigate the safety and tolerability of FP-01.1 in&#xD;
      healthy subjects and to explore the effect of prior vaccination with Vaccine FP-01.1 (250&#xD;
      μg/peptide) or placebo on the incidence, severity and duration of the signs and symptoms of&#xD;
      influenza and the magnitude of viral load in nasal secretions and duration of viral shedding,&#xD;
      after challenge with an A/California/H1N1 2009 influenza virus, in healthy male and female&#xD;
      subjects. The study will also be used to provide additional information on the immunological&#xD;
      responses (both humoral and cell-mediated immune [CMI] responses) following Vaccine FP-01.1&#xD;
      treatment and to investigate potential markers for protection against influenza A infection.&#xD;
