    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess whether a vaccine containing a small fragment of the&#xD;
      protein IDO, which may be present in cancer cells and cells of the immune system, is safe to&#xD;
      use in combination with either Ipilimumab or Vemurafenib in the treatment of malignant&#xD;
      melanoma that has metastasized.&#xD;

    <description>Reactivity towards epitopes nested within the sequence of the peptide used for vaccination, will be assessed in T cells from peripheral blood, obtained at the specified sample times. Reactivity will be assessed using ELISpot technology, where secretion of interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha is measured during in vitro stimulation with the peptide used for vaccination. In addition to this, combinatorial coding with fluor chrome conjugated HLA tetramers are used to enumerate precursor frequency of CD8 T cells specific for epitopes within the peptide sequence</description>
