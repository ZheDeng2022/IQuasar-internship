  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the effects of a translational health in nutrition and&#xD;
      kinesiology (THINK) after school program on physical variables, nutrition and exercise&#xD;
      knowledge base/behaviors, and exercise enjoyment and confidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Partnering with the YMCA investigators in the Kinesiology and Sport Sciences department at&#xD;
      the University of Miami will set up the after-school THINK program offered three afternoons&#xD;
      per week for nine months in two experimental and two control schools. The schools will&#xD;
      consist of minority elementary school students (predominantly Hispanic and Black) in the&#xD;
      South Florida area. The control schools will receive baseline, mid-year and follow-up testing&#xD;
      nine months later, but will not go through the THINK program. They will instead go through&#xD;
      their standard YMCA after school Sports, Play, and Active Recreation for Kids (SPARK)&#xD;
      program.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two- thirds of American adults are overweight or obese, and that number continues to rise.&#xD;
      Thus, it is not surprising that the prevalence of overweight/obesity has more than doubled in&#xD;
      school children and tripled in adolescents. Concomitant with the rise in obesity has been a&#xD;
      significant decrease in physical fitness levels (1,2). At least one study has shown the youth&#xD;
      of today demonstrate lower aerobic fitness levels than their parents (3). Low aerobic fitness&#xD;
      levels are most prevalent among Hispanic and Black (non-Hispanic) minority youth. No doubt&#xD;
      the increases in TV viewing, computer time and technology have contributed to the increase in&#xD;
      sedentary habits and decline in physical activity levels (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The THINK program translates fitness and health-related information into knowledge and skills&#xD;
      that children can understand and incorporate into their own personal health and lifestyle&#xD;
      behaviors. The program is unique in that it combines educational and hands-on clinical&#xD;
      experiences with physical activity and exercise. The goal is to promote healthier, more&#xD;
      active children of today who demonstrate improved levels of physical fitness, exercise&#xD;
      knowledge, and enjoyment of tomorrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each unit in the THINK program has three components: a seminar on the scientific aspects of a&#xD;
      health-related theme, clinical experiences related to the theme, and related physical&#xD;
      activities performed in the field. The THINK seminars engage students by getting them up and&#xD;
      moving, while asking questions that prompt them to think creatively to come up with their own&#xD;
      answers. Clinical experiences reinforce the educational themes allowing children to learn&#xD;
      more about their bodies, how it functions, and how it adapts through various movement&#xD;
      exercises. Finally, games and enjoyable physical activities round out the program&#xD;
      contributing to enhanced motor skill development and improved physical fitness levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The THINK program will begin with a series of baseline physical assessments comprising both&#xD;
      heath and performance-related physical fitness. Participants will also receive a quiz on&#xD;
      nutrition and exercise-related information and two surveys regarding nutritional behaviors&#xD;
      and physical activity levels. They will be asked to complete one survey on exercise enjoyment&#xD;
      and self-confidence. Parents will also be asked to complete a survey each on their child's&#xD;
      nutritional habits. This will be done in two experimental and two control YMCA after school&#xD;
      programs comprising primarily minority (Hispanic and Black) participants. Testing will again&#xD;
      take place midway through the program and at the conclusion of the program nine months later.&#xD;
      The control group will not go through the THINK program but will instead go through the&#xD;
      traditional SPARK curriculum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether the THINK program results in improvements in&#xD;
      physical fitness, nutrition and exercise knowledge/habits, and exercise enjoyment and&#xD;
      self-confidence above that of the control group.&#xD;
