      Weight gain occurs because of imbalances in energy balance favouring energy intake. Whilst&#xD;
      over 50% of a person's energy requirement goes towards the maintenance of physiological&#xD;
      functions, around 40% is used for physical activity. In addition to this, around 10-15% of&#xD;
      energy is spent on what is termed as Diet Induced Thermogenesis (DIT). Diet Induced&#xD;
      Thermogenesis is the increase in energy expenditure following a meal, and represents the&#xD;
      energy utilised for the digestion and metabolism of food. Some nutrients such as proteins&#xD;
      require more energy to digest and therefore produce a greater DIT than others. In addition to&#xD;
      this, some food components are able to independently stimulate calorie burning. For example&#xD;
      caffeine, chilli, ginger and green tea have been shown to induce calorie burning through DIT.&#xD;
      Therefore the inclusion of such foods in the diet could increase energy expenditure and&#xD;
      thereby help in weight control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine the DIT effects of some plant foods that are&#xD;
      native to Scotland (blackberries, blueberries, red raspberries, wild garlic and sea&#xD;
      buckthorn). These foods have been shown to contain compounds that stimulate DIT. If found to&#xD;
      be effective, these foods could then be used to develop dietary strategies for weight control&#xD;
      in Scotland.&#xD;

      Obesity prevalence is increasing around the world and the United Kingdom is no exception.&#xD;
      Latest statistics show that approximately 25% of the UK population is obese and is predicted&#xD;
      to rise to 70% by 2020 if present trends continue. Obesity is particularly widespread in&#xD;
      Scotland where approximately 62% of the population are of a BMI over 25kg/m2. Curtailing&#xD;
      obesity rates is a public health priority as excess weight is also the greatest predictor of&#xD;
      other co-morbidities such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes, and hence&#xD;
      collectively exerts a significant toll on the health and economic burden of the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight gain occurs primarily due to an imbalance in energy balance status where energy intake&#xD;
      outweighs expenditure. Energy expenditure (EE) in adults consists of three components: basal&#xD;
      metabolism (50-70% of EE), physical activity (30-40% of EE) and diet induced thermogenesis&#xD;
      (DIT). The latter is described as the thermic effect of food and is the increase in EE above&#xD;
      Basal Metabolic Rate after a meal, and usually ranges between 3-10% of total EE (depending on&#xD;
      the composition of the meal). Whilst cornerstone approaches to weight control have focused on&#xD;
      strategies to reduce energy intake and increase physical activity, the still escalating&#xD;
      obesity levels show that this approach is ineffective in the long term possibly due to poor&#xD;
      long-term compliance to dietary regimes and adequate physical activity. Thus it is being&#xD;
      increasingly recognised that the most sustainable long-term strategy for reducing obesity is&#xD;
      making small diet and lifestyle changes that would positively influence energy regulatory&#xD;
      mechanisms targeted at preventing a positive energy balance. It is also now recognised that&#xD;
      genetic predispositions to a slow mechanism characterised by a slow metabolic rate and&#xD;
      capacity for fat oxidation also determines an individual's propensity to weight gain.&#xD;
      Furthermore, studies have shown that weight loss and reduced food intake result in an&#xD;
      attenuation of EE possibly due to the loss of lean mass and improved metabolic efficiency.&#xD;
      The regular consumption of high DIT foods which could increase EE and fat oxidation whilst&#xD;
      circumventing these energy sparing mechanisms may have significant potential in long-term&#xD;
      weight control. Indeed studies demonstrating pronounced obesity in mice whose DIT mechanism&#xD;
      were inactivated indicates the important role thermogenesis plays in weight control&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food components such as chilli (capsaicin), ginger, mustard, pepper, caffeine, green tea&#xD;
      (flavanols) and medium-chain triglycerides have been demonstrated as increasing DIT. The&#xD;
      thermogenic effects of these compounds have been shown to be mainly via the sympathetic&#xD;
      nervous system. Pharmacological agents such as ephedrine and salicylate as well as food&#xD;
      constituents such as methylxanthines (theophylline and caffeine) and caffeine have been shown&#xD;
      to possess sympathomimetic properties and induce fat oxidation and thermogenesis in effector&#xD;
      cells by stimulating the release of noradrenalin. Flavanoids such as green tea catechins have&#xD;
      also been shown to stimulate this pathway. Sympathetically released noradrenalin has been&#xD;
      shown to activate Beta3adrenoceptors and thereby induce thermogenesis and fat oxidation in&#xD;
      peripheral tissues as well as activate uncoupling protein (UCP1) that mediates thermogenesis&#xD;
      in brown adipose tissue (BAT). Plant phenolics have also been shown to demonstrate&#xD;
      thermogenic effects, particularly Oleuropein, green tea catechins, Kaempferol, flavanol&#xD;
      glycosides, stilbenes and quercetin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the present pilot study is to assess the thermogenic effects of some plant&#xD;
      foods native to Scotland that contain the above phytochemicals. Specifically, the study will&#xD;
      investigate the thermogenic effects of berries (blackberries [Rubus sp.], blueberries&#xD;
      [Vaccinium corymbosum] and red raspberries [Rubus idaeus L]), wild garlic (Allium ursinum)&#xD;
      and sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides). Blackberries, blueberries and raspberries have been&#xD;
      shown to be rich in flavonoids and phenolics including catechins and raspberry ketones which&#xD;
      have been suggested to be thermogenic. These berries are also rich in anthocyanins such as&#xD;
      cyanidin-3-glucoside which has been shown to potentially promote thermogenesis by&#xD;
      upregulating UCP1. Furthermore, blueberries have been shown to be a good source of stilbenes&#xD;
      such as resveratrol and pterostilbene which have demonstrated thermic effects elsewhere.&#xD;
      Similarly, sea buckthorn has been reported to contain catechins, epicatechins and flavonols&#xD;
      such as isorhamnetin, quercetin and kaempferol. Sea buckthorn is also rich in carotenoids,&#xD;
      especially those with provitamin A activity that have been shown to upregulate the expression&#xD;
      of UCP1 and thereby influence thermogenesis. Wild garlic contains Sulphur containing&#xD;
      compounds such as alliin and Allicin derivatives (diallyldisulphide) that in studies using&#xD;
      garlic have shown thermogenic activity by enhancing noradrenalin secretion and stimulating&#xD;
      brown adipose tissue. Indeed the total thiosulfinate content in wild garlic has been shown to&#xD;
      be comparable to garlic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of thermogenic compounds in these plant products logically suggests that they&#xD;
      may have a thermic effect in humans and this forms the rationale for the present study. No&#xD;
      studies have investigated the thermic effects of these foods in humans and their therapeutic&#xD;
      potential in weight control from a thermogenesis perspective. The proposed pilot study will&#xD;
      provide preliminary data on the thermic effects of these Scottish foods and provide a basis&#xD;
      for future research.&#xD;
