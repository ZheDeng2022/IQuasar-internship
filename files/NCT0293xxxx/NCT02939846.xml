  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Present clinical study will be conducted in China to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of single&#xD;
      and repeat oral doses of trametinib, the safety profile and the clinical activity in Chinese&#xD;
      subjects with solid tumor. Approximately 10 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in the study,&#xD;
      Subjects will receive trametinib 2 mg once daily (QD). Study treatment will continue until&#xD;
      disease progression, death or unacceptable toxicity. The study will be completed after all&#xD;
      subjects have discontinued from study treatment or last enrolled subject has had at least 16&#xD;
      weeks of follow-up, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
