    <textblock>
      Mothers with symptoms suggesting clinical depression can be identified and potentially&#xD;
      motivated to seek further care during pediatric visits for their young children. The best&#xD;
      ways for pediatric providers to encourage mothers to seek further evaluation and treatment&#xD;
      for their depressive symptoms are not known. The investigators plan to provisionally optimize&#xD;
      a pediatric office-based intervention that the investigators developed to motivate mothers&#xD;
      who may be depressed to seek further care and, thereby to improve the well-being of women&#xD;
      from diverse backgrounds and their children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression in mothers parenting young children is common and undertreated. Depression is&#xD;
      debilitating for mothers, negatively affects their parenting, and is associated with mental,&#xD;
      behavioral, and physical health problems in their children. Identifying and treating mothers&#xD;
      with depression improves both the mothers' well-being and their children's mental and overall&#xD;
      health. Pediatric visits offer a potential significant opportunity to intervene. Mothers may&#xD;
      see their child's pediatric provider more often than their own, and these providers could&#xD;
      motivate mothers to seek effective, underutilized, formal depression care, by communicating&#xD;
      how recovery from depression is linked to child well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in recent pilot work, the investigators developed a pediatric setting-based&#xD;
      intervention that includes a validated maternal depression screen, and subsequent depression&#xD;
      education and care-seeking motivational messages that emphasize the benefits of maternal&#xD;
      depression care for children. Initial testing demonstrated that depression screen-positive&#xD;
      mothers receiving the intervention had greater intention and attempts to seek depression care&#xD;
      compared to mothers receiving usual care. The investigators then professionally translated&#xD;
      the intervention into Spanish as a first step in increasing the generalizability of the&#xD;
      intervention through refinement in future studies. As is often the case with interventions&#xD;
      tested as a package, the investigators lack empirical evidence on which components of the&#xD;
      pilot intervention deliver the greatest effects. Therefore, the investigators propose to&#xD;
      adopt a rapid-cycle intervention improvement approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, the investigators will assess the effects intervention refinements on&#xD;
      depression screen-positive mothers' depression care-seeking, using a factorial randomized&#xD;
      design. The resulting intervention will be provisionally optimized by including only those&#xD;
      refined components found to be most experimentally efficacious. This provisionally optimized&#xD;
      intervention will have a higher probability of demonstrating reproducible effectiveness,&#xD;
      potentially speeding the way to implementation. The ultimate optimized intervention will&#xD;
      improve maternal depression care by being an essential link in future integrated systems&#xD;
      between pediatric-based maternal depression screening and effective community-based programs&#xD;
      for maternal mental health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators modified the initial anticipated sample size reported from 312 to 80.&#xD;
      During the course of recruiting and enrollment investigators found the need to reorient the&#xD;
      trial to one of feasibility and reduced the sample size accordingly. The investigators' goal&#xD;
      is to obtain an analytic sample size that will allow for balanced numbers of participants in&#xD;
      each cell across sites, with a minimum of 5 observations per intervention type. Given&#xD;
      variable recruiting and retention rates, this could be a recruited sample size between 48 and&#xD;
      80 individuals. In addition, investigators extended the initial recruiting time frame.&#xD;
