  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tyrosine-kinase Inhibitors (TKI) resistance in gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) is a&#xD;
      common problem after prolonged treatment periods. The main objectives of this monocentric&#xD;
      diagnostic Phase I/IIa study are safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and dosimetry of&#xD;
      68Ga-NeoBomb1 in GIST patients. The rationale behind this study is to improve diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy in GIST via positron-emission tomography/computer tomography (PET-CT) with a focus&#xD;
      on TKI-resistant subtypes. Better detection, classification and definition of lesion extent&#xD;
      are expected from the use of 68Ga-NeoBOMB1.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale of the design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a monocentric diagnostic Phase I/IIa study. Due to the very limited number of&#xD;
      patients and the rare nature of the disease the study was designed as a combination of phases&#xD;
      I and IIa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of such an early phase clinical trial are safety and tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and (in the case of radiopharmaceuticals) dosimetry aspects. For the first 6&#xD;
      patients, the focus of the study will be on safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
      Therefore, both TKI-resistant and TKI-sensitive GIST patients will be included. As resistant&#xD;
      patients are typically in 2nd- or 3rd-line TKI treatment prone to substantial side effects&#xD;
      and potentially suffer from a greater extent of disease, the study design includes a limited&#xD;
      number of non-resistant GIST patients to address a possible bias regarding tolerability and&#xD;
      side effects profile of 68Ga-NeoBOMB1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 6 included patients an interim analysis of safety and pharmacokinetic data including&#xD;
      PBPK modelling and dosimetry calculation will be performed. Thereby it will be decided,&#xD;
      whether the data generation is sufficient for a final calculation of dosimetry, if so&#xD;
      pharmacological and dosimetric aspects can be omitted in the last 6 patients, reducing the&#xD;
      burden for these patients considerably (less number of scans, no blood and urine sampling).&#xD;
      This analysis will also reveal the optimal time window for PET/CT imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the establishment of these baseline findings, the second part of the study will&#xD;
      emphasize the assessment of imaging data towards targeting properties of the GRP(gastrin&#xD;
      releasing peptide)-receptor-specific radiopharmaceutical 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 as proof of the&#xD;
      molecular imaging principle. In this phase only patients with confirmed GRPR receptor&#xD;
      expression via Immunohistochemistry will be included. Nonetheless, safety and tolerability&#xD;
      still remain a primary objectives in this part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As there are no preclinical indications that the GRP receptor status of TKI resistance is&#xD;
      variable, all objectives should be met including targeting properties of 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 also&#xD;
      in non-resistant patients. Nonetheless, changes in GRP-receptor expression under treatment&#xD;
      pressure may still exist. Therefore in both phases a minimum of 50% of the patients have to&#xD;
      show resistance to TKI treatment, where therapeutic option are extremely limited. This will&#xD;
      allow providing data in patients that will most likely benefit most from an improved target&#xD;
      characterisation and GRPR targeting therapy approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study conduct:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 28 days after the patient's positive evaluation and written informed consent, the&#xD;
      imaging study will be performed. During the study, patients will be shortly hospitalised.&#xD;
      These pre-planned hospitalisations for study purposes will not be considered as (serious)&#xD;
      adverse events. The radiopharmaceutical will be administered to the patient directly at the&#xD;
      imaging system (PET-CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first phase of the trial including the first six patients a series of dynamic scans&#xD;
      between 0 and 45 min and static whole-body PET images at 1, 2 and 3-4h will be obtained to&#xD;
      determine pharmacokinetics and absorbed doses to normal organs and to tumorous lesions. Blood&#xD;
      samples drawn concomitantly at the time of imaging will be collected to estimate residence&#xD;
      times in blood and to derive the bone marrow absorbed dose (max. 10 samples during the&#xD;
      hospitalisation). Urine will be collected to determine the bladder wall and kidney absorbed&#xD;
      doses. Regions of interest for critical organs and tumour lesions will be drawn using the&#xD;
      acquired images resulting in time-activity curves with quantitative fractions of administered&#xD;
      activity. Residence times of radioactivity from this analysis will be calculated. All&#xD;
      dosimetric calculations will be performed by feeding the residence times as well as blood and&#xD;
      urine activities into an appropriate software program (OLINDA/EXAM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second phase is in principle conducted in the same way, if interim analysis returns&#xD;
      sufficient data for dosimetry and pharmacokinetics, PET images will be reduced to 2 whole&#xD;
      body scans within the optimal time window and blood and urine sampling can be omitted.&#xD;
