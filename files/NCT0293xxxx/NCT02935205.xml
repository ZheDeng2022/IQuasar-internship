  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects of enzalutamide and indomethacin and to see&#xD;
      how well they work in treating patients with prostate cancer that does not respond to&#xD;
      treatment with hormones, has come back, or has spread from where it started to other places&#xD;
      in the body. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Hormone therapy using&#xD;
      enzalutamide and indomethacin may fight prostate cancer by lowering the amount of androgen&#xD;
      the body makes and/or blocking the use of androgen by the tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the toxicity of indomethacin and enzalutamide when given in combination, and to&#xD;
      determine the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response that is defined as a 50% or more&#xD;
      reduction from the baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall response as determined by the Prostate Cancer Working Group 2&#xD;
      criteria (PCWG2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival of&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients treated with indomethacin and&#xD;
      enzalutamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate molecular correlatives for patient response and outcomes through the&#xD;
      analysis of patient baseline tumor specimens (diagnostic biopsy) along with serial blood&#xD;
      specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive enzalutamide orally (PO) once daily (QD) and indomethacin PO twice daily&#xD;
      (BID) or QD. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 months.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed prostate cancer (CaP);&#xD;
             CaP can be recurrent disease after definitive therapy (radical prostatectomy or&#xD;
             radiation therapy) for localized CaP, or metastatic CaP&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have CaP deemed to be castration-resistant by one or more of the&#xD;
             following criteria (despite androgen deprivation when applicable):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Progression of unidimensionally measurable disease assessed within 42 days prior&#xD;
                  to initial administration of drug&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Progression of evaluable but not measurable disease assessed within 42 days prior&#xD;
                  to initial administration of drug for PSA evaluation and for imaging studies&#xD;
                  (e.g, bone scans)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Rising PSA, defined as at least two consecutive rises in PSA to be documented&#xD;
                  over a reference value (measure 1); the first rising PSA (measure 2) should be&#xD;
                  taken at least 7 days after the reference value; a third confirmatory PSA measure&#xD;
                  (2nd beyond the reference level) should be greater than the second measure, and&#xD;
                  it must be obtained at least 7 days after the 2nd measure; if this is not the&#xD;
                  case, a fourth PSA measurement is required to be taken and be greater than the&#xD;
                  second measure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease is not required&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who have measurable disease must have had X-rays, scans or physical&#xD;
                  examinations used for tumor measurement completed within 28 days prior to initial&#xD;
                  administration of drug&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must have non-measurable disease (such as nuclear medicine bone scans)&#xD;
                  and non-target lesions (such as PSA level) assessed within 28 days prior to&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Soft tissue disease that has been radiated within two months prior to&#xD;
                  registration is not assessable as measurable disease; soft tissue disease that&#xD;
                  has been radiated two or more months prior to registration is assessable as&#xD;
                  measurable disease provided that the lesion has progressed following radiation;&#xD;
                  as the biology of previously irradiated tumors may be different from&#xD;
                  non-irradiated tumors, patients must have at least one measurable lesion outside&#xD;
                  the previously irradiated region in order to be considered to have measurable&#xD;
                  disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If PSA is the only indicator of disease and patients do not have any metastatic&#xD;
                  disease, PSA value must be 5.0 or higher&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have been surgically or medically castrated; if the method of castration&#xD;
             was luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists (leuprolide or goserelin) or&#xD;
             antagonists (degarelix), then the patient must be willing to continue the use of LHRH&#xD;
             agonists or antagonists; serum testosterone must be at castration levels (&lt; 50 ng/dL)&#xD;
             within 3 months prior to registration&#xD;
