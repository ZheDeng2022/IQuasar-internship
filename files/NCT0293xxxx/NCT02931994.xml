      Removal and prevention of formation of dental plaque biofilms is one of the current hygiene&#xD;
      regimen to prevent, reduce or even reverse the gingival and periodontal disease condition. In&#xD;
      such endeavors of mechanical plaque removal, tooth-brushing and use of dental floss play an&#xD;
      important role. Gomes et al have presented a modification in the use of knotted floss in&#xD;
      wider embrasure areas. The modification in the dental floss has been done so as to increase&#xD;
      the effective width of the floss. The purpose of this study is to compare the reduction of&#xD;
      the clinical signs of plaque accumulation, gingival inflammation and gingival trauma in the&#xD;
      area the knotted floss technique has been utilized versus the area where conventional&#xD;
      flossing has been utilized in Type I gingival embrasures. Patients' acceptability of the&#xD;
      knotted flossing technique will also be evaluated. This study is part of a larger study&#xD;
      protocol involving different sample groups comparing the knotted floss technique with&#xD;
      conventional dental flossing, use of interdental brushes and unitufted brushes in type II and&#xD;
      type III embrasures as well.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been well established that the origin of gingivitis and periodontal diseases occurs by&#xD;
      the colonization, accumulation and subsequent maturation of bacterial plaque, (Loe et al&#xD;
      1965, Socransky 1970), and mediated by the host immunological response (Lewis et al, 2004).&#xD;
      Since, oral bacteria in plaque biofilms are an essential component in the dental diseases&#xD;
      processes, most of current preventive oral health care focuses on thorough plaque removal so&#xD;
      as to prevent, reduce or even reverse the disease condition. (Suomi 1971, Schmid et al 1976).&#xD;
      In such endeavors of thorough plaque removal and especially prevention of its further&#xD;
      accumulation, dental surgeons and hygienists have commonly recommended daily mechanical&#xD;
      plaque removal, specifically tooth-brushing. Use of toothbrush to mechanically remove plaque&#xD;
      is extremely effective, but yet is not able to remove it thoroughly from interdental areas&#xD;
      when used alone (Hansen &amp; Gjermo 1971) Routine use of dental floss in conjunction with&#xD;
      tooth-brushing has been shown to reduce the onset and severity of gingivitis (Bergenholtz &amp;&#xD;
      Britton 1980, Carter-Hanson et al 1996) Patients' reluctance and inability to perform&#xD;
      flossing on a regular basis has been mentioned (Kresh 1976). In addition, to plaque control,&#xD;
      patients also utilize flossing to clear the interdental areas wherein food impaction has&#xD;
      occurred (Gjermo &amp; Flotra 1970). Schmid (1984) has classified interdental embrasures,&#xD;
      depending upon the filling of the gingival embrasure by the interdental papilla. Hence in&#xD;
      Type I, floss is used, and in Type II and III the incrementally wider proxabrush and&#xD;
      unitufted brush are used respectively. Gomes et al have presented a modification in the use&#xD;
      of knotted floss in wider embrasure areas. (Gomes et al 2016). The modification in the dental&#xD;
      floss had been done so as to increase the effective width of the floss. This enables it to be&#xD;
      used in embrasures wider than that recommended for conventional floss. In this modification,&#xD;
      a knot is tied in the floss at any distance in the middle third of the floss length. The&#xD;
      floss is inserted past the interdental contact point by the conventional finger flossing&#xD;
      technique in the non-knotted area and then during the 'to and fro movement' on the tooth&#xD;
      surface cervical to contact point, the knotted area is engaged through the embrasure (Gomes&#xD;
      et al 2016) The purpose of this study is to compare the reduction of the clinical signs of&#xD;
      plaque accumulation, gingival inflammation and gingival trauma in the area the knotted floss&#xD;
      technique has been utilized versus the area where conventional flossing has been utilized in&#xD;
      Type I gingival embrasures. Patients' acceptability of the knotted flossing technique will&#xD;
      also be evaluated. This study is part of a larger study protocol involving different sample&#xD;
      groups comparing the knotted floss technique with conventional dental flossing, use of&#xD;
      inter-dental brushes and unitufted brushes in type II and type III embrasures as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of thirty subjects will be selected based on the model used by Carter-Hanson et&#xD;
      al 1996. Prior to commencement of the actual study, each volunteer will receive written and&#xD;
      verbal instructions on the two techniques. The principal and third investigator will&#xD;
      demonstrate to the volunteers both techniques on models, for half hour counseling session,&#xD;
      for three consecutive days. Each counseling session will not have more than 10 participants.&#xD;
      On the third day the volunteer's proficiency on models in both techniques will be confirmed&#xD;
      by both demonstrators separately, informed consent will be taken and the volunteer will be&#xD;
      enrolled as subject into the fourteen week, 2-phase crossover, single (examiner) blind study&#xD;
      protocol with washout in-between phases. Failure by the volunteer to perform the techniques&#xD;
      as instructed will result in another counseling session of half hour or he/she will not be&#xD;
      included in the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first phase, 50% of the subjects will be randomly assigned to use either conventional&#xD;
      flossing technique, while the other 50% will be assigned to use the knotted floss technique.&#xD;
      Only the first author know about which subject will be assigned to which technique. The&#xD;
      treatment phase will consist of 6 weeks of daily use of the assigned technique followed by a&#xD;
      'washout period' of 14 days, following which will start the second treatment phase wherein&#xD;
      the subject will use the other flossing technique. i.e those using the conventional flossing&#xD;
      technique will now use the knotted flossing technique and vice versa. At the baseline&#xD;
      appointment for each phase, every subject will be given their assigned floss products.&#xD;
      Subjects that will be assigned to conventional flossing will receive ninety pieces of waxed&#xD;
      floss, fifteen centimeters in length each piece, (Reach¬® by Johnson &amp; Johnson Inc.) equally&#xD;
      divided in three ziplock® bags. Subjects that will be assigned to knotted flossing technique&#xD;
      will receive the same except that every floss thread will have a simple knot at around the&#xD;
      middle. Each subject also will receive a sample of Colgate® Soft Toothbrush and Dentifrice&#xD;
      (Colgate® Inc). The registered subjects will be instructed to brush their teeth twice a day&#xD;
      in their customary manner using the above toothbrush and dentifrice provided and cautioned&#xD;
      not to use any other oral hygiene aid except for the assigned floss twice a day. They will be&#xD;
      instructed to wrap the floss around their middle or index finger and gently slide the floss&#xD;
      between the teeth and move it along the gum margin, curved into &quot;c&quot; shape. After this, they&#xD;
      will have to move the floss up and down several times between each tooth without using&#xD;
      excessive pressure, finally allowing it out through embrasure. The subjects will have to&#xD;
      return to the third author any unused floss products at the end of the phase. During the&#xD;
      'washout period' the subjects will be instructed to perform normal oral hygiene practices of&#xD;
      tooth-brushing with dentifrice and refrain from using any floss or any additional plaque&#xD;
      control aids. The &quot;washout&quot; period is designed so as to give subjects time to return to their&#xD;
      original oral status and establish parity in baseline clinical measurements prior to starting&#xD;
      the second treatment phase. Such a 'washout' in study design allowed use of 50% lesser&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluations of all subjects will be done at 2-weekly intervals, namely baseline, 2&#xD;
      weeks, 4 weeks and 6 weeks of each treatment phase. Both adjacent teeth and gingiva at test&#xD;
      sites will be scored for the Rustogi Modification of Navy Plaque Index, the Modified Gingival&#xD;
      Index (Lobene 1986) and the Modified Papillary Bleeding Index (Barnett 1980). A plaque&#xD;
      disclosing agent will be used to identify the location and amount of plaque. Additionally,&#xD;
      gingival trauma will be assessed as presence or absence of signs of trauma in the marginal&#xD;
      and papillary gingiva of adjacent teeth. The facial and lingual surfaces will be examined&#xD;
      visually for gingival lacerations. Presence of laceration, floss cut, or demarcation&#xD;
      line/indentation at the site will be scored as one, while a score of zero (0) will be&#xD;
      recorded in the absence of any signs of trauma. The score per subject will be obtained by&#xD;
      totaling all scores and dividing by number of sites examined (Carter-Hanson 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The indices will be recorded by second and fourth investigator. Intra- and inter-examiner&#xD;
      reliability will be established prior to commencement of the study and at two weekly&#xD;
      intervals. The study schedule will be so distributed such that not more than six subjects&#xD;
      report for examination on any given day of the week. The two examiners will have no knowledge&#xD;
      as to which technique the subject is using and the amount of unused floss if any at end of&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject compliance A compliance diary will also be given to each subject at the baseline&#xD;
      appointment of each treatment phase and will be collected at the end of each phase by third&#xD;
      investigator. The subjects will be instructed to record each flossing experience in this&#xD;
      diary and any other event he/she felt significant. Compliance will further be established by&#xD;
      dispensing a specific amount (90 pieces) of assigned floss product per treatment phase. At&#xD;
      the conclusion of each treatment phase, the subjects will return to principal or third&#xD;
      investigator, any unused portion of floss product and thus non-compliance will be estimated.&#xD;
      Additionally, the patient satisfaction questionnaire will substantiate subject compliance.&#xD;
      This questionnaire will be answered by every subject at the end of the second and final&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
