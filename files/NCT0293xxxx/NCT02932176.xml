    <textblock>
      The use of handheld arterial 'stethoscopes' (continuous wave Doppler devices) are ubiquitous&#xD;
      in clinical practice. However, most users have received no formal training in their use or&#xD;
      the interpretation of the returned data. This leads to delays in diagnosis and errors in&#xD;
      diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to create a novel machine-learning algorithm to assist clinicians in&#xD;
      the use of this data. This study will allow the investigators to collect sound files from the&#xD;
      use of the devices and compare the algorithms output to established, existing vascular&#xD;
      testing. There will be no invasive procedures, and use of these stethoscopes is part of&#xD;
      routine clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If successful, this data and algorithm will be later deployed via smartphone app for point of&#xD;
      case testing in a separate study&#xD;

      There are three main research tasks for this project: 1) the identification of discriminant&#xD;
      features of Doppler audio for patient classification, 2) the selection and training of&#xD;
      classification algorithms, and 3) CWD audio data enrichment using physics-based models. The&#xD;
      investigators will determine which discriminant features are optimal for patient&#xD;
      classification from ultrasound Doppler audio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this end, the investigators will employ signal features in the frequency domain such as&#xD;
      bandwidth, peak frequency, mean power, mean frequency, and time harmonic distortion, among&#xD;
      others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators will investigate whether time domain features are necessary&#xD;
      for accurate sound classification. Other studies have shown that specific features of audio&#xD;
      waveforms can classify the data. The investigators will employ some of the most effective&#xD;
      machine-learning algorithms for classification such as SVM, logistic regression, and Na√Øve&#xD;
      Bayes, among others. The investigators will start with a binary classification problem in&#xD;
      which individuals will be classified as healthy or unhealthy. Then, the investigators will&#xD;
      move in complexity to multi-class classification problems in which individuals will be&#xD;
      categorized into different groups according to defined abnormal arterial conditions. Data&#xD;
      enrichment using physics-based models employing physiologically accurate finite element&#xD;
      models of fluid flow in arteries to generate synthetic sound signals corresponding to various&#xD;
      arterial conditions. Physics-based simulations would allow the investigators to produce a&#xD;
      wealth of training data that can span many known arterial conditions. This capability can&#xD;
      augment the classification accuracy and generalization of our algorithms, as clinical data&#xD;
      may not be exhaustive enough to incorporate all the known arterial conditions. The&#xD;
      investigators will study the performance of the trained algorithms on patient data. To this&#xD;
      end, the investigators will partition the data into training and testing samples. The&#xD;
      training samples will be used for training of the algorithms, while the testing set will be&#xD;
      used to assess generalization capability. The investigators will compute misclassification&#xD;
      rates for each algorithm as a metric for performance.&#xD;
