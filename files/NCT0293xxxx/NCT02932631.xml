  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that worldwide, about 15 million people are affected by vascular accident&#xD;
      (CVA) per year, and in Brazil, the stroke is a major cause of death and disability,&#xD;
      generating too much economic and social impact by generating motor sequelae , sensory and&#xD;
      cognitive arising from blockage or rupture of blood vessels. Among the motor sequelae is the&#xD;
      hemiparesis, which affects about 80% of cases with consequent impairment of the quality of&#xD;
      life of individuals. However, physical therapy has shown to facilitate return of the function&#xD;
      of these individuals, while minimizing the sensorimotor deficits for promoting neuronal&#xD;
      plasticity through the motor relearning. Among the features of physical therapy are the&#xD;
      conventional physical therapy techniques, Therapy and Restriction of Movement Induction&#xD;
      (TRIM) and the Mental Practice. In view of this, the objective of the study is to compare the&#xD;
      application of conventional physiotherapy protocols and TRIM and / or mental practice on the&#xD;
      morphometric features, functionality and quality of life of post-stroke hemiparetic subjects&#xD;
      in the chronic phase. 60 volunteers will be selected, of both sexes, aged between 45 and 80&#xD;
      years with a clinical diagnosis of stroke, with hemiparesis in the chronic phase were divided&#xD;
      into four groups (N = 15): control group (CG), TRIM Group (GT), Mental Practice group (GPM)&#xD;
      and group TRIM + Mental Practice (GTPM) to perform specific exercises for each group for&#xD;
      three times a week, totaling 24 sessions. Volunteers will be evaluated in four times through&#xD;
      the Fugl-Meyer Assessment scale (FMA) adapted and Motor Ability Test of the Upper Limb&#xD;
      (THMMS) and to assess the Quality of Life will be used Quality Scale Specific Life Vascular&#xD;
      Accident brainstem (EQVE-AVE) and oxidative stress analysis by collecting blood and&#xD;
      electromyography for muscular activity. After the research data will be tabulated on an Excel&#xD;
      spreadsheet to perform intergroup and intragroup comparisons between the four evaluation&#xD;
      times, which will be used for data analysis the BioEstat® 5.2 program, the choice of tests&#xD;
      for analysis dependent on the statistical distribution types found and the homogeneity of&#xD;
      their variances.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sample is composed of 60 volunteers of both sexes, with a clinical diagnosis of stroke&#xD;
      (CVA) with injury over six months time that characterizes the chronic stage of the disease&#xD;
      and present hemiparesis in upper limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES AND DATA COLLECTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will be divided into the following steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE 1: The search will begin with an invitation to volunteers to participate in the study,&#xD;
      through posters and verbal invitation. Then, a pre-selection candidates by applying MMSE will&#xD;
      be performed, Jaeger card and Whisper test in order to evaluate the existence of cognitive&#xD;
      impairment, visual and auditory respectively. If they can make up the sample, volunteers will&#xD;
      be selected as meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and researchers will deliver&#xD;
      two-way the IC explaining how occur the research objectives of the Office and application of&#xD;
      the Protocol and deliver two-way also statement of photographs and footage authorization for&#xD;
      display permit photos and footage. It is noteworthy that both routes of the term and&#xD;
      Declaration will be signed on every page by volunteers, which will be a copy of each document&#xD;
      with the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the procedures and data collection, the researchers will be trained in the&#xD;
      application of all instruments of evaluation and handling of resources to be used in the&#xD;
      treatment of volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2nd STAGE: Volunteers will be evaluated through the scale application of FMA and THMMS in&#xD;
      order to analyze the functionality and ability of MS and QOL will be assessed by EQVE-stroke&#xD;
      as described in materials in this methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amplitude of the paretic upper limb movement will also be assessed by goniometry&#xD;
      scapulohumeral humeral joint, shoulder, elbow, wrist, thumb interphalangeal and where use of&#xD;
      a universal manual goniometer and another smaller toward the measuring fingers. The first&#xD;
      measure goniometric be obtained after the patient's arrival in treatment- place in the&#xD;
      pre-treatment. The following measures will be during treatment (12 ° session) and the&#xD;
      immediate and late stages after the treatment. To perform such a procedure will be asked to&#xD;
      volunteers who remain supine on a stretcher, followed by the sitting position in a chair, the&#xD;
      latter should position the upper limb aligned to the trunk and forearm to be evaluated on a&#xD;
      small table, a neutral pronation and supination with the elbow held in 90 ° of flexion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3rd STAGE: Next muscle electromyographic activity will be measured by electromyography&#xD;
      apparatus of Miotec ®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will conduct the test in a well-lit room with adequate ventilation and environment&#xD;
      without noise, which will be placed in the sitting position with arm supported on fixed&#xD;
      surface and so will surface electrodes connected on the paretic upper limb having as guidance&#xD;
      for positioning electrodes muscular motor points previously located by an electrical&#xD;
      stimulator and coupled with a conductive gel, so as to promote a more stable transitions and&#xD;
      tendon insertions in order to quantitatively analyze the information sent nerve member.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will be asked to volunteer to perform three isometric contractions for four&#xD;
      seconds each with two intervals between contractions two minutes, and asked each contraction&#xD;
      the patient to reach its maximum strength. The muscles to be analyzed will be the flexors of&#xD;
      fingers flexors wrist flexor ulnar elbow flexors, shoulder flexors and internal rotators of&#xD;
      the shoulder, the answers will be measured and displayed on a computer screen that will be&#xD;
      BIOPAC ® system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4th STAGE: As for the functional range of the MS paretic will be measured by the functional&#xD;
      reach test, adapted to the sitting position, in which the individual will be sitting without&#xD;
      armrest in the chair for the upper limb, positioned laterally to the wall, with shoulder 15&#xD;
      cm away from this without touching it at any time, with feet parallel in a comfortable&#xD;
      position, keeping the shoulder near the wall flexed to 90 °. A tape measure is fixed parallel&#xD;
      to the floor, positioned at the height of the acromion. The volunteer will then be instructed&#xD;
      to lean forward as much as possible; the displacement to be measured on the tape with three&#xD;
      attempts functional range, then obtaining the average of the three.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5th STEP: Then, for the collection of handgrip strength in paretic MS will be used hydraulic&#xD;
      dynamometer handgrip Jamar® where with volunteers in the sitting position in the bed,&#xD;
      standing with the shoulder in neutral position, elbows and wrist in 90 ° neutral position,&#xD;
      the therapist will support the dynamometer. Volunteers will be instructed to perform three&#xD;
      handgrip maneuvers reaching maximum voluntary contraction with each hand, with one-minute&#xD;
      interval between one operation and another. After the collection will be the simple&#xD;
      arithmetic average entrees the three measures collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These procedures in the study will take place in four stages: before the start of treatment&#xD;
      that correspond to the pre-treatment; after the 12th session that correspond to intermediate&#xD;
      treatment; immediately after the 24th session, which will correspond to the immediate&#xD;
      post-treatment; and the total intervention time equal to 24 sessions, which will be&#xD;
      distributed in three weekly sessions held on alternate days (Monday, Wednesday and Friday).&#xD;
      After evaluating the functionality evaluation of oxidative stress. Initially it will be&#xD;
      collected blood with a sterile needle through the lancing on the medial side of the digital&#xD;
      pulp of the fourth finger of the left hand, which will be pre-cleaned with 70% alcohol. The&#xD;
      collection of blood drop will be made with a razor through five light taps of this blade with&#xD;
      the drop microscopy. After this, at room temperature (23 ° C), the blade will be kept in&#xD;
      place protected from contact with the blood of nine minutes for the realization of the&#xD;
      collected blood clotting process. At the end of this period, the morphology of these clots is&#xD;
      microscopically observed under a 40X magnification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morphological evaluation of oxidative stress in plasm blood be evaluated according to the&#xD;
      test known as Optical Microscopy for cell analysis in vitro or HLB test, also known under the&#xD;
      designation of Dry layer oxidative test, which will be referred to as microscopic morphology&#xD;
      oxidative stress in plasm (EEW).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EEW provides indirect information on to oxidative stress, among others, using the&#xD;
      following grading system the percentage of the discontinuous area of clot present in&#xD;
      microscope slide: grade I (normal oxidative stress rate, with total area of discontinuous&#xD;
      extracellular matrix (ME) less than 10%), grade II (mild stress, with ME discontinuity area&#xD;
      between 10 to 20%), grade III (moderate stress with ME discontinuity the area between 20&#xD;
      30%), grade IV (severe stress, with ME discontinuity area between 30 to 40%) and the grade V&#xD;
      (very severe stress, with the ME discontinuity area above 40%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The respective assigned qualitative graduation will be logged into a spreadsheet for further&#xD;
      analysis statistics. As a measure of standardization, the observation of morphological&#xD;
      patterns of different clots will be performed by one of the researchers associated with&#xD;
      assessment by OxyScanner the so-called program developed and marketed by Aldea Global&#xD;
      Soluciones® (SFA), which give a copy of the software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This evaluation will be done in four stages, which will use throughout the process coats,&#xD;
      disposable gloves and masks, and will be held by only one of the researchers, in order to&#xD;
      avoid bias in the research.&#xD;
