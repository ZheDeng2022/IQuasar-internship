      Anorexia means loss of appetite. But there is disagreement about whether the appetite is&#xD;
      changed by the disease anorexia nervosa (AN). Appetite is a subjective essential sense, which&#xD;
      is regulated in a complex ensemble between brain, stomach - intestinal system and hormones.&#xD;
      As a direct result of malnutrition, there are many somatic complications caused by the&#xD;
      disease AN. Several of these complications may in itself affect hunger- and satiety&#xD;
      perception. An example of this is delayed gastric emptying. Furthermore, changes in the&#xD;
      hormone systems affects the biological &quot;reward system&quot; in the brain, which plays an important&#xD;
      role in appetite regulation. There is clearly need for research that could lead to better&#xD;
      treatments for AN. Hunger- and satiety perception has only been studied in a few small&#xD;
      cross-sectional studies with no clear conclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether a visual analog scale measurement can detect&#xD;
      changes in hunger- and satiety perception in a least 30 patients admitted to nutrition for&#xD;
      life-threatening severe anorexia nervosa. It may lead to the first step in the development of&#xD;
      a simple and inexpensive instrument which may prove to be useful in measuring the impact of&#xD;
      new and ongoing treatments of the disease.&#xD;

      Appetite refers to the desire associated with eating. Both internal and external factors can&#xD;
      stimulate appetite. Hunger and satiety are included in appetite regulation. Hunger is related&#xD;
      to physiological needs and the commencement of eating. Satiety refers to a state without the&#xD;
      urge to eat, where both the onset of satiety and post ingestion satiety are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anorexia is abnormal loss of appetite for food. Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder&#xD;
      characterized by food restriction, despite low weight, leading to speculation about the&#xD;
      presence of appetite alterations by weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AN is a syndrome of unknown etiology which has been well described since 1873, and which&#xD;
      occurs most frequently in adolescent women. The syndrome is characterized by distorted body&#xD;
      image, and fear of obesity, why low ideal weight is pursued. The disorder occurs in different&#xD;
      degrees of severity with secondary endocrine and metabolic changes and disturbances. The&#xD;
      symptoms may also include excessive physical activity, abuse of laxatives, or diuretics and&#xD;
      self-induced vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are multiple medical complications due to the starvation and weight loss in AN, several&#xD;
      of which directly may affect appetite, for instance, delayed emptying of the stomach and&#xD;
      constipation. Furthermore, compression of duodenum has been observed causing nausea and early&#xD;
      satiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothalamic hypogonadism is one of the well-known adaptive endocrine alterations in AN due&#xD;
      to starvation and exaggerated exercise. Progesterone and testosterone is believed to&#xD;
      stimulate appetite and eating, in a manner mediated centrally, selectively increasing the&#xD;
      number of meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, AN patients have significantly higher levels of ghrelin, growth hormone (GH) and&#xD;
      cortisol and significantly lower leptin, compared with partially recovered AN patients and&#xD;
      constitutionally thin subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hunger and satiety are subjective sensations which may be influenced by sensory factors and&#xD;
      palatability, including taste, smell and texture. A recent study suggested that patients with&#xD;
      AN may have an altered perception of olfactory, gustatory stimuli, and reduced perception of&#xD;
      bitter stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other physiological factors such as, hypothalamic and mesolimbic endocannabinoids, enhance&#xD;
      appetite by stimulating neurochemical pathways underlying both homeostatic and rewarding&#xD;
      aspects of food intake. Endocannabinoids are involved in food-related reward mechanisms, and&#xD;
      there are increasing evidence that these mechanisms are dysregulated in AN patients.&#xD;
      Moreover, functional neuroimaging studies have demonstrated decreased food-related stimuli in&#xD;
      brain areas of the mesolimbic reward system in AN patients.&#xD;
