  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies show that patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) have an increased risk&#xD;
      of fracture, particularly hip fracture whose complications and postoperative mortality appear&#xD;
      to be higher than in the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This increased risk of fracture is due partly to an increased risk of falling, and secondly&#xD;
      to an impairment of bone tissue with lower bone mineral density (BMD). A meta-analysis&#xD;
      concluded that patients with IPD have lower BMD than healthy controls. Prospective studies&#xD;
      also showed rapid bone loss in these patients compared with controls. The association between&#xD;
      low BMD and IPD seems dependent on the severity and duration of the disease even if some data&#xD;
      are contradictory. Various mechanisms may explain this bone loss including weight loss,&#xD;
      malnutrition and a low level of physical activity. However, enrollments in these studies are&#xD;
      often weak and it is difficult to conclude on the real impact of these factors on bone loss&#xD;
      in the IPD. The main objective of our study is to assess and prioritize from these various&#xD;
      bone loss mechanisms. Bone assessment by &quot;peripheral quantitative computed tomography&quot; (pQCT)&#xD;
      will also assess the impact of various risk factors on bone strength parameters. The&#xD;
      prevalence of vertebral compression fractures in the IPD, at this day unknown can be&#xD;
      evaluated. This study will also estimate the prevalence of vertebral compression fractures in&#xD;
      the IPD.&#xD;
