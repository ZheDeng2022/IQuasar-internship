  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomized controlled study in patients undergoing lung resection&#xD;
      for cancer to compare the impact of multimodal intervention composed of exercise, nutritional&#xD;
      supplement and psychological well-being on functional exercise capacity. One group&#xD;
      (rehabilitation group) will receive the multimodal intervention after surgery for 8 weeks;&#xD;
      the other will start 4 weeks before surgery and continue for 8 weeks postop (prehabilitation&#xD;
      group). In this case, both groups will be exposed to the program, which will be available to&#xD;
      both groups postoperatively. One of the two groups will start this program 4 weeks before&#xD;
      surgery and continue for 8 weeks postoperatively, and the other will start once they leave&#xD;
      the hospital and continue for 8 weeks postoperatively.&#xD;

      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multidisciplinary program is composed of 3 elements: exercise, nutritional supplements&#xD;
      and psychological coping strategies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise program&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be seen by a kinesiologist for a period of 1 hour and he/she will assess&#xD;
      patients' mobility and capacity to undertake exercise, will prepare a personalized program&#xD;
      and will explain and monitor the exercise program. Patients will be instructed on how to&#xD;
      conduct aerobic exercise in the lab and at home, by either walking or cycling initially at&#xD;
      50% of the calculated heart rate reserve for 20 min three times per week, and this will be&#xD;
      increased in stepwise increments by 10% each week, if tolerable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscular resistance training will be also carried out 3 times a week to avoid muscle&#xD;
      soreness. Persons will be instructed to do push-up, sit-ups, and standing strides (lunges)&#xD;
      until volitional fatigue increasing this number to reach 12 repetitions. The resistance&#xD;
      chosen for strengthening of biceps, deltoids and quadriceps will be based on what the person&#xD;
      can lift to reach volitional fatigue with 8 repetitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological program&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that patients undergoing surgery for cancer are anxious with some component of&#xD;
      depression. Since both anxiety and depression can influence the motivation to carry out&#xD;
      social and functional activities, psychological strategies can be put in place to help&#xD;
      patients to cope with the stress of surgery and disease. For this reason patients will be&#xD;
      seen by a trained psychologist. Patients will receive a total of 1.5 hours of psychological&#xD;
      intervention in the first session and more sessions if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first preoperative session, the first hour will address the patient's anxieties,&#xD;
      coping strategies, and post-operative expectations, with the goal of optimizing psychological&#xD;
      well-being &amp; ways of coping with surgery. The importance of the patient's active&#xD;
      participation in the healing process will also be discussed. The last thirty minutes will be&#xD;
      devoted to teaching relaxation techniques and breathing exercises. Patients will be given a&#xD;
      relaxation CD to take home for practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional supplementation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nutritional status of patients affected by lung cancer is directly influenced by the&#xD;
      presence of cancer, which impacts on all aspects of intermediary (protein, carbohydrate,&#xD;
      lipid, trace element, vitamin) metabolism, and by other factors such as age, adjuvant cancer&#xD;
      therapy and stage of the disease. The greater sensitivity of protein catabolism to&#xD;
      nutritional support, in particular to amino acids, could have important implications for the&#xD;
      nutritional management of these patients during the period of catabolic stress, with&#xD;
      particular emphasis on substrate utilization and energy requirement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients' nutritional status and dietary intake will be assessed by the nutritionist.&#xD;
      Percentage of lean body mass and fat percentage will be measured. All patients will receive a&#xD;
      daily dietary supplement known as whey protein (Immunocal, Immunotec Â©). Special precautions&#xD;
      will be considered if patients have specific medical conditions (e.g. diabetes).&#xD;

    <description>The 6MWT evaluates the ability of an individual to maintain a moderate level of physical activity over a time period reflective of the activities of daily living. Subjects are instructed to walk back and forth, in a 20 m stretch of hallway, for six minutes, at a pace that would make them tired by the end of the walk; encouragement and feedback are given according to published guidelines.</description>
