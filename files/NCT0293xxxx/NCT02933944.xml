  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine safety and anti-tumor immune activation generated&#xD;
      by TG02 and Granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), first as monotherapy&#xD;
      (Part I), thereafter in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab (Part II), in&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced primary and recurrent colorectal cancer scheduled to have&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I will include 4-6 patients and Part II will include up to 10 patients. Part I and Part&#xD;
      II are separate and independent sequential components of the study. Patients will only be&#xD;
      able to participate in either the Part I cohort or Part II cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective of the study is to investigate safety and immune response after&#xD;
      TG02-treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Part I: The TG02-treatment consists of an intradermal injection of GM-CSF followed by an injection of TG02. The GM-CSF is to be given 15-30 minutes before TG02. TG02-treatment will be administered on Days 1, 8, 15, 22 and 36. If surgery after week 10, TG02-treatment will also be given at week 10 (Day 64).&#xD;
Part II: TG02-treatment will be given as described under Part I. In addition pembrolizumab will be administered.</description>

             criteria, the investigator shall contact the medical monitor to discuss the&#xD;
