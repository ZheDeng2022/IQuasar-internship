  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Consecutive patients with cirrhosis and septic shock with AKI who give written informed&#xD;
      consent will be included in this prospective trial. At baseline NT-Pro BNP, urine N-GAL will&#xD;
      be done for all patients. A baseline serum blood sample (10 ml) and urine sample will be&#xD;
      stored. Septic shock will be defined by the presence of two or more diagnostic criteria for&#xD;
      the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, proven or suspected infection with hypotension&#xD;
      non-responsive to adequate fluid resuscitation assessed by no evidence of stroke volume&#xD;
      variation on flow track and need of a vasopressor to achieve a target mean arterial pressure&#xD;
      (MAP) of â‰¥ 65 mm Hg. A record of CVP, IVC diameter and B-lines on ultrasound lung would also&#xD;
      be done. Patients with age less than 18 years, severe known cardiopulmonary disease&#xD;
      (structural or valvular heart disease, coronary artery disease, COPD) pregnancy, chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease on hemodialysis, patients already meeting emergency criteria for immediate&#xD;
      hemodialysis at the time of randomization as specified in the late group, patients&#xD;
      transferred from other hospitals who have already been on hemodialysis before their arrival&#xD;
      in the intensive care unit, extremely moribund patients with an expected life expectancy of&#xD;
      less than 24 hours, failure to give informed consent from family members.&#xD;
