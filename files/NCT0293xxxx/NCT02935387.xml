  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients in remission with a combination of TNFinhibitors (TNFi)&#xD;
      and methotrexate (MTX) often express their wish to stop MTX treatment because of side&#xD;
      effects. Given the efficacy of TNFi it is conceivable that in early RA patients in remission&#xD;
      with methotrexate (MTX)/TNFi stepwise discontinuation of MTX prior to TNFi is superior in&#xD;
      maintaining sustained remission and reaching drug free remission as compared to&#xD;
      discontinuation of TNFi prior to MTX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To investigate whether tapering MTX first, then the TNFi golimumab (GOL), is more&#xD;
      efficacious than tapering GOL first, then MTX, in sustaining remission and reaching drug free&#xD;
      remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: multicenter, open label clinical trial in very early RA patients. Remission&#xD;
      will be induced by an open label treat-to-target (T2T) remission induction protocol in&#xD;
      clinical care: (MTX, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), i.m. glucocorticoids (GC), and, if not in&#xD;
      remission, the TNFi golimumab (GOL)) (phase I, 3/4th or 1 year). Patients in sustained&#xD;
      remission on MTX/GOL (DAS28&lt;2.6 with max 4 swollen joints of the 44 swollen joint count (SJC)&#xD;
      at 2 consecutive visits 3 months apart) will be randomized to taper either MTX first, then&#xD;
      GOL or GOL first, then MTX with as primary endpoint sustained (drug free) remission (phase&#xD;
      II, 1 year). During 1 year additional follow-up maintenance of drug-free sustained remission&#xD;
      will be investigated (phase III).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: RA patients fulfilling 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/EUropean&#xD;
      League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria for RA, with symptom duration &lt;12 months; naïve&#xD;
      for anti-rheumatic drugs and glucocorticoids for RA; DAS28 ≥3.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Patients in sustained remission (defined as DAS28&lt;2.6 with max 4 swollen joints&#xD;
      of the 44SJC at ≥ 2 consecutive visits 3 months apart) on MTX/GOL at the end of phase I&#xD;
      (after 24 weeks of treatment with MTX/GOL) will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to taper&#xD;
      medication as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Taper and stop GOL first during 24 weeks, then, if still in sustained remission, taper&#xD;
           and stop MTX during 24 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Taper and stop MTX first during 24 weeks, then, if still in sustained remission, taper&#xD;
           and stop GOL during 24 weeks The primary end point is the proportion of patients in&#xD;
           sustained remission at week 24 after start of tapering of either MTX or GOL first. The&#xD;
           main secondary end point is the proportion of patients in drug-free sustained remission,&#xD;
           at week 48 after start of tapering.&#xD;
