  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use is considered to be a significant risk factor among those who die by suicide,&#xD;
      especially among those who drink to regulate their emotions. Unfortunately, there is a dearth&#xD;
      of treatment outcome research for suicidal heavy drinkers. Further, treatments that target&#xD;
      this population must be maximally effective, with promise for wide dissemination. The&#xD;
      application of technology has been increasingly utilized as an efficacious and acceptable way&#xD;
      to rapidly disseminate evidence-base treatment. However, these methods are used infrequently&#xD;
      for individuals deemed too high risk for computerized treatment. Along these lines, the goal&#xD;
      of this project is to begin a line of research focused on developing interventions to reduce&#xD;
      heavy drinking and risk for suicide through the use of technology. Dialectical Behavior&#xD;
      Therapy (DBT) skills training is an effective intervention for behaviors associated with&#xD;
      emotion dysregulation including addictive and suicidal behaviors. Further, DBT skills use has&#xD;
      been identified as the active ingredient for treatment effectiveness; thus, a skills training&#xD;
      intervention delivered via the Internet has the capacity to be a potent and efficient method&#xD;
      of treatment delivery. The goal of this research is to establish a proof of concept for&#xD;
      developing and evaluating a potentially efficacious and acceptable intervention for heavy&#xD;
      episodic drinkers who are suicidal. Specifically, this project proposes to conduct a&#xD;
      randomized controlled pilot trial of a computerized DBT skills training intervention for&#xD;
      suicidal individuals who engage in heavy episodic drinking (HED) to regulate emotions. The&#xD;
      project's aims are to conduct a randomized controlled pilot trial of cDBT vs. a Wait-list&#xD;
      control (WL). This pilot trial is not intended to demonstrate that cDBT works better than&#xD;
      other interventions in improving clinical indices, but rather to determine whether further&#xD;
      revisions of the cDBT intervention are needed and will inform the design of a subsequent&#xD;
      full-scale randomized controlled trial.&#xD;

      It is well established that clinical research should focus on streamlining treatments in ways&#xD;
      that maximizes their potency and ease of implementation. The application of technology has&#xD;
      been increasingly utilized as an effective and acceptable way to rapidly disseminate&#xD;
      evidence-base treatment. However, these methods are used infrequently for individuals deemed&#xD;
      too high risk for computerized psychotherapy. This atheoretical approach to participant&#xD;
      exclusion broadens the treatment gap among those in dire need of treatment. Along these&#xD;
      lines, the primary goal of this project is to establish a proof of concept for developing and&#xD;
      evaluating an efficacious and acceptable intervention for heavy episodic drinkers who are&#xD;
      suicidal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This scope has been selected to increase feasibility for this pilot trial and to allow&#xD;
      comparison with a wait-list control condition, providing important groundwork for a&#xD;
      subsequent randomized control trial. The proposed research will take place in one phase and&#xD;
      will fall within Stage 1a and 1b of the updated Stage Model for Behavioral Therapy Research.&#xD;
      This project will consist of a randomized controlled pilot trial, an initial &quot;strong test&quot; of&#xD;
      efficacy of cDBT for the treatment of HED and suicidal behaviors, using a between groups&#xD;
      design. This method of intervention delivery (e.g. computerization) will allow for ease of&#xD;
      transition to subsequent stages that fit the updated scope of Behavioral Therapy Research&#xD;
      which highlight the need for dissemination and implementation. The overall aim of this&#xD;
      project is not to demonstrate that cDBT works better than other interventions in improving&#xD;
      outcomes, but rather to provide preliminary evidence that the intervention is feasible and&#xD;
      efficacious in producing change when delivered through an easily disseminated and acceptable&#xD;
      method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of computerized DBT Skills Training will be to eliminate HED and suicidal&#xD;
      behavior that function to regulate emotions while simultaneously increasing behavioral&#xD;
      control through the use of functional, skillful behavior. cDBT-ER is an existing 8-week&#xD;
      computerized skills intervention that targets difficulties in emotion regulation and includes&#xD;
      numerous skills that explicitly target modifying emotional states. DBT skills translate well&#xD;
      into computerized interventions, as they are based on learning models in which patients are&#xD;
      taught reproducible skills to be used in their environment. The proposed intervention will&#xD;
      require adding the DBT addiction skills to target heavy drinking as well as including a&#xD;
      computerized version of a risk assessment protocol to assess suicidal urges electronically.&#xD;
      The DBT addiction skills draw largely from relapse prevention and include DBT adaptations of&#xD;
      Harm Reduction (via &quot;Dialectical Abstinence&quot;) and Urge Surfing (via &quot;Burning Bridges). The&#xD;
      addiction skills have been implemented in numerous DBT studies that explicitly target&#xD;
      addictive behavior with positive outcomes in reducing substance and alcohol use. Thus, cDBT&#xD;
      would teach clients ways to reduce and eliminate alcohol consumption, along with skillful&#xD;
      behaviors to effectively manage negative emotions.&#xD;
