      Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is the most common chronic complication of diabetes, affecting up&#xD;
      to50% of individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1DM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple pre-clinical and clinical studies demonstrate a pathogenic role for inflammation,&#xD;
      especially cytokine production, in the disease course of DN and CAN. This suggests that&#xD;
      agents with known anti-inflammatory properties, such as salicylates, may prevent the&#xD;
      development of DN and the pain associated with DN. This study builds upon and expands on&#xD;
      prior work done by the investigators with salsalate, a pro-drug form of salicylate, as an&#xD;
      agent to address inflammatory pathways in people with T1DM.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is the most common chronic complication of diabetes, affecting up&#xD;
      to50% of individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). DN is a progressive disease, leading to&#xD;
      severe morbidity and staggering health care costs. Patients experience poor quality of life&#xD;
      due to pain, loss of sensation leading to poor balance, falls and eventual foot deformities&#xD;
      with high rates of ulcerations and amputations. While not as commonly diagnosed as DN,&#xD;
      cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) carries equal morbidity with patients experiencing&#xD;
      orthostasis, arrhythmias and premature death).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the high morbidity associated with DN, most randomized clinical trials evaluating&#xD;
      therapies for established DN have been disappointing. To date there is no pathogenetic&#xD;
      treatment for this condition. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)&#xD;
      demonstrated that intensive control designed to achieve near-normal glycemia is essential in&#xD;
      reducing the risk of DN development in type 1 diabetes (8, 9). However, attainable intensive&#xD;
      glycemic control, although necessary, is insufficient to prevent adverse nervous system&#xD;
      effects, justifying a therapeutic need to identify new drug targets to treat DN early in its&#xD;
      course. One such new therapeutic target is inflammation. Multiple pre-clinical and clinical&#xD;
      studies demonstrate a pathogenic role for inflammation, especially cytokine production, in&#xD;
      the disease course of DN and CAN. This suggests that agents with known anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      properties, such as salicylates, may prevent the development of DN and the pain associated&#xD;
      with DN. Salsalate, a pro-drug form of salicylate, is a FDA approved drug commonly indicated&#xD;
      for relief of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and related&#xD;
      rheumatic disorders. In vitro and in vivo studies and human trials have shown that salicylate&#xD;
      therapy is effective in controlling low grade inflammation in diabetes by inhibition of the&#xD;
      inhibitor of the κB kinase (IKKβ)/NF-κB pathway. It has a large margin of safety (unlike&#xD;
      other salicylates), and a low cost. There is also extensive experience with long-term human&#xD;
      use of salsalate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies show that salsalate causes no greater intestinal occult blood loss than&#xD;
      placebo and has no suppressive effects on renal prostaglandin production in contrast to&#xD;
      aspirin or NSAIDs. The recently published NIDDK-funded &quot;Targeting Inflammation Using&#xD;
      Salsalate in Type 2 Diabetes (TINSAL-T2D)&quot; trial confirmed salutary effects of 3.5 gram/day&#xD;
      salsalate on markers of inflammation, glucose control and overall safety after 48 weeks&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes. The Investigators' initial NIDDK funded R03 (DK 094499) grant&#xD;
      confirmed the safety and feasibility of targeting inflammation with salsalate treatment in&#xD;
      T1DM subjects with DN. The Investigators' current study builds upon and expands their initial&#xD;
      promising results and will either confirm or refute the therapeutic efficacy of salsalate in&#xD;
      a larger T1DM cohort.&#xD;

    <description>Change from baseline to month 12 in the intraepidermal nerve fiber density. IENFD, is a continuous measure of small fiber neuropathy, with high positive and negative predictive values along with a high diagnostic efficiency in differentiating between subjects with and without neuropathy. The morphometric quantification of IENFD, most commonly expressed as the number of IENFs per length of section (IENF/mm e.g. density) is possible with skin biopsy (IENFD) at the distal thigh.</description>

&#xD;
          9. requiring long-term glucocorticoid therapy or chronic immunosuppressive therapy;&#xD;
             Inhaled steroid use for management of asthma is not an absolute exclusion.&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. You have developed keloid scarring in the past. Keloids are large, thick masses of&#xD;
             scar tissue. These are more common among dark-skinned people.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. presence of any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator would make it&#xD;
             unlikely for the subject to complete 12 months of study participation, e.g., history&#xD;
             of non- adherence to therapeutic regimens, presence of conditions likely to limit life&#xD;
             expectancy, living situation that would interfere with study visit schedules such as a&#xD;
             job requiring frequent or extended travel&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. known hypersensitivity to salsalate. Patients who have experienced asthma, hives, or&#xD;
             other allergic-type reactions to aspirin or other NSAIDs are excluded from&#xD;
             participation. Patients with known or suspected aspirin or NSAID-sensitive asthma are&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, subjects with concurrent chicken pox, influenza, flu-like symptoms or other&#xD;
        symptomatic viral illnesses should not be enrolled in the study until the illness or&#xD;
        condition has resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with known or suspected hypersensitivity to lidocaine or epinephrine may not be&#xD;
        able to participate as these agents are used for local anesthesia during skin biopsies. The&#xD;
        study investigators should consider the nature and severity of past reported reactions to&#xD;
        these agents, and may consider alternative anesthesia options for local anesthesia on a&#xD;
        case by case basis.&#xD;
