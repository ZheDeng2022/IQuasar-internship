      In this Austrian observational study preterm infants born with a birth weight &lt;1500 g and a&#xD;
      gestational age &lt;32 weeks will be investigated at the neonatal outpatient clinic. Infants&#xD;
      will be stratified according their feeding regimen (breast, formula and combined feeding) and&#xD;
      their introduction of solid foods (early complementary feeding group: &lt;17th week of life&#xD;
      corrected for prematurity, late complementary feeding group: ≥17th week of life corrected for&#xD;
      prematurity). Nutrient intakes and anthropometric parameters will be assessed at term, 6&#xD;
      weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months - all corrected for prematurity and with&#xD;
      40, 54 and 66 months.&#xD;

      Introduction: Evidenced-based guidelines for the introduction of complementary feeding in&#xD;
      preterm infants are not available so far. In comparison to full-term babies, there is strong&#xD;
      evidence that babies less than 1500 grams have increased nutritional needs starting with the&#xD;
      time of birth up to the second year of life to establish catch up growth and to reach the&#xD;
      main milestones in neurological development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence based data on feeding practices after discharge of the hospital, weaning and the&#xD;
      quantity and quality of complementary food are missing. With this prospective observational&#xD;
      study the investigators intend to close this knowledge gap in weaning of former preterm&#xD;
      infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In this prospective observational study preterm infants born with a birth weight&#xD;
      &lt;1500 g and a gestational age &lt;32 weeks will be recruited at term corrected for prematurity&#xD;
      at the neonatal outpatient clinic. Infants will be stratified according their source of milk&#xD;
      intake (breast milk, formula and mixed feeding) and their introduction of solid foods (early&#xD;
      complementary feeding group: &lt;17th week of life corrected for prematurity, late complementary&#xD;
      feeding group: ≥17th week of life corrected for prematurity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional intake will be estimated based on 24h Recalls at term and after 6 weeks of age&#xD;
      corrected for prematurity. Furthermore, 3-days dietary records, an average dietary record and&#xD;
      the introduction of the main food categories will be queried at 4 different time points (3&#xD;
      months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months - all corrected for prematurity) by food&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within these visits anthropometric parameters (height, head circumference and weight), data&#xD;
      on body composition (Pea Pod®, BodPod ) &amp; bio-impedance measurements will be collected. Atopy&#xD;
      will be determined by the clinical scoring system SCORAD. For follow up anthropometry and the&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcome will be assessed by the Bayley Scale at 12 &amp; 24 months corrected&#xD;
      for prematurity and at 40 months of age. Furthermore, K-ABC II (Kaufmann assessment battery&#xD;
      for children) will be performed at 66 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals: With this observational study the investigators aim to identify current feeding&#xD;
      practices in premature infants and their impact on growth, body composition, atopy and&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcome.&#xD;
