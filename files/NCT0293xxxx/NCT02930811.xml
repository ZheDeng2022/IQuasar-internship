  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) is a highly debilitating disease that affects 202 million&#xD;
      people around the world and about 7 million people in France. Morbi-mortality from&#xD;
      cardiovascular events is increased in this population. Intermittent claudication is the most&#xD;
      common clinical feature of PAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary therapeutic approach is medical treatment and advice to walk. Sildenafil, a PDEi type&#xD;
      5, is well tolerated, largely used in impotence and has interesting clinical delay and&#xD;
      duration of action in the concept of a potential use in claudication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients agreeing and signing informed consent, randomisation of treatment&#xD;
      (placebo/sildenafil) will be done. Treatment will be proposed in addition to usual treatment.&#xD;
      The experimental drug will be delivered for a 1 month treatment. First follow up visit at&#xD;
      month one will focus on tolerance, compliance and eventual side effects. If no major side&#xD;
      effect is found the study drug will then be delivered for an additional 2 months. Patients&#xD;
      will be evaluated at month 3 (second follow-up visit) for persistent or non-persistent&#xD;
      indication for revascularisation and addressed for revascularization if needed. In parallel&#xD;
      focus on tolerance, compliance and eventual side effects will be done. If no major side&#xD;
      effect is found, the study drug will be delivered for an additional 3 months treatment. Third&#xD;
      and fourth follow-up visit are scheduled at month 6 (end of treatment) and month 9 (3 months&#xD;
      after the end of experimental drugs).&#xD;
