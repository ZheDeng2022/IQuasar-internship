      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who have had a traumatic brain injury (TBI) often have trouble sleeping. TBI may also&#xD;
      alter hormones, which can cause poor sleep. Researchers believe that a form of growth hormone&#xD;
      releasing hormone (GHRH) might improve sleep in service members and veterans who have had a&#xD;
      TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if GHRH can improve sleep in people who have had a TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active duty service members or veterans (active duty in the past 10 years) ages 18-45 who&#xD;
      have had a TBI in the past 6 months to 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Getting ACTH (a hormone) through an intravenous catheter (thin plastic tube)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interview about their mood and alcohol and drug use&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires about their TBI, mood, and sleep&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 2 overnight study visits a couple weeks apart. These will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two intravenous catheters placed. Blood samples will be taken throughout the night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two shots under the skin of the belly. The shots will be GHRH on one visit and placebo on the&#xD;
      other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spending the night in the sleep lab. Their brain waves will be recorded with electrodes&#xD;
      placed on the scalp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A questionnaire in the morning about their sleep&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be called a few days after each overnight visit. They will be asked about&#xD;
      how they are feeling and to rate their sleep.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Objective: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the hallmark injury of deployment in Iraq and&#xD;
      Afghanistan. Up to one-third of service members who sustain a TBI are diagnosed with a sleep&#xD;
      disorder; insomnia being one of the most common. Currently, over half of TBI-associated&#xD;
      insomnia cases remain untreated due to poor efficacy of available pharmacologic agents.&#xD;
      Neuroendocrine dysfunction is an important mechanism linking TBI and disordered sleep, thus&#xD;
      pharmacological agents that address this dysfunction may be effective in treating TBI-related&#xD;
      insomnia. The neuroendocrine system is essential for regulating sleep and circadian function.&#xD;
      Decreased neuroendocrine function, including the hypothalamus and the somatotrophic cells of&#xD;
      the anterior pituitary, which regulate growth hormone secretion, likely contributes to&#xD;
      insomnia. This assertion is supported by previous studies that demonstrated the&#xD;
      sleep-promoting effects of growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) administration in healthy&#xD;
      controls, the elderly, and participants with depression. Therefore, we propose that&#xD;
      administration of GHRH will address the underlying mechanisms of insomnia in service members&#xD;
      and veterans who sustained a TBI, and provide a pharmacological agent more robust than&#xD;
      currently available treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: This study will recruit 50 active duty service members and veterans with a&#xD;
      documented TBI to participate in one of two study groups. The insomnia group (n=25) will&#xD;
      include participants that have a current clinical diagnosis of insomnia without obstructive&#xD;
      sleep apnea. The no-insomnia group (n=25) will include participants with no current clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis of insomnia or obstructive sleep apnea. Withdrawals/dropouts will be replaced to&#xD;
      obtain 20 participants per group who complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A double-blind, randomized, crossover design will be used to examine the impact of&#xD;
      tesamorelin (GHRH (1-44) analog) or placebo on total non-rapid eye movement (NREM) time&#xD;
      evaluated during two polysomnography visits, scheduled 1-3 weeks apart. Serial blood draws&#xD;
      will be obtained during the polysomnography to examine endocrine function and neuropeptide&#xD;
      release.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The primary outcome is change in NREM time following tesamorelin&#xD;
      administration compared to placebo. The secondary outcomes are (1) within and between group&#xD;
      differences in plasma concentration levels of neuroendocrine proteins following tesamorelin&#xD;
      administration compared to placebo and (2) within and between group differences in urinary&#xD;
      concentration levels of growth hormone following tesamorelin administration compared to&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
