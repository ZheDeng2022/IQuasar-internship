  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a workplace intervention program targeted at low SES&#xD;
      workers. Working in partnership with BJC HealthCare, we will test an innovative multi-level&#xD;
      intervention that includes an interactive obesity treatment program (iOTA) using SMS text&#xD;
      messaging. The iOTA intervention will be embedded in a newly described Healthy Workplace&#xD;
      Participatory Program, which incorporates employee participation in decision making to&#xD;
      produce changes in the workplace environment that are acceptable, effective, and sustainable.&#xD;
      These nested interventions will be tested a large delayed-start group-randomized trial. This&#xD;
      study will rigorously test readily scalable interventions that can be translated to other&#xD;
      work settings to reduce obesity and diabetes risk among low SES workers, a group at high risk&#xD;
      for these disorders. This pragmatic clinical trial will advance the long-term goal of&#xD;
      enabling employers and employees to reduce obesity and obesity-associated illnesses including&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;

      Specific Aim: Test a multi-level worksite weight loss intervention to help workers attain and&#xD;
      maintain healthy weight. Investigators propose a new group-level participatory wellness&#xD;
      program engaging all employees within intervention work groups. The proposed workplace&#xD;
      participatory program will assist work groups to adapt and deploy interventions that change&#xD;
      their work environments to support healthy eating and physical activity. Nested within this&#xD;
      group-level intervention for all workers, obese (BMI&gt;30) workers will be offered&#xD;
      participation in an individual-level interactive obesity treatment approach (iOTA)&#xD;
      intervention based on assessment of individual behavior risks, collaborative goal-setting&#xD;
      with a health coach, and use of an interactive text system to provide ongoing support and&#xD;
      self-monitoring of behavior change goals. Investigators will test these interventions in a&#xD;
      delayed-start group randomized trial in 22 work groups (total workers = 990, obese workers =&#xD;
      308).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim A: Implement and test a healthy workplace participatory program (HWPP) to&#xD;
      promote healthy eating and healthy physical activity among all workers through changes in the&#xD;
      work environment. Hypothesis: Workers in intervention groups will show improvements in&#xD;
      healthy eating and activity compared to workers in control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim B: Implement and test an innovative Individual Obesity Treatment Approach (iOTA)&#xD;
      in conjunction with changes in work environment. Hypothesis: Obese workers offered the iOTA&#xD;
      intervention will lose weight over 24 month follow-up when compared to obese control group&#xD;
      workers.&#xD;
