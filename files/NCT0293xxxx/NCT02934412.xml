  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single dose escalating, study in 5&#xD;
      sequential cohorts to investigate the effect of a single s.c. injection of SHR-1314 at 5 dose&#xD;
      levels (20mg, 40mg, 80mg, 160mg, and 240mg) in healthy subjects. Each cohort will consist of&#xD;
      6 subjects receiving active drug and 2 subjects receiving placebo, for a total of&#xD;
      approximately 40 subjects dosed at one study site.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will consist of a 27-day screening period (Days -28 to -2), clinic check-in (Day&#xD;
      -1), a treatment day (Day 1), a 10-week treatment period and a study completion evaluation&#xD;
      (Day 71) as shown in above figure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A review of blinded interim PK data will be conducted by the Safety Review Committee (SRC) to&#xD;
      confirm the study sampling schedule captures the full PK profile of SHR-1314. This interim&#xD;
      analysis will be conducted for Cohort 1 and may be conducted for subsequent cohorts if serum&#xD;
      SHR-1314 concentrations in Cohort 1 or any of the subsequent cohorts are below the limit of&#xD;
      quantification of the assay preventing evaluation of the PK profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected duration of participation for each subject will be up to 99 days. Subjects who&#xD;
      are withdrawn for reasons other than safety may be replaced at the discretion of the sponsor.&#xD;
