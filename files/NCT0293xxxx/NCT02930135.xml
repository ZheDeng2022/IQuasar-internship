  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the clinical and radiographic success of indirect pulp&#xD;
      capping of vital young permanent teeth with deep caries using two-step antibacterial bonding&#xD;
      system versus conventional one.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was carried out on patients attending outpatient clinic in Pediatric and Dental&#xD;
      Public Health department- Faculty of Oral and Dental Medicine Cairo University- Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      **Sample size: On searching, no previous studies were conducted using neither conventional&#xD;
      bonding nor antibacterial bonding in indirect pulp treatment in young permanent teeth, so&#xD;
      sample size will be measured by estimation rather than calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, all patients attended outpatient clinic in Pediatric and Dental Public Health department-&#xD;
      Faculty of Oral and Dental Medicine Cairo University- Egypt, In the period from 1/8/2015 -&#xD;
      31/10/2015 were enrolled for this study if they compatible with eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      **Clinical Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Diagnosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full personal, medical and dental history,clinical and radiographic examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Allocation concealment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selected envelopes will be opened in the first visit to allocate the patients to their&#xD;
      treatment groups .&#xD;
&#xD;
      III.Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A- Experimental Group: Indirect pulp capping with Antibacterial Two-Step Bonding System:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Local anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Isolation of tooth with rubber dam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Opening of the cavity and the removal of undermined enamel using high speed hand-piece&#xD;
           with copious air/water spray and round burs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Caries at the lateral walls of the cavity and at the dentin-enamel junction is&#xD;
           completely removed with excavators or low speed round burs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Partial removal of carious dentin (only soft disorganized dentin is removed) on the pulp&#xD;
           wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Washing the cavity with distilled water and dryness with triple airway syringe and&#xD;
           sterile cotton.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Apply antibacterial light-cure, self-etching bonding agent (Clearfil SE Protect, Kuraray&#xD;
           America, Inc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Light-cured bulk fill composite (x-tra fil, VOCO) will be used as final tooth&#xD;
           restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Postoperative digital radiograph will be taken as a base line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B- Comparative Group: Indirect pulp capping with Conventional Two-Step Bonding System Same as&#xD;
      that of the experimental group EXCEPT steps number 5 as conventional light-cure, self-etching&#xD;
      bonding agent (Clearfil SE Bond, Kuraray America, Inc.) will be applied into cavity according&#xD;
      to manufacturer's instruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Follow up and postoperative instructions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Patients will be recalled 48 hours after the treatment then at 2, 9 months&#xD;
