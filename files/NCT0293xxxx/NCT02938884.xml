    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study would be to determine whether utilization of this&#xD;
      technology improves adherence to recommended increases in hydration for stone forming&#xD;
      patients with low urine volume relative to standard techniques such as education and reading&#xD;
      materials. We hypothesize that the addition and utilization of the smart water bottle to&#xD;
      standard recommendations will lead to measurable increases 24 hour urine output for affected&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Nephrolithiasis is one of the most common and costly diseases in medicine affecting nearly&#xD;
      10% of the population. It is also the most costly urologic disease with an estimated ten&#xD;
      billion dollars per year in associated healthcare expenditures towards treating this&#xD;
      condition. One of the biggest obstacles in controlling the growing incidence of the disease&#xD;
      is better preventative care, especially considering that one third to one half of the&#xD;
      patients who have a single stone event will have another stone within the next ten to fifteen&#xD;
      years. Despite decades of research on preventative strategies to reduce stone recurrences&#xD;
      there are only a handful of dietary and medical treatments with strong evidence supporting&#xD;
      their use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the cornerstones of kidney stone prevention is ensuring adequate fluid intake. Without&#xD;
      adequate hydration, urinary volume is low which in turn increases super-saturation of all&#xD;
      stone forming salts and increases the likelihood of stone formation. The best evidence&#xD;
      supporting adequate fluid as a prevention strategy for stones comes from Borghi et al. who&#xD;
      performed a 5 year randomized control study and found a 12% recurrence rate in the cohort of&#xD;
      patients encouraged to achieve a goal of 2 liters (L) of urine per day compared to a 27%&#xD;
      recurrence in the group who was not encouraged to increase fluid intake. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      most recent guidelines by both the American Urological Association (AUA) and American College&#xD;
      of Physicians (ACP) on medical management of kidney stones advocate a goal urine volume of&#xD;
      2.5 L for all stone formers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite recommendations and evidence supporting its utility as an effective prevention&#xD;
      mechanism for stone formers, achieving significant increases in hydration and subsequently&#xD;
      urinary volumes remains a considerable clinical challenge. To date, adherence to increased&#xD;
      fluid recommendations has been understudied with little data assessing patient compliance&#xD;
      specifically for fluid. However, noncompliance with metabolic treatment of nephrolithiasis is&#xD;
      common with estimates that only 50% of patients follow recommendations.These rates are&#xD;
      similar to rates of noncompliance with recommended care in other chronic medical conditions&#xD;
      as well including diabetes, chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, and metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, mobile health technology has received much attention as a potential aide in helping&#xD;
      improve compliance with medically indicated lifestyle and dietary treatments. Early studies&#xD;
      using &quot;smart technology&quot; and mobile health applications have shown that implementation of&#xD;
      such strategies can not only be beneficial in improving compliance, but also have the&#xD;
      potential to lead to sustainable behavioral change. To date, there are no studies looking at&#xD;
      mobile health technology as it applies to increasing fluid intake, particularly among stone&#xD;
      formers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a novel &quot;smart&quot; water bottle called &quot;HidrateSpark&quot; (www.hidratespark.com) developed&#xD;
      by researchers at the University of Minnesota has been developed for use as a noninvasive&#xD;
      fluid intake monitoring system. The device uses capacitive touch sensing via a sensor&#xD;
      extending from the lid to the base, which calculates volume measurements by detecting changes&#xD;
      in water levels. Data from the bottle is sent wirelessly to users' smartphones through an&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This device has significant potential for use particularly among stone former that have&#xD;
      demonstrated difficulty increasing their hydration as a part of preventative care. The device&#xD;
      would not only allow users the ability to closely monitor their fluid intake throughout the&#xD;
      day, it would also engage the patient with reminders to drink periodically throughout the day&#xD;
      and stay hydrated. Additionally, fluid intake measurements stored through the associated&#xD;
      application have the potential to be used as a novel metric capable of being brought to the&#xD;
      provider's attention in order to better assess and guide patient hydration status and&#xD;
      identify barriers to achieving hydration goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study would be to determine whether utilization of this&#xD;
      technology improves adherence to recommended increases in hydration for stone forming&#xD;
      patients with low urine volume relative to standard techniques such as education and reading&#xD;
      materials. We hypothesize that the addition and utilization of the smart water bottle to&#xD;
      standard recommendations will lead to measurable increases 24 hour urine output for affected&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

They will download the associated free software application to their smartphone and be given education in the outpatient setting regarding how to use the system.&#xD;
All subjects in both cohorts will be provided the same questionnaire on two occasions, at the beginning and end of the trial, to determine their attitudes about fluids and potentially identify barriers to maintaining adequate hydration status (Appendix A). Additionally, standard information from the medical record including demographics, occupation, medical history and medications will be recorded.</description>
