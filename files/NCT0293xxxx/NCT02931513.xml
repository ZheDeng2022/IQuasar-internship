  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune chronic liver disease, characterised by&#xD;
      destruction of the small intrahepatic bile ducts. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the first&#xD;
      line treatment for patients with PBC. However, up to 40% of patients respond inadequate to&#xD;
      this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      sCD163 is a macrophage activation marker shedded into plasma by macrophages in the liver. sMR&#xD;
      is a soluble mannose receptor. The investigators want to investigate whether sCD163 and sMR&#xD;
      can predict response to treatment with UDCA in newly diagnosed patients with PBC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC, previously called 'primary biliary cirrhosis') is an&#xD;
      autoimmune cholestatic liver disease characterized by destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts&#xD;
      and progression to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. In the pre-cirrhotic phase, fatigue and&#xD;
      pruritus are the dominant symptoms. These symptoms reduce PBC patients' quality of life, but&#xD;
      the extent to which they cause the patient to leave the work force and seek disability&#xD;
      pension is unknown. The diagnosis of PBC is based on the presence of two of three major&#xD;
      criteria; unexplained serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) &gt;1.5 times upper normal limit for more&#xD;
      than 24 weeks, presence of anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA), and compatible liver&#xD;
      histology. Multiple models have been conducted to predict prognosis in patients with PBC. The&#xD;
      Mayo risk score is the best validated and includes information on age, bilirubin, albumin,&#xD;
      prothrombin time and peripheral oedema. Other prognostic factors are pruritus and fatigue at&#xD;
      diagnosis that predict the time to develop cirrhosis and its complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ursodeoxycholic acid is the first line treatment for all patients with PBC. Response to&#xD;
      treatment is assessed after 12 months of treatment using e.g. the Paris 1 criteria (ALP &lt;3&#xD;
      times upper normal limit, AST &lt;2 times upper normal limit, and bilirubin ≤1 mg/dL after one&#xD;
      year of treatment). Up to 40% of patients respond inadequately to UDCA and need add-on&#xD;
      therapies. (e.g. fibrates, budenosid or obeticholic acid).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In PBC, inflammation is attributed to an immune response to mitochondrial autoantigens&#xD;
      followed by a serologic response of anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMAs); and accompanied by&#xD;
      inflammation of small bile ducts. The pathogenesis includes both CD4 and CD8 cells, which in&#xD;
      the presence of biliary cells expressing the 2-oxo-dehydrogenase pathway (PDC-E2) activates&#xD;
      macrophages via granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. The activated macrophages,&#xD;
      together with AMAs, produce a proinflammatory response with subsequent liver inflammation and&#xD;
      fibrosis. Thus, macrophages seem to be involved in PBC disease severity and progression.&#xD;
      However, macrophage activation markers have not previously been investigated in PBC patients.&#xD;
      The investigators in our research group have during the last years investigated the&#xD;
      macrophage activation marker sCD163. The group have shown increased levels in relation to&#xD;
      liver fibrosis/cirrhosis in patients with chronic viral hepatitis (HBV and HCV),&#xD;
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD/NASH) and alcoholic liver disease (alcoholic&#xD;
      hepatitis and cirrhosis) and liver disease severity including risk of portal hypertension and&#xD;
      development of complications and mortality. Just recently the investigators' group also&#xD;
      demonstrated that the soluble mannose receptor (sMR) and sCD163 are associated with early and&#xD;
      long-term prognosis of patients with cirrhosis and acute-on-chronic liver failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate sCD163 and sMR at diagnosis, before treatment with UDCA, as possible&#xD;
      predictors of non-response to UDCA treatment and thus as predictors of patients needing&#xD;
      add-on therapy.&#xD;
