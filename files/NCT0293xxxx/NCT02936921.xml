  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several decades ago, France has made the choice to implement a national prevention program&#xD;
      for congenital toxoplasmosis. The identification in their first trimester of pregnancy of all&#xD;
      pregnant women who are susceptible to Toxoplasma infection has been mandatory since 1985. In&#xD;
      1992, the decision was made to extent the program to the monthly retesting of all women&#xD;
      identified as not immune, in an attempt to reduce the number of severely infected children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The systematic detection of all maternal and congenital infections has generated many&#xD;
      questions from clinicians, biologists, parents and older patients, on the short and long-term&#xD;
      prognosis of congenital toxoplasmosis, on the best tests to use to diagnose infections in&#xD;
      mothers and children, on the efficacy of existing treatments, and on how to manage patients&#xD;
      in the long-term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need to answer these many questions has prompted the medical team working within the&#xD;
      laboratory and the outpatient department of the Parasitology Department at the Croix-Rousse&#xD;
      Hospital in Lyon to implement a clinical research program. It is based on the systematic&#xD;
      inclusion in our cohort of all pregnant women whose infection is confirmed, on their follow&#xD;
      up, in order to monitor the outcome of pregnancy 2) and on the follow up of their children in&#xD;
      order to confirm their infection or to rule it out. All congenitally infected subjects&#xD;
      undergo clinical examinations, serological tests and ocular examination at least once a year&#xD;
      without age limit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data are prospectively collected in a dedicated database: gestational age at&#xD;
      maternal infection and corresponding serological profile; type and dates of maternal&#xD;
      treatment; findings of ultrasound tests and amniotic fluid analysis; serological and clinical&#xD;
      findings at birth; types and dates of postnatal treatment; postnatal serological profiles;&#xD;
      infection status at one year of age; long term clinical (ophthalmologic) et serological&#xD;
      findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data have allowed producing original findings on the risk of maternal-foetal&#xD;
      transmission according to gestational age at maternal infection, on the long term&#xD;
      ophthalmological outcome of congenital toxoplasmosis and to offer guidelines for the&#xD;
      diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of maternal and congenital infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These efforts are still to be maintained in the future in order&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to further analyse the impact of puberty, pregnancy, or adult co-morbidities on the risk&#xD;
           of ophthalmological events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to increase precision around our risk estimates for materno-foetal transmission,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to continue innovating in terms of diagnostic strategy to improve tests performances and&#xD;
           reduce costs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to explore new potential clinical outcomes such as neuropsychiatric disorders associated&#xD;
           with congenital and postnatal infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine if infections due to oocysts could have different clinical outcomes than&#xD;
           those due to the ingestion of cysts&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess the efficacy of treatments for maternal and congenital infections&#xD;
