      The purpose of this clinical investigation is to evaluate the accuracy of the Eversense&#xD;
      Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (Eversense System) measurements when compared with a&#xD;
      Self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) meter. The investigation will assess device performance&#xD;
      in two insertion locations (abdomen and upper arm), evaluate safety of the Eversense System&#xD;
      usage, and assess the usability of the Eversense system in the hands of user at home setting.&#xD;
      Changes in HbA1c from baseline will also be evaluated.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Adult subjects, age ≥18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Clinically confirmed diagnosis of diabetes mellitus for ≥1 year and using insulin by&#xD;
             subcutaneous injection or insulin pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has signed an informed consent form and is willing to comply with protocol&#xD;
             requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Female subjects of childbearing capacity (defined as not surgically sterile or not&#xD;
             menopausal for ≥ 1 year) who are lactating or pregnant, intending to become pregnant,&#xD;
             or not practicing birth control during the course of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A condition preventing or complicating the placement, operation or removal of the&#xD;
             sensor or wearing of transmitter, including upper extremity deformities or skin&#xD;
             condition&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Symptomatic coronary artery disease; unstable angina; myocardial infarction, transient&#xD;
             ischemic attack or stroke within 6 months; uncontrolled hypertension (systolic&gt;160 mm&#xD;
             HG or diastolic &gt;100 mm Hg at time of screening); current congestive heart failure;&#xD;
             history of cardiac arrhythmia (benign PACs and PVCs allowed). Subjects with&#xD;
             asymptomatic coronary artery disease (e.g., CABG, stent placement or angioplasty) may&#xD;
             participate if negative stress test within 1 year prior to screening and written&#xD;
             clearance from cardiologist documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Currently receiving (or likely to need during the study period): immunosuppressant&#xD;
             therapy; chemotherapy; anticoagulant/antithrombotic therapy (excluding aspirin);&#xD;
             glucocorticoids (excluding ophthalmic or nasal). This exclusion does include the use&#xD;
             of inhaled glucocorticoids and the use of topical glucocorticoids (over sensor site&#xD;
             only); antibiotics for chronic infection (e.g. osteomyelitis, endocarditis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. A condition requiring or likely to require magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Known topical or local anesthetic allergy&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Known allergy to glucocorticoids&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Any condition that in the investigator's opinion would make the subject unable to&#xD;
             complete the study or would make it not in the subject's best interest to participate&#xD;
             in the study. Conditions include, but are not limited to, psychiatric conditions,&#xD;
             known current or recent alcohol abuse or drug abuse by subject history, a condition&#xD;
             that may increase the risk of induced hypoglycemia or risk related to repeated blood&#xD;
             testing. Investigator will supply rationale for exclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Participation in another clinical investigation (drug or device) within 2 weeks prior&#xD;
             to screening or intent to participate during the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. The presence of any other active implanted device*&#xD;
