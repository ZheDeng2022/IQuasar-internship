      This is a 10 week, open-label, prospective study, involving 10 volunteer participants with&#xD;
      cannabis use disorder to test the feasibility and safety of using lorcaserin in addition to&#xD;
      the feasibility, likability, and utility of a mobile sensor device in cannabis users. The&#xD;
      study will be entirely outpatient. Upon study entry, participants will begin clinic visits at&#xD;
      the Substance Treatment and Research Service (STARS) clinic. All consented participants will&#xD;
      receive a Fitbit Charge HR device in week 1 to wear for the entire study and receive&#xD;
      lorcaserin beginning in week 2 for a total of 8 weeks (weeks 2-9). At the beginning of week&#xD;
      10 following discontinuation of lorcaserin, the participants will continue to wear the Fitbit&#xD;
      Charge HR device for this final week following completion of the medication trial. All&#xD;
      participants will visit the clinic twice weekly to provide urine toxicology on THC, report on&#xD;
      adverse events, complete additional assessments (outlined below), and upload de-identified&#xD;
      data from the Fitbit Charge HR device to the secure encrypted Fitabase database. Study&#xD;
      assessments will be collected at baseline, throughout the study, and 1 week following&#xD;
      medication discontinuation. All participants will also receive medical management, a&#xD;
      medication adherence focused psychosocial intervention that facilitates compliance with study&#xD;
      medication and other study procedures, including adherence to wearing the Fitbit Charge HR&#xD;
      device, and promotes abstinence from cannabis and other substances. Progressive voucher&#xD;
      incentives will be provided for compliance with visit attendance and study procedures.&#xD;

      Design Overview: This is a 10 week, open-label, prospective study, involving 10 volunteer&#xD;
      participants with cannabis use disorder to test the feasibility and safety of using&#xD;
      lorcaserin in addition to the feasibility, likability, and utility of a mobile sensor device&#xD;
      in cannabis users. The study will be entirely outpatient Upon study entry, participants will&#xD;
      begin clinic visits at the Substance Treatment and Research Service (STARS) clinic. All&#xD;
      consented participants will receive a Fitbit charge HR mobile device in week 1 to wear for&#xD;
      the entire study and receive lorcaserin beginning in week 2 for a total of 8 weeks (weeks&#xD;
      2-9). At the beginning of week 10 following discontinuation of lorcaserin, the participants&#xD;
      will continue to wear the device for this final week following completion of the medication&#xD;
      trial. All participants will visit the clinic twice weekly to provide urine toxicology on&#xD;
      THC, report on adverse events, complete additional assessments (outlined below), and upload&#xD;
      de-identified data from the device to a secure encrypted database. Study assessments will be&#xD;
      collected at baseline, throughout the study, and 1 week following medication discontinuation.&#xD;
      All participants will also receive medical management, a medication adherence focused&#xD;
      psychosocial intervention that facilitates compliance with study medication and other study&#xD;
      procedures, including adherence to wearing the device, and promotes abstinence from cannabis&#xD;
      and other substances. Progressive voucher incentives will be provided for compliance with&#xD;
      visit attendance and study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether lorcaserin is associated with a reduction from baseline in cannabis&#xD;
           use in individuals with cannabis use disorder seeking treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the tolerability of lorcaserin in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the feasibility and likability of incorporating a mobile health sensor&#xD;
           device in a treatment study for cannabis use disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Lorcaserin will significantly reduce cannabis use during the study period as measured by&#xD;
           self-report (Timeline Followback) and creatinine-normalized quantitative THC urine&#xD;
           levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Lorcaserin will be well tolerated in participants with cannabis use disorder as measured&#xD;
           by the proportion of participants completing the study, adherence to medication, and the&#xD;
           proportion of participants experiencing adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participants will find it feasible and likeable to utilize the Fitbit Charge HRTM in the&#xD;
           study as measured by selfreport assessment of liking and adherence to wearing the device&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the effect of medication treatment for cannabis use disorder on activity,&#xD;
           sleep, stress, and quality of life as measured with a mobile sensor device and&#xD;
           self-report assessments in individuals with cannabis use disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the correlation between summarized Fitbit Charge HR health sensor measures&#xD;
           and self-report assessments of sleep, stress, and quality of life in addition to&#xD;
           participants' use of cannabis and cannabis withdrawal at baseline, during, and after a&#xD;
           treatment trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome measures include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Medication treatment will increase positive health behaviors including activity and&#xD;
           improve sleep (increase total sleep time and percentage deep sleep) in addition to&#xD;
           decreasing stress and improving quality of life as measured by summarized daily total&#xD;
           steps, sleep duration and quality, and summarized stress score measured with device in&#xD;
           conjunction with improvement in the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory (PSQI), decreased&#xD;
           Perceived Stress Scale score (PSS), and improvement on Quality of Life, Enjoyment, and&#xD;
           Satisfaction Questionnaire (QLESQ), as compared to baseline. Negative health behaviors&#xD;
           (poor sleep, decreased activity, increased stress) will be highest within subjects&#xD;
           before starting treatment and with initial abstinence from cannabis when withdrawal&#xD;
           symptoms are most prominent. Positive health behaviors will increase during treatment&#xD;
           within subject, and particularly towards the second half of treatment as reduction in&#xD;
           cannabis use or abstinence is sustained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The device measures and self-report measures will directly correlate, as expected; ie:&#xD;
           increased sleep and increased % of deep sleep will correlate with higher PSQI scores.&#xD;
           When participants are using baseline levels of cannabis or are in cannabis withdrawal,&#xD;
           they will have device measures consistent with negative health behaviors (poor sleep,&#xD;
           decreased activity, increased stress). When they reduce cannabis use or achieve&#xD;
           abstinence for a sustained period (any 14 days), an association with positive health&#xD;
           behaviors as measured by the mobile device (adequate sleep, adequate activity, decreased&#xD;
           stress) will increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the pilot is to obtain preliminary data on cannabis use patterns,&#xD;
      tolerability of this medication, and sleep, quality of life and activity patterns in&#xD;
      individuals with cannabis use disorder before conducting a larger trial with lorcaserin and&#xD;
      to inform future applications of mobile sensors to cannabis use disorder treatment.&#xD;
