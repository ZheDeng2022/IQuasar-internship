      In the last few years much attention has been paid to hyperalgesia induced by opioids, which&#xD;
      represents a clinically significant condition following acute and chronic exposure to&#xD;
      opioids. It has been suggested that the increase in gene expression of μ-opioid receptors and&#xD;
      the development of hyperalgesia could be linked to epigenetic mechanisms. In particular the&#xD;
      use of opioids seems to be related to an increase of the degree of DNA methylation. In the&#xD;
      literature are not currently available data about the degree of DNA methylation in surgical&#xD;
      patients, opioid-naive prior to surgery, receiving acute opioids treatment in the&#xD;
      perioperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the degree of perioperative DNA methylation&#xD;
      (extracted from whole blood) in patients undergoing major surgery exposed to opioids&#xD;
      according to current clinical practice compared to preoperative baseline levels. The timing&#xD;
      (preoperative vs intraoperative vs postoperative) in which the possible increase of the&#xD;
      degree of DNA methylation will happen wil be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 consecutive patients undergoing major surgery performed under general anesthesia that have&#xD;
      expressed their consent to participate to the study will be enrolled. This sample is adequate&#xD;
      to allow the observation of a possible increase of DNA methylation in opioid-naive patients&#xD;
      exposed to anesthesia/analgesia based on opiates according to current clinical practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During perioperative period surgical patients experience profound changes in their&#xD;
      physiological processes. In addition to surgical stress, these variations are in part due to&#xD;
      pharmacological treatments commonly used for anesthesia and analgesia during and after&#xD;
      surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opioids are essential drugs for the management of acute perioperative pain. In the last few&#xD;
      years much attention has been paid to hyperalgesia induced by opioids, which represents a&#xD;
      clinically significant condition following acute and chronic exposure to opioids. It has been&#xD;
      suggested that the increase in gene expression of μ-opioid receptors and the development of&#xD;
      hyperalgesia could be linked to epigenetic mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epigenetic alterations typically involve changes in chromatin structure, which is composed of&#xD;
      DNA, histones and non-histone proteins. Main changes in clinical setting are covalent&#xD;
      modifications of N-terminal sequences of histone proteins and DNA methylation. In particular,&#xD;
      DNA methylation is carried out with the addition of a methyl group on the fifth carbon atom&#xD;
      of cytosine residues (5mC), mainly localized in CpG regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA methylation is considered as a mechanism of gene silencing. It is a complex process&#xD;
      regulated by a whole family of enzymes called DNA methyl-transferase (DNMTs: DNMT1, DNMT2,&#xD;
      DNMT3a, DNMT3B, and DNMT3L) that catalyze the transfer of a methyl group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular DNMT 1, 3a, 3b were studied during the development of a neuropathic pain model.&#xD;
      Through immunohistochemical analysis it was observed that in the dorsal root ganglion of an&#xD;
      adult rat (L4-5) DNMT3B showed an important up-regulation that is observed already 1 week&#xD;
      after the induction of the model and that persists for 4 weeks; on the contrary, DNMT1 and&#xD;
      DNMT3a showed a moderate and transient up-regulation. Other studies have shown that in a&#xD;
      different pattern of pain, acute inflammatory, the expression levels of DNMT3a and DNMT3B are&#xD;
      particularly high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these findings suggest the important activity of these enzymes in different models of&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opioids admnistration seems to be related to an increase of the degree of DNA methylation. In&#xD;
      a study published in 2013, Doehring et al. rated the degree of DNA methylation in patients&#xD;
      heroin addicts undergoing methadone substitution treatment. Patients treated with opioids&#xD;
      have shown an overall increase in DNA methylation, in particular of μ-opioid receptor. It is&#xD;
      interesting to note that the degree of DNA methylation correlates with the intensity of pain&#xD;
      reported by subjects analyzed in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature are not currently present data related to the degree of DNA methylation in&#xD;
      surgical patients receiving acute treatment with opiates that are opioid-naive prior to&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the degree of perioperative DNA methylation&#xD;
      (extracted from whole blood) in patients undergoing major surgery exposed to opiates&#xD;
      according to current clinical practice compared to preoperative baseline levels. The timing&#xD;
      (preoperative vs intraoperative vs postoperative) in which the possible increase of the&#xD;
      degree of DNA methylation will happen will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are: observe the possible correlation between the degree of DNA&#xD;
      methylation and the intensity of acute postoperative pain, observe the possible correlation&#xD;
      between the degree of DNA methylation and the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting,&#xD;
      observe the possible correlations between the degree of DNA methylation and the gene&#xD;
      expression of μ opioid receptor, observe the possible correlations between the degree of DNA&#xD;
      methylation and the expression of genes mainly involved in methylation processes, compare the&#xD;
      degree of DNA methylation in the preoperative phase of the different patients involved in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEDAPO trial is a monocentric clinical trials with the use of human tissue in vitro. Because&#xD;
      the lack of knowledge in literature about the increased degree of DNA methylation following&#xD;
      acute administration of opioids in surgical patients, this study will be explorative.&#xD;
      Moreover, not being able to avoid exposure to opiates in the intraoperative phase, but being&#xD;
      possible to guarantee postoperative analgesia without opioid treatments, it will be&#xD;
      interesting to see if any increase in methylation occurs already during the intraoperative&#xD;
      phase or whether it can be related to the time of exposure to treatment with opiates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will provide useful information to better plan the timing for randomization into a&#xD;
      future trial comparing various postoperative analgesic techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 consecutive patients undergoing major surgery performed under general anesthesia that have&#xD;
      expressed their consent to participate to the study will be enrolled. This sample is adequate&#xD;
      to allow the observation of a possible increase of DNA methylation in opioid-naive patients&#xD;
      exposed to anesthesia/analgesia based on opiates according to current clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analysis related to the primary objective of the trial will be performed. We will&#xD;
      perform parametric tests for paired data to observe the correlation between the degree of DNA&#xD;
      methylation and acute postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After verifying the signature of informed consent, the presence of the inclusion criteria and&#xD;
      the absence of exclusion criteria, the patient will be considered eligible. Each patient will&#xD;
      be assigned to a serial number which will identify the samples used for molecular analysis&#xD;
      making them anonymous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study period will extend from the signing of informed consent up to 48 hours after the&#xD;
      end of surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participation to the study will not change the treatment plan of the patient: surgical&#xD;
      procedure and anesthetic conduct will represent the normal daily clinical practice without&#xD;
      any variation regardless the enrollment of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of arrival in the operating room the patient will be monitored according to&#xD;
      standard clinical practice in relation to the type of surgery (ECG, SpO2, EtCO2 and Invasive&#xD;
      Blood Pressure). After monitoring the patient, it will be placed a peripheral venous catheter&#xD;
      ≤ 20 G and an arterial catheter (20G) in radial or humeral artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After adequate oxygenation anesthesia will be induced with fentanyl (3 mcg/kg), propofol&#xD;
      (2-2.5 mg/kg) and Rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg) or Succinylcholine (1 mg/Kg). The maintenance of&#xD;
      anesthetic level will be obtained by the use of Sevoflurane 0.7 - 1.3 MAC (minimum alveolar&#xD;
      concentration), and bolus doses of Fentanyl (1mcg /kg) and possibly of Rocuronium (0.15mg/kg)&#xD;
      every 45 minutes until the end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The acute postoperative pain in the first 48 hours will be treated with a continuous&#xD;
      intravenous infusion of morphine (1 mg/h), with the possibility of the patient to&#xD;
      self-administer boluses of 1 mg of morphine repeatable every 8 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous infusion of morphine will be preceded by an intraoperative bolus (immediately&#xD;
      after the last stitch) of 0.1 mg/kg of morphine. Ten minutes after awakening the patient, if&#xD;
      the pain will be poorly controlled (NRS ≥ 4), will be administered 1 mg of morphine,&#xD;
      repeatable every 5 minutes, until NRS&lt;3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prophylaxis for postoperative nausea and vomiting will carried out by intravenous&#xD;
      administration of 0.1 mg/kg of dexamethasone prior to administration of the first dose of&#xD;
      fentanyl. In case of postoperative nausea and vomiting, it will be administered droperidol&#xD;
      0.625 mg repeatable every 6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study period, in addition to the anthropometric parameters, we will collect the&#xD;
      following data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of anesthesia, defined as the time between induction of general anesthesia and&#xD;
      awakening; Duration of surgery, defined as the time between surgical incision and the last&#xD;
      stitch; Fentanyl consumption, expressed in mcg/kg /hour; Morphine consumption in the first 24&#xD;
      and 48 hours after the end of surgery; Pain (NRS) at rest and after deep inhalation 10&#xD;
      minutes after waking up, 24 and 48 hours after the end of surgery; Number of episodes of&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting in the first 24 and 48 hours after the end of surgery; Consumption of&#xD;
      antiemetic drugs in the first 24 and 48 hours after the end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study period, in addiction to blood tests carried out according to routine&#xD;
      clinical practice a blood sample of 5 ml will be collected to perform epigenetic analysis.&#xD;
      The semple will be added with heparin or EDTA or ascorbate ACD as anticoagulant agents and&#xD;
      stored at a temperature of - 20 ° C until the delivery to the Department of Pharmacy and&#xD;
      Biotechnology which will take place after the last blood sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be collected according to the following schedule reflects everyday clinical&#xD;
      practice:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T0: after placement of the arterial catheter, prior to administration of opiates&#xD;
           (baseline blood gases);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T1: 1 hour after general anesthesia induction (hemogasanalysis verification of&#xD;
           mechanical ventilation);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T2: after the last stitch, before the intraoperative bolus of morphine (hemogasanalysis&#xD;
           testing blood loss);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T3: 24 ± 6 hours after after the end of surgery (control blood count);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T4: 48 ± 6 hours after the end of surgery (control blood count). On these blood samples,&#xD;
           it will be assessed the degree of DNA methylation. The samples will be subjected to&#xD;
           extraction of RNA and genomic DNA through ZR-Duet ™ kit DNA / RNA Miniprep (Zymo&#xD;
           Research). The nucleic acids obtained from the samples will be stored at - 80 ° C until&#xD;
           analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the change in methylation of genomic DNA is observed in various diseases, the need to&#xD;
      measure the degree of overall DNA methylation has become very important. The 5-mC DNA ELISA&#xD;
      kit (Zymo Research) offers a method of high-throughput, easy to identify and quantify the&#xD;
      degree of DNA methylation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total RNA extracted from each sample will be used for gene expression studies using RT-qPCR&#xD;
      method. This technique will allow making a quantitative assessment of genes' expression&#xD;
      codifying for the μ opioid receptor and enzymes belonging to the family of DNMTs. Based on&#xD;
      these results, we will be able to correlate the degree of DNA methylation to the levels of&#xD;
      expression of the investigated genes.&#xD;
