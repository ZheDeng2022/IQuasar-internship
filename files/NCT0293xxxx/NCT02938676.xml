      Nurses will be responsible for delivering the &quot;Guide tips for the person with a transplanted&#xD;
      heart&quot;, thus initiating an individualized education program. Education will be held at the&#xD;
      time of admission in which the patient has passed the most critical post-operative.&#xD;
&#xD;

      contact on the habits that must change. Education lasts 10-30 minutes and is taught in&#xD;
      daytime, in a calm environment and at the right time, favoring the presence of the caregiver.&#xD;
      Later, education is reinforced on the doubts that arise both the patient and the primary&#xD;
      caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first days of admission to the unit of cardiology, socio-demographic data of the&#xD;
      patient and primary caregiver by the research team will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few days before discharge, having left time between 7-8 days after delivery of educational&#xD;
      advice guide, any member of the research team, who does not work in the cardiology unit, will&#xD;
      provide the patient and the primary caregiver the satisfaction questionnaire where the&#xD;
      perception of information and education received during the postoperative period in the&#xD;
      inpatient cardiology unit and the appropriateness of the topics covered in the guide&#xD;
