  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Protocol PEN-221-001 is an open-label, multicenter Phase 1/2a study evaluating PEN-221 in&#xD;
      patients with SSTR2 expressing advanced gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) or lung or thymus or&#xD;
      other neuroendocrine tumors or small cell lung cancer or large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma&#xD;
      of the lung.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Protocol PEN-221-001 will first enroll patients into a dose escalation phase, where a&#xD;
      Bayesian logistic regression model, guided by the escalation with overdose control principle&#xD;
      and overseen by a safety review committee, will be used to make dose recommendations and&#xD;
      estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the MTD has been confirmed, remaining patients will be enrolled into a full expansion&#xD;
      phase to assess PEN-221 efficacy in patients with gastrointestinal mid-gut neuroendocrine&#xD;
      tumors or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors or small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
