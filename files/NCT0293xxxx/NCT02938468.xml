    <textblock>
      Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is a collection of blood and its breakdown products in the&#xD;
      subdural compartment. It is a condition frequently seen in any neurosurgical practice. cSDH&#xD;
      is believed to arise from tearing of bridging veins as a result of trauma, which may be minor&#xD;
      and unapparent to the patient. Management of cSDH is widely varied. A &quot;wait-and-see&quot; or&#xD;
      &quot;wait-and-rescan&quot; approach may be acceptable in asymptomatic patients with a relatively small&#xD;
      hematoma whilst cSDH with severe neurological deficits or decreased level of consciousness&#xD;
      may require surgical decompression by burr-hole craniostomy, twist drill craniostomy or&#xD;
      craniotomy. Surgery is associated with serious morbidity and mortality of up to 17% and&#xD;
      recurrence rates of 4%-33% requiring further treatment in some instances.The safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of different neurosurgical procedures have been evaluated but there is a paucity of&#xD;
      well-designed randomized controlled trials in the literature. Consequently, there is no&#xD;
      consensus on the best treatment with respect to surgical technique, pre-operative and&#xD;
      post-operative management and nonsurgical alternatives including the use of Corticosteroids,&#xD;
      Tranexamic acid, Osmotic diuretics, Atorvastatin or Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)&#xD;
      inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corticosteroids may be a therapeutic option in the management of cSDH. There is very little&#xD;
      data on the efficacy of corticosteroids in the treatment of cSDH and certainly no randomized&#xD;
      trials. The purpose of the study is to prove dexamethasone can be just as efficacious as&#xD;
      surgery in treating chronic subdural hematoma. The investigators also hope to show that those&#xD;
      patients treated with dexamethasone suffer less complication compared to those who undergo&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

      Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is a collection of blood and its breakdown products in the&#xD;
      subdural compartment. It is a condition frequently seen in any neurosurgical practice. cSDH&#xD;
      is believed to arise from tearing of bridging veins as a result of trauma, which may be minor&#xD;
      and unapparent to the patient. The one-year incidence rate is 1 to 8.2 per 100 000 in those&#xD;
      65 years or older. Advanced age is one of several risk factors and the incidence is expected&#xD;
      to increase due to improved life expectancy. Other risk factors include brain atrophy,&#xD;
      chronic alcoholism, intracranial hypotension, male gender and coagulopathy (including&#xD;
      antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of cSDH is widely varied. A &quot;wait-and-see&quot; or &quot;wait-and-rescan&quot; approach may be&#xD;
