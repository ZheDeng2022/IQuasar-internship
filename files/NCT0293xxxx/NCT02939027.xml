      Electronic brachytherapy (EBT) offers an isotope-free radiation therapy modality for the&#xD;
      treatment of specific skin lesions, especially non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC). Within the&#xD;
      treatment of NMSC, surgical removal of the lesion is currently the treatment of choice for&#xD;
      the majority of cases. However in an estimated 10-15% of NMSC patients, surgery might not be&#xD;
      the best treatment option. Location of the tumour in cosmetically sensitive areas, patient&#xD;
      comorbidities, old age, use of anti-coagulation etc. might all be reasons to select&#xD;
      radiotherapy as first choice of treatment. The objective of ths study will be to determine&#xD;
      histologically confirmed clinical efficacy, safety, and usability of Electronic&#xD;
      Brachytherapy, an innovative treatment for Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC).&#xD;

      -  Rationale: Electronic brachytherapy (EBT) offers an isotope-free radiation therapy&#xD;
           modality for the treatment of specific skin lesions, especially non-melanoma skin&#xD;
           cancers (NMSC). Within the treatment of NMSC, surgical removal of the lesion is&#xD;
           currently the treatment of choice for the majority of cases. However in an estimated&#xD;
           10-15% of NMSC patients, surgery might not be the best treatment option. Location of the&#xD;
           tumour in cosmetically sensitive areas, patient comorbidities, old age, use of&#xD;
           anti-coagulation etc. might all be reasons to select radiotherapy as first choice of&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective: To determine histologically confirmed clinical efficacy, safety, and&#xD;
           usability of Electronic Brachytherapy, an innovative treatment for Basal Cell Carcinoma&#xD;
           (BCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study design: Prospective, out-patient based, single centre, single treatment modality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study population: 40 patients, &gt;18 years old, having at least 1 BCC. Intervention: BCC&#xD;
           will be treated with EBT, using low-energy X-rays. Area of the lesion will be evaluated&#xD;
           for tumour presence and size before, during and at 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 3 months after&#xD;
           treatment. If the patient has more than one BCC, all of them will be treated with&#xD;
           Electronic Brachytherapy but only the largest one will be analysed in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Main study parameters/endpoints: Local control of BCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary parameters: Acute skin toxicity, skin cosmesis, and care giver satisfaction,&#xD;
           and patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and&#xD;
           group relatedness: Patients will be exposed to low-energy X-rays. Required site-visits&#xD;
           are: 1 pretreatment visits (intake/informed consent and biopsy), 6 treatment visits over&#xD;
           the course of 2-3 weeks, 6 control-visits 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12&#xD;
           months and 24 months after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will also be asked to complete a short questionnaire to evaluate their quality&#xD;
           of life.&#xD;
