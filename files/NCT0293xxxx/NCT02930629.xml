  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the incidence of residual block in patients arriving&#xD;
      in the Post Anaesthetic Care Unit (PACU) following surgery, and in those who have received&#xD;
      neuromuscular blocking drugs (muscle relaxants). Residual block (decreased motor function)&#xD;
      due to residual levels of muscle relaxants is associated with increased morbidity.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, cross sectional study. Adult patients undergoing surgery in the main&#xD;
      operating theatres of Singapore General Hospital and requiring general anaesthesia and muscle&#xD;
      relaxants will be enrolled and assessed over a 4 month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explanation, handing over of the Participation Information Sheet, and consent taking for the&#xD;
      research will be taken either: In the anaesthetic Pre-operative Evaluation Clinic (PEC) which&#xD;
      takes place on average 1-2 weeks prior to surgery itself; or On the ward, as a portion of&#xD;
      patients are admitted as an inpatient the day before surgery. This allows patients time to&#xD;
      consider participation into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conduct of anaesthesia before arrival in PACU is left to the discretion of the attending&#xD;
      anaesthetist. After arrival in PACU, patients are cared for by the PACU nurse and attending&#xD;
      anaesthetist. The PI or co-investigators of the participants will follow up patients arriving&#xD;
      in PACU if they fit the inclusion criteria i.e. who have received muscle relaxants during&#xD;
      their anaesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have their neuromuscular function monitored using a TOF Watch. This is a&#xD;
      neuromuscular monitor used to assess the twitch height of muscles when stimulated by small&#xD;
      electrical currents. Assessing neuromuscular function at all stages of anaesthesia (during&#xD;
      anaesthesia and during recovery from anaesthesia) is the standard of care and is considered&#xD;
      &quot;essential&quot; as per guidelines from the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and&#xD;
      Ireland (2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following are standards of care in PACU if patients are suspected of having residual&#xD;
      block:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Neuromuscular function will be assessed using clinical means (head lift and hand grip)&#xD;
           but these are unreliable (false positives due to effects of anaesthetic agents and&#xD;
           opioids rather than muscle relaxants)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Neuromuscular function assessed by either TOF count (number of twitches) or TOF ratio&#xD;
           (any fade in height of the four twitches) as per manufacturer's guidelines. Two ECG&#xD;
           electrodes will be placed 4 cm apart over the path of the ulnar nerve of the wrist after&#xD;
           cleaning the skin with alcohol swabs. The TOF force transducer will be placed on the&#xD;
           volar aspect of the thumb. The TOF Watch leads will be attached to the electrodes and a&#xD;
           TOF stimulus will be applied: four twitches at 2Hz (every 0.5 seconds), each twitch&#xD;
           lasting 0.2ms, and at a current of 50 milliamperes (mA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients who have residual block will be closely monitored as per standard care in PACU,&#xD;
           which include oxygen therapy, and monitoring (continuous ECG, respiratory rate, pulse&#xD;
           oximetry, and 15 minutely non invasive blood pressure measurements). Those patients who&#xD;
           have clinical signs and symptoms of residual block will be treated at the discretion of&#xD;
           the PACU nurse and attending anaesthetic medical officer stationed in PACU&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the research study in PACU, patients will have the above (steps 1 to 3) irrespective of&#xD;
      whether residual block is suspected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TOF ratio will be measured as two sets of TOF ratio with an average of the two taken. As&#xD;
      far as possible, the TOF will be done when patients are still slightly drowsy from the&#xD;
      effects of anaesthesia in order to minimize any patient TOF discomfort. If there is &gt;10%&#xD;
      discrepancy between these two readings then two more TOF will be applied, and an average of&#xD;
      the two closest measurement averaged. This will determine if the participant has residual&#xD;
      block (defined at TOF&lt;0.9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical record review of data will be that from intraoperative period and PACU stay (usually&#xD;
      one hour) and includes data already inputted into the anaesthetic charts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient data: age, weight, BMI, American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) status,&#xD;
           list of co-morbidities&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Surgical data: type of operation and duration&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Anaesthetic data: type, dose and timing of muscle relaxants and reversal used; type and&#xD;
           method of neuromuscular monitoring used&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. PACU data: time of arrival; heart rate, blood pressure, pulse oximetry and respiratory&#xD;
           rate on admission; any adverse incidents (airway obstruction, desaturation (SpO2&lt;95%),&#xD;
           complaints of muscle weakness or blurred/double vision).&#xD;
