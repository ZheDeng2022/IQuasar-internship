      The study aims to evaluate the potential role of ACTH gel in the management of non-infectious&#xD;
      uveitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uveitis is a term used to describe a group of inflammatory disorders involving the uveal&#xD;
      tract (iris, ciliary body and choroid). It is amongst the most common causes in the list of&#xD;
      preventable cause of blindness in the developed world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H.P. Acthar Gel is a highly purified sterile preparation of the adrenocorticotropic hormone&#xD;
      (ACTH) gelatin to provide a prolonged release after intramuscular or subcutaneous (SC)&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACTH is part of a group of molecules called melanocortins (MC) (ACTH, α, β, γ-MSH) that are&#xD;
      produced, in human bodies, by breakdown of a common larger precursor called&#xD;
      proopiomelanocortin (POMC). A very well-known anti-inflammatory mechanism of action of ACTH&#xD;
      is the production glucocorticoids by stimulating the adrenal glands. ACTH has also been shown&#xD;
      to bind with all five melanocortin receptors (MCRs). MCRs have a variety of roles including&#xD;
      cortisol production and regulation of immune modulation by ACTH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACTHAR is an open-label, multi-center, randomized, phase II study to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      two dose regimens of repeated SC injections of ACTH gel in patients with active&#xD;
      non-infectious intermediate, posterior, or pan-uveitis followed over a period of 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACTHAR study will be conducted at up to 7 clinical sites in USA. The study will be&#xD;
      coordinated by the Ocular Imaging Research and Reading Center (OIRRC), which will serve as&#xD;
      the coordinating and reading center for the ACTHAR Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study will be at month 6, with an active, as-needed treatment&#xD;
      extension phase from month 6 to month 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty-six (36) patients with non-infectious intermediate, posterior, or pan-uveitis will be&#xD;
      enrolled and randomized (1:1) to one of the two treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mandatory twice a week (Mondays and Thursdays) treatment with SC ACTH gel 80 U/day&#xD;
           starting at BL until month 6. Starting at month 6, the treatment will be administered on&#xD;
           as needed basis, based on the retreatment criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mandatory thrice a week (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays) treatment with SC ACTH gel 80&#xD;
           U/day starting at BL until month 6. Starting at month 6, the treatment will be&#xD;
           administered on as needed basis, based on the retreatment criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting at month 6, retreatment will be offered to study subjects who have demonstrated any&#xD;
      level of response during the first 6 months and who meet any of these Retreatment Criteria&#xD;
      listed below. Patients receiving retreatment will receive the dose that was assigned to them&#xD;
      at randomization.&#xD;
