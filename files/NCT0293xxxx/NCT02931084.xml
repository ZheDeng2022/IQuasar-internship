    <textblock>
      The natural course after ACL injury is not well described in the literature. Every year about&#xD;
      7000 people, a majority aged 15-30 years old, injure their anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)&#xD;
      in Sweden. About 3500 go through surgical treatment and rehabilitation. Despite the large&#xD;
      amount of research on ACL-injuries, there are still many patients who have unsatisfactory&#xD;
      outcomes regarding instability, decreased activity level, and quality of life, not being able&#xD;
      to return to sport as well as an increased risk for osteoarthritis. The general aim of the&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the natural course and recovery after ACL injury. Specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate physical, psychological and contextual factors affecting recovery after&#xD;
           anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Recovery is related both to natural course and&#xD;
           to treatment chosen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate factors affecting the decision for which treatment to choose (ACL&#xD;
           reconstruction and rehabilitation or rehabilitation alone)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate factors affecting the decision for return to sports&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study development of knee osteoarthritis after ACL-injury&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study epidemiology of acute knee trauma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study risk factors for new injuries after ACL-injury These aims will be pursued by&#xD;
           consequently and prospectively following patients who sustain a new ACL injury in a&#xD;
           multicenter study including approximately 800 patients. Assessment methods will be&#xD;
           questionnaires to patients, orthopedic doctors and physical therapists. A sub-cohort of&#xD;
           130 patients will undergo multiple clinical and functional examination as well as MRIs&#xD;
           and blood, urine and joint fluid samples.&#xD;

      Study design: A descriptive and prospective prognostic cohort study, with consecutive&#xD;
      recruitment of patients during a 12 month period from seven sites in Sweden Start of&#xD;
      recruiting participants is October 2016. Most participants will receive a diagnosis from an&#xD;
      orthopedic doctor approximately 2-4 weeks after their knee injury, and undergo rehabilitation&#xD;
      for at least the first three months, before a decision regarding ACL reconstruction is taken&#xD;
      (in line with current treatment guidelines). The patient cohort will be naturally divided&#xD;
      into reconstruction plus rehabilitation, and rehabilitation only. Being included in the study&#xD;
      will not affect the choice of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to participate at their initial contact with healthcare, after their&#xD;
      knee injury. The recruitment process will differ slightly between the different sites, based&#xD;
      on the clinical routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who accept to participate will complete web-based questionnaires distributed via&#xD;
      smart phones or e-mail, once a week the first 6 weeks, every second week up to 3rd month,&#xD;
      every month up to 1 year and every second month up to 3 years after initial injury. The&#xD;
      length of the questionnaires varies from very short (approximately 10 questions that take 2&#xD;
      minutes to fill in) to longer at specific critical time points. Each time the patient has&#xD;
      contact with an orthopedic surgeon, the patient, orthopedic doctor and physiotherapist (if&#xD;
      the patient has contact with one) will be asked to answer a questionnaire about choice of&#xD;
      treatment (surgery or not). In addition, when the patient reports that they are back to sport&#xD;
      activity, the patient and the physiotherapist will be asked to answer a questionnaire about&#xD;
      the decision to return to sport. Patients who will have ACL reconstruction will be followed&#xD;
      up with new baseline from the time of reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients recruited from Link√∂ping will have expanded follow-up data collection at baseline&#xD;
      and 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after injury. At these follow-ups, a clinical examination will be&#xD;
      completed by an orthopedic surgeon or physiotherapist, MRI, and blood and urine samples will&#xD;
      be collected. A joint fluid sample will be acquired at baseline, and at the time of ACL&#xD;
      reconstruction (if the patient has surgical treatment). Radiographs will be done at baseline&#xD;
      and 5 years follow up. Patients who have ACL reconstruction will be followed up with new&#xD;
      baseline at the time for reconstruction, but without MRI or blood and urine samples.&#xD;
