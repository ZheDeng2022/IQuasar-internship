      The purpose of this study is to compare the duration of stent patency of a covered vs. an&#xD;
      uncovered biliary self-expandable metal stents (SEMS) placed to relieve biliary obstruction&#xD;
      in patients with inoperable extrahepatic malignant biliary obstruction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer of the pancreas, gallbladder, or bile ducts is the most common cause of malignant&#xD;
      obstruction of the biliary tree. Patients who have unresectable tumors have a dismal&#xD;
      prognosis in terms of survival and quality of life. In these cases 5-year survival is less&#xD;
      than 2% and palliation, such as the establishment of a biliary drainage, is the only&#xD;
      treatment available. Two types of stents are routinely used: plastic stents (PS) and&#xD;
      self-expandable metal stents (SEMS). The first generation SEMS are uncovered and recurrent&#xD;
      obstruction, most frequently caused by tumor ingrowth through the metal mesh, is seen in&#xD;
      16-46%. Recently, covered SEMS have been introduced to prevent tumor ingrowth. Covered SEMS&#xD;
      are associated with stent occlusion in 14% of patients. As can be expected, the most frequent&#xD;
      cause of stent obstruction in these patients is sludge formation. Stent migration, and&#xD;
      cholecystitis and pancreatitis caused by obstruction of the cystic duct and pancreatic duct,&#xD;
      respectively, have been suggested to occur more frequently with covered SEMS. To date,&#xD;
      however, one randomized trial and three comparative studies compared covered with uncovered&#xD;
      SEMS, have found only a non statistically significant trend towards more frequent occurrence&#xD;
      of these complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From these initial studies comparing uncovered to covered SEMS, it suggested that stent&#xD;
      patency may be longer with covered SEMS. However, supporting evidence for the superior&#xD;
      efficacy of covered SEMS is lacking. In addition, the issue of safety of covered SEMS, as&#xD;
      well as the real world effectiveness of the self conformable SEMS, warrant further&#xD;
      investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the Investigators will include patients with symptoms (jaundice, cholangitis)&#xD;
      due to malignant extrahepatic biliary tree obstruction (pancreatic cancer,&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder cancer, or metastatic lymphadenopathy) who are not candidates&#xD;
      for surgical cure either because the tumor is inoperable or because of the patient's poor&#xD;
      medical condition due to comorbidities and/or advanced age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with extrahepatic malignancy in whom a diagnostic work up is still ongoing to&#xD;
      establish the possibility of performing a curative approach will not be immediately enrolled.&#xD;
      Patients who have been previously treated with a plastic stent will be eligible if the&#xD;
      plastic stent was placed within the 4 weeks prior to enrolment in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare the duration of stent patency of a covered vs. an&#xD;
      uncovered biliary self-expandable metal stents (SEMS) placed to relieve biliary obstruction&#xD;
      in patients with inoperable extrahepatic malignant biliary obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Primary Aim: To compare the duration of stent patency of a covered vs. an uncovered&#xD;
      biliary SEMS placed to relieve biliary obstruction in patients with inoperable extrahepatic&#xD;
      malignant biliary obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with inoperable extrahepatic malignant biliary obstruction managed with SEMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate complication rates of covered vs. uncovered biliary SEMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the quality of life before and after intervention with covered vs. uncovered&#xD;
           biliary SEMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the survival of patients treated with covered vs. uncovered biliary SEMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of covered and uncovered biliary SEMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To determine the predictors of survival in patients in patients with inoperable&#xD;
           extrahepatic malignant biliary obstruction managed with SEMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 Primary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normalization of the bilirubin level and other cholestasis parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of clinically significant stent occlusion or migration prior to death of&#xD;
           patients (minimum follow-up: 4 months) as defined below Clinically Significant Occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be defined as an occurrence of the following items:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The development of clinical symptoms of biliary obstruction such as cholangitis,&#xD;
           accompanied by jaundice and fever requiring antibiotic treatment, and pruritis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory evidence of cholestasis, including elevation of conjugated bilirubin (≥ 30%&#xD;
           increase in bilirubin), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and&#xD;
           alanine transaminase (ALT) following stent placement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging findings consistent with biliary obstruction Initial stent failure: if&#xD;
           normalization of bilirubin level and other cholestatic parameters does not occur&#xD;
           immediately after SEMS placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health-related quality of life (HRQL) (evaluated monthly)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complications (perforation, haemorrhage, pancreatitis, cholecystitis, cholangitis, stent&#xD;
           migration [into the duodenal lumen by ≥ 1 cm], sludge occlusion, severe pain, tumor in-&#xD;
           and over-growth, infection, haemorrhage, stent fracture and shearing, stent cover&#xD;
           disruption) major and minor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall survival post stent placement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality adjusted life years (QALYs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Costs of treatment strategies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Occurrence of biliary re-intervention, defined as any endoscopic, percutaneous or&#xD;
           surgical procedure to improve biliary drainage after the stent placement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedure time (stent deployment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Technical complications of the tested endoscopic devices. Population: The study&#xD;
           population will include patients with symptoms (jaundice, cholangitis) due to malignant&#xD;
           extrahepatic biliary tree obstruction (pancreatic cancer, cholangiocarcinoma,&#xD;
           gallbladder cancer, or metastatic lymphadenopathy) who are not candidates for surgical&#xD;
           cure either because the tumor is inoperable or because of the patient's poor medical&#xD;
           condition due to comorbidities and/or advanced age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with extrahepatic malignancy in whom a diagnostic work up is still ongoing to&#xD;
      establish the possibility of performing a curative approach will not be immediately enrolled.&#xD;
      Patients who have been previously treated with a plastic stent will be eligible if the&#xD;
      plastic stent was placed within the 4 weeks prior to enrolment in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials Fully covered SEMS: Niti-S Biliary ComVi Stent; Uncovered SEMS: Niti-S (D type)&#xD;
      stent Sample size calculation: The primary end point of the study is stent occlusion. The&#xD;
      number of patients in each group required to demonstrate a statistically significant&#xD;
      difference in SEMS patency with an 80% power is 70 for a 22% difference,121 for a 17%&#xD;
      difference, and 248 for a 12% difference in the obstruction rate between the two groups.&#xD;
      Estimated sample size is 121 for a 17% difference, and 70 for a 22% difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a lower (75%) power, 63 patients per treatment group are required to detect a difference&#xD;
      of 22%, 108 for a 17% difference and 222 for a 12% difference. This computation is based on&#xD;
      data on obstruction percentage reported in literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target enrolment for this study will be 70 patients per study arm. Considering time to&#xD;
      occlusion analysis, a total of 140 patients will detect a treatment difference at a two sided&#xD;
      0.05 significance level, with 80% power, if the true hazard ratio is at least 1.76.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of data Data storage, management, and analysis will be centralized. An electronic&#xD;
      database will be constructed to collect the data. The program will be distributed to all&#xD;
      participating centers and the data will be entered at the time of the encounters with the&#xD;
      subjects such as at the time of endoscopy for stent placement, follow-up visit, or follow-up&#xD;
      telephone call. Randomization assignment (stent type) will be coded. Standard operating&#xD;
      procedures for regularly backing up the data will be employed at each facility and centrally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 6 months the compact disk (CD) with the study site data will be sent to the&#xD;
      coordinating center where the data manger will download the data and merge it with the&#xD;
      previously collected study data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Security measures will be adopted before the mailing of the CD in order to avoid any possible&#xD;
      disclosure of the privacy: the data will be encrypted and transformed in numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data manager will remove information regarding the type of SEMS used prior to sending the&#xD;
      data to the statistician. Therefore, data analysis will be performed by a statistician who is&#xD;
      blinded to the type of stent.&#xD;

           questionnaires Analysis Descriptive statistics, including graphical displays, will be&#xD;
           used to summarize all study variables. The unit of analysis will be the patient. For&#xD;
           continuous variables, means, medians, standard deviations, percentiles, ranges, box&#xD;
           plots and histograms will be generated. For categorical variables, frequencies and&#xD;
           proportions will be generated. The investigators will examine all variables to determine&#xD;
           if parametric distributional assumptions (e.g. normality for the continuous variables)&#xD;
           are valid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences between continuous variables will be determined by parametric tests, or, when&#xD;
      appropriate by non-parametric tests. Differing frequencies of variables at different times&#xD;
      within each group (dysphagia score, body weight, etc) will be compared with tests for related&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the primary aim, differences in duration of stent patency, the Kaplan-Meier method&#xD;
      will be used to estimate stent patency in each group and the log-rank test will be used for&#xD;
      an unadjusted comparison between groups. Then a Cox proportional hazard model will be&#xD;
      constructed to compare time to stent occlusion adjusted for important potential confounders.&#xD;
      Stent patency will be calculated in days and will represent the interval between the time of&#xD;
      stent insertion and the time of its replacement or the death of the patient with concomitant&#xD;
      cholangitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the secondary aims, relationships between complication rates and stent type will&#xD;
      be examined by the chi-square or the exact Fisher tests. Logistic regression will be used to&#xD;
      compare stent complication rates adjusted for important potential confounders. Health-related&#xD;
      quality of life (HRQL) will be evaluated by a paired t-test to determine the impact of stent&#xD;
      placement (i.e. compare baseline HRQL and month 3 HRQL) by Student's t -test to compare the&#xD;
      differences in HRQL at baseline and 3 months between study groups. Linear regression models&#xD;
      will be constructed to assess HQRL while adjusting for factors other than stent type. Total&#xD;
      direct costs for each study group will be compared and cost effectiveness modelled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all analyses the Statistical Package for Social Sciences software (SPSS, Inc. for Windows&#xD;
      will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events are defined as any undesirable experience occurring to a subject during a&#xD;
      clinical trial. All adverse events reported spontaneously by the subject or observed by the&#xD;
      investigator or his staff will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any level&#xD;
      results in death:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is life threatening (at the time of the event)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing in patients' hospitalisation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is a new event of the trial likely to affect the safety of the subjects, such as an&#xD;
           unexpected outcome of an adverse reaction, lack of efficacy, major safety finding&#xD;
           Withdrawal of individual subjects Subjects can leave the study at any time for any&#xD;
           reason if they wish to do so without any consequences. The investigator can decide to&#xD;
           withdraw a subject from the study for urgent medical reasons.&#xD;
