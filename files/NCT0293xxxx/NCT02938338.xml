      The aim is&#xD;
&#xD;
      to examine the energy consumption before and after bariatric surgery. The study will&#xD;
      contribute to the knowledge if operations should be complemented by interventions to increase&#xD;
      energy expenditure, mainly by reducing sedentary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      as input for the design of an intervention to reduce sedentary. Such intervention should be&#xD;
      based on knowledge of the mediators of physical activity among the subjects that need to be&#xD;
      strengthened.&#xD;

      The aim is&#xD;
&#xD;
      to examine the energy consumption before and after bariatric surgery. The study will&#xD;
      contribute to the knowledge if operations should be complemented by interventions to increase&#xD;
      energy expenditure, mainly by reducing sedentary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      as input for the design of an intervention to reduce sedentary. Such intervention should be&#xD;
      based on knowledge of the mediators of physical activity among the subjects that need to be&#xD;
      strengthened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Patients who undergo bariatric surgery have before surgery low energy consumption&#xD;
      related to physical activity. The investigators hypothesis is that low energy consumption for&#xD;
      the most part retained and that is independent of whether one starts exercising or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About the level of physical activity and energy expenditure Increased physical activity after&#xD;
      obesitasoperation is correlated with greater weight loss. According the Swedish Obesitas&#xD;
      Surgery study, the percentage of persons who were classified as physically inactive decreased&#xD;
      from 45% before surgery to less than 10% 6 months after surgery. The proportion of inactive&#xD;
      people 6 years after surgery was 20%. Patients who undergo surgery for obesity has low energy&#xD;
      consumption related to physical activity before surgery, as measured by pedometer or&#xD;
      self-reported physical activity. The results in terms of increased physical activity after&#xD;
      surgery are contradictory, where physical activity increases more in studies based on&#xD;
      self-reported physical activity than in studies where measurements are made with the&#xD;
      objective method. In a Swedish study (n = 56 women) no change could be seen in physical&#xD;
      activity and sedentary after bariatric surgery. For a group of extremely obese (BMI around&#xD;
      50) were found reduced energy consumption by 25% after surgery. The decrease was related to&#xD;
      lower body weight (average 53 kg) and thus decreased basal energy consumption and lower&#xD;
      energy consumption during physical activity. A 20% decrease in body weight means an average&#xD;
      of 400 kcal / day lower energy consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among adults is the basal energy consumption approximately 1,500 kcal per day (depending on&#xD;
      body size). For adults, the average energy consumption related to physical activity 300 kcal&#xD;
      / day, compared with 1000 kcal / day for people who traditionally live (hunter / gatherers).&#xD;
      Patients who undergo bariatric surgery have weak mediating factors for physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About sedentary Sedentary and low energy consumption is a risk factor for cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, type 2 diabetes and premature death, even after correction for exercise / training&#xD;
      and body mass index (BMI). Sedentary is also a contributing factor to obesity, independent of&#xD;
      physical activity in general. Moving in everyday life (apart from exercise) is an essential&#xD;
      part of the investigators energy consumption. The difference in energy consumption between a&#xD;
      mainly sedentary person and a person who has a relatively moving life, may be 700 kcal per&#xD;
      day) and compared with a very physically active (moving much at work and leisure), the&#xD;
      difference be 2000 kcal per day. Among people with overweight or obesity, moving in everyday&#xD;
      life is responsible for 90% of the energy consumption related to physical activity.&#xD;
      Overweight people are sedentary 2-2.5 hours more per day than normal weight people, and that&#xD;
      corresponding to a difference in energy of 350 kcal / day. In one year, that is equivalent to&#xD;
      15 kg of body weight. For the population as a whole, 60% of waking hours is sedentary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About behavioral change and interventions to reduce sedentary For patients undergoing&#xD;
      bariatric surgery are increased physical activity in everyday life / decreased sedentary very&#xD;
      important for a positive weight development and favorable results regarding the health and&#xD;
      quality of life, but low energy consumption in everyday life may remain after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is difficult to change an established behavior, or a habit, well documented in social&#xD;
      cognitive theory. Within this theoretical framework has also behavioral change models been&#xD;
      developed. According to Nilsen et al is a habit behavior that has been repeated until it has&#xD;
      become more or less automatically and is independently of the active awareness of what is&#xD;
      happening. Gradually changing behavior control from being guided by beliefs, attitudes and&#xD;
      intentions, that is triggered by a particular situation or context. It has been shown that&#xD;
      behaviors that are repeated in a constant, unchanged context are difficult to change. So,&#xD;
      change in the context where the habit has been established should to be important for a&#xD;
      successful change of a habitual behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generally, there is lack of efficacy studies of interventions to reduce sedentary. A&#xD;
      meta-analysis of interventions to reduce sedentary among adolescents show a small but&#xD;
      significant effect. The focus in interventions and research should be on decreased sedentary&#xD;
      connected to television and computer use, sitting at workplace and sitting in the car.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About mediating factors for increased physical activity and decreased sedentary Mediating&#xD;
      factors for increased physical activity are factors that pave the way for change to come&#xD;
      about and continue. The best evidence available for self-efficacy (situation-bound&#xD;
      self-confidence, for example, &quot;I know that I can take uo training again after a break.&quot;),&#xD;
      social support (support and encouragement from family and friends) and enjoyment (experience&#xD;
      / joy of movement).&#xD;
