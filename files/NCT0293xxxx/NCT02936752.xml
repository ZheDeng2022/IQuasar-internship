  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of entinostat when given together&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome after deoxyribonucleic&#xD;
      acid (DNA) methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) therapy failure. Entinostat may stop the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy&#xD;
      with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack&#xD;
      the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving&#xD;
      entinostat together with pembrolizumab may work better in treating patients with&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome after DNMTi therapy failure.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess safety, tolerability, and identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      entinostat given in combination with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To obtain a preliminary estimate of efficacy of entinostat in combination with MK-3475&#xD;
      (pembrolizumab).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the dynamic quantitative change in measurable immunological biomarkers&#xD;
      (proportions of myeloid-derived suppressor cells [MDSCs], and programmed death protein-1&#xD;
      [PD-1] expression in bone marrow) with the combined epigenetic-immunotherapy and correlation&#xD;
      with any observed clinical responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of entinostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive lower dose entinostat orally (PO) on days 1 and 8 or higher dose entinostat&#xD;
      PO on days 1, 8, and 15, and pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 of&#xD;
      cycle 2 and cycles thereafter. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 cycles in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve an objective&#xD;
      response or maintain a stable disease (SD) status after the first 4 cycles may continue to&#xD;
      receive entinostat and pembrolizumab for up to 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 6 months.&#xD;

The variability in the rate of change in MDSCs across patients will also be examined. The association between the clinical outcome and a meaningful reduction in MDSCs, which will be defined after a review of the data, will be assessed with the chi-square test. The quantity of MDSCs at baseline and during treatment as continuous variables can also be compared between responding and non-responding patients using a t-test or Mann-Whitney U-Test, if more appropriate.</description>
