    <textblock>
      Multi-center sequential multiple assignment randomized trial comparing the effectiveness of&#xD;
      three different standard of care treatment options for patients with isolated skin&#xD;
      vasculitis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be initially randomized (1:1:1) to receive one of the 3 medications&#xD;
      under investigation (colchicine 0.6 mg x 2/day; dapsone 150 mg/day; azathioprine 2 mg/kg/day)&#xD;
      for 6 months. Endpoint is response to treatment at month 6 (stage 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient has to discontinue the study drug within the 6 month study period or during&#xD;
      the subsequent follow-up period (up to month 12) because of a lack of response (or failure),&#xD;
      flare or side effect, he/she will be randomized again to receive one of the remaining two&#xD;
      study drugs (stage 2, with a 1:1 randomization ratio) for 6 months. Endpoint in this second&#xD;
      stage will again be the response to treatment at 6 months.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with primary skin vasculitis, not associated with any significant&#xD;
             extra-cutaneous involvement that would require specific immunosuppressive therapy.&#xD;
             Eligible patients will have a diagnosis of either:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Isolated cutaneous small vessel (SV) or medium-sized vessel (MV) vasculitis or&#xD;
                  cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa (PAN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  IgA vasculitis (IgA, formerly Henoch-Schönlein purpura), without active and/or&#xD;
                  progressing renal involvement (stable glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &gt;60&#xD;
                  ml/min; absence of, or mild-and-stable microscopic hematuria without red blood&#xD;
                  cell casts; absence of, or mild-and-stable proteinuria (&lt;1g/24 hours); not&#xD;
                  requiring systemic immunosuppressive therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
             These conditions, when skin-limited, are all currently treated in similar manners in&#xD;
             practice. Mild arthralgias, myalgias, peripheral limb edema, fatigue, weight loss ≤6&#xD;
             lbs or 3 kg within past 3 months, low-grade fever, and mild anemia (Hb ≥ 10 g/dL) will&#xD;
             be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The diagnosis of vasculitis must have been confirmed by skin biopsy prior to&#xD;
             enrollment (earlier, at diagnosis, and/or just prior to enrollment) that has included&#xD;
             an immunofluorescence study (in the case of small vessel vasculitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have active cutaneous vasculitis lasting for at least 1 month&#xD;
             continuously and/or have had 2 or more flares over the six months preceding enrollment&#xD;
             (post-inflammatory lesions such as hyperpigmentation or healing ulceration(s) are not&#xD;
             to be considered active vasculitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have active / ongoing cutaneous vasculitis lesions at the time of&#xD;
             enrollment (post-inflammatory lesions such as hyperpigmentation or healing&#xD;
             ulceration(s) are not to be considered active vasculitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients may have a contra-indication to one of the study drug or have been treated&#xD;
             prior to enrollment with one of the study medications but failed to respond to it&#xD;
             (according to the study definitions of failure and if they have been on the drug at&#xD;
             the target dose or higher for 3 months or longer) or had to stop it because of an&#xD;
             adverse event. Such patients can be enrolled directly in the second stage of the study&#xD;
             and be randomized to receive one of the two other study drugs. The number of such&#xD;
             patients enrolled directly in stage 2 will be capped at 10 (10% of the total&#xD;
             recruitment target).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients may have received systemic glucocorticoids for their cutaneous vasculitis&#xD;
             before enrollment. For the patients on prednisone at the time of enrollment,&#xD;
             prednisone should be stopped within a maximum of 6 weeks after enrollment and&#xD;
             initiation of the study drug, following a pre-defined tapering schedule. Patients on&#xD;
             long-term, low and stable dose of glucocorticoids (≤5 mg/day prednisone-equivalent)&#xD;
             for other conditions (e.g., asthma or adrenal insufficiency) can be enrolled if the&#xD;
             likelihood of requiring a dose increase for this other condition is low during the 6&#xD;
             month study period (these patients will remain on that low and stable dose during the&#xD;
             study period, with the option to receive one short course of prednisone at higher&#xD;
             doses for skin vasculitis flare during the first 3 months of the study period, like&#xD;
             any other patients enrolled).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participant age 18 years or greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Presence of significant extra-cutaneous manifestations suggestive of a systemic&#xD;
             vasculitis or more diffuse condition. The presence of mild arthralgias, myalgias,&#xD;
             peripheral limb edema, fatigue, weight loss ≤6 lbs or 3 kg within past 3 months,&#xD;
             low-grade fever, and mild anemia [Hb ≥ 10 g/dL] are not exclusion criteria. Mild and&#xD;
             stable microscopic hematuria without RBC casts and/or mild and stable proteinuria&#xD;
             (&lt;1g/24 hours) are not exclusion criteria. These latter patients must not require&#xD;
             systemic immunosuppressive therapy because of possible renal involvement and their GFR&#xD;
             must be &gt;60 ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Known systemic and/or non-skin-isolated vasculitis, such as granulomatosis with&#xD;
             polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, cryoglobulinemic&#xD;
             vasculitis, systemic polyarteritis nodosa, central nervous system vasculitis and&#xD;
             patients with detectable antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) by&#xD;
             immunofluorescence or ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, and other known&#xD;
             secondary skin vasculitides such as those secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus,&#xD;
             Sjögren syndrome, another auto-immune condition, a cancer, a hematological disorder,&#xD;
             an ongoing active infection, or an ongoing medication. Investigators should consider&#xD;
             such underlying diagnoses and perform and interpret appropriate laboratory work-up&#xD;
             where indicated based on clinical presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of significant intolerance, allergy or serious adverse events to any of the&#xD;
             study medications: such patients can be enrolled directly in the second stage of the&#xD;
             study and be randomized to receive one of the two other study drugs. The number of&#xD;
             patients enrolled directly in stage 2 of the study will be capped at 10 (10%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients who have contra-indications to two or three of the study drugs (azathioprine,&#xD;
             colchicine, or dapsone), or have been treated prior to enrollment with two or three of&#xD;
             the study drugs but failed to respond to them, or had to stop two or three of them&#xD;
             because of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Deficit in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) or history of hemolytic anemia&#xD;
             (all patients must be tested for G6PD at the screening visit to assess for their&#xD;
             eligibility): such patients can be enrolled directly in the second stage of the study&#xD;
             and be randomized to receive one of the two other study drugs (azathioprine or&#xD;
             colchicine). The number of patients enrolled directly in stage 2 of the study will be&#xD;
             capped at 10 (10%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Low or absent thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) activity (if known, not a&#xD;
             requirement for study entry): Patients known to have low or absent TPMT can be&#xD;
             enrolled directly in the second stage of the study and be randomized to receive one of&#xD;
             the two other study drugs (dapsone or colchicine).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Evidence of significant hepatic insufficiency or liver function tests &gt; 2 times the&#xD;
             upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Evidence of significant renal insufficiency or creatinine clearance &lt; 60 mL/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Evidence of significant or symptomatic anemia or Hb &lt; 10 g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Comorbid condition that has moderate or high likelihood of requiring intermittent&#xD;
             courses of prednisone within the study period, according to the investigator (e.g.&#xD;
             chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), unstable or severe asthma).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Active cancer or history of malignancy within the previous 5 years (patient in&#xD;
             remission of a cancer &gt;5 years, or with non-metastatic prostate cancer or treated&#xD;
             basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin can be enrolled).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Active uncontrolled or serious infection that may compromise or contra-indicate the&#xD;
             use of the study medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patient unable to consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Pregnant or lactating women.&#xD;
