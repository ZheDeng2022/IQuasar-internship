      IMPAACT 2002 was a prospective, multi-site, two-arm, cluster-randomized study that evaluated&#xD;
      whether a health and wellness Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Medication Management (COMB-R)&#xD;
      intervention for depression demonstrated improved depression outcomes (e.g., decreased&#xD;
      depressive symptoms and greater remission and response rates) and medical outcomes (e.g.,&#xD;
      increased cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) T-cell count, decreased HIV RNA level) among&#xD;
      HIV-infected youth in the US compared to enhanced standard care (ESC). Sites were randomized&#xD;
      to either the COMB-R intervention or the ESC control arm. Youth enrolled in the study&#xD;
      attended a Screening/Entry Visit and study visits at Weeks 1, 6, 12, and 24. They had two&#xD;
      additional follow-up visits at Weeks 36 and 48 for the study team to evaluate if observed&#xD;
      effects of the intervention were maintained. The intervention was a treatment for depression&#xD;
      that included a manualized Health and Wellness Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and an&#xD;
      algorithm-driven Medication Management designed to address the unique challenges faced by&#xD;
      this population.&#xD;

    <measure>Depression Outcomes: Quick Inventory of Depression Symptomatology - Self Report (QIDS-SR) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The QIDS-SR ranges from 0-27 and assesses the severity and number of depression symptoms. Data completed through the Audio Computer Assisted Interview (ACASI) system are used for this outcome. A lower score indicates fewer depression symptoms and lower depression symptom severity. Scores for all participants at a site were averaged. The site-specific averages were then analyzed.</description>

    <measure>Depression Outcomes: Response to Treatment, Defined as a Decrease in QIDS-SR Score by &gt;50%</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>We are assessing the percentage of participants with a response to treatment.The percentage of participants at each site with a response was calculated. These percentages were averaged for each treatment and the treatment averages were compared. A response to treatment is considered a decrease in Quick Inventory of Depression Symptomatology, Self Report (QIDS-SR) from Study entry to Week 24 by more than 50%. The week 0 value is generally considered the entry value. Priority is given to the ACASI score at week 0. In certain cases, the week 1 ACASI value is used if there is no ACASI score at week 0, but there is one at week 1. Paper form scores are used for &quot;study entry&quot; if there is no ACASI record, with the value at week 0 prioritized over the value at week 1. Otherwise, ACASI data are used for this outcome. The QIDS-SR is scored from 0 to 27 with a lower score indicating less symptomatology.</description>

    <measure>Biological Outcomes: Plasma HIV RNA Level at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma HIV RNA data are calculated on the log10 scale as log10(RNA copies/mL)&#xD;
For this analysis, HIV-1 RNA values (copies per mL) that were censored below the lower limit of quantification (LLQ) were imputed to be equal to the LLQ - 1. The LLQ was considered to be 40 copies/mL. Viral load was calculated on the log10 scale as log10(RNA copies/mL). Viral load suppression was also measured as copies &lt; 40.&#xD;
The log10 (RNA copies/mL) values were averaged by site and those averages were analyzed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Implemental Fidelity (COMB-R) - Medication Management - Stages</measure>
    <time_frame>week 1, 6, 12, 24</time_frame>
    <description>We summarized the stages of the MM algorithm reported for participants by prescribing clinicians in the COMB-R group. Stage 0 is no medication. Stage 1 is monotherapy with a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI). Stage 2 is monotherapy with a second SSRI. Stage 3 is monotherapy with a non-SSRI. Stage 4 is combination treatment with two antidepressants or an antidepressant plus lithium. Stages 1 through 3 also allow for partial responders to receive augmentation with selected other psychiatric medications.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability: Frequency of Psychiatric Medication Use - Percent of Participants on Psychiatric Medications</measure>
    <time_frame>week 24</time_frame>
    <description>We assessed whether or not participants were taking psychiatric medications at week 24 and we computed the percent of participants at each site taking psychiatric medications overall and by classes of psychiatric medications. We compared the site-level percentages across treatment groups. Classes of medications included: any psychiatric medication, any antidepressant medication, any regimen with a selective serotonin re uptake inhibitor (SSRI), any regimen with a non-SSRI antidepressant medication, any other non-antidepressant psychiatric medication.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability - Frequency of Psychiatric Medication Use - Percent of Study Time on Psychiatric Medications Through Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>over 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For those participants taking each of several classes of psychiatric medications during the first 24 study weeks, we computed the percent of study time during which each participant was taking psychiatric medications of that category. Regimen classes were: any psychiatric medication, any antidepressant medication, single selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI), single non-SSRI, SSRI+other medication, non-SSRI+other medication. Then the average percent of time on each category of medication was computed for all participants at each site. The site-level means were compared across treatments.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability: Number of Interim Visits - Counseling Sessions</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We counted the number of interim visits with the counseling clinician, defined as those outside of the scheduled study visits. The average number for all participants at each site were computed. Site mean numbers were compared across treatments.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability - Number of Interim Medication Management Visits (COMB-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We counted the number of interim visits with the prescribing clinician, defined as those outside of the scheduled study visits. We computed the average number of sessions for all participants at each site. We took the mean of those averages.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>COMB-R and ESC Acceptability Among Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Client satisfaction was computed as the mean of the 8 questionnaire items. Each is rated on a 4-point Likert scale from 1-4, with 4 being the best acceptability. Items reflected quality of service, degree to which program met participant needs, and satisfaction with and efficacy of the help given. The average score for all participants at each site was computed. Site mean scores were compared across treatments.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>COMB-R and ESC Acceptability Among Counseling Clinicians</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Six items were rated on a 4-point Likert scale from 0-3 (0=poor, 1=fair, 2=good, 3=excellent). A higher score indicates better clinician satisfaction with administering the intervention. These questions rated appropriateness, effectiveness, flexibility, ease of use, fit and overall quality of the treatment approach. For each participant's clinician, a mean score of the six items was computed. The average score was computed for the clinicians of all participants at each site. These site-level means were compared between groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>COMB-R MM and ESC Acceptability Among Prescribing Clinicians</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>For each participant's prescribing clinician, we assessed two domains: How easy or difficult it was to follow the treatment plan (ESC) or medication management algorithm (COMB-R) and whether or not participants symptoms improved over the intervention period. These items were assessed on a 5-point Likert scale (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) and reverse scored if necessary so that a higher score reflected that it was easier to follow the algorithm and that the patients' symptoms improved. Average scores at each site were computed and the site-level summaries were compared across treatments.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Grade 3 or Higher Adverse Events (AE), Psychological Hospitalizations, and Suicide Attempts</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In this analysis only &quot;new&quot; events were counted; as identified by MedDRA Preferred Term; that is, those which were first reported after study entry. Two types of adverse events were reported: 1) grade 3 or higher signs/symptoms, and 2) grade 3 or higher diagnoses. &quot;Trigger&quot; events (psychiatric hospitalization or suicide attempts) were also reported. For each of these three types of events, the percent of participants at each site with at least one such event was computed. The average of these site-level percentages within each treatment arm were compared. Note, in some cases due to sparseness (few events reported at sites within a treatment group), the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval was less than zero . In those cases, the bounds were truncated to zero.</description>

        <title>Depression Outcomes: Response to Treatment, Defined as a Decrease in QIDS-SR Score by &gt;50%</title>
        <description>We are assessing the percentage of participants with a response to treatment.The percentage of participants at each site with a response was calculated. These percentages were averaged for each treatment and the treatment averages were compared. A response to treatment is considered a decrease in Quick Inventory of Depression Symptomatology, Self Report (QIDS-SR) from Study entry to Week 24 by more than 50%. The week 0 value is generally considered the entry value. Priority is given to the ACASI score at week 0. In certain cases, the week 1 ACASI value is used if there is no ACASI score at week 0, but there is one at week 1. Paper form scores are used for &quot;study entry&quot; if there is no ACASI record, with the value at week 0 prioritized over the value at week 1. Otherwise, ACASI data are used for this outcome. The QIDS-SR is scored from 0 to 27 with a lower score indicating less symptomatology.</description>

        <description>Adherence to anti-HIV medications at each assessment for the first 24 weeks (during active treatment) and at 48 weeks, as measured by self-report. The second of three questions was how good the participant is at taking his medication as instructed in the last 30 days. Response scales are Likert from 1 to 6, with a higher score indicating better adherence. 1=Very poor .... 6=Excellent.

        <title>Adherence Outcomes: Adherence to Psychiatric Medications - Number of Days in Last 30 With Any Missed Doses</title>
        <description>Adherence to depression medications at each assessment for the first 24 weeks (during active treatment) and at 48 weeks, as measured by self-report for those participants taking depression medications. Three questions were asked; The first of the three questions was to assess the number of days in the last 30 with any missed medication doses.The average number of days for all participants at a site were averaged. The site-specific averages were then analyzed.</description>
        <time_frame>Weeks 24 and 48</time_frame>
        <population>We analyzed data for all participants with adherence to depression medication data reported at either week 24 or week 48. Participants not taking depression medication were excluded.</population>

          <title>Adherence Outcomes: Adherence to Psychiatric Medications - Number of Days in Last 30 With Any Missed Doses</title>
          <description>Adherence to depression medications at each assessment for the first 24 weeks (during active treatment) and at 48 weeks, as measured by self-report for those participants taking depression medications. Three questions were asked; The first of the three questions was to assess the number of days in the last 30 with any missed medication doses.The average number of days for all participants at a site were averaged. The site-specific averages were then analyzed.</description>
          <population>We analyzed data for all participants with adherence to depression medication data reported at either week 24 or week 48. Participants not taking depression medication were excluded.</population>

        <title>Depression Outcomes: Quick Inventory of Depression Symptomatology Self-Report (QIDS-SR) Response to Treatment Over 48 Weeks, Defined as a Decrease in QIDS-SR Score by &gt; 50%</title>
        <description>A response to treatment was considered to be a decrease in Quick Inventory of Depression Symptomatology, Self Report (QIDS-SR) from Study entry to Week 48 by more than 50%. The week 0 value was generally considered the entry value. Priority was given to the ACASI score at week 0. In certain cases, the week 1 ACASI value was used if there was no ACASI score at week 0, but there was one at week 1. Paper form scores were used for &quot;study entry&quot; if there were no ACASI records, with the value at week 0 prioritized over the value at week 1. Otherwise, ACASI data were used for this outcome. The QIDS-SR was scored from 0 to 27 with a lower score indicating less symptomatology.The percentage of participants with a QIDS-SR response at each site was calculated. These percentages were averaged for each treatment and the treatment averages were compared.</description>

            <groups_desc>An interaction effect is computed based on subgroup differences within sites. The mean subgroup difference is computed for each treatment group and the interaction effect is the difference of those group mean differences.This is equivalent to taking the differences of the treatment effects between subgroups. Note: For QIDS-SR, since a lower score reflects fewer depression symptoms, a positive treatment effect is a negative difference value between groups.</groups_desc>

        <title>Behavioral Risk - Drug Use - Past 3 Months Regular Frequency of Use</title>
        <description>Past three months use frequency for cannabis, cocaine, amphetamine, inhalants, sedatives, hallucinogens, opioids was assessed. This was measured on a 5-point Likert scale from 1=Never to 5=almost daily. A lower score indicates less frequent use. Scores were dichotomized as regular use (3=monthly, 4=weekly, 5=daily/almost daily) or low use (1=never, 2=once or twice). The percent of participants who used a substance at regularly, given they ever used it, was computed for each site. We also defined a variable of regular frequency of use for any illegal substance, excluding cannabis.</description>

        <population>We analyzed data for all participants with substance use data reported at either week 24 or week 48. Note that the overall number of participants analyzed includes cannabis use.</population>

        <title>Behavioral Risk - Sex Risk Behaviors. Low Use Frequency of Condom Use in Last Three Months - Main Partner</title>
        <description>Main partner frequency of condom use was measured on a 5-point Likert scale from 1= always, 2 = more than half the time, 3= about half the time, 4=less than half the time to 5=never. It is only reported if participant reported some anal or vaginal sex in past three months. The worse (higher) score of that reported for vaginal or anal sex is analyzed. For each site we computed the percent of participants reporting low frequency of condom use (score = 3, 4 or 5). The site-level percentages were averaged and the site-level averages were compared across treatments.</description>

        <title>Behavioral Risk - Sex Risk Behavior - Low Use Frequency of Condom Use in Past 3 Months - Other Partner</title>
        <description>Condom use frequency for other than main partners was measured on a 5-point Likert scale from 1= always, 2 = more than half the time, 3= about half the time, 4=less than half the time to 5=never. It is only reported if participant reported some anal or vaginal sex in past three months. The worse (higher) score of that reported for vaginal or anal sex is analyzed. For each site we computed the percent of participants reporting low frequency of condom use (score = 3, 4 or 5). The site-level percentages were averaged and the site-level averages were compared across treatments.</description>

        <description>We summarized the stages of the MM algorithm reported for participants by prescribing clinicians in the COMB-R group. Stage 0 is no medication. Stage 1 is monotherapy with a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI). Stage 2 is monotherapy with a second SSRI. Stage 3 is monotherapy with a non-SSRI. Stage 4 is combination treatment with two antidepressants or an antidepressant plus lithium. Stages 1 through 3 also allow for partial responders to receive augmentation with selected other psychiatric medications.</description>

        <description>For those participants taking each of several classes of psychiatric medications during the first 24 study weeks, we computed the percent of study time during which each participant was taking psychiatric medications of that category. Regimen classes were: any psychiatric medication, any antidepressant medication, single selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI), single non-SSRI, SSRI+other medication, non-SSRI+other medication. Then the average percent of time on each category of medication was computed for all participants at each site. The site-level means were compared across treatments.</description>

A higher score indicates better clinician satisfaction with administering the intervention. These questions rated appropriateness, effectiveness, flexibility, ease of use, fit and overall quality of the treatment approach. For each participant's clinician, a mean score of the six items was computed. The average score was computed for the clinicians of all participants at each site. These site-level means were compared between groups.</description>

        <description>For each participant's prescribing clinician, we assessed two domains: How easy or difficult it was to follow the treatment plan (ESC) or medication management algorithm (COMB-R) and whether or not participants symptoms improved over the intervention period. These items were assessed on a 5-point Likert scale (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) and reverse scored if necessary so that a higher score reflected that it was easier to follow the algorithm and that the patients' symptoms improved. Average scores at each site were computed and the site-level summaries were compared across treatments.</description>

        <description>In this analysis only &quot;new&quot; events were counted; as identified by MedDRA Preferred Term; that is, those which were first reported after study entry. Two types of adverse events were reported: 1) grade 3 or higher signs/symptoms, and 2) grade 3 or higher diagnoses. &quot;Trigger&quot; events (psychiatric hospitalization or suicide attempts) were also reported. For each of these three types of events, the percent of participants at each site with at least one such event was computed. The average of these site-level percentages within each treatment arm were compared. Note, in some cases due to sparseness (few events reported at sites within a treatment group), the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval was less than zero . In those cases, the bounds were truncated to zero.</description>

          <title>Grade 3 or Higher Adverse Events (AE), Psychological Hospitalizations, and Suicide Attempts</title>
          <description>n this analysis only &quot;new&quot; events were counted; as identified by MedDRA Preferred Term; that is, those which were first reported after study entry. Two types of adverse events were reported: 1) grade 3 or higher signs/symptoms, and 2) grade 3 or higher diagnoses. &quot;Trigger&quot; events (psychiatric hospitalization or suicide attempts) were also reported. For each of these three types of events, the percent of participants at each site with at least one such event was computed. The average of these site-level percentages within each treatment arm were compared. Note, in some cases due to sparseness (few events reported at sites within a treatment group), the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval was less than zero . In those cases, the bounds were truncated to zero.</description>
          <population>This is the analysis for the Week 48 data. We count a participant if any new qualifying event was reported prior to the week 48 upper window (+30 days).</population>
