      To improve activities of daily living (ADL) and social functions is the important treatment&#xD;
      plans and goals in participants with schizophrenia. Precise and effective measures of ADL and&#xD;
      social functions are critical for clinicians to set up appropriate treatments plans, follow&#xD;
      up participants' changes, and understand participants' progress. Three common measures of ADL&#xD;
      and social functions used in participants with schizophrenia were the Comprehensive&#xD;
      Occupational Therapy Evaluation Scale (COTES), the Activities of Daily Living Rating Scale&#xD;
      third ed. (ADLRS-3), and the Social Functioning Scale. To investigators' knowledge,&#xD;
      psychometric properties of these assessments have not been examined in participants with&#xD;
      schizophrenia. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to (1) examine internal consistency and&#xD;
      construct validity of these 3 assessments (the COTES, the ADLRS-3, and the Social Functioning&#xD;
      Scale); and (2) calculate missing rate of self-report assessment (the ADLRS-3 and the Social&#xD;
      Functioning Scale). Investigators expect that these results of internal consistency,&#xD;
      construct validity and/or missing rate will provide empirical evidence for using these three&#xD;
      measures in both clinical and research setting.&#xD;

      Social dysfunction is one of the main characteristics of participants with schizophrenia and&#xD;
      influences participants' daily functions and quality of life. The Social Functioning&#xD;
      Scale-Taiwan short form (SFST) is commonly used to measure social function in participants&#xD;
      with schizophrenia. However, no study has examined psychometric properties of the SFST in&#xD;
      participants with schizophrenia exclusively. Therefore, the study aimed to examine missing&#xD;
      rate, ceiling effect/floor effect, internal consistency, and convergent validity of the SFST&#xD;
      in participants with schizophrenia. Investigators obtained schizophrenic self-report data&#xD;
      (the SFST and the ADLRS-3) from occupational therapy records. The Chinese version of the&#xD;
      Activities of Daily Living Rating Scale (ADLRS-3), which has 10 domains, is commonly used for&#xD;
      assessing activities of daily living (ADL) in participants with schizophrenia. However,&#xD;
      construct validity (i.e., unidimensionality) for each domain of the ADLRS-3 is unknown,&#xD;
      limiting the explanations of the test results. From occupational therapy records,&#xD;
      investigators obtained self-report data of the ADLRS-3. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)&#xD;
      was conducted to examine the 10 one-factor structures. If a domain showed an insufficient&#xD;
      model fit, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed to investigate the factor&#xD;
      structure and choose one factor representing the original construct. Internal consistency was&#xD;
      examined using Cronbach's alpha. Ceiling and floor effects were determined by the percentage&#xD;
      of participants with the maximum and minimum scores in each domain, respectively. To evaluate&#xD;
      construct validity (i.e., unidimensionality and convergent validity) and Rasch reliability of&#xD;
      the Comprehensive Occupational Therapy Evaluation Scale (COTES) in participants with&#xD;
      schizophrenia. From occupational therapy records, investigators collected COTES data of&#xD;
      participants with schizophrenia. The 20-item COTES contains three subscales. For construct&#xD;
      validity, investigators first examined the unidimensionality of each subscale using Rasch&#xD;
      analysis. After unidimensionality was supported, investigators examined convergent validity&#xD;
      using Pearson's r and Rasch reliability of the individual subscales in unidimensional and&#xD;
      multidimensional approaches.&#xD;
