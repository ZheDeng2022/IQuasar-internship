  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      APG-115 is a novel, orally active small-molecule mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2)&#xD;
      inhibitor. Mechanistically, APG-115 increases p53 and p21 overexpression, activates p53 -&#xD;
      mediated apoptosis in tumor cells retaining wild-type p53. APG-115 has shown strong dose- and&#xD;
      schedule-dependent antitumor activities in multiple human cancer xenograft and a patient&#xD;
      derived xenograft (PDX) models. The preclinical data generated from APG-115 suggest that it&#xD;
      may have a broad therapeutic potential for the treatment of human cancer as a single agent&#xD;
      and in combination with other classes of anticancer drugs. APG-115 is intended for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors and lymphomas. Upon completion of the Phase&#xD;
      1 dose escalation study to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicities (DLTs), and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), several phase Ib/II studies will&#xD;
      be implemented accordingly.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor&#xD;
             or lymphoma that has relapsed from or is refractory to standard treatment, or no&#xD;
             standard treatment is available. Only patients with advanced/metastatic cancer who&#xD;
             have disease progression after treatment with all available therapies that are known&#xD;
             to confer clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or non-pregnant, non-lactating female patients age ≥18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status ≤ 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Adequate hematologic and bone marrow functions&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Adequate renal and liver function&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Troponin (I) ≤ Upper Limit of Normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Brain metastases with clinically controlled neurologic symptoms, defined as surgical&#xD;
