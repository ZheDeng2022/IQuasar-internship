    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of guadecitabine when given&#xD;
      together with atezolizumab and to see how well they work in treating patients with&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia that has spread to other places&#xD;
      in the body and has come back or does not respond to treatment. Guadecitabine may stop the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. Giving guadecitabine and atezolizumab may work better in treating patients with&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify a safe dose of guadecitabine in combination with atezolizumab and to assess&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of the combination in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome&#xD;
      (MDS) who are refractory to or have lost their confirmed response to one or more&#xD;
      hypomethylating agents (HMAs) and in patients with newly diagnosed MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the efficacy of guadecitabine in combination with atezolizumab for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with MDS who are refractory to or have lost their confirmed response to&#xD;
      one or more HMAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the efficacy of guadecitabine in combination with atezolizumab for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with newly diagnosis MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To measure the impact of the combination of guadecitabine and atezolizumab on overall&#xD;
      survival among patients with relapsed/refractory MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To measure the impact of the combination of guadecitabine and atezolizumab on overall&#xD;
      survival among patients with treatment-naive MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the impact of the combination of guadecitabine and atezolizumab on the&#xD;
      duration of response in patients with relapsed/refractory MDS and treatment-naive MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the impact of the combination of guadecitabine and atezolizumab on&#xD;
      transfusion-dependence among patients with relapsed/refractory and treatment-naive MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the baseline expression/methylation of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)&#xD;
      in T cells among patients with relapsed, refractory and treatment-naive MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To quantify the impact of combination therapy with guadecitabine and atezolizumab on PD-1&#xD;
      expression/methylation in T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To correlate response with expression/methylation of PD-1 by T cells and with expression&#xD;
      of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in the bone marrow of patients with MDS treated&#xD;
      with guadecitabine and atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To investigate the expression of tumor antigens on MDS blasts during combination therapy&#xD;
      with guadecitabine and atezolizumab V. To investigate the specific T-cell subsets in MDS&#xD;
      blood and bone marrow during combination therapy with guadecitabine and atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To investigate the specific antigens (epitopes) which are recognized by T-cells in MDS&#xD;
      blood and bone marrow during combination therapy with guadecitabine and atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of guadecitabine followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive guadecitabine subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-5 and atezolizumab intravenously&#xD;
      (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days 8 and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 24 months in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 or 90 days and every 6&#xD;
      months thereafter.&#xD;
