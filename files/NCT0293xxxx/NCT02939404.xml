  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One reason people gain weight is eating more calories from food than what they need for&#xD;
      energy over 24 hours. Metabolism is the amount of energy a person uses over 24 hours.&#xD;
      Researchers want to study the relationship between changes in metabolism and how much a&#xD;
      person eats.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see how much food a person eats when the body's temperature is cooled. To study how&#xD;
      changes in metabolism may alter the amount of food a person eats.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people ages 18-55.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay at NIH for 20 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first 4 days, participants will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests. One blood test includes drinking a sugar solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DXA body composition scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questions about foods they like, physical activity, and personal behavior&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercise test on a stationary bicycle&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will spend 24-hour periods in a metabolic chamber. The chamber will be at normal&#xD;
      room temperature or cooler.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some times, participants will eat a diet that matches their daily needs. Other times, they&#xD;
      can eat as much as they wish from a vending machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have blood and urine collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will swallow an ingestible wireless sensor and wear a small data recorder&#xD;
      device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the second to last day, participants will stay in the metabolic chamber but only consume&#xD;
      water and non-caffeinated sugar-free beverages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will come back for 1-day visits at six months and one year from the first&#xD;
      admission. They will have blood and urine tests, and a DXA scan. They will answer questions&#xD;
      on physical activity and food habits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 30% of adults are considered overweight. In general, lifestyle changes (diet and&#xD;
      exercise) or current weight loss drugs only lead to about 5 to 10% weight loss. This may be&#xD;
      because a person s energy expenditure, aka the number of calories the body uses, leads to&#xD;
      hunger and may increase the amount of food a person eats. Cold exposure is known to increase&#xD;
      metabolism but it may not lead to weight loss if appetite and the desire for food are also&#xD;
      increased. The primary goal of this study is to evaluate whether changing energy expenditure&#xD;
      by cool temperature exposure results in changes in food intake. This study will involve a&#xD;
      stay on our clinical research unit where we will determine the energy requirements (at 24&#xD;
      degree C) of 68 healthy, adult volunteers without evidence of diabetes. Exposure to cool&#xD;
      temperatures (16 degree C) will be used to increase the number of calories a person s body&#xD;
      uses in a day. Participants will spend 24 hours in a room that measures energy expenditure&#xD;
      while the temperature in the room is turned down, once with a fixed diet and once with a&#xD;
      buffet of food choices. After the fixed diet, volunteers will self-select how much food they&#xD;
      wish to eat for one day from a vending machine. Volunteers will also spend one day fasting&#xD;
      followed by a day self-selecting their food from the vending machine. Findings from this&#xD;
      study will provide knowledge about a possible causal link between energy expenditure and&#xD;
      eating behavior. This information may shed light on why many weight loss interventions that&#xD;
      increase energy expenditure do not work as well as expected, and may eventually lead to new&#xD;
      weight loss approaches and therapies.&#xD;
