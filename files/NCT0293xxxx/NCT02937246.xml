      Previous studies indicated that covered stents are less likely to become occluded in&#xD;
      comparison to bare stents. While the probability of occlusions caused by tumor in-growth is&#xD;
      less in covered stents, they are more likely to spontaneously migrate to a position that is&#xD;
      distal to the original deployment site. However, newer covered stents with improved designs,&#xD;
      such as the partially covered double bare metallic stent used for this study, include&#xD;
      features to mitigate the migration issue. The purpose of this study is to confirm whether the&#xD;
      difference in patency rate between regular covered stents and bare stents, which has already&#xD;
      been well established by existing studies, is also reproducible when double covered stents&#xD;
      are compared against double bare stents.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Malignant obstructive jaundice is a common complication of advanced stage cholangiocarcinoma,&#xD;
      GB cancer, and pancreatic cancer. In biliary stricture by malignancy, biliary drainage with&#xD;
      placement of self-expanding metal stent (SEMS) for palliation is the therapy of choice in&#xD;
      these patients. When compared to plastic stents, SEMS present a significantly decreased risk&#xD;
      of recurrent biliary obstruction. SEMS are also more cost-effective than plastic stents in&#xD;
      patients with a life expectancy of longer than 4 months. However, despite their numerous&#xD;
      benefits, SEMS become occluded in up to 50 % of patients in the first 6-8 months. In order to&#xD;
      minimize the occurrence of this issue, covered stents were developed. Previous studies&#xD;
      indicated that covered stents are less likely to become occluded in comparison to bare&#xD;
      stents. While the probability of occlusions caused by tumor in-growth is less in covered&#xD;
      stents, they are more likely to spontaneously migrate to a position that is distal to the&#xD;
      original deployment site. However, newer covered stents with improved designs, such as the&#xD;
      partially covered double bare metallic stent used for this study, include features to&#xD;
      mitigate the migration issue. The purpose of this study is to confirm whether the difference&#xD;
      in patency rate between regular covered stents and bare stents, which has already been well&#xD;
      established by existing studies, is also reproducible when double covered stents are compared&#xD;
      against double bare stents.&#xD;
