      Transplantation of cellularized human cornea impregnated and populated by mesenchymal stem&#xD;
      cells derived from the patient's adipose tissue. The purpose of the study is to assess the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of transplantation of a single dose of&#xD;
      autologous mesenchymal adipose tissue derived adult stem cells (ADAS) cellularized into&#xD;
      laminas for subjects with corneal defects. 3 groups will be included in the study: (1)&#xD;
      transplantation of ADAS alone without scaffold, (2) transplantation of scaffold (human&#xD;
      corneal decellularized lamina) without ADAS, and (3) transplantation of ADAS cellularized on&#xD;
      scaffold (the human corneal decellularized lamina)&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Different types of stem cells have been used in various ways in several research projects in&#xD;
      order to find the optimal procedure to regenerate the human corneal stroma. It included&#xD;
      several approaches which can be classified as intrastromal implantation of stem cells (1)&#xD;
      alone, (2) together with a biodegradable scaffold, (3) with a non-biodegradable scaffold, or&#xD;
      (4) with a decellularized corneal stromal scaffold. In fact, the complex structure of the&#xD;
      corneal stroma has not been yet replicated, and there are well known drawbacks to the use of&#xD;
      synthetic scaffold-based designs. Recently, several corneal decellularization techniques have&#xD;
      been described, which provide an acellular corneal extracellular matrix (ECM). These&#xD;
      scaffolds have gained attention in the last few years as they provide a more natural&#xD;
      environment for the growth and differentiation of cells when compared with synthetic&#xD;
      scaffolds. In addition, components of the ECM are generally conserved among species and are&#xD;
      tolerated well even by xenogeneic recipients. Keratocytes are essential for remodeling the&#xD;
      corneal stroma and for normal epithelial physiology. This highlights the importance of&#xD;
      transplanting a cellular substitute together with the structural support (acellular ECM) to&#xD;
      undertake these critical functions in corneal homeostasis. To the best of the investigators&#xD;
      knowledge, all attempts to repopulate decellularized corneal scaffolds have used corneal&#xD;
      cells, but these cells have major drawbacks that preclude their autologous use in clinical&#xD;
      practice (damage of the donor tissue, lack of cells and inefficient cell subcultures), thus&#xD;
      the efforts to find an extraocular source of autologous cells. A recent study by the&#xD;
      investigators has shown a perfect biointegration of human decellularized corneal stromal&#xD;
      sheets (100µm thickness) with and without h-ADASC colonization inside the rabbit cornea in&#xD;
      vivo, without observing any rejection response despite the graft being xenogeneic. The&#xD;
      investigators also demonstrated the differentiation of h-ADASCs into functional keratocytes&#xD;
      inside these implants in vivo, which then achieved their proper biofunctionalization.&#xD;
      According to the investigator's opinion the transplant of stem cells together with&#xD;
      decellularized corneal ECM would be the best technique to effectively restore the thickness&#xD;
      of a diseased human cornea, like in keratoconus. Through this technique, and using&#xD;
      extraocular mesenchymal stem cells from patients, it is possible to transform allergenic&#xD;
      grafts into functional autologous grafts, theoretically avoiding the risk of rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process flow is defined as following: (1) the file study: which start by receiving the&#xD;
      file of the patient, the file will be forwarded to appointed physicians coordinators for&#xD;
      review and submission of medical report, then the medical report will be evaluated within the&#xD;
      cell therapy committee and the patient will be asked for clinical examination, and after&#xD;
      consultation a reply to the patient with medical decision will follow with an approval or not&#xD;
      to be recruited and if yes, a brief report about the procedure will be submitted and&#xD;
      explained in details to the patient, a consent form must be signed if the patient agree to be&#xD;
      included in the study, (2) the patient admission: which may start by completion of the&#xD;
      procedure forms and doing the pre-op evaluation (initial work up defined as a clinical and&#xD;
      biological assessment upon C.A.S which may include unaided and best spectacle corrected&#xD;
      visual acuity, refraction, slit lamp examination, intraocular pressure, fundoscopy, corneal&#xD;
      topography, aberrometry, endothelial cell count (specular microscopy) as well as blood tests)&#xD;
      by an ophthalmologist, followed by lipoaspiration of the subcutaneous adipose tissue to be&#xD;
      performed by a plastic surgeon, then sample processing at a cGMP facility for isolation and&#xD;
      characterization of the stromal vascular fraction enriched with ADAS as well as laminas&#xD;
      preparing (the quality control assessment will be realized before and after all the steps of&#xD;
      the procedure starting from the ADAS collection to transplantation including cell culture,&#xD;
      cell quiescence, decellularization of human corneal lamina, recellularization of the laminas&#xD;
      with ADAS, and transplantation; the assessment will include cell viability, cell number, cell&#xD;
      apoptosis, immunophenotyping, infection, inflammation by analyzing the secreted cytokines&#xD;
      from ADAS, lamina cutting, lamina thickness, immunostaining, confocal microscopy, etc.); (3)&#xD;
      the delivery (transplantation) which starts by a peribulbar or retrobulbar anesthesia where&#xD;
      the patient is placed under operating microscope, followed by a femtosecond laser assisted&#xD;
      mid-stromal lamellar dissection, then the ADAS or laminas or recellularized laminas will be&#xD;
      placed within the pocket, and finally closed by a superior incision closure. The patient will&#xD;
      be putted under antibiotic/steroids for a defined period and followed by the team at 1 week,&#xD;
      2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol of cell therapy will be applied exclusively at Laser Vision (Hazmieh-Lebanon)&#xD;
      and prepared at Reviva Regenerative Medicine Center in affiliation with VISSUM&#xD;
      (Alicante-Spain) and Optica General (Saida-Lebanon).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's recruitment will take place: for the lipoaspiration, processing, preparing the&#xD;
      celluraized laminas and quality control assessments, at the Middle East Institute of Health&#xD;
      the Reviva Center (Bsalim-Lebanon) under the regulations of the hospital and the Reviva&#xD;
      Center; for injection, at Laser vision (Hazmieh-Lebanon); and for follow-up, at Laser vision&#xD;
      &amp; optica general. All these steps are managed by VISSUM (Prof. J. ALIO).&#xD;
