  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic Hysterectomy (LH) is increasingly used as a standard surgical approach to&#xD;
      hysterectomy. It is a safe procedure with low rates of complications and readmissions.&#xD;
      Increasing evidence indicates that LH may be suitable for an outpatient setting but this may&#xD;
      impair patient's satisfaction in more than 25% of cases. In addition, change from in-patient&#xD;
      care to day case surgery might influence readmission rates and postoperative physical&#xD;
      activity. No data are available on the current length of sick leave in Danish patients after&#xD;
      hysterectomy, and the effects of outpatient surgery on this parameter are difficult to&#xD;
      predict. A randomized controlled trial of LH performed as an outpatient procedure compared&#xD;
      with today's inpatient standard will provide a firm platform for future planning of routine&#xD;
      treatment of patients with need of hysterectomy for benign indications.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hysterectomy is the most frequent gynecological operation world wide and the indication is&#xD;
      often benign. The women are healthy and young with a median age below 50 years. In Denmark,&#xD;
      hysterectomy is performed as an inpatient procedure with a median hospitalization of 1 day.&#xD;
      Hysterectomies in Denmark are distributed by 45% abdominal hysterectomies (AH), 35% vaginal&#xD;
      hysterectomies (VH) and 20% laparoscopic hysterectomies (LH). There is no final consensus&#xD;
      whether VH or LH should be recommended as first choice but LH is gaining more and more&#xD;
      acceptance. Increasing evidence indicates that LH may be suitable for an outpatient setting.&#xD;
      Data seem to assure that outpatient LH is feasible but patient's satisfaction in this setting&#xD;
      remains an open question. A detailed analysis of data from a Norwegian study indicates that&#xD;
      patients reporting dissatisfaction with the early discharge amounts to 25-38%. Such a&#xD;
      decrease in patient's satisfaction would present a significant problem, and a randomized&#xD;
      controlled study of sufficient size with focus on this aspect is therefore needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recommendations on postoperative sick leave vary considerably, due to lack of evidence-based&#xD;
      guidelines and no firm data are available on the relation between outpatient treatment and&#xD;
      sick leave in gynecology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled study attempt to examine outpatient LH and patient satisfaction&#xD;
      and related subject as readmissions and complications, time to return to work, physical&#xD;
      activity in the recuperation period and an overall socioeconomic calculation of the costs of&#xD;
      LH in an in- and outpatient setting.&#xD;
