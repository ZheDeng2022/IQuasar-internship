      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well established that physical fitness improves muscle performance either in sedentary&#xD;
      people or in athletes. In this regard, specific exercises for respiratory muscles can result&#xD;
      in better functional performance in hospitalized individuals, especially in critically ill&#xD;
      patients in prolonged weaning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the following variables between intervention and control patients: success in&#xD;
      weaning, free time off ventilator on ICU after weaning, and gain of muscle strength with the&#xD;
      use of the inspiratory muscle training (IMT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective randomized controlled clinical trial. Only individuals on prolonged weaning will&#xD;
      be enrolled. They will undergo IMT or will be managed in a conventional manner. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint will be successful weaning. In addition, other variables such as free time off&#xD;
      ventilator on ICU after weaning and muscle strength will be measured. In addition, mortality&#xD;
      in the ICU, inside the hospital and after discharge will be followed for one year after study&#xD;
      entrance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the working hypothesis, it is expected that the performance of patients&#xD;
      undergoing IMT will be superior to the conventional treatment. Also, their time to mortality&#xD;
      is expected to be longer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The control group only performed inspiratory muscle training (IMT) with the use of the&#xD;
      T-piece. From the first day of prolonged weaning, patients would remain in spontaneous&#xD;
      breathing progressing their stay time each day, respecting the criteria already mentioned for&#xD;
      interruption and return to mechanical ventilation in support pressure mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group, in addition to the protocol described above, would undergo&#xD;
      inspiratory muscle training with the POWER breathe K-5 (UK) device. POWER breathe K-5 will be&#xD;
      employed once a day, with an initial loading of 40% of maximal inspiratory strength in a&#xD;
      schedule of 30 repetitions. This number of repetitions could be reached in one to 6 sessions&#xD;
      depending on the respiratory muscle force of the patient. Most of the times more than one&#xD;
      session were required. Typically, subjects performed two to six sessions of 5 to 15 breaths&#xD;
      per day, with two minutes rest in ventilation pressure support mode. When the patient was&#xD;
      unable to comply with the schedule, the training session was interrupted at a total of 3&#xD;
      minutes. The load was planned to be adjusted weekly with a 5 to 10% increase until 60% of the&#xD;
      maximal inspiratory strength was reached with a total time of 10 minutes or 100 breaths.&#xD;
      After training with POWER breathe K-5 (UK), the patient would return to mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation in support pressure mode for 30-60 minutes, and then follow the conventional&#xD;
      T-piece protocol. The IMT was conducted normally between 08h and 10h, Monday through Friday.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study subjects would be under continuous surveillance through the multi-parameter DX 2010&#xD;
      monitor (Dixtal, SÃ£o Paulo, SP, Brazil), which records the electrocardiogram, heart rate,&#xD;
      peripheral oxygen saturation and systemic arterial pressure. At any sign of instability, the&#xD;
      IMT was interrupted and the patient returned to the ventilatory support and/or supplemental&#xD;
      oxygen therapy for recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial was stopped if at least one of the following intolerance criteria was present:&#xD;
      SaO2&lt;90% or PaO2 &lt;60 mm Hg with FIO2 &gt;0.4; PaCO2 &gt; 50 mm Hg or increased by &gt; 8 mm Hg;&#xD;
      arterial pH &lt; 7.33 or decreased by 0.07 or more; breathing frequency &gt; 35 breaths/min or&#xD;
      increased by 50% for 5 min or longer; heart rate &gt; 140 beats/min or a sustained increase or&#xD;
      decrease of &gt; 20%; mean blood pressure &gt; 130 or &lt; 70 mm Hg; or presence of agitation,&#xD;
      diaphoresis, disorientation, or depressed mental status.&#xD;
