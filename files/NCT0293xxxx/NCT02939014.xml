  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of&#xD;
      brentuximab vedotin as a single agent in Chinese participants with relapsed/refractory CD30+&#xD;
      Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) or Systemic Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (sALCL).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called brentuximab vedotin. This study will look at&#xD;
      efficacy, safety and PK of brentuximab vedotin in Chinese participants with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory CD30+ HL or sALCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 30 patients. Participants will receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be administered IV infusion on Day 1 each 3-week cycle until the sooner&#xD;
      of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or completion of 16 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in China only. The overall time to participate in&#xD;
      this study is 3.5 years. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be&#xD;
      followed for overall survival (OS) every 12 weeks until death, withdrawal of consent, 18&#xD;
      months after end of treatment (EOT) or study closure, whichever occurs first.&#xD;

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs or worsens after receiving study drug.</description>

Abnormal laboratory values assessed by the investigator that lead to discontinuation or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervention, or were considered by the investigator to be clinically significant changes from Baseline were recorded as Adverse Events. Neutropenia (pooled) includes preferred terms Neutropenia and Neutrophil count decreased.</description>

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs or worsens after receiving study drug.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Antitherapeutic Antibodies (ATA) and Neutralizing Antitherapeutic Antibodies (nATA) to Brentuximab Vedotin</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected to assess the immunogenicity of brentuximab vedotin (ATA development) using a laboratory test to determine ATA titers. Confirmed ATA-positive response was categorized as transient (defined as 1 or 2 post-baseline confirmed ATA-positive responses) and persistent (defined as more than 2 post-baseline confirmed ATA positive responses) and by nATA status. The number of participants in each baseline ATA and post-baseline ATA categories are reported.</description>
