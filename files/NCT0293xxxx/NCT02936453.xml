      STIMO is a First-in-Man (FIM) study to confirm the safety and feasibility of a closed-loop&#xD;
      Epidural Electrical Stimulation (EES) in combination with overground robot assisted&#xD;
      rehabilitation training for patients with chronic incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will participate during 8-12 months, during which there will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-implant evaluations (6-8 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Device implantation and stimulation optimization (6-8 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overground rehabilitation training with EES (5-6 months). In the period after&#xD;
           implantation, participants need to be present for testing and training, 4 days per week&#xD;
           at the CHUV University Hospital in Lausanne (lodging can be provided). It is possible to&#xD;
           complement the neuro-rehabilitative training at CHUV with training outside the&#xD;
           rehabilitation room by making use of the Home-use system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the protocol, the study aims to make the patients walk better and faster. As&#xD;
      this is the first study of its kind, success is not guaranteed. However, the potential&#xD;
      benefits outweigh the potential risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An optional extension of the study up to 3 years is offered. During this period, the patient&#xD;
      can continue the training with the Home-use system.&#xD;

      STIMO is a First-in-Man (FIM) study with the objective to confirm the safety and feasibility&#xD;
      of a closed-loop Epidural Electrical Stimulation (EES) in combination with overground robot&#xD;
      assisted rehabilitation training for patients with chronic incomplete spinal cord injury&#xD;
      (SCI), as it was previously successfully demonstrated in animals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Main study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main study lasts about 8-12 months for each individual participant, from signing informed&#xD;
      consent to the final test in the study This period can be divided into 3 distinct phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-implant : about 6-8 weeks from informed consent to implant. During this phase,&#xD;
           patient will participate during a total of 6 distinct days of evaluations, of which 5&#xD;
           days in Lausanne and 1 day at the assessment center in Zurich. The patient will also&#xD;
           participate to 3 weeks of pre-implantation training in a Body Weight Support (BWS)&#xD;
           system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implant and stimulation optimization: about 6-8 weeks, including the implantation of the&#xD;
           epidural lead and the neurostimulator. In this phase, the optimal stimulation parameters&#xD;
           will be determined for the flexing and stretching of both legs. During this period,&#xD;
           participants need to be present at the CHUV University Hospital in Lausanne 4-5 days per&#xD;
           week (lodging can be provided).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rehabilitation training and final evaluation: 4 days per week of rehabilitation training&#xD;
           during a period of 5 months, followed by a final evaluation lasting 4 days in Lausanne&#xD;
           and 1 day in Zurich. In this phase, the patients receive intensive overground&#xD;
           rehabilitation training using a body weight support device in combination with EES, with&#xD;
           the aim of significantly improving their walking capabilities. During this period,&#xD;
           participants need to be present at the CHUV University Hospital in Lausanne (lodging can&#xD;
           be provided) 4 days per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patient has shown the ability to stand or walk safely without robotic assistance,&#xD;
      he/she is offered the possibility to complement his/her neuro-rehabilitative training using&#xD;
      EES outside the robotic environment and rehabilitation room by making use of the Home-use&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Optional study extension (3 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient has the possibility to continue his/her neuro-rehabilitative training with the&#xD;
      home-use system for an additional period of 3 years after the end of clinical rehabilitation&#xD;
      period. During this period, evaluation measures and technical check-ups are made at regular&#xD;
      time points. The patient is contacted monthly to ensure a normal training conduct and a&#xD;
      safety follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the protocol, the study aims to make the patients walk better and faster.&#xD;
      Improvements are quantified through pre-defined measures assessed prior to implant and at the&#xD;
      end of the main study as well as at regular time points during the optional study extension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is the first study of its kind, success is not guaranteed. However, the potential&#xD;
      benefits outweigh the potential risks.&#xD;
