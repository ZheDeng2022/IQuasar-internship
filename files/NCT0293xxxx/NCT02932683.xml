    <textblock>
      This study was designed to evaluate if MedNav impacts the ability of novice resuscitators to&#xD;
      perform Neonatal Life Support (NLS) in the simulated environment, and if this ability is&#xD;
      maintained after a 7 week period. Testing the nul hypothesis that there is no difference in&#xD;
      technical skill completion when performing neonatal resuscitation on a mannequin with or&#xD;
      without MedNav, immediately after training or after a period of 7 weeks since the training&#xD;
      episode.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Novices resuscitators (Medical Students) were invited to attend a 2 hour teaching session on&#xD;
      neonatal resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure that the differences in outcome of Neonatal Life Support (NLS) learning are&#xD;
      attributable to MedNav only, a simple randomisation process was carried out just prior to&#xD;
      testing, where candidates pulled out a folded piece of paper assigning them to either&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. No MedNav on performing NLS (control arm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assistance of MedNav when performing NLS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding/masking was not possible for either the candidate or faculty as the testing process&#xD;
      involved the use of a tablet device to display the MedNav system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On entering the room, candidates stated whether they were using MedNav or not. Each candidate&#xD;
      was given an identical neonatal resuscitation scenario and technical skills in neonatal&#xD;
      resuscitation were assessed using a 12-point mark sheet adapted from the Neonatal Life&#xD;
      Support course provided by the UK Resuscitation Council. After testing, all candidates were&#xD;
      asked to assess their confidence in performing NLS using a seven point Likert scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidates were subsequently invited back for a follow-up session at 7 weeks. Testing of the&#xD;
      same NLS scenario was undertaken with participants staying in their initial allocation&#xD;
      groups. Again technical skills were assessed based on the UK resuscitation council mark sheet&#xD;
      and candidates were asked to rate their confidence on NLS after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For further analysis, a small sample of 9 students from the &quot;non-MedNav&quot; group were asked to&#xD;
      perform NLS with the use of MedNav immediately after their secondary testing at 7 weeks. The&#xD;
      investigators aim here was to assess if this crossover group had a significant improvement in&#xD;
      their task completion owing largely to the use of MedNav.&#xD;
