  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects around 7% of the population yearly. Although&#xD;
      effective treatments are available, only around half of all patients participating in&#xD;
      clinical trials respond to 6 to 12 weeks of antidepressant treatment. Given these high&#xD;
      failure rates, the ability to predict as early as possible whether a patient is (un)likely to&#xD;
      respond would be of great value, as it would enable physicians to change treatment strategies&#xD;
      faster.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early improvement has consistently been found to be a strong predictor of later response.&#xD;
      However, misclassification is still quite common, with perhaps a third of those who do not&#xD;
      show early improvement going on to respond. Conversely, a substantial proportion of those who&#xD;
      do show early improvement do not go on to respond. One possibility for improving the&#xD;
      predictive power of early improvement is to examine individual symptoms, rather than the&#xD;
      total score on a depression rating scale. Some items, for example, could reflect&#xD;
      antidepressant side effects (e.g. gastrointestinal symptoms) and may not be very predictive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project aims to examine the relationship between early improvement in individual&#xD;
      symptoms and response to antidepressants in a very large patient sample. This large sample&#xD;
      size makes it possible to use more rigorous methods than previous studies, such as the use of&#xD;
      cross-validation to confirm the findings. It also makes it possible to examine a large set of&#xD;
      predictors, including possible interactions among early-improving symptoms and between&#xD;
      symptoms and demographic factors like age and gender. The added value of individual symptoms&#xD;
      over and above using the total symptom score alone will also be examined, as well as possible&#xD;
      differences between different antidepressant classes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will use penalized (lasso) regression, which is well-suited to analyzing data&#xD;
      with a large number of (potentially highly correlated) predictors. In the primary analysis,&#xD;
      response after 6 weeks of treatment will be predicted. In secondary analyses, remission at&#xD;
      week 6 and response and remission at week 12 will also be predicted.&#xD;

      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project is an individual patient data meta-analysis. Data will be collated from&#xD;
      31 trials of second-generation antidepressants for the treatment of major depressive&#xD;
      disorder, using data from trial arms treated with placebo or Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA)-approved antidepressants. These trials include a total of approximately 7,800&#xD;
      antidepressant-treated and 3,000 placebo-treated participants. Penalized regression methods&#xD;
      (specifically least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, 'lasso') will be used to&#xD;
      examine the relationship between early improvement in specific depressive symptoms and&#xD;
      response to treatment. Furthermore, the investigators will examine whether interactions among&#xD;
      early-improving symptoms and between early-improving symptoms and demographic variables such&#xD;
      as age and gender improve the prediction of treatment outcome. Finally, the investigators&#xD;
      will also examine whether the prediction of response to treatment by early improvement in&#xD;
      specific symptoms is dependent upon the type of treatment provided (placebo, selective&#xD;
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors&#xD;
      [SNRIs]), which would suggest a drug-specific mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data: A complete cases approach will be taken, as it is of interest to predict&#xD;
      response and remission in participants who have actually taken an antidepressant for the&#xD;
      specified period of time. Therefore, only participants who have valid baseline, week 2 and&#xD;
      week 6 (±1) HDRS scores will be selected for the main analyses (or valid week 12 data for the&#xD;
      secondary analyses of week 12 outcomes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training and validation sample: The data will be randomly divided into an 80% training sample&#xD;
      and a 20% validation sample (stratified by treatment group). Model discovery will be done in&#xD;
      the training sample, while the predictive performance of the models will be assessed in the&#xD;
      validation sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predictors: Improvement in individual symptoms will be derived from the HDRS items at&#xD;
      baseline and week 2. The answer choices for these items range from 0 - 2 for 7 items and 0 -&#xD;
      4 for 10 items. Early improvement will be dichotomized into &quot;no improvement&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;improvement&quot;. &quot;No improvement&quot; is indicated by worsening of the item score (e.g. from 1 at&#xD;
      baseline to 2 at week 2) or no change in the item score. &quot;Improvement&quot; is indicated by an&#xD;
      improvement in the item score of ≥1. Cross-tables will be used to check whether any variables&#xD;
      are very highly correlated and if so, one of the items will be removed. Baseline scores on&#xD;
      the HDRS items will also be included in the model in order to investigate the added value of&#xD;
      improvement of individual items over and above the baseline item scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the total HDRS-17 score, early improvement will also be dichotomized into no/minor&#xD;
      improvement (&lt;20% improvement) or improvement (≥20% improvement). The baseline HDRS-17 score&#xD;
      will be standardized and included in the model as a covariate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regard to the demographic factors, gender is already a dichotomous variable and age will&#xD;
      be standardized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lasso regression: Lasso regression will be applied to the following models:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary analysis (in the antidepressant-treated group only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A model containing variables for early improvement at week 2 in all 17 HDRS items, age,&#xD;
           gender, and all two-way interactions between these variables; baseline HDRS item scores;&#xD;
           and additionally total HDRS score at baseline and early improvement (≥20% improvement in&#xD;
           score) in total HDRS score at week 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exploratory analysis (in all participants, including those treated with placebo)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. As model 1 above, but including treatment group (placebo, SSRI, SNRI) and all two- and&#xD;
           three-way interactions with treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tuning parameter (lambda) resulting in minimal prediction error (based on deviance) will&#xD;
      be selected with the help of 10-fold cross-validation. The GLMMLasso package for multilevel&#xD;
      data will be used to fit the lasso model, which will subsequently be refit with mixed-effects&#xD;
      logistic regression using only the variables selected by lasso regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Model performance: Prediction accuracy will be assessed by applying the mixed-effects&#xD;
      logistic regression model to the independent validation sample. The area under the curve&#xD;
      (AUC) for the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve in predicting response/remission&#xD;
      at 6 or 12 weeks will be used to assess prediction accuracy. Sensitivity, specificity, and&#xD;
      accuracy (percentage of correct predictions) will also be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analyses: Secondary analyses will examine 12-week outcomes within the subgroup of&#xD;
      trials with a double-blind treatment duration of at least 12 weeks.&#xD;
