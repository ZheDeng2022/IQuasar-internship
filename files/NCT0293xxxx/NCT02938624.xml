  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single arm, phase I, dose escalation trial and expansion cohort, examining the safety and&#xD;
      feasibility of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab treatment for early resectable NSCLC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that response rate to neo-adjuvant pembrolizumab&#xD;
      will be higher than the response rate of advanced NSCLC patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      16-28 patients with apparently operable NSCLC, clinically staged I-II with a resectable tumor&#xD;
      would be recruited. Recruitment would be based on clinical assessment by a qualified Thoracic&#xD;
      surgeon, with the appreciation that some of the recruited patients would eventually be deemed&#xD;
      to be non-operable, or with a non-resectable disease, or to harbor a diagnosis different from&#xD;
      NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screen of consenting patients would include a diagnostic biopsy that includes core needle&#xD;
      biopsy procedure. Fresh as well as formalin fixed paraffin embedded baseline tumor samples&#xD;
      will be obtained according to common Standard Operating Procedures. Specimens would be&#xD;
      processed as per pathology standard of care and two cores or more will be utilized later for&#xD;
      the research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A patient recruited after a previous diagnostic biopsy, would be eligible for the trial only&#xD;
      if willing to undergo a repeat diagnostic procedure as above. Processing of biopsy material&#xD;
      will be similar regardless if it is first or second biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial treatment will commence only following pathological confirmation of NSCLC, complete&#xD;
      staging including CT-PET and brain imaging, and positive pre-op cardiac and pulmonary&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study schedule Dose levels of this study are defined by dose of drug as well as number of&#xD;
      treatments and required interval from last treatment to surgery. At least 3 subjects in a&#xD;
      dose cohort must complete the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation period before dosing is&#xD;
      initiated at the next higher dose level. Only toxicities occurring during the DLT period will&#xD;
      be considered as DLTs and utilized to inform dose escalation decisions. The DLT period starts&#xD;
      with the first dose of pembrolizumab till 30 days post-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts consists of 3-6 subjects per dose level, to be treated with study therapy following a&#xD;
      3+3 schema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation will proceed between cohorts according to a modified &quot;3+3 design,&quot; as&#xD;
      explained in the following scheme. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined below and is&#xD;
      confined in time as defined above. As a safety feature, a new dosing/schedule level will open&#xD;
      only after the end of 30 post-operative days of the last patient in the previous cohort. If&#xD;
      cohort one will be found to be too high as RP2D/schedule, the next patients will be treated&#xD;
      at a dose/schedule level minus one. Only one step of dose reduction is planned.&#xD;

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit&#xD;
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.&#xD;

             anti-Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody (including&#xD;
             ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation&#xD;
             or checkpoint pathways).&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).&#xD;
