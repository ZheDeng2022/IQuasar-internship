  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to examine whether stress predicts telomere length in&#xD;
      individuals who hold executive-level positions. Telomeres are the caps at the end of each&#xD;
      strand of DNA that may affect how cells age. Subjects will complete an online&#xD;
      survey/interview and provide one blood sample or saliva samples. The goal is to understand&#xD;
      whether stress predicts genetic markers of longevity.&#xD;

      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between overall levels of&#xD;
      stress and telomere length. It is hypothesized that the high stress group (based on the&#xD;
      Perceived Stress Scale)compared to low stress group will have shorter telomere length. A&#xD;
      secondary aim is to evaluate whether different types of stress have differing degrees of&#xD;
      association with telomere length. An exploratory aim is to assess for gender differences in&#xD;
      the association between stress and telomere length. The investigators are collecting a number&#xD;
      of other measures, including demographics, work sector, perceived social support, and medical&#xD;
      history, in order to adjust for potential confounders in the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an extension of earlier work Dr. Rasgon has done with Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn&#xD;
      at UCSF on the relationship between telomere length and mood outcomes. The investigators hope&#xD;
      this study will add to the growing body of literature on stress and genetic markers of&#xD;
      longevity, specifically how stress level and type is associated with telomere length. The&#xD;
      increased understanding gained through this study may provide leads for predicting&#xD;
      age-related diseases and early mortality in adults, thus benefiting others in the future.&#xD;

        100 subjects - individuals who hold executive-level positions. Participants are males and&#xD;
        females, 18 or older, may be of any ethnic background. The investigators aim to recruit a&#xD;
