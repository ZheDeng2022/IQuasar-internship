      This is a multi-centre, non-randomised, open label Phase I clinical trial of an Advanced&#xD;
      Therapy Investigational Medicinal Product (ATIMP) in adults (age ≥16) with (1) high risk,&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory (r/r) CD19+ B-ALL; (2) r/r DLBCL; (3) r/r CLL/SLL and (4) r/r indolent&#xD;
      B-NHL. The ATIMP for this study is cryopreserved autologous patient-derived T-cells&#xD;
      transduced with the lentiviral pCCL.PGK.alpha.CD19CAT-41BBzeta vector, CD19CAT-41BBζ CAR&#xD;
      T-cells (referred to sub-sequently as CD19CAR T-cells) which is classified as a gene therapy&#xD;
      medicinal product. Patients will undergo an unstimulated leucapheresis for the generation of&#xD;
      the ATIMP. The ATIMP will take approximately 15 days to generate. During this period,&#xD;
      patients may receive &quot;holding&quot; chemotherapy as per institutional practice to maintain disease&#xD;
      control. The study will evaluate ATIMP safety and efficacy and the duration of disease&#xD;
      response in adults with high risk / relapsed CD19+ B-ALL, DLBCL, B-CLL/SLL and indolent&#xD;
      B-NHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive pre-conditioning lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      60mg/kg on Day -6 and fludarabine 30mg/m2 administered over 3 days (Day -5 to Day -3).&#xD;
      Patients with DLBCL only will also receive a single dose of pembrolizumab 200 mg at day -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients recruited to ALLCAR19 will be treated with different dosing schedules, depending on&#xD;
      their underlying disease. Patients with B-ALL and B-CLL/SLL are considered at high risk of&#xD;
      CLL/CRES so receive split dosing, with the sec-ond dose only given in the absence of severe&#xD;
      toxicity 9 days later. Please note CAR T-cell dosing in ALLCAR19 is flat i.e. not dependent&#xD;
      on patient body weight or surface area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regimen A1: Patients with B-ALL with a baseline marrow blast% of ≤20% receive a split&#xD;
           dose with a first dose of 100 x 106 CD19 CAR T-cells and a possible second dose of 310 x&#xD;
           106 CAR T-cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regimen A2: Patients with B-ALL with a baseline marrow blast% of &gt;20% receive a split&#xD;
           dose with a first dose of 10 x 106 CD19CAR T-cells and a possible second dose of 400 x&#xD;
           106 CAR T-cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regimen B: Patients with DLBCL receive a single dose of 200 x 106 CAR T-cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regimen C: Patients with CLL/SLL will receive a split dose with a first dose of 30 x 106&#xD;
           CD19 CAR T-cells and a possible second dose of 200 x 106 CD19 CAR T-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regimen D: Patients with indolent B-NHL receive a single dose of 200 x 106 CAR T-cells&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate ATIMP feasibility and safety of generating CD19CAR T-cells and for&#xD;
      B-ALL patients only, efficacy and the duration of disease response to CD19CAR T-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the interventional phase of the study all patients, irrespective of whether&#xD;
      they progressed or responded to treatment, will enter long term follow up until 10 years&#xD;
      post-CD19CAR T-cell infusion.&#xD;
