      The objective of this study is to identify insulin-specific cerebral blood flow (CBF) control&#xD;
      mechanisms, and establish cerebrovascular responsive baseline in younger (18-45 yrs)&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome adults (MetSyn) who are at substantial risk of stroke and other types of&#xD;
      cardiovascular mortality even if they never develop diabetes. The central hypothesis is that&#xD;
      vasodilator actions of insulin are impaired in MetSyn due to loss of dilator and gain of&#xD;
      constrictor signals. This study will focus on 2 mechanisms that likely limit CBF in MetSyn:&#xD;
      1) Disruption of nitric oxide (NO) vasodilation, and 2) Exaggerated endothelin (ET-1)&#xD;
      constriction. Three specific aims will be addressed: Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      physiologic surges of insulin acutely increase CBF in young adults, but adults with MetSyn&#xD;
      exhibit paradoxical insulin-mediated vasoconstriction. Aim 2: To test the hypotheses that key&#xD;
      mechanisms responsible for poor CBF in MetSyn are shifts in NO and ET-1 signaling.&#xD;
      Specifically, in healthy controls, NO mediates robust dilation, with little to no ET-1&#xD;
      constriction. In contrast, adults with MetSyn exhibit uncoupled NO synthase (NOS) and&#xD;
      exaggerated ET-1 constriction. Aim 3: To test the hypothesis that insulin regulation of CBF&#xD;
      is regionally distinct (e.g. Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) reactive than Anterior Cerebral&#xD;
      Artery (ACA) or basilar), and the negative effects of insulin resistance (IR) are similarly&#xD;
      regionally specific.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction It is widely accepted that insulin resistance in MetSyn increases the risk of&#xD;
      cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and stroke. Additionally, MetSyn is associated with cognitive&#xD;
      impairments and increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases. Despite strong association of&#xD;
      poor cerebrovascular health in MetSyn, the cerebral blood flow (CBF) response to acute&#xD;
      insulin surges in humans remains largely unexplored. Cerebrovascular dysfunction in response&#xD;
      to insulin and potential mechanism(s) that attenuate CBF may not only highlight the central&#xD;
      underpinnings of the pathophysiology of stroke and CVD, it may provide key insights to&#xD;
      understanding cognitive decline strongly linked to older individuals with MetSyn. Therefore,&#xD;
      establishing the mechanisms of insulin-mediated cerebrovascular control are not only&#xD;
      important for decreasing mortality in MetSyn, it may be profoundly important to maintaining&#xD;
      brain health. Insulin-meditated vasodilation is largely a vascular endothelium-dependent&#xD;
      process. Elegant experiments using animal models suggests insulin resistance disrupts six&#xD;
      endothelial signaling pathways, with the strongest evidence implicating a loss of nitric&#xD;
      oxide (NO) vasodilation, and exaggerated endothelin (ET-1) constriction. The literature&#xD;
      indicates that in MetSyn, a spike in insulin leads to vasoconstriction and cerebral&#xD;
      hypoperfusion. These findings are directionally opposite from no change or insulin-mediated&#xD;
      vasodilation and increase in CBF reported in the literature. Evidence suggests that uncoupled&#xD;
      function of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) leads to unfavorable balance between NO, reactive&#xD;
      oxygen species, and ET-1. Normally, stimulation of insulin receptor on the vascular&#xD;
      endothelium should provide an environment in which NOS manufactures NO leading to&#xD;
      vasodilation and inhibition of ET-1. Instead, in MetSyn insulin stimulates the&#xD;
      vasoconstrictor ET-1 to a greater extent while, NOS is uncoupled generating more reactive&#xD;
      oxygen species that scavenges the NO that is generated leading to a greater vasoconstrictor&#xD;
      signal rather than vasodilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims/Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis is that vasodilator actions of insulin are already impaired in&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome due to loss of dilator and gain of constrictor signals. Cerebral&#xD;
      vasodilation to insulin is largely endothelium-dependent. Emerging evidence in animal models&#xD;
      suggests insulin resistance disrupts at least six endothelial signaling pathways that could&#xD;
      be potential targets, and this proposal focuses on two that most likely reduce CBF in MetSyn:&#xD;
      1) Loss of nitric oxide (NO) vasodilation, and 2) Exaggerated endothelin (ET-1) constriction.&#xD;
      These experiments will address three specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that physiologic surges of insulin acutely increase CBF in&#xD;
      young adults, but adults with MetSyn exhibit paradoxical insulin-mediated vasoconstriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To test the hypotheses that key mechanisms responsible for poor CBF in MetSyn are&#xD;
      shifts in NO and ET-1 signaling. Specifically, in healthy controls, NO mediates robust&#xD;
      dilation, with little to no ET-1 constriction. In contrast, adults with MetSyn exhibit&#xD;
      uncoupled NO synthase (NOS) and exaggerated ET-1 constriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To test the hypothesis that insulin regulation of CBF is regionally distinct (e.g. MCA&#xD;
      reactive than ACA or basilar), and the negative effects of IR are similarly regionally&#xD;
      specific.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults with metabolic syndrome will exhibit reduced cerebral vasodilation in response to&#xD;
           an OGTT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NOS inhibition will reduce the CBF responses (Δ CVC/Δ insulin) in lean controls to&#xD;
           levels of Metabolic syndrome whereas it will increase CBF responses in Metabolic&#xD;
           syndrome, suggesting that Metabolic syndrome have uncoupled NOS function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ET-1 inhibition will increase CBF responses (Δ Cerebral Vascular Conductance Index&#xD;
           (CVCi)/Δ insulin) in lean controls and metabolic syndrome. However, it will increase&#xD;
           significantly more in in metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The MCA will be more reactive to insulin surges than other cerebral arteries&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints: Change in Cerebral vascular conductance (CVC, ml/min/100mmHg) relative to&#xD;
      the change in concentration of insulin in blood after consumption of glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects Sixty participants (30 per group) will be recruited. Determination of eligibility&#xD;
      will be a two-step process. The first step is all participants will complete an initial&#xD;
      screen to determine if they qualify for the screening visit. Preliminary eligible subjects&#xD;
      will be invited to the research lab for informed consent and formal screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the screening visit at the research laboratory, subjects will complete informed&#xD;
      consent, a health history questionnaire, an MRI Safety screening form, and a physical&#xD;
      activity questionnaire. Height, weight, blood pressure, and waist and hip circumference will&#xD;
      also be taken. Additionally, a venous blood sample will be drawn for glucose and lipid&#xD;
      testing to determine eligibility. If the screening visit reveals that there is an abnormality&#xD;
      or contraindication to participation, which is covered or not covered in the summarized&#xD;
      exclusion criteria, the potential subject will not be allowed to participate. As a summary,&#xD;
      subjects will experience the following activities during the in-lab screening visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Following initial screening and a screening visit, participation in this study will&#xD;
      involve two separate MRI study visits (Saline infusion as placebo, versus L-NMMA infusion to&#xD;
      inhibit NOS OR Ambrisentan orally (male participants only), versus Lactose placebo orally to&#xD;
      inhibit ET-1). Subjects will be directed into an experimental condition (placebo/L-NMMA or&#xD;
      placebo/Ambrisentan) based on number of subjects need to maintain statistical power. For the&#xD;
      Ambrisentan trial, subjects must be male, due to potential harmful effects of drug on fetus.&#xD;
      Once assigned an experimental condition group, the drug order (placebo/drug) will be&#xD;
      performed in a randomly assigned, counter-balanced single blind fashion. The experimental&#xD;
      procedures will be identical on all testing days with the exception of which drug will be&#xD;
      infused. Throughout each visit, subjects will be monitored for heart rate, blood pressure,&#xD;
      end-tidal carbon dioxide, and verbal communication of adverse symptoms (how is the subject&#xD;
      feeling) while in the MRI scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy Test: All female subjects must have a negative urine pregnancy test prior to either&#xD;
      study visits (placebo or drug) to ensure they are not pregnant at the time of each study&#xD;
      visit. Females will not be assigned to the Ambrisentan trial, even if their pregnancy test is&#xD;
      negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venipuncture Blood Sample: During the screening visit, blood (up to 20 ml) will be drawn&#xD;
      using venipuncture to be analyzed for fasting glucose, serum lipids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will abstain from exercise, caffeine, and NSAIDS, as well as fast for ≥ 10 hours&#xD;
      prior to all experimental trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous Catheter: Trained staff will place two intravenous catheters. Placement of the&#xD;
      catheters will be in any arm veins deemed most suitable for ease of access. However, one will&#xD;
      be placed in the antecubital fossa (infusion), and one in the antecubital, hand, or wrist&#xD;
      vein (blood sample) of the opposite arm for each of the two study visits. The blood sampling&#xD;
      IV catheter will be used to draw up to 15 mL blood samples at specific time points throughout&#xD;
      each study visit to measure concentrations of glucose and insulin as well as for markers of&#xD;
      inflammation and oxidative stress. All procedures are identical during each trial&#xD;
      (placebo/L-NMMA/BQ123). The specific time points, which are approximate due to small&#xD;
      variations in MRI scan times, are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline, prior to baseline PC VIPR scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before PC VIPR scan 1 after OGTT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before PC VIPR scan 2 after OGTT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before PC VIPR scan 3 after OGTT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before PC VIPR scan 4 after OGTT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before PC VIPR scan 5 after OGTT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before PC VIPR scan 6 after OGTT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before PC VIPR scan 7 after OGTT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before PC VIPR scan 8 after OGTT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before PC VIPR scan 9 after OGTT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-venous infusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. NOS inhibition: L - NMMA is a potent non-selective NOS inhibitor used to study vascular&#xD;
      physiology. L-NMMA will be infused at 3 mg/kg body weight/hr bolus (over 10min ) followed by&#xD;
      a maintenance infusion of 1 mg/kg/hr for the duration of the experiment. Systemic delivery of&#xD;
      L - NMMA has been shown to elevate blood pressure ~8-15 mmHg that is within the range&#xD;
      observed during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Placebo: Placebo infusion rates will be determined using the same formulas for L-NMMA&#xD;
      infusion, using the subject's most recent screening weight. Ideally, saline will be infused&#xD;
      at the same rate and quantity as the corresponding drug visit. Subject's that are rescreened&#xD;
      and have a weight change, however, may have a saline infusion rate that differs slightly from&#xD;
      the L-NMMA infusion rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small discrepancy in saline and drug infusion rate is insignificant from a scientific&#xD;
      perspective as there is already variability in the amount of saline that the subject receives&#xD;
      since it is used to flush the IV (1-5 mL) with every blood draw (up to 10 blood draws).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ET-1 - Inhibition studies (15 control, 15 MetSyn) (Ambrisentan Arm):&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. ET-1 inhibition: Ambrisentan is an antagonist of the ETA receptor. Subjects will receive&#xD;
      10 mg of Ambrisentan in a pill form 90-150 minutes prior to the OGTT. This class of drugs&#xD;
      have been used to research ET-1 signaling in diabetes, obesity, and hypertension (Bruno,&#xD;
      Sudano, Ghiadoni, Masi, &amp; Taddei, 2010; Lteif, Vaishnava, Baron, &amp; Mather, 2007; Mather,&#xD;
      Mirzamohammadi, Lteif, Steinberg, &amp; Baron, 2002). ETA receptors are the most likely to&#xD;
      mediate excessive constriction in MetSyn patients. Ambrisentan will be taken orally. Systemic&#xD;
      delivery of endothelin antagonist have been shown at chronic dosing to decrease systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure 4.5±10 mmHg and diastolic 3 ± 7.5 mmHg in hypertensives, and not alter mean&#xD;
      arterial pressure in obesity (Bruno et al., 2010; Mather et al., 2010; Spratt et al., 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Placebo: Placebo pill similar in size and shape to Ambrisentan will be used as placebo&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): A 3 Tesla MRI will be used to quantify cerebral blood flow&#xD;
      and capture cerebral vessel structure at designated time points throughout the study visits&#xD;
      (at baseline and during treatment conditions). No contrast agent will be used at any time.&#xD;
      The subject will be in the scanner for an initial baseline scan and during the experimental&#xD;
      trials. All scanning will be accomplished in the proposed timeline of experimental trials.&#xD;
      While in the scanner, subjects will be monitored for heart rate, ECG, end-tidal carbon&#xD;
      dioxide (CO2), and blood pressure. The scanner has the capabilities to collect this data,&#xD;
      except for end-tidal CO2, which will be collected with a subject monitor. In addition to&#xD;
      standard pulse sequences commonly obtained for clinical purposes (localizers, standard MR&#xD;
      Angiography for vessel anatomy (without a contrast agent), 2D phase contrast MRI for velocity&#xD;
      encoded measurements), a.s.o.; 'basic sequences'), an acquisition scheme developed at the&#xD;
      University of Wisconsin-Madison will be used. This scheme, PC VIPR (phase contrast vastly&#xD;
      under-sampled isotropic projection reconstruction) is unique in its capability to acquire&#xD;
      volumetric data sets with three-directional velocity encoding and high spatial resolution in&#xD;
      fairly short scan times. All pulse sequences used in this study are designed to stay within&#xD;
      the current guidelines for dB/dt established by the FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT): The subject will drink distilled deionized water (300ml)&#xD;
      containing 75 grams glucose within 5 minutes. This is the standard administration of OGTT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Re-enrollment: Male subjects that fully complete the study will have the choice to re-enroll&#xD;
      and complete the wing of the study they did not participate in. Subjects will be re-screened&#xD;
      to determine eligibility and will be separated by at least 1 week from completion of the&#xD;
      study. Furthermore, they only participate in the L-NMMA or Ambrisentan (which ever they have&#xD;
      not completed in the other wing of the study), they will not need to repeat the&#xD;
      control/saline visit.&#xD;
