      This pilot study intends to evaluate an online exercise video rehabilitation program for&#xD;
      stroke survivors with moderate disability compared to usual care. The intervention videos&#xD;
      combine aerobic and resistance training using a latex resistance band, Thera band® elastic&#xD;
      band, specifically designed for rehabilitation. This study will aim to show that for patients&#xD;
      suffering acute ischemic stroke resulting in disability, at-home physical therapy with&#xD;
      aerobic exercise videos will improve depression level and aerobic capacity more than usual&#xD;
      care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seven million Americans are stroke survivors and another four million Americans are expected&#xD;
      to have strokes by 2030.1 Nearly 800,000 strokes occur annually and of these, 25% occur after&#xD;
      a previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).2 Put another way, stroke recurrence&#xD;
      affects 30% of stroke survivors.3 Given the high burden of stroke among stroke survivors,&#xD;
      preventing recurrence is a top priority for post-stroke and post-TIA management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke survivors must cope with impairments in functioning that can range from facial droops&#xD;
      to hemiparesis and aphasia. These physical challenges mean that even four years after stroke,&#xD;
      71% of survivors feel they have not completely recovered from the stroke.4 The peak oxygen&#xD;
      cost (VO2) of participating in activities of daily living such as walking is higher in stroke&#xD;
      survivors six months after stroke than able-bodied individuals.5,6 This increased energy cost&#xD;
      is related to decreased cardiorespiratory reserve, changes in tissue composition, and gait&#xD;
      deviation and asymmetry.5,6 The exhaustion point for hemiparetic stroke survivors falls&#xD;
      within the range of aerobic fitness required to perform activities of daily living (3-5 METS&#xD;
      [Metabolic Equivalents]).6 Small increases in aerobic capacity would therefore translate into&#xD;
      the ability to perform activities of daily living.6&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American Heart Association (AHA) and American Stroke Association issued guidelines in&#xD;
      2014 recommending physical activity and exercise to improve stroke survivors' functional&#xD;
      ability, quality of life, and morbidity of stroke recurrence.3 It is the goal of this study&#xD;
      to improve physical activity adherence in stroke survivors and thereby improve their&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory reserve and reduce depression. Secondary variables to be examined include&#xD;
      functional ability, balance, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), rates of cerebrovascular&#xD;
      and cardiovascular events, and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation post-stroke or post-TIA Cardiac rehabilitation care&#xD;
      post-discharge for stroke survivors is not established standard of practice. Several groups&#xD;
      have been evaluating the efficacy of comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation, as provided to&#xD;
      patients after acute MI, in post-stroke populations. This intervention has been shown to be&#xD;
      cost effective in post-MI care, reducing healthcare cost overall (attributed to fewer&#xD;
      re-admissions) and per quality-adjusted life year.12 Several groups have conducted&#xD;
      small-scale trials of cardiac rehabilitation among TIA and stroke patients with promising&#xD;
      improvements in cardiovascular fitness outcomes.13-16 Aerobic exercise for rehabilitation&#xD;
      after stroke has been evaluated in small randomized controlled trials.6,17&#xD;
&#xD;
      One group conducted a randomized controlled trial of a comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation&#xD;
      program in chronic stroke patients after ischemic events.14 Their intervention was twice&#xD;
      weekly, supervised exercise on cycle ergometers (upper or lower body) to 50-60% maximal heart&#xD;
      rate.14 At the end of the ten-week program, subjects in the intervention arm showed&#xD;
      significant improvements in cardiovascular fitness as measured by peak oxygen consumption&#xD;
      (VO2) and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) after three minutes of exercise.14 Self-reported&#xD;
      depression and anxiety scores also improved in the intervention arm, though health-related&#xD;
      quality of life did not.14 The same group is now conducting a larger clinical trial called&#xD;
      Cardiac Rehabilitation Adapted For Transient Ischemic Attack and Stroke (CRAFTS) expanding on&#xD;
      the results of the earlier pilot.13,14&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another group in London, Ontario conducted a feasibility study evaluating the use of&#xD;
      comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation (CCR) in patients within 12 months of TIA or mild,&#xD;
      non-disabling stroke.15 In this prospective cohort study, 100 patients were enrolled and 80&#xD;
      patients completed the CCR with group-based or home-based progressive aerobic training for&#xD;
      six months.15 Diet counseling in individual or group-based sessions emphasized the&#xD;
      Mediterranean diet.15 Patients were screened for depression and referred to a psychologist&#xD;
      for anxiety, depression, and smoking cessation as needed.15 Medications were optimized to&#xD;
      meet AHA recommendations regarding use of aspirin or anti-platelet agent, angiotensin&#xD;
      converting enzyme inhibitor, statin, and blood pressure management with diuretic.15 The&#xD;
      results of the feasibility study were promising with improvements in cardiopulmonary fitness,&#xD;
      blood lipid profile, BMI, weight, waist circumference, smoking status, and Duke Treadmill&#xD;
      Score.15 Although the study was not powered to evaluate morbidity of stroke/TIA and&#xD;
      mortality, the recurrence of stroke was 0% among patients who completed intake/outtake and&#xD;
      4.6% including patients who left CCR.15&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third study, PREVENT, is a randomized controlled trial out of Nova Scotia, Canada currently&#xD;
      enrolling patients post-TIA or non-disabling stroke to evaluate a program of rehabilitative&#xD;
      exercise and education in improving risk factors.16 The trial aims to randomize 250 patients&#xD;
      to control (usual care) or to a 12-week comprehensive rehabilitation program comprising&#xD;
      group- and home-based exercise with aerobic and resistance training and weekly education&#xD;
      classes.16 Primary outcomes to be measured include lipid profile, blood pressure, waist&#xD;
      circumference, fasting glucose, and hemoglobin A1c; secondary outcomes to be assessed are&#xD;
      exercise capacity, walking endurance, cognitive function, depression, health-related quality&#xD;
      of life, and physical activity.16 The trial was not powered to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the intervention in preventing morbidity of stroke/TIA/cardiac events.16&#xD;
&#xD;
      AHA Recommendation In 2014, American Heart Association (AHA)/American Stroke Association&#xD;
      released recommendations regarding physical activity in stroke survivors.3 Prior to starting,&#xD;
      a pre-exercise physical evaluation including electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate monitoring,&#xD;
      and graded exercise testing. Recommended exercise is aerobic cardiovascular exercise 3-5&#xD;
      times weekly for 20-60 minutes; aerobic activity should achieve 40-70% peak O2 or heart rate&#xD;
      maximum.3 Additional exercise in resistance training two to three days weekly is also&#xD;
      recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed intervention differs from these studies in that it involves a one-way&#xD;
      communication via streaming video in addition to case management follow-up phone calls. To&#xD;
      our knowledge, the efficacy of this tele-intervention has not been reported previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thera-band® elastic bands Thera band® elastic bands (The Hygienic Corporation, Akron, Ohio)&#xD;
      are versatile exercise training tools used primarily to provide graded resistance during&#xD;
      strength training.22 They have been used in home-based resistance training for stroke&#xD;
      rehabilitation with improvement in strength, gait speed, and functional ability.22 Combined&#xD;
      with aerobic activity, strength training of hip flexors, extensors, and abductors improved&#xD;
      gait speeds between 3.6-12.6 meters/minute in ambulatory stroke survivors after ten weeks of&#xD;
      intervention.22-24 A small study (sponsored by the manufacturer of Thera band®) found using&#xD;
      Thera band® elastic band is comparable to using resistance-training machines in activating&#xD;
      exercised muscles, as demonstrated by electromyography (EMG).25 Community-based training with&#xD;
      physiotherapists guiding stroke survivors in the use of Thera band® elastic bands for&#xD;
      resistance training over 16 weeks improves balance and strength.26&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to providing resistance, Thera band® can be used to assist stroke survivors in&#xD;
      dorsiflexion during gait training. Patients who received gait training using Thera band®&#xD;
      showed faster improvement in mobility than usual care.27&#xD;
&#xD;
      A guided, community-based model is the most representative of e-rehabilitation. Strength and&#xD;
      gait improvements are comparable in supervised and unsupervised resistance training in stroke&#xD;
      survivors.23 This study's recorded exercise videos are intended to visually demonstrate&#xD;
      aerobic resistance training to community-dwelling patients. Although the patients will remain&#xD;
      unsupervised, exercise sessions will be entirely guided by a trained exercise physiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot, randomized, controlled, double-blinded study will compare a comprehensive&#xD;
      lifestyle and exercise rehabilitation intervention to usual care in patients after acute&#xD;
      stroke. The investigators of this study intend to evaluate an online exercise video&#xD;
      rehabilitation program for stroke survivors with moderate disability compared to usual care.&#xD;
      The intervention videos combine aerobic and resistance training using a latex resistance&#xD;
      band, Thera band® elastic band, specifically designed for rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will be performed at the Kaiser Permanente (KP) San Diego Medical Center.&#xD;
      Kaiser Permanente patients that are admitted with acute ischemic stroke, resulting in&#xD;
      moderate disability, in the prior two weeks to enrollment range will be recruited in the&#xD;
      medical center. Patients will be directly offered participation in the study by the principal&#xD;
      investigator, at the time of hospital admission to the KP San Diego Medical Center with&#xD;
      ischemic stroke. For patients interested in participating in the trial, screening based on&#xD;
      written inclusion and exclusion criteria will be done by reviewing patient information in the&#xD;
      electronic medical record system. If patient meets initial eligibility criteria, they will be&#xD;
      notified by telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of usual care, all enrolled patients will have an initial study visit included within&#xD;
      their post-hospital discharge follow-up visit. Informed consent will be obtained at this&#xD;
      time, as well as subsequent collection of baseline data, including vital signs, social and&#xD;
      medical history, demographic variables, and questionnaire response items.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have an appointment at Positive Choice within two weeks of the initial&#xD;
      visit for education training, further testing (aerobic capacity measures), and distribution&#xD;
      of Thera bands to the intervention group. Within the subsequent week patients and family in&#xD;
      the intervention arm will receive an educational outreach call which will include medication&#xD;
      reconciliation and adherence, dietary adjustments, smoking cessation, physical activity,&#xD;
      depression education, as well as how to access the physical therapy videos online. Videos are&#xD;
      20-30 minutes with combination of aerobic and resistance training to be done in seated&#xD;
      positions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study staff will call patients 1 week after the aforementioned educational phone call to&#xD;
      offer encouragement, ask about progress, and answer any questions the patient may have&#xD;
      regarding the videos. To control patients, the call will be a brief reminder to continue to&#xD;
      adhere to medical therapy. Study staff will also call all enrolled patients to screen for&#xD;
      depression at 4-week intervals, and to ensure coordination for depression treatment with&#xD;
      primary care physician. Investigator will perform physical exam including NIH stroke scale at&#xD;
      the completion of prescribed therapy. At this time, patient will be advised to continue&#xD;
      physical activity with videos as part of AHA recommendation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome status (in terms of toxicity, response, reason off study, progression, and&#xD;
      survival) of all eligible patients will be reported. All eligible patients who begin&#xD;
      treatment will be included in the analysis of survival and time-to-failure. The primary&#xD;
      outcomes of this study are the impact on the depression scores and cardiorespiratory reserve&#xD;
      change of stroke survivors as a result of the intervention videos combined with aerobic and&#xD;
      resistance training using a latex resistance bands. Additional outcomes of this study are&#xD;
      measurement of potential changes in body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), hemoglobin&#xD;
      A1c (HbA1c), functional status, balance, incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular&#xD;
      events, as well as adherence to exercise program.&#xD;
