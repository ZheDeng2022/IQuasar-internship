      People with disabilities experience a staggering incidence of secondary conditions that can&#xD;
      result in death or negatively impact their health, participation in the community, and&#xD;
      quality of life. Many of these chronic secondary conditions are preventable. The Institute&#xD;
      for Healthcare Improvement has advocated for optimizing care through programs that&#xD;
      simultaneously improve health and the patient experience of care, while reducing cost, called&#xD;
      the &quot;Triple Aim.&quot; Studies have shown that the Triple Aim can be achieved through programs&#xD;
      that facilitate community integration; however the U.S. healthcare system lacks a paradigm of&#xD;
      care for individuals with disabilities that promotes community integration. In order to&#xD;
      identify potential models of healthcare delivery for individuals with disabilities that are&#xD;
      effective in achieving the Triple Aim, we will conduct a rigorous research project to&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of two different models of care on the Triple Aim: 1) a community-based&#xD;
      care management program delivered by a non-profit organization through waiver funds, and 2)&#xD;
      the Program for All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) applied to younger individuals with&#xD;
      disabilities between ages 55-64.&#xD;

      People with disabilities experience a staggering incidence of secondary conditions that can&#xD;
      result in death or negatively impact their health, participation in the community, and&#xD;
      quality of life. Many of these chronic secondary conditions are preventable. The Institute&#xD;
      for Healthcare Improvement has advocated for optimizing care through programs that&#xD;
      simultaneously improve health and the patient experience of care, while reducing cost, called&#xD;
      the &quot;Triple Aim.&quot; Studies have shown that the Triple Aim can be achieved through programs&#xD;
      that facilitate community integration; however the U.S. healthcare system lacks a paradigm of&#xD;
      care for individuals with disabilities that promotes community integration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Living in the community affords many benefits for individuals with disabilities and chronic&#xD;
      conditions. Studies have shown that higher integration into the community is associated with&#xD;
      better health outcomes, longevity, higher quality of life, and lower cost of care. For&#xD;
      example, it is estimated that the social support networks of the elderly saves the U.S.&#xD;
      Government over 190 billion dollars annually through positive impacts on health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. healthcare system, however, currently lacks a paradigm of care for individuals with&#xD;
      disabilities that facilitates their integration into the community. Impactful research&#xD;
      studies will be those that investigate delivery models that incorporate community-based&#xD;
      services and that are funded through non-traditional means. One example of an innovative&#xD;
      model of care is a wellness intervention wherein community-based interventions are delivered&#xD;
      by non-profit organizations. For example, a recent study showed that using community-based&#xD;
      peer health coaches to conduct telephone interventions for individuals with chronic spinal&#xD;
      cord injury (SCI) resulted in greater confidence toward health goals and a greater connection&#xD;
      to resources. Another recently published study on the &quot;Living Well&quot; program used health&#xD;
      facilitators to conduct weekly health workshops. This program was implemented by 279&#xD;
      community-based independent living centers funded under Title VII of the Rehabilitation Act&#xD;
      in 46 states, served approximately 9 million participants, and saved an estimated 30 million&#xD;
      dollars. Many other studies have also demonstrated a positive impact of wellness&#xD;
      interventions in a wide variety of chronic and disabling conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community Living and Support Services (CLASS) is a non-profit organization in Pittsburgh, PA,&#xD;
      that provides a host of programs that aim to achieve community integration for individuals&#xD;
      with disabilities. One such program is Community Partners which began in 1986. Community&#xD;
      Partners offer non-traditional case management services which involved physically meeting&#xD;
      with consumers in the community and telephonic support. The services provided included&#xD;
      assisting clients in managing their personal care needs (e.g. activating attendant care&#xD;
      services, or learning how to prepare meals), medical needs (e.g. taking medications on time&#xD;
      or ensuring follow up at medical appointments), wellness needs (e.g. eating a balanced diet&#xD;
      or engaging in adaptive exercise), and social needs (e.g. connecting with vocational&#xD;
      rehabilitation or support groups)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second example of an innovative model of care is the Program for All Inclusive Care for the&#xD;
      Elderly (PACE). A PACE organization is a unique capitated managed care program provided by a&#xD;
      non-profit, public entity, and in some cases a for-profit entity. The PACE model is a dually&#xD;
      capitated, multidisciplinary approach to delivering both medical services and LTSS in&#xD;
      accordance with a participant's needs. The services are delivered in the community whenever&#xD;
      possible, usually integrate into a primary care medical home, and offer non-medical services&#xD;
      including an adult day health center and in-home support services where appropriate. These&#xD;
      organizations are typically responsible for all traditional Medicare-covered services&#xD;
      (hospitals, physicians, and post-acute care), as well as supportive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The services are delivered in the community whenever possible, usually integrate into a&#xD;
      primary care medical home, and offer non-medical services including an adult day health&#xD;
      center and in-home support services where appropriate. These organizations are typically&#xD;
      responsible for all traditional Medicare-covered services (hospitals, physicians, and&#xD;
      post-acute care), as well as supportive care. The services include, but are not limited to,&#xD;
      all Medicare and Medicaid services. At a minimum, a PACE organization must provide 16&#xD;
      different types of services including social work, medications, personal care, nutritional&#xD;
      counseling, recreational and other therapies, transportation, and meals. The care team is&#xD;
      comprised at a minimum of a primary care physician who works a substantial amount of time at&#xD;
      the PACE, a nurse, social worker, physical therapist, occupational therapist, recreational&#xD;
      therapist or activity coordinator, dietitian, PACE center supervisor, home care liaison, and&#xD;
      health workers/aides. These organizations also provide support and respite care for families&#xD;
      and other caregivers of participants. Today, 119 PACE programs in 31 states serve over 38,000&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this project is to evaluate the impact of the Community LIFE program (a&#xD;
      PACE model) on the Triple Aim for individuals with disabilities (health improvement,&#xD;
      satisfaction of care, and cost).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study findings will provide evidence as to whether these types of community-based&#xD;
      delivery system could be scaled to larger populations and adopted by an integrated delivery&#xD;
      system through an innovative funding mechanism.&#xD;
