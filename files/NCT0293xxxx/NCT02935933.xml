      Evaluate the effect of addition of morphine, dexmedetomidine to bupivacaine in PVB could&#xD;
      improve the analgesic effect and thus reduce postoperative morphine consumption and&#xD;
      development of chronic neuropathic pain, compared to PVB with bupivacaine , in patients&#xD;
      undergoing major breast cancer surgery, i.e., modified radical mastectomy (MRM) and breast&#xD;
      conservation surgery with axillary lymph node dissection.&#xD;

      Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy and a leading cause of cancer-related&#xD;
      deaths among women. Surgery followed by chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy are the mainstay of&#xD;
      current management. Chronic pain, or persistent postsurgical pain, which until recently was&#xD;
      considered infrequent after breast cancer surgery (BCS), affects 60% to 80% of breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors. The exact cause of chronic pain after BCS is not clear, but there is an&#xD;
      association between acute postoperative pain and chronic pain generation after BCS.&#xD;
      Postoperative pain intensity and analgesic consumption are significantly higher in patients&#xD;
      who develop chronic pain after BCS, and it is suggested that optimizing postoperative pain&#xD;
      management may reduce chronic pain. preoperative paravertebral block (PVB) administration in&#xD;
      additional to general anesthesia, which has consistently been demonstrated to improve acute&#xD;
      postoperative pain control and decrease length of hospital stay. The role of TPVB in&#xD;
      preventing chronic pain is still evolving. Karmakar et al. shed more light on the impact of&#xD;
      TPVBs in preventing and reducing the severity of chronic pain after breast surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The discovery of peripheral opioid receptors led to the clinical application of adding&#xD;
      opioids to local anesthetics for peripheral nerve blocks. Studies from the 1990s showed mixed&#xD;
      results from the addition of morphine to peripheral nerve blocks, with two suggesting&#xD;
      enhancement of analgesia duration and several showing no benefit at all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective alpha-2 adrenoreceptor agonist that has been shown to&#xD;
      have both sedative and analgesic effects. Although it is approved only for intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      sedation, it has been extensively used for off-label indications, including neuraxial and&#xD;
      peripheral nerve blocks, with good results. A significant prolongation of duration of&#xD;
      analgesia has been reported when dexmedetomidine was added to LA for epidural analgesia,&#xD;
      caudal block, subarachnoid block, PVB, brachial plexus block, ulnar nerve block and greater&#xD;
      palatine nerve block.&#xD;
