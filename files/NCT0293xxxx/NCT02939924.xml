  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess safety and efficacy of the Kanshas DCB in the treatment of de novo lesions in the&#xD;
      superficial femoral (SFA) and/or popliteal arteries.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The KANSHAS 1 (K-1) trial investigates the inhibition of restenosis using the Kanshas DCB in&#xD;
      the treatment of de novo lesions in the superficial femoral or popliteal arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed clinical study will be a prospective, multi-center, controlled, open, single-arm&#xD;
      study. Up to 50 patients will be enrolled at up to 7 sites in Belgium and Germany. Follow-ups&#xD;
      are scheduled before discharge, at 30 days, 6 months, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years. Each patient&#xD;
      will have a follow-up contact via hospital visit and telephone.&#xD;

    <description>The appropriate Kanshas DCB size is selected after review of the patient's baseline angiogram and determination of the reference vessel diameter and lesion length. The balloons is sized to ensure the full length of the lesion is treated. The initial inflation of the study device should be approximately 1 minute for optimal drug release. In order to optimize lesion dilatation, longer inflation times are possible at the discretion of the operator.</description>
