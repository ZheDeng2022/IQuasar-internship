  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early childhood caries (ECC) is a global health problem that causes pain and infection to the&#xD;
      children affected. It is a common disease among preschool children in Hong Kong. There is a&#xD;
      great need to improve at-home ECC preventive measures through oral health promotional&#xD;
      activities as early as possible to parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will propose a 4-year randomized controlled trial of family-centered oral&#xD;
      health promotion for new parents which aims to increase the proportion of parents brushing&#xD;
      their infants' teeth at 1 year, establishing proper feeding and dietary habits, reducing the&#xD;
      transfer of MS from the parents to their infants and then reducing the risk of ECC of the&#xD;
      children at 3 years. The investigators also aim to improve the oral hygiene status of the new&#xD;
      parents and prevention of oral diseases among themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First-time expectant mothers and their husbands will be recruited. The recruited families&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated to the test and control groups. In the test group, personal&#xD;
      hygiene instruction (OHI) for the expectant mothers and their husbands together with oral&#xD;
      health education materials on infant's tooth development and eruption, establishment of&#xD;
      proper feeding, dietary and toothbrushing habits will be given before the delivery of the new&#xD;
      born babies. Reinforcement of OHI and demonstrations on how to clean the infant's oral&#xD;
      cavities and perform toothbrushing will be delivered after the babies are born. Comprehensive&#xD;
      data will be collected from the mothers, fathers and the infants in both the test and control&#xD;
      groups at different time points through dental examination, biological testing and&#xD;
      questionnaire survey. The CONSORT statement will be strictly followed when conducting the&#xD;
      clinical trial, analyzing the data and reporting the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that the effectiveness of oral health promotion starting at the pregnancy&#xD;
      period and for both expecting mothers and their husbands will be greater in preventing the&#xD;
      infants from developing ECC. Furthermore, establishing good oral health care habits will have&#xD;
      long term benefits, helping safeguard the oral health of the children as they grow and the&#xD;
      family as a whole. This study will also provide much needed evidence for the further&#xD;
      development of oral health policies and oral health promotion programmes in Hong Kong;&#xD;
      specifically how these can be integrated into family health education so as to achieve a&#xD;
      higher effectiveness. This will contribute significantly to the improvement of oral health in&#xD;
      the population of Hong Kong.&#xD;
