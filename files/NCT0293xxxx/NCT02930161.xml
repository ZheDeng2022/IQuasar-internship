      The study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of different doses and dosing&#xD;
      regimens of Runihol, tablets, enteric coated, produced by &quot;NTFF&quot; POLYSAN&quot; (Russia), in&#xD;

      The aim of this study is a comparative assessment of the safety and efficacy of different&#xD;
      doses and dosing regimens of Runihol drug tablets, enteric coated, produced by &quot;NTFF&quot; POLYSAN&#xD;
      &quot;(Russia) and placebo tablets, enteric coated, produced by&quot; NTFF &quot;POLYSAN&quot; (Russia), when&#xD;
      administered to patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled comparative&#xD;
      study in parallel groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed on the outpatient basis under the supervision of the&#xD;
      physician-researcher who will be in charge of screening and the whole course of study drug&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of the following periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening - preliminary examination of the eligible patients (duration 14 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The period of therapy - the use of the study drug Runihol®, tablets, enteric coated,&#xD;
           produced by &quot;NTFF&quot; POLYSAN &quot;(Russian) or placebo tablets, enteric coated, produced by&quot;&#xD;
           NTFF &quot;POLYSAN&quot; LLC (Russia), during 84 days (12 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following screening, patients who meet the inclusion criteria and have no criteria for&#xD;
      exclusion will be randomly assigned into three study groups in the proportion of 1: 1: 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group I: treatment with Runihol®, 1 tablet 3 times a day, and placebo tablets, 1 tablet&#xD;
           three times a day, for 84 days (12 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group II: treatment with Runihol®, 2 tablets 2 times a day, morning and evening, and&#xD;
           placebo tablets, 2 tablets once a day, in the afternoon, for 84 days (12 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group III: patients will receive placebo tablets, 2 tablets 3 times a day, for 84 days&#xD;
           (12 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient assessment will be carried out in the course of 6 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 0 (-14 day ... Day 1) - Screening: preliminary evaluation of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period of treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 (Day 1) - evaluation of the patient based on the results of physical examination,&#xD;
      assessment of vital signs, complex laboratory (clinical and biochemical blood tests, PTI,&#xD;
      insulin resistance index calculation, the determination of homocysteine in the serum /&#xD;
      plasma, general urine analysis) and instrumental (ECG ) investigations; randomization, the&#xD;
      appointment of therapy, assessment of concomitant therapy, instructions to fill the patient's&#xD;
      diary, registration of AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (Day 15) - evaluation of the patient based on the results of physical examination,&#xD;
      assessment of vital signs, laboratory complex (clinical and biochemical blood tests, PTI,&#xD;
      determination of homocysteine in the blood serum, the total urine analysis) and instrumental&#xD;
      (ECG) studies; control of intake of study medication / placebo, evaluation of concomitant&#xD;
      therapy, checking patient diary, registration of AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 (Day 29) - evaluation of the patient based on the results of physical examination,&#xD;
      assessment of vital signs, laboratory complex (clinical and biochemical blood tests, PTI,&#xD;
      determination of homocysteine in the serum / plasma, total urine analysis) and instrumental&#xD;
      (ECG ) investigations; control of intake of study medication / placebo, evaluation of&#xD;
      concomitant therapy, checking patient diary, registration of AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4 (Day 57) - evaluation of the patient based on the results of physical examination,&#xD;
      assessment of vital signs, laboratory complex (clinical and biochemical blood tests, PTI,&#xD;
      determination of homocysteine in the serum / plasma, total urine analysis) and instrumental&#xD;
      (ECG ) studies; control of intake of study medication / placebo, evaluation of concomitant&#xD;
      therapy, checking patient diary, registration of AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5 (Day 85) - evaluation of the patient based on the results of physical examination,&#xD;
      assessment of vital signs, laboratory complex (clinical and biochemical blood tests, PTI,&#xD;
      determination of homocysteine in the serum / plasma, insulin resistance index calculation,&#xD;
      the total urine analysis) and instrumental (ECG, ultrasound of the abdomen) investigations;&#xD;
      control of intake of study medication / placebo, evaluation of concomitant therapy, checking&#xD;
      patient diary, registration of AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is expected to include, and randomize at least 162 patients (men and women aged 18&#xD;
      to 65 years) with clinically or histologically confirmed diagnosis of non-alcoholic fatty&#xD;
      liver disease (code ICD-10: K76.0: Fatty degeneration of the liver, not classified elsewhere)&#xD;
      in the form of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and metabolic syndrome, provided with written&#xD;
      informed consent to participate in the study, the relevant criteria for inclusion in the&#xD;
      study and no criteria for exclusion; data collected will be used for further analysis of&#xD;
      safety and efficacy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of possible dropout of patients at screening and during the study a total of 204&#xD;
      patients are planned for inclusion.&#xD;
