  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators evaluated dietary modulation of LIPC rs1800588 (-514 C/T) for lipids and&#xD;
      glucose using a randomized cross-over design comparing a high-fat Western diet and a low-fat&#xD;
      traditional Hispanic diet in Caribbean Hispanics (n=42; 4 weeks/phase).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The LIPC -514 C/T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been inconsistently associated&#xD;
      with high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in population studies, supporting the&#xD;
      possibility of its modulation by dietary factors. To investigate the interaction between the&#xD;
      common LIPC -514(C/T) SNP and dietary fat, the investigators compared changes in lipids and&#xD;
      glucose in response to two levels of dietary total fat (20% energy intake vs. 39% energy&#xD;
      intake) in a crossover, randomized dietary intervention study enrolling Caribbean Hispanics.&#xD;
      Individuals were screened for LIPC rs1800588 genotype prior to enrollment, and&#xD;
      genotype-associated differences in response to diet were evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was designed to test the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Carriers of the T allele consuming a low fat (LF) diet will have decreased hepatic&#xD;
           lipase activity as compared with subjects with the CC genotype at the -514(C/T)&#xD;
           polymorphism. Conversely, in individuals consuming a high fat (HF) diet, T carriers will&#xD;
           exhibit an impaired ability to down regulate hepatic lipase activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Based on differences in hepatic lipase activity, the investigators hypothesized that a&#xD;
           significant and clinically relevant proportion of the individual variability in fasting&#xD;
           plasma HDL-C responses to changes in dietary fat intake would be due to variability at&#xD;
           the LIPC locus. Specifically, CC subjects will respond to increases in total dietary fat&#xD;
           consumption with significant increases in HDL-C concentration. Conversely, increased fat&#xD;
           consumption in T carrying subjects will result in decreased HDL-C concentration.&#xD;

    <description>The dietary intervention was designed as a typical Western diet (39% total fat, 14% saturated fat, 12% monounsaturated fat, 9.6% polyunsaturated fat, 42% carbohydrate, 8.8 grams fiber/1000 kcal)</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Low-fat diet</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The dietary intervention consisted of a Hispanic diet (20% total fat, 5.5% saturated fat, 9.6% monounsaturated fat, 3.7% polyunsaturated fat, 61% carbohydrate, 13.7 grams fiber/1000 kcal). The diet was comprised of typical foods and recipes resembling a traditional Caribbean Hispanic diet and differed from the Western diet in four primary ways: 1) more fruits and vegetables, 2) more beans (e.g. mixed dishes to reduce serving size of white rice while increasing legumes), 3) emphasis on reduced-fat dairy products (e.g., 1% fat milk), and 4) lower total fat and lower animal and hydrogenated fat.</description>
