    <measure>Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve from time 0 to the Time of the Last Measurable non-Below Quantification Limit Concentration (AUC [0-last])</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 29 days</time_frame>
    <description>AUC (0-last) is defined as area under the analyte concentration-time curve from time 0 to the time of the last measurable (non-below quantification limit [BQL]) concentration, calculated by linear-linear trapezoidal summation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to Infinite Time (AUC [0-infinity])</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 29 days</time_frame>
    <description>The AUC (0-infinity) is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinite time, calculated as the sum of AUC(last) and C(last)/lambda(z); wherein AUC(last) is area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to last observed measurable (non-BQL) concentration, and lambda(z) is elimination rate constant; extrapolations of more than 20.00 percent (%) of the total AUC are reported as approximations.</description>

             pregnancy test at screening and all female participants should have a negative urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test on Day -1&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant with a past history of cardiac arrhythmias (example [eg], extrasystoli,&#xD;
             tachycardia at rest), history of risk factors for Torsade de Pointes syndrome (eg,&#xD;
             hypokalemia, family history of long QT Syndrome)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female participant who is breastfeeding at screening or pregnant at screening or&#xD;
             predose&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  Participant with current human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) or HIV-2&#xD;
             infection (confirmed by antibodies) at Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant with current hepatitis A infection (confirmed by hepatitis A antibody&#xD;
             immunoglobulin M [IgM]), or hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (confirmed by HBsAg), or&#xD;
             hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (confirmed by HCV antibody), or hepatitis E&#xD;
             infection (confirmed by hepatitis E antibody IgM) at Screening&#xD;
