      This study will look at cervical tissue samples in women with abnormal cervical cells to see&#xD;
      if the frequency of the HPV 16/18 subtypes has changed in female populations today, after the&#xD;
      introduction of the HPV vaccine. It will compare women who have been exposed to the HPV&#xD;
      vaccine with those who have not.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of cervical dysplasia (precursor to cervical cancer) and cervical cancer&#xD;
      requires infection with one of several cancer causing subtypes of the human papilloma virus&#xD;
      (HPV). There are over 100 subtypes of HPV, and most are not cancer causing. In the past,&#xD;
      North American data has shown that 70% of early cervical cancers were associated with HPV&#xD;
      subtypes 16 and/or 18. The first HPV vaccines to be approved protected against the common&#xD;
      subtypes of HPV 16 and 18. The traditional HPV vaccination consists of 3-doses administered&#xD;
      over a 6 month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the 8 years after the introduction of the vaccine, there have not been any studies&#xD;
      analyzing HPV subtype changes. It is important to determine if the prevalence of the HPV&#xD;
      subtypes associated with precancerous and/or early cervical cancer have changed, and what&#xD;
      preventative outcomes have arisen from the HPV vaccination. This will have implications&#xD;
      regarding the importance and anticipated effects of immunization with the nanovalent vaccine&#xD;
      that includes other oncogenic subtypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will look at tissue samples to see if the frequency of the HPV 16/18 subtypes has&#xD;
      changed in female populations today, after the introduction of the HPV vaccine. It will&#xD;
      compare women who have been exposed to the HPV vaccine with those who have not.&#xD;
