  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the relations among food insecurity status,&#xD;
      obesity, and impulsive food choice patterns and to test the extent to which a mindful eating&#xD;
      strategy reduces impulsive choice for food. The central hypothesis is that food-insecure&#xD;
      individuals will demonstrate more impulsive food choice patterns and demonstrate a greater&#xD;
      likelihood of obesity than individuals who are food secure. Two specific aims are proposed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim #1: Determine the relation between food insecurity, obesity, and impulsive food&#xD;
      choice patterns in women. The working hypothesis is that food-insecure individuals,&#xD;
      especially those that are obese, will exhibit more impulsive food choice patterns than&#xD;
      food-secure individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim #2: Determine the efficacy of an extended mindfulness-based eating strategy on&#xD;
      impulsive choice patterns among food insecure women. The working hypothesis is that mindful&#xD;
      eating will reduce impulsive food choice patterns relative to baseline and control&#xD;
      conditions, and will persist to follow-up. The investigators expect mindful eating to reduce&#xD;
      impulsive choice compared to control conditions, despite food security status.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit women from a variety of community locations, including grocery&#xD;
      stores, public schools, churches, local food pantries, and from governmental food assistance&#xD;
      programs, such as Women, Infants, and Children and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance&#xD;
      Program. Participants will be recruited heavily from settings where low to moderate food&#xD;
      security is prevalent, but not severe food security. Food insecurity status will be&#xD;
      determined by completion of the 18-item United State Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food&#xD;
      Security Module, and will be scored based on standardized scoring techniques. Participants&#xD;
      will provide informed consent, be weighed and measured, and complete several questionnaires&#xD;
      that measure diet quality, time since last pay check or food benefits as well as other&#xD;
      information, such as age, education, ethnicity, employment status, income, marital status,&#xD;
      intelligence, nicotine dependence, and alcohol and drug use. Participants will complete&#xD;
      baseline delay and probability discounting tasks for food and money as measures of&#xD;
      impulsivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, food insecure women only will be randomly assigned to one of three arms: mindful&#xD;
      eating, a nutrition movie, or a control. Participants in the mindful eating group will be&#xD;
      given four foods and receive a 50 min mindful eating workshop. Individuals in the nutrition&#xD;
      movie condition also will be given the same four foods, but will view a 50 minute nutrition&#xD;
      video. The third group (no treatment control) will receive the four foods, but no treatment.&#xD;
      A Time 2 measures of discounting will be administered immediately after the treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, for the next week after Session 2, participants in the mindful eating group will be&#xD;
      asked to practice mindful eating throughout the week. Research assistants will send text&#xD;
      message prompts to participants reminding them to record when they practice mindful eating&#xD;
      during meals twice per day for one week. Those in the Nutrition movie will receive the same&#xD;
      number of prompts during a one week period as the mindful eating group, but they will give&#xD;
      give one-word answers to questions about nutrition. Those in the control group will do&#xD;
      nothing during the week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After one week of mindful eating (or controls), all participants will be asked to return to&#xD;
      the laboratory and complete a third set of discounting tasks.&#xD;
