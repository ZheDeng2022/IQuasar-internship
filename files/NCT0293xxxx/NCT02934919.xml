  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impulse control disorders (ICDs) (such as pathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive&#xD;
      shopping …) are an increasingly recognized psychiatric complications in Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      (PD). Therapeutic management of these disorders is important since they have an impact on&#xD;
      patient quality of life. Dopamine agonists play a key role in the emergence of ICD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Animal models and imaging underline the implication of opioid system in the genesis of ICD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An opioid antagonist, the naltrexone, has been studied to treat ICDs in PD. Papay and al 2014&#xD;
      have found that patients treated by naltrexone showed an interesting decrease of their ICDs&#xD;
      measured by the QUIP RScale. Nevertheless, naltrexone has shown adverse effects such as&#xD;
      increasing hepatic liver enzymes. Nalmefene has no known hepatic adverse effects. Nalmefene&#xD;
      is an opioid antagonist that has an antagonist action on μ and δ receptors, but also an&#xD;
      agonist action on κ receptor. Grant and al 2006 has shown significant reduction of the&#xD;
      severity of pathological gambling in patients treated with nalmefene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of nalmefene in the treatment&#xD;
      of ICDs in PD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this open study, 30 patients with ICDs, will be treated with 18 mg per day of nalmefene&#xD;
      during 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated 2 times: at inclusion visit (J0) and 3 months after (at the end of&#xD;
      the study, +3months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each time, patients will have :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a clinical and neurological evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  neuropsychological tests for cognitive, depression and TCI evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood sample to test hepatic and renal functions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  tolerance evaluation with a list of adverse events/effects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be contacted 3 times by phone: 2 weeks after inclusion, 1 month after inclusion&#xD;
      and 2 months after inclusion, to note the presence of adverse events.&#xD;
