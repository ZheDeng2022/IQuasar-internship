    <textblock>
      This is a study measuring toxicity while making observations about the survival benefits of&#xD;
      treating participants with oligometastatic disease using stereotactic ablative radiotherapy&#xD;
      (SABR).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To assess quality of life and side effects in participants with up to 5 metastatic cancer&#xD;
      lesions treated with a comprehensive oligometastatic SABR treatment program. Secondarily, the&#xD;
      investigators will document the disease free and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oligometastatic state was first defined in 1995 and refers to a stage of disease where&#xD;
      cancer has spread beyond the site of origin, but is not yet widely metastatic. In such a&#xD;
      state of limited metastatic disease, it is hypothesized that eradication of all sites of&#xD;
      metastatic disease could result in long-term survival, or even cure, in some participants.&#xD;
      Ablation of metastatic deposits can be achieved through several techniques, including&#xD;
      surgery, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), or through Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy&#xD;
      (SABR), a new radiotherapy technology that delivers very large, hypofractionated doses of&#xD;
      radiotherapy to small tumor targets, with high rates of local control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evidence to support the presence of an oligometastatic state is controversial.&#xD;
      However, there is emerging low quality evidence in both the surgical and SABR literature that&#xD;
      this state may exist. In a study of over 5200 participants with lung metastases who underwent&#xD;
      surgical resection, a 5-year survival of 36% was reported in participants who achieved a&#xD;
      complete resection, much higher than would be expected for stage IV disease.3 Similarly, in&#xD;
      participants treated with SABR for 1-3 lung metastases from a variety of primary tumors,&#xD;
      local control with SABR was 96% at 2-years, and 2-year survival was 39%. Long-term survival&#xD;
      has been demonstrated in participants treated for oligometastases with surgery or SABR at&#xD;
      several other tumor sites, including liver, brain, bone, and adrenal metastases. The risk of&#xD;
      further metastases after ablative treatment is up to 60-80% in some studies. SABR can also be&#xD;
      used for further salvage at newly progressive sites (oligoprogression).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the apparent achievement of long-term survival with ablative treatment for&#xD;
      oligometastatic disease, the level of evidence to support such treatments is weak, often&#xD;
      based on single-arm studies without appropriate controls. Participants included in such&#xD;
      reports are highly selected, based on good performance status and slow pace of tumor&#xD;
      progression. It has been suggested that the long-term survival achieved with treatment of&#xD;
      oligometastases is a result of the selection of fit participants with very slow-growing&#xD;
      tumors, rather than the result of treatment intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized trials are therefore necessary to establish the utility of ablative treatment of&#xD;
      oligometastatic disease, and therefore the BCCA oligometastatic SABR group, recommends that&#xD;
      participants be considered for a randomized control before being offered SABR on this current&#xD;
      trial. In some circumstances, participants may not be comfortable with this approach, or&#xD;
      their physicians do not have clinical equipoise, and therefore SABR for oligometastatic&#xD;
      disease may be appropriate. BCCA has decided that given the limited evidence for SABR in this&#xD;
      setting, it will not be offered off trial. The main focus of this trial is to assess the side&#xD;
      effects and quality of life post SABR. This trial aims to provide a clear informed consent&#xD;
      process, including the limited evidence for SABR off trial, and potential harm from SABR, for&#xD;
      participants opting to pursue SABR for oligometastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-randomized phase II trial where all participants will receive experimental SABR&#xD;
      to all sites of metastatic disease. The investigators will accrue 200 participants to assess&#xD;
      toxicity associated with this experimental treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy &gt; 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In many scenarios, this is best estimated by a multidisciplinary opinion from&#xD;
                  disease site experts, often obtained by presentation at multidisciplinary tumours&#xD;
                  rounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not a candidate for surgical resection at all sites: surgery to all sites not&#xD;
             recommended by multidisciplinary team, or unfit or declining surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No chemotherapy agents (cytotoxic, or molecularly targeted agents) will be used within&#xD;
             the period of time commencing 2 weeks prior to radiation, lasting until 1 week after&#xD;
             the last fraction. Certain chemotherapy agents may require a longer break prior to or&#xD;
             after SABR if protocols dictate. Hormonal therapy during SABR is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with metastases that have been previously treated may be eligible for this&#xD;
             SABR protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If the previous treatment was systemic therapy, the patient may be eligible, if&#xD;
                  the metastases have demonstrated a complete radiologic response&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If the previous treatment was by a local non-radiation means (e.g. prior&#xD;
                  resection, RFA or microwave ablation), then SABR may be considered for&#xD;
                  residual/recurrent disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If the previous treatment was SABR, the patient is not eligible unless the new&#xD;
                  site(s) was/were not previously treated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the previous treatment was conventional RT, SABR could be considered if it can be&#xD;
             delivered safely. In such a circumstance it must be presented in a multidisciplinary&#xD;
             setting for approval.&#xD;

             questionnaires in English, and other assessments that are a part of this study, via&#xD;
             paper or online using REDCap (if email address is provided by participant on the&#xD;
             informed consent) Note: The potential treating SABR radiation oncologist reserves the&#xD;
             right to require a multidisciplinary note documenting life expectancy, other treatment&#xD;
             options and suitability for SABR.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Serious medical co-morbidities precluding radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bone metastasis in a femoral bone if risk of pending fracture is high&#xD;
