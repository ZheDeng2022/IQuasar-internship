  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioid analgesics are the most common postoperative pain medications used among dentists in&#xD;
      the United States.Although these medications are highly effective in the postoperative dental&#xD;
      pain management, not all patients optimally benefit from this therapy. Many suffer adverse&#xD;
      consequences such as nausea, emesis, and psychomotor impairment, and there is a high&#xD;
      prevalence of opioid prescription misuse among substance abusers within the dental patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of non-opioid analgesics including ibuprofen and acetaminophen in the management of&#xD;
      postoperative dental pain has demonstrated equivalent or superior analgesic effects compared&#xD;
      to opioid analgesic therapies, typically with significantly less adverse effects.However,&#xD;
      despite these results, dentists have encountered a high variability in the success of&#xD;
      non-opioid analgesic responses among the postoperative dental pain population.Thus, new&#xD;
      strategies for earlier recognition of analgesic responses for pain medications is fundamental&#xD;
      in the field of dentistry. Therefore, this study will evaluate the clinical utility of&#xD;
      pharmacogenomic testing in acute postoperative dental pain management among healthy adults&#xD;
      who undergo extraction of impacted mandibular third molar.&#xD;

      To date, the use of pharmacogenomic methods in medicine has broadened our understanding of&#xD;
      the important role of genes and different phenotypes/genotypes that make each individual&#xD;
      unique in pain responses, including drug biotransformation, transportation, and drug-related&#xD;
      side effects to name a few.Thus, recognizing the genetic profile of each individual prior to&#xD;
      the prescription of pain medication for postoperative dental pain management will be&#xD;
      essential to provide a more effective and safer pain therapy.Additionally, we suggest that&#xD;
      80% of the individuals in the general population exhibit a genetic profile that influence a&#xD;
      normal pain response to non-opioid pain therapies. Hence we postulate that the integration of&#xD;
      a pharmacogenomic testing to guide the prescription of ibuprofen and acetaminophen, not only,&#xD;
      could lead to improved clinical postoperative dental pain outcomes, but also, significantly&#xD;
      reduce opioid analgesics prescriptions by dentists.&#xD;

    <description>To compare the pain control outcomes between a single-dose of pharmacogenomics- testing-driven-prescription of ibuprofen (400mg) or acetaminophen (650mg) with those of single-dose (standard of care) of combined formulation of hydrocodone and acetaminophen (5/650mg).
