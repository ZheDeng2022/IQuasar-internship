      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of the Aerobika® device on the&#xD;
      aerosol deposition pattern of concomitant inhalation medication using FRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of the Aerobika® device on&#xD;
      the airway volume (iVaw), lung and lobe volume (iVlobes), airway resistance (iRaw),&#xD;
      hyperinflation, airway wall thickness (iVaww), blood vessel density (iVbv), and air trapping&#xD;

&#xD;
         16. Subject with an uncontrolled disease or any condition that might, in the judgement of&#xD;
             the investigator, place the patient at undue risk or potentially compromise the&#xD;
             results or interpretation of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Subject with active cancer or any other chronic disease with poor prognosis and /or&#xD;
             affecting patient status&#xD;
&#xD;

             scope, and possible consequences of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Subject who received any investigational new drug within 4 weeks of Visit 1 or twice&#xD;
             the duration of the biological effect of any drug (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Subject with a history of alcohol or substance abuse that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, may be of clinical significance.&#xD;
