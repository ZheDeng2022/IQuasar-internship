  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The relative effectiveness of current treatments and their different mechanisms of action&#xD;
      yield to consider more and more that the multiple sclerosis (MS) therapeutic approach must&#xD;
      use multiple molecules, both combined and sequential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this sense, one can assume that the combination of two molecules with different but&#xD;
      complementary mechanisms of action, can delay progression of the disease. Mitoxantrone has a&#xD;
      powerful action, immediate and total, whereas interferon a selective action, immunomodulatory&#xD;
      and delayed.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is based on the hypothesis that there is a synergistic effect of both increasing&#xD;
      the dose of interferon and also the use of mitoxantrone, allowing to further reduce the&#xD;
      conversion rate MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because mitoxantrone decreases the rate of relapses 2 times more than interferon beta, a (at&#xD;
      least) 2 times higher benefit on the disease activity is expected with interferon&#xD;
      mitoxantrone combination than with interferon alone.&#xD;
