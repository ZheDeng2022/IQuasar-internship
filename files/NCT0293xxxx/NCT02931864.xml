  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in Singapore. Breast cancer survivors&#xD;
      usually experience side effects/symptoms after surgery and/or adjuvant chemotherapy and/or&#xD;
      radiotherapy such as fatigue, lymphedema, problems with sleeping, peripheral neuropathy, and&#xD;
      anxiety/depression. Currently, there is no study to include both symptom management and&#xD;
      mindfulness training components for breast cancer survivors. And given breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors have infrequent clinical follow-up, we aim to develop an e-Home based symptom&#xD;
      management and mindfulness training programme for breast cancer survivors and to determine&#xD;
      its effects on quality of life, symptom distress, psychosocial adjustment, psychological&#xD;
      morbidity, and unplanned outpatient attendance or hospitalisation in breast cancer survivors.&#xD;
      We employ a randomised clinical trial with four study arms (with 47 subjects in each arm)&#xD;
      together with a process evaluation; group 1 (usual care), group 2 (experimental group: five&#xD;
      weekly sessions of online symptom management + mindfulness training programme and usual&#xD;
      care), group 3 (comparison group 1: five weekly sessions of online symptom management&#xD;
      programme and usual care), and group 4 (comparison group 2: five weekly sessions of online&#xD;
      mindfulness training programme and usual care). Subjects will complete questionnaires&#xD;
      measures of 6-item Social Support Questionnaire, Breast Cancer Survivor Self-Efficacy Scale,&#xD;
      the Quality of Life-Cancer Survivor Scale, Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale, Psychosocial&#xD;
      Adjustment to Illness Scale, short version of the Fear of Recurrence Scale, Hospital and&#xD;
      anxiety Depression Scale and Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire at baseline (printed&#xD;
      questionnaires), at 8 weeks from baseline, at 12 weeks from baseline and at 24 weeks from&#xD;
      baseline by an online system or printed questionnaires. Individualised semi-structured&#xD;
      interview (15-25 mins) for experimental and comparison groups will be conducted at 24 weeks&#xD;
      from baseline to understand the subjects' experiences of the study programme. Data will be&#xD;
      analysed using SPSS version 24. Baseline demographic and clinical information of subjects in&#xD;
      the experimental, comparison and control groups will be summarised using descriptive&#xD;
      statistics, and will be compared using chi square tests and ANOVA/ANCOVA tests.&#xD;
      Intention-to-treat approach will be used. Repeated measures analysis of variance will be used&#xD;
      to examine the differences on outcome measures among the experimental, comparison and control&#xD;
      groups across study time points. In addition, differences in changes in outcome measures&#xD;
      among experimental, comparison groups and usual care groups will be tested using multilevel&#xD;
      modelling techniques. A p-value smaller than 5% will be considered as statistically&#xD;
      significant. Content analysis will be conducted to analyse the interviews data.&#xD;
