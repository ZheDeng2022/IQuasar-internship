    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 trial of one or more administrations of Zika Virus Purified Inactivated&#xD;
      Vaccine (ZPIV). The trial will be conducted under a placebo controlled, double-blind,&#xD;
      randomized allocation of study product. There are four groups in the study. Each group is&#xD;
      testing a different vaccine schedule.&#xD;

             platelet disorder requiring special precautions)&#xD;

         21. Malignancy (Not excluded: a participant with a surgical excision and subsequent&#xD;
             observation period that in the investigator's estimation has a reasonable assurance of&#xD;
