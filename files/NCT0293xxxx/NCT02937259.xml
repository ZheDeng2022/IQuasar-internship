      Self-admission is a novel treatment tool whereby patients who are well-known to a service who&#xD;
      have high previous utilization of health care are offered the possibility of self-admission&#xD;
      to the inpatient ward for up to seven days without having their motive for admission&#xD;
      questioned. Patients are free to admit themselves because of deteriorating mental health,&#xD;
      acute stress, lack of structure in their everyday life, loneliness, boredom, or any other&#xD;
      reason. The patients decide when they want to admit themselves and can discharge themselves&#xD;
      at any time. The purpose behind the self-admission model is to increase the availability of&#xD;
      inpatient care for severely ill patients, to avoid stressful and possibly destructive visits&#xD;
      to the emergency service, and to decrease total inpatient care utilization. Patients offered&#xD;
      a contract for self-admission usually have a history of repeated and prolonged&#xD;
      hospitalizations. By encouraging them to monitor their own mental health status and allowing&#xD;
      them to seek help swiftly when they are feeling poorly, the delay from first signs of&#xD;
      deterioration to admission can be minimized and full-blown relapse can be avoided, ultimately&#xD;
      reducing the total time spent in hospital. Until now, projects of self-admission have mainly&#xD;
      targeted patients with long-standing psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, or bipolar&#xD;
      disorder. Starting in August 2014, a four-year clinical project at the Stockholm Centre for&#xD;
      Eating Disorders began offering self-admission to patients with severe and enduring eating&#xD;
      disorders. The purpose of this study is to determine whether this model is viable in a&#xD;
      specialized eating disorders treatment setting, if it does lead to increased patient&#xD;
      participation and agency and a reduction of the total time spent hospitalized for this&#xD;
      particular patient group, and if it is cost-effective.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are approximately 100 000 individuals in Sweden who suffer from an eating disorder such&#xD;
      as anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. The course of these disorders is often prolonged and&#xD;
      can lead to enduring disability for many years. Some patients require lengthy periods of&#xD;
      inpatient care, and relapse after discharge is common. Unfortunately, there is still little&#xD;
      evidence concerning the optimal model of inpatient care for patients suffering from a severe&#xD;
      and enduring eating disorder (SE-ED) and unlike psychiatry in general, the hospitalization&#xD;
      rate for SE-ED patients has not been markedly reduced in the past decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Norway, a novel treatment concept for psychiatric patients has been in place for about ten&#xD;
      years: self-admission. In self-admission, patients who are well-known to a service who have&#xD;
      high previous utilization of health care are offered the possibility of self-admission to the&#xD;
      inpatient ward for up to seven days without having their motive for admission questioned.&#xD;
      Patients are free to admit themselves because of deteriorating mental health, acute stress,&#xD;
      lack of structure in their everyday life, loneliness, boredom, or any other reason. The&#xD;
      patients decide when they want to admit themselves and can discharge themselves at any time.&#xD;
      The purpose behind the self-admission model is to increase the availability of inpatient care&#xD;
      for severely ill patients, to avoid stressful and possibly destructive visits to the&#xD;
      emergency service, and to decrease total inpatient care utilization. Patients offered a&#xD;
      contract for self-admission usually have a history of repeated and prolonged&#xD;
      hospitalizations. By encouraging them to monitor their own mental health status and allowing&#xD;
      them to seek help swiftly when they are feeling poorly, the delay from first signs of&#xD;
      deterioration to admission can be minimized and full-blown relapse can be avoided, ultimately&#xD;
      reducing the total time spent in hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Norwegian results are very promising. Self-admission has led to increased patient&#xD;
      participation and compliance, strengthened the patients' abilities to handle their symptoms&#xD;
      and their everyday life, and clearly reduced the total time spent in inpatient care. The&#xD;
      total time spent in non-voluntary inpatient care and the number of violent or threatening&#xD;
      episodes at the ward was also reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now, projects of self-admission have mainly targeted patients with long-standing&#xD;
      psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder. Starting in August 2014, a&#xD;
      three-year clinical project at the Stockholm Centre for Eating Disorders (SCÄ) began offering&#xD;
      self-admission to patients with SE-ED (mainly anorexia nervosa, which is the most common&#xD;
      diagnosis at the SCÄ inpatient ward). The overall goal of the self-admission project at SCÄ&#xD;
      is to create a high-quality treatment approach that is also cost-effective. The relatively&#xD;
      brief nature of these self-admissions will of course not allow for full-scale weight&#xD;
      restoration or achievement of other long-term treatment goals. Instead, this admission&#xD;
      concept is probably best used as booster opportunity or for providing a short respite from&#xD;
      stressful life situations where the risk of relapse is elevated. In this way, offering brief&#xD;
      inpatient treatment as a preemptory tool to be made use of rather than as a &quot;necessary evil&quot;&#xD;
      when severe mental breakdown has already occurred can increase patient participation, agency,&#xD;
      self-awareness, and autonomy. Furthermore, bypassing the traditional clinician-led&#xD;
      decision-making in evaluating whether inpatient treatment should occur could also foster&#xD;
      reflection on subjective motives and barriers in asking for help. Here, self-admission&#xD;
      promotes partnership between patient and clinicians instead of distrust. The approach could&#xD;
      enhance self-knowledge and motivation and, by extension, foster skills and strategies that&#xD;
      can influence the course and prognosis of the disorder. It has been shown that patients&#xD;
      suffering from anorexia nervosa do request inpatient treatment after the initial period of&#xD;
      reinforcement inherent to the disorder has passed and that this is part of a personal process&#xD;
      of increased awareness. As they gradually become more aware of their loss of control over&#xD;
      eating disorder symptoms and of their ambivalence towards change, they also become less&#xD;
      reluctant to ask for assistance in regaining control. For patients with long-standing illness&#xD;
      this process may take several years. It is hypothesized that such a process could be&#xD;
      solidified and hastened by offering patients a concrete tool in the form of self-admission,&#xD;
      by which they are also required to practice self-monitoring and develop agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current program is the first of its kind to offer self-admission to patients with an&#xD;
      eating disorder. If the model proves to be successful, it can hopefully be established as a&#xD;
      standard tool in the treatment of patients with SE-ED. However, a health economics analysis&#xD;
      is critical to determining whether the model merits broader implementation. The potential&#xD;
      health economic benefits are evident: lower health care costs for the specific patient group,&#xD;
      increased availability of much sought after hospital beds for &quot;regular&quot; patients in the queue&#xD;
      to the ward, improving patients' chances of maintaining everyday activities with functioning&#xD;
      family life and work, lowered rates of sick leave, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a preliminary duration of three years, two out of ten beds at the inpatient ward at SCÄ&#xD;
      will be reserved for self-admission; i.e. they will not be occupied by regularly admitted&#xD;
      patients but available only for patients with a self-admission contract, who may at will&#xD;
      admit themselves for a maximum of seven days at a time. Participants are also free to&#xD;
      discharge themselves at will. Upon arrival at the ward, they will see a nurse for a brief&#xD;
      discussion of current status and treatment goals but they will not be assessed by a medical&#xD;
      doctor at this point (unless the ward nurse deems this as necessary due to acute medical&#xD;
      impairment, suicidal communication etc.). There will be no restriction in the total number of&#xD;
      admission episodes and when regarded as necessary patients with a contract can also be&#xD;
      admitted for longer periods of time for a regular admission. The aim is to include a total of&#xD;
      20-40 patients in this program. Inclusion criteria are simple: to be offered a contract,&#xD;
      patients must be well-known to the clinic, they must have received inpatient treatment at the&#xD;
      ward at least once in the previous three years, and they must be willing and able to follow&#xD;
      the basic treatment structure at the ward. Exclusion criteria are active suicidal or&#xD;
      self-injurious behavior and active substance use disorder; however, no body mass index (BMI)&#xD;
      criteria will be applied. In effect, this means that patients considered for inclusion suffer&#xD;
      from SE-ED and that many of them will have been hospitalized on several previous occasions.&#xD;
      Most patients in the program will probably present with a clinical picture of&#xD;
      treatment-refractory anorexia nervosa but it is not ruled out that patients with severe&#xD;
      bulimia nervosa may be able to make use of the concept as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate the clinical self-admission project thoroughly, a broad number of&#xD;
      methods will be employed. The following data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RAND-36 (the RAND Corporation version of SF-36 (Short Form Health Survey));quality of&#xD;
           life questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EQ-5D (EuroQol Health Questionnaire); health experience questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two questions on inpatient care experiences and expectations of project participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At six months:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Semi-structured recorded patient interview concerning subjective experiences of&#xD;
      self-admission. The interview manual, designed specifically for this study, consists of a set&#xD;
      of open-ended questions on several areas of interest regarding participant experiences. The&#xD;
      interview is conducted as an &quot;open&quot; discussion of these topics and the interviewer&#xD;
      continuously checks that all these areas are covered. The recorded interviews are then&#xD;
      transcribed and computer software NVivo is used to conduct a qualitative content analysis,&#xD;
      grouping the interview material into similar nodes and themes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At one year:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RAND-36.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EQ-5D.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of days spent in inpatient care (at SCÄ as well as at other clinics).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of days spent in involuntary inpatient care (at SCÄ as well as at other clinics).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of outpatient visits (at SCÄ as well as at other clinics).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnoses giving rise to inpatient care/outpatient visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current medication prescriptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of days with social security benefits (sick leave from work/school, disability&#xD;
           pension and similar models).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At three years:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Same data as collected at one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Semi-structured recorded patient interview concerning subjective experiences of&#xD;
           self-admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on health care consumption (other than at SCÄ), diagnoses, medication, and social&#xD;
      security benefits will be collected from the National Board of Health and Welfare and from&#xD;
      Statistics Sweden, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, all participants will be assessed with the following psychiatric&#xD;
      scales/questionnaires at inclusion and at one- and three-year follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SCID-5-CV (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Disorders - Clinician Version);&#xD;
           assessment of psychiatric co-morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SEDI (Structured Eating Disorder Interview); assessment of the occurrence of a clinical&#xD;
           eating disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GAF (Global Assessment of Functioning); assessment of global function, the previous axis&#xD;
           V in DSM-IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PSRS (Psychiatric Status Rating Scale for Eating Disorders); assessment of eating&#xD;
           disorder severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EDE-Q (Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire); self-assessment of central diagnostic&#xD;
           components of an eating disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CIA (Clinical Impairment Assessment); assessment of secondary disability due to an&#xD;
           eating disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CPRS (Comprehensive Psychiatric Rating Scale); self-assessment of psychiatric symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SASB (Structural Analysis of Social Behavior); self-assessment of self-image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no randomization; instead, every single patient will function as her or his own&#xD;
      control, in that their individual data on health care consumption etc. during the study&#xD;
      period will be compared with their retrospective data for the same amount of time (thus, up&#xD;
      to three years) proceeding inclusion in the self-admission project. Since all patients in the&#xD;
      study are well known to the clinic, retrospective data are ready available in the patient&#xD;
      files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the health economics evaluation, a cost-benefit analysis will be performed based on&#xD;
      the collected data on quality of life, disease progression, health care consumption,&#xD;
      medication, social security benefits, etc. Changes in availability of hospital beds at the&#xD;
      inpatient ward at SCÄ for &quot;regular&quot; patients without a self-admission contract will also be&#xD;
      analyzed. Hypothetically, by reserving two beds for self-admission and thus reducing the&#xD;
      number of regular beds, overall availability may also be negatively affected. On the other&#xD;
      hand, by establishing a &quot;fast lane&quot; for high consumers of inpatient care and thereby removing&#xD;
      them from the general admission queue, waiting lists may ultimately be reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An estimation of statistical power, assuming a standard deviation based of the effects sizes&#xD;
      found in a previous review of the Norwegian data (multiplied by a factor of 3 in order to&#xD;
      achieve a more conservative estimate), suggests that power is well above 80% (approx. 98%).&#xD;
      As is customary, no separate power estimation has been made for the health economics&#xD;
      evaluation at this point as it will largely be based on the clinical effect data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time plan for the clinical self-admission project is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Autumn 2014: The clinical pilot project is started and the first patients are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2015: Patient interviews at six months. One-year follow-up of the first patients in the&#xD;
           project.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2016: Half-time evaluation at the end of the year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2018: The clinical pilot project ends and a temporary clinical evaluation is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project participants will, however, be included successively during this entire period and&#xD;
      thus, the research part of the project (data collection and analysis) will proceed for an&#xD;
      additional three years, i.e. until 2020:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2017: Analysis of combined 12-month quantitative data. Qualitative content analysis of&#xD;
           6-month interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2018: Cost-benefit analysis of 12-month data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2019-2020: Analysis of combined quantitative 36-month data. Qualitative content analysis&#xD;
           of 36-month interviews. Cost-benefit analysis of 36-month data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will produce four separate sub-studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Qualitative interview study about patient experiences in the self-admission program at 6&#xD;
           months&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Analysis of changes in health care consumption patterns, eating disorder severity and&#xD;
           quality of life at 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Health economics analysis at 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Analysis of changes in health care consumption patterns, eating disorder severity and&#xD;
           quality of life, including health economics analysis, at 36 months&#xD;
