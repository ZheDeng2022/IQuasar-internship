      Study Objective: Allergies affect up to 20% of the population of developed countries and can&#xD;
      cause substantial individual disease burden. For some allergies, immunotherapeutic regimens&#xD;
      (&quot;hyposensitization&quot;) have been established, e.g. for insect venom allergies and pollen&#xD;
      allergies. This project aims at identifying the T cell activation potential in vivo from&#xD;
      resting T cells of patients undergoing immunotherapy (IT) via a systems biology approach. For&#xD;
      the participants, it involves blood draws and stool collection as well as gathering some&#xD;
      basic medical information. The participation takes one week for patients undergoing insect&#xD;
      venom IT and three months for patients undergoing pollen IT. A control group without a&#xD;
      clinical history of allergies is recruited. Blood and stool samples are collected in the same&#xD;
      time frames as in allergic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a cooperation project between the Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg (CHL), the&#xD;
      Luxemburg Institute of Health (LIH), the University of Luxembourg and the Integrated Biobank&#xD;
      of Luxemburg (IBBL).&#xD;

      Summary of the study: Applying systems immunology to the search for personalized biomarkers&#xD;
      of clinical efficacy: Predicting the T cell activation potential in vivo from resting T cells&#xD;
      of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction Allergy affects more than 20% of the populations of most developed countries.&#xD;
      The major allergic diseases, allergic rhinitis, asthma, food allergies and urticaria, are&#xD;
      chronic, cause major disability, and are costly both to the individual and to the society&#xD;
      (World Allergy Organisation (WAO) white book 2013). Besides occupational allergies, the most&#xD;
      common allergies are caused by food, pollen, dust, mold, animal dander, insect sting,&#xD;
      medications…Allergic phenomena are due to an exacerbated response of the immune system to&#xD;
      antigens that are tolerated by non-allergic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After exposure to antigens, naive CD4+ (cluster of differentiation 4) T cells can be&#xD;
      differentiated in different subsets of T helper (Th) cells (Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17, Th22, Tfh)&#xD;
      and induced suppressive regulatory T cells characterized by different cytokine expression&#xD;
      patterns, transcription factors and other surface markers, which will orchestrate adaptive&#xD;
      and innate immune responses to these stimuli. Th2 cells are central players in all the&#xD;
      various forms of Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-associated allergic diseases and are thus regarded as&#xD;
      the most dominant T cell subset sustaining the allergic response. Upon antigen uptake and&#xD;
      processing by antigen-presenting cells, CD4+ T cells are polarized towards a Th2 phenotype,&#xD;
      leading to the expression of Th2 cell-associated cytokines such as Interleukin (IL)-4, -5,&#xD;
      -9, -13, switching B cell response toward IgE production (sensitization or early phase).&#xD;
      Allergen-specific IgE bind to a high-affinity receptor (FcεRI) of innate immune cells&#xD;
      including basophils and mast cells, triggering the release of anaphylactogenic mediators&#xD;
      (cytokines, chemokines, histamine, heparin, serotonin and proteases) responsible for&#xD;
      inflammatory cell recruitment and allergic symptoms (effector or late phase). Identifying&#xD;
      networks of genes expressed in resting and activated Th2 cells from allergic patients would&#xD;
      help distinguish gene candidates predicting immune tolerance to allergens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allergies are diseases involving many cell subsets. The specific reactivities and&#xD;
      contributions to the clinical picture are closely interdependent and not fully deciphered&#xD;
      yet. The interplay between the different actors of the cellular immune system is further&#xD;
      complexified by the existence of the commensal intestinal flora, also called the microbiota.&#xD;
      Gut microbiota is partially under supervision of the immune system, and dysregulations or&#xD;
      changes in the composition of the microbiota, for example due to antibiotics uptake during&#xD;
      childhood and /or different eating habits, may impact adaptative and innate immune functions.&#xD;
      Characterization of the gut microbiota of human hosts undergoing immunotherapy might be of&#xD;
      high interest to delineate interactions between microbiota and adaptive immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite substantial improvements in medications relieving daily allergy symptoms, a&#xD;
      percentage of patients still experience uncontrolled severe symptoms. For these patients,&#xD;
      strictly avoiding the allergen and keeping emergency medications within reach are the best&#xD;
      recommendations so far, and the burden of living with allergy ultimately results in&#xD;
      psychosocial, health, occupational and economic problems by impacting public health costs. In&#xD;
      these cases, the best and feasible solution to improve quality of life is to apply an&#xD;
      immunotherapeutic approach to induce allergen tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) has been implemented for more than 100 years, and&#xD;
      achieves sustained unresponsiveness by administrating escalating doses of the causative&#xD;
      allergen until a maintenance dose is reached. Immunotherapeutic protocols spanning different&#xD;
      durations (from hours for ultra-rush protocols to weeks or months for conventional protocols)&#xD;
      are applied for the treatment of food, pollen, pet dander and insect sting allergy.&#xD;
      Desensitization takes place in sequential steps such as very early desensitization of mast&#xD;
      cells and basophils, skewing of T- and B-cell responses towards regulatory phenotype,&#xD;
      modulation of allergen-specific antibody isotypes and inhibition of migration and mediator&#xD;
      release of eosinophils, basophils and mast cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions remain however about the very early events taking place at initiation of&#xD;
      immunotherapy, as whether mechanisms are different in rush or conventional protocols.&#xD;
      Immunotherapy outcome may be related to events occurring in different cell subsets, and the&#xD;
      identification of predictive biomarkers for tolerance induction is still highly needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To that aim, systems biology will be applied. Systems biology aims at gathering informations&#xD;
      on complex biological systems (for example, transcriptomics data) and to apply computational&#xD;
      tools to better understand and predict whether and to which degrees these systems will react&#xD;
      to perturbations. Based on &quot;omics&quot; data, systems biology gives a bigger picture of cellular&#xD;
      events occurring during the course of AIT than approaches focusing on isolated gene&#xD;
      candidates or signaling pathways. This systemic approach allows the building and inference of&#xD;
      predictive gene expression networks that could not be determined using hypothesis-based&#xD;
      approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale of the research project:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human individuals show great variance in both innate and adaptive immune responses following&#xD;
      immune stimuli. However, little is known about which and how molecular subnetworks&#xD;
      quantitatively control the immune response potential. Until now, no predictive biomarkers of&#xD;
      clinical efficacy of vaccinations or antigen-specific immunotherapies to allergy have been&#xD;
      established. The current proposal is a pilot study to identify candidates of interest, which&#xD;
      predictive value as biomarkers will be assessed in further studies involving larger groups of&#xD;
      patients and appropriate controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that early molecular events of cell stimulation in successful&#xD;
      AIT correlate with a regulatory immune responsive signature of innate (Natural killer (NK)&#xD;
      cells, innate lymphoid cells) and adaptive (T and B cells) immune cells. In this regard,&#xD;
      characteristics of the resting (before AIT) Th2 cells of allergic patients and early changes&#xD;
      occurring in this population within the course of AIT could ultimately predict therapeutic&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to develop a systems biology strategy to quantitatively predict&#xD;
      the response potential of activated Th2 (T-helper type 2) cells from resting Th2 cells of&#xD;
      allergic patients undergoing allergen desensitization treatment. The investigators plan to&#xD;
      analyze the transcriptome of their cells at different timepoints throughout the course of AIT&#xD;
      and to infer networks of gene expression that will allow us to determine key prognostic&#xD;
      factors for AIT responsiveness and immune tolerance induction. In parallel to Th2 cells, the&#xD;
      investigators will study the roles and subpopulations of NK cells, as the role of these&#xD;
      subsets in allergy is still largely unknown. Additionally, as the gut microbiota is known to&#xD;
      be associated and interacting with the immune system, the investigators will seize the&#xD;
      opportunity to collect microbiota samples of patients undergoing AIT to assess changes that&#xD;
      might occur during desensitization. The completion of this study will allow us i) to identify&#xD;
      potential biomarkers that might ultimately be used to predict therapy outcome or to refine&#xD;
      and adapt therapy to a patient's features ii) to monitor the changes occurring in NK cells&#xD;
      from patients exposed to desensitization procedures, iii) to study the gut microbiota of&#xD;
      allergic patients and explore potential microbiota predictive biomarkers (part of the study&#xD;
      performed at IBBL). This study stands as a proof-of-concept study to start a future larger&#xD;
      cohort, since the discovery of new biomarkers/features could open up new avenues to&#xD;
      understand other disorders linked to immune dysregulation and in which tolerance induction is&#xD;
      required, such as autoimmune diseases, transplant rejection and others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who will be enrolled in this study are allergic patients from the Immuno-Allergology&#xD;
      department of the CHL, who will anyway undergo routine antigen-specific immunotherapy for&#xD;
      medical reasons. These immunotherapeutic protocols are already established and used by&#xD;
      experienced specialists at the CHL and will not be modified for the purpose of this research&#xD;
      project. If patients eligible for AIT agree to participate in our research project, the&#xD;
      investigators will collect blood and stool samples during the course of treatment. Depending&#xD;
      on the allergy to be treated, there are two routine desensitization protocols: an ultra-rush&#xD;
      protocol is performed for insect sting desensitization, while a conventional protocol is used&#xD;
      for pollen desensitization. A control group without a clinical history of allergies is&#xD;
      recruited. Blood and stool samples are collected in the same time frames as in allergic&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
