      Determine the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD), and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ACY-241 in combination with ipilimumab and&#xD;
      nivolumab in patients with unresectable Stage III/Stage IV melanoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, open-label, dose-escalation cohort study. The study will consist of a&#xD;
      dose escalation assessment of the safety and tolerability of ACY-241 administered&#xD;
      concurrently in combination with ipilimumab and nivolumab to patients with advanced melanoma.&#xD;
      Treatment will be divided into induction and maintenance phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD), and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ACY-241 in combination with ipilimumab at 1&#xD;
      mg/kg and nivolumab at 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses each during a 12-week induction&#xD;
      period, then administered with nivolumab at a flat dose of 240 mg every 2 weeks in&#xD;
      maintenance for up to 1 year in patients with unresectable Stage III/Stage IV melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that this clinical study will enable selection of the RP2D and dose&#xD;
      schedule of this 3-drug combination for further clinical testing. The trial will include an&#xD;
      assessment of the pharmacodynamic activity of ACY-241.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Patients must have signed and dated an Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics&#xD;
             Committee -approved written informed consent form in accordance with regulatory and&#xD;
             institutional guidelines. This must be obtained before the performance of any&#xD;
             protocol-related procedures that are not part of normal patient care&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment schedule,&#xD;
             laboratory tests, tumor biopsies, and other requirements of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. All patients must be either Stage IIIb/c or Stage IV according to the American Joint&#xD;
             Committee on Cancer (AJCC) (7th edition) and have histologically-confirmed melanoma&#xD;
             that is felt to be surgically unresectable in order to be eligible. Please refer to&#xD;
             the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th edition for a description of tumor, lymph node,&#xD;
             metastasis and staging.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  All melanomas, except ocular/uveal melanoma, regardless of primary site of&#xD;
                  disease will be allowed; mucosal melanomas are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must not have received prior anticancer treatment for metastatic disease&#xD;
                  (for example, but not limited to, systemic, local, radiation,&#xD;
                  radiopharmaceutical).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -Exceptions: Surgery for melanoma and/or postresection brain radiotherapy (RT) if&#xD;
                  central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or prior treatment with adjuvant&#xD;
                  interferon (IFN) (as described in Exclusion Criterion 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  All patients must have their disease status documented by a complete physical&#xD;
                  examination and imaging studies within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study&#xD;
                  drug. Imaging studies must include computerized tomography (CT) scan of neck,&#xD;
                  chest, abdomen, pelvis, and all known sites of resected disease in the setting of&#xD;
                  Stage IIIb/c or Stage IV disease, and brain magnetic resonance imaging ([MRI],&#xD;
                  brain CT allowable if MRI is contraindicated).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The complete set of baseline radiographic images must be available before&#xD;
                  treatment initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Tumor tissue from the resected site of disease must be provided for biomarker analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Prior treated CNS metastases must be without MRI evidence of recurrence for at least 4&#xD;
             weeks after treatment. Patients must be off immunosuppressive doses of systemic&#xD;
             steroids (≥ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) for at least 14 days prior to study&#xD;
             drug administration, and must have returned to neurologic baseline status&#xD;
             postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
             • The 4-week period of stability is measured after the completion of the neurologic&#xD;
             interventions (ie, surgery and/or radiation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. In addition to neurosurgery to treat CNS metastases, adjuvant radiation after the&#xD;
             resection of CNS metastasis is allowed. Immunosuppressive doses of systemic steroids&#xD;
             (doses ≥ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) must be discontinued at least 14 days&#xD;
             before study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Prior surgery that required general anesthesia must be completed at least 4 weeks&#xD;
             before study drug administration. Surgery requiring local/epidural anesthesia must be&#xD;
             completed at least 72 hours before study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. All baseline laboratory requirements will be assessed and should be obtained within 14&#xD;
             days of first dose of study drug. Screening laboratory values must meet the following&#xD;
             criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  White blood cells ≥ 2000/µL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Neutrophils ≥ 1500/µL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets ≥ 100 × 10³/µL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) or creatinine clearance &gt; 40&#xD;
                  mL/minute (using Cockcroft/Gault formula)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patient Re-enrollment: This study permits the re-enrollment of a patient that has&#xD;
             discontinued the study as a screen failure (ie, patient has not been dosed/has not&#xD;
             been treated). If re-enrolled, the patient must be re-consented.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Males and females ≥ 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy&#xD;
             test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin&#xD;
             hormone) within 24 hours prior to the start of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Women must not be breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Women of childbearing potential must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of&#xD;
             contraception for the duration of treatment with study drug(s) plus 5 half-lives of&#xD;
             study drug plus 30 days (duration of ovulatory cycle). The half-lives of nivolumab and&#xD;
             ipilimumab is up to 25 days and 18 days, respectively. Given the blinded nature of&#xD;
             this study, WOCBP should therefore use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for a&#xD;
             total of 23 weeks posttreatment completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for&#xD;
             method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with study drug(s) plus 5&#xD;
             half lives of the study drug(s) plus 90 days (duration of sperm turnover). The&#xD;
             half-lives of nivolumab and ipilimumab are up to 25 days and 18 days, respectively.&#xD;
             Given the blinded nature of this study, men should therefore use an adequate method of&#xD;
             contraception for a total of 31 weeks posttreatment completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Azoospermic males and WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are exempt&#xD;
             from contraceptive requirements. However, they must still undergo pregnancy testing as&#xD;
             described in this section.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Investigators shall counsel WOCBP and male patients who are sexually active with WOCBP on&#xD;
        the importance of pregnancy prevention and the implications of an unexpected pregnancy.&#xD;
        Investigators shall advise WOCBP and male patients who are sexually active with WOCBP on&#xD;
        the use of highly effective methods of contraception. Highly effective methods of&#xD;
        contraception have a failure rate of &lt; 1% when used consistently and correctly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with carcinomatosis meningitis or a history of ocular/uveal melanoma are&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with previous nonmelanoma malignancies are excluded unless a complete&#xD;
             resection or remission was achieved at least 2 years prior to study entry and no&#xD;
             additional therapy is required or anticipated to be required during the study period&#xD;
             (exceptions include, but are not limited to, nonmelanoma skin cancers, in situ bladder&#xD;
             cancer, in situ gastric cancer or gastrointestinal stromal tumor, in situ colon&#xD;
             cancers, in situ cervical cancers/dysplasia, or breast carcinoma in situ).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with active, known, or suspected autoimmune disease. Patients with type I&#xD;
             diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune thyroiditis only&#xD;
             requiring hormone replacement, or skin disorders (such as vitiligo, psoriasis, or&#xD;
             alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment are permitted to enroll. For any cases of&#xD;
             uncertainty, it is recommended that the Principal Investigator be consulted prior to&#xD;
             signing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (≥&#xD;
             10 mg daily prednisone or equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14&#xD;
             days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids are permitted in the&#xD;
             absence of active autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Prior therapy for melanoma with the following exceptions which are allowed: 1) surgery&#xD;
             for the melanoma lesion(s), 2) adjuvant RT after neurosurgical resection for CNS&#xD;
             lesions, and 3) prior adjuvant IFN (see qualifier below). Specifically, patients who&#xD;
             received prior therapy with anti-PD-1, anti PD L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or&#xD;
             anti-CTLA-4 antibody (including ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically&#xD;
             targeting T cell costimulation or checkpoint pathways) are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
             • Prior treatment with adjuvant IFN is allowed if completed ≥ 3 months prior to&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Treatment directed against the melanoma (eg, chemotherapy, targeted agents,&#xD;
             biotherapy, limb perfusion) that is administered after a prior complete resection&#xD;
             other than adjuvant radiation after neurosurgical resection and IFN for resected&#xD;
             melanoma.&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder or active infection that, in the opinion&#xD;
             of the Investigator, may increase the risk associated with study participation, study&#xD;
             drug administration, or would impair the ability of the patient to receive protocol&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Any positive test result for hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus indicating acute&#xD;
