    <textblock>
      This observational study will collect blood and urine and clinical information from&#xD;
      individuals with early-stages of polycystic kidney disease (PKD), their unaffected siblings&#xD;
      and normal volunteers to create a biobank, also called a biorepository. The long-term goal is&#xD;
      to develop new knowledge on biological markers or biomarkers that indicate changes in the&#xD;
      disease progression. An understanding of biomarkers for early renal cyst growth will benefit&#xD;
      PKD patients as new therapies are being developed and tested.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In polycystic kidney disease (PKD), renal cysts form in utero and progressively enlarge due&#xD;
      to aberrant proliferation of the cyst-lining cells and accumulation of fluid within the&#xD;
      expanding cyst cavity. Over decades of unrelenting cyst growth, renal function declines due&#xD;
      to the loss of functional tissue, eventually leading to kidney failure and the need for renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy, such as dialysis or kidney transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective therapies for the treatment of PKD will need to be delivered as early as possible,&#xD;
      before a measurable decline in kidney function, to preserve functional tissue. Currently, it&#xD;
      is difficult to make an accurate prognosis of the progression of early-stage PKD since the&#xD;
      growth of microscopic cysts is difficult to detect by standard imaging modalities and changes&#xD;
      in total kidney volume measured within a reasonable time period are too small to be&#xD;
      informative. Even though early cysts may not cause detectable changes in total kidney volume,&#xD;
      their progressive enlargement damages the surrounding tissue and is a prelude to chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current blood and urine tests provide important information on the decline of kidney&#xD;
      function; however, these tests are not useful for monitoring early events of PKD such as&#xD;
      initial cyst growth and damage to neighboring tissue. Clearly, novel biomarkers of early&#xD;
      cystic disease need to be discovered to develop appropriate clinical tests to monitor the&#xD;
      progression of early stage PKD. These tests will be important to identify patients at risk of&#xD;
      rapid progression and of need of therapeutic intervention and to monitor the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the therapeutic drug. The PKD Biomarkers Repository will allow approved researchers to obtain&#xD;
      blood and urine samples for biomarker discovery and development of appropriate biomarker&#xD;
      assays for prognosis of early PKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study is currently recruiting for three groups: 1) individuals diagnosed&#xD;
      with relatively early PKD as defined by total kidney volume and estimated GFR, 2) unaffected&#xD;
      or undiagnosed family members, preferably siblings, 3) normal volunteers with no family&#xD;
      history of renal disease.&#xD;
