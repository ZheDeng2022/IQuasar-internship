  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We plan to study whether the impact of offering the choice of a pre-colonoscopy physician&#xD;
      visit or direct referral to colonoscopy will increase adherence to colonoscopy relative to&#xD;
      usual care in a large fecal immunochemical test (FIT) mailing campaign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will evaluate two study options, usual care during which patients will be required to have&#xD;
      an office visit with wither a PCP or a Gastroenterologist prior to being scheduled for a&#xD;
      colonoscopy, or a choice where patients will be given the option of a pre-colonoscopy visit&#xD;
      with a gastroenterologist or PCP vs. direct referral for a colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In these two options we will examine colonoscopy adherence, adequacy of triage, patient&#xD;
      satisfaction, colonoscopy outcomes (no show rate, prep quality, and pain during colonoscopy)&#xD;
      and how insurance coverage, gender, race, education or patient understanding of colon cancer&#xD;
      screening message during the navigation process might impact outcomes.&#xD;

      A total of 13,392 patients will be invited to participate in the study. Approximately 2500&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled in the study every month for 4 months. This sampling plan will&#xD;
      enable sufficient statistical power (at least .80) to conduct the analyses of the objectives&#xD;
      using logistic regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of enrollment into the study, an educational brochure and a letter will be sent&#xD;
      to all potential participants advising them that they may not be up to date in colon cancer&#xD;
      screening and that they will be receiving a free FIT test in the mail in a couple weeks. The&#xD;
      letter will advise them that they will be participating in a study that Renown is doing to&#xD;
      improve the ability to diagnose early colon cancer and that they will be contacted by Renown&#xD;
      with their results and also any additional recommendations if the FIT is positive. If they&#xD;
      have questions or do not want to participate, there is a number for potential participants to&#xD;
      call for more information or to opt out. Patients that choose not to participate in the study&#xD;
      who would still like to complete the FIT screening kit, will be informed that they will be&#xD;
      responsible to pay for the FIT test (about $25) following Renown's standard operating&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 weeks after the initial letter, all newly enrolled patients will receive a mailing&#xD;
      including a FIT test, an educational brochure, instructions on how to collect the FIT test&#xD;
      and a Thank You letter for participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial automated telephone message will be left for each patient at the time of the&#xD;
      mailing reminding them to submit their stool FIT. At 2 and 3 weeks after the FIT mailing all&#xD;
      patients medical records will be reviewed and those who have not yet returned their stool FIT&#xD;
      will receive an automated telephone call reminder to mail in their stool FIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 4 weeks all patients who have not yet returned their stool FIT will be contacted by phone&#xD;
      and those that are able to be reached and agree to submit the stool FIT will be mailed a 2nd&#xD;
      stool FIT if needed. If the stool FIT is not submitted by 2 months of the mailing, the&#xD;
      patient will be listed as not returning a FIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who have returned a stool FIT with a negative result will be provided their&#xD;
      results by letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients PCP will be also provided the positive or negative results by letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with a positive stool FIT will be randomized into either Usual Care or Choice&#xD;
      study groups. The two study groups will be matched by gender, race/ethnicity,&#xD;
      Spanish-speakers, and rural/urban location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in Group 1 (Usual Care) who have a positive result will be contacted by phone by the&#xD;
      Nurse Navigator with their results, receive some education about the significance of a +&#xD;
      stool FIT relative to colon cancer screening and advised to make an appointment with a PCP or&#xD;
      Gastroenterologist to discuss the results and possibly be referred for colonoscopy. If they&#xD;
      do not have a PCP they will receive assistance in being referred to one. They will be asked&#xD;
      to complete a telephone questionnaire that explores patient demographics (education, race,&#xD;
      income, prior colonoscopy etc) in Spanish or English. Patients' EPIC electronic medical&#xD;
      records will be monitored to see if they have made an appointment within 2 days of getting&#xD;
      their results. If not, they will receive 2 attempted live telephone reminders followed by a&#xD;
      certified letter. If a patient is referred to a GI consult, and fails to schedule an&#xD;
      appointment within 1 month, GI will notify the patients Renown PCP of the failed appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in Group 1 with a positive result who cannot be reached by phone will receive a&#xD;
      certified letter with their results with instructions to contact the Study Navigator to&#xD;
      arrange further testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in Group 2 (Choice) who have a positive FIT result will be contacted by phone by the&#xD;
      Nurse Navigator with their results, receive some education about the significance of a +&#xD;
      stool FIT relative to colon cancer screening and given the choice to either schedule an&#xD;
      appointment with a PCP or Gastroenterologist to discuss their results, or will receive direct&#xD;
      referral to Gastroenterology Consultants for a colonoscopy. They will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      telephone questionnaire that explores patient demographics (education, race, income, prior&#xD;
      colonoscopy) in Spanish or English. Patients will then receive assistance and monitoring as&#xD;
      in that described above for Group 1 depending upon whether they are referred for an office&#xD;
      visit/consultation vs. a direct referral for a colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in Group 2 with a positive result who cannot be reached by phone will receive a&#xD;
      certified letter with their results with instructions to contact the Study Navigator to&#xD;
      arrange further testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are referred directly for a colonoscopy will be contacted by phone by a&#xD;
      scheduler at Gastroenterology Consultants and be asked questions to determine the best bowel&#xD;
      preparation and sedation for them (conscious sedation with fentanyl and versed vs. propofol,&#xD;
      and to insure that the patient has no significant co-morbidities that might require a&#xD;
      pre-colonoscopy visit for medical assessment (anticoagulants, severe lung disease, recent MI,&#xD;
      bleeding disorder).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, those that are referred for a direct colonoscopy and fail to schedule or show&#xD;
      for their appointment will be referred back to the Renown Nurse Navigator for 2 attempts at a&#xD;
      live call then a certified letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients in group 2 who have not yet had a colonoscopy 6 months after they were initially&#xD;
      given their results will again be contacted by phone by a Navigator and again encouraged to&#xD;
      have colonoscopy or at minimum to discuss the procedure/FIT results with either their&#xD;
      physician or a Gastroenterologist and be offered assistance to schedule those appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both groups will have 1 year from the date their initial FIT test is mailed to&#xD;
      obtain a colonoscopy as recorded in the EPIC EMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with a positive stool FIT who have completed the study either by having a&#xD;
      colonoscopy or by not having a colonoscopy at the end of the study period will be mailed a&#xD;
      questionnaire assessing various quality parameters of the colon cancer screening experience&#xD;
      with a stamped self addressed envelope for return and Thank You letter for their&#xD;
      participation including a $10 Amazon gift certificate as a token of appreciation for their&#xD;
      time. If the questionnaire is not returned within 2 weeks, they will be sent a 2nd&#xD;
      questionnaire and reminder letter. After 2 more weeks, if the questionnaire is not returned&#xD;
      the research assistant will contact the patient to offer the choice to complete the survey&#xD;
      over the telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accommodate Spanish speaking only patients, all documents mailed to patients will be&#xD;
      written both in English and Spanish versions and Spanish translators will be available to&#xD;
      speak with patients by phone to respond to questions or to go over the questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Items A script will be used for any participants who call with questions (see &quot;Script&#xD;
      if participant calls&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To protect participant's identity, only de-identified data will be reviewed by the UNR&#xD;
      co-investigator (Paul Devereux). The de-identified data will be stored on a&#xD;
      password-protected computer in Paul Devereux's locked office. The data will be transferred to&#xD;
      Paul Devereux using a password-protected USB flash drive. Data will not contain, names,&#xD;
      addresses, dates of birth, or Renown ID numbers.&#xD;
