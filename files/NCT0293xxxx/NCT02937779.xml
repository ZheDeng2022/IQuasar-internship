    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization recommends that all high endemic countries for HBV infection&#xD;
      based their mother to child transmission prevention strategies on vaccination of all children&#xD;
      and administration of immunoglobulins (HBIG) to infants born to infected mothers in the first&#xD;
      24 hours after birth. Lack of access to antenatal screening and to HBIG significantly results&#xD;
      in failure of this strategy in many countries. Moreover, despite sero-vaccination, 10 to 15%&#xD;
      of infants of mothers that are positive for HBsAg and HBeAg are still infected, as high&#xD;
      levels of HBV replication occurring in the third quarter of pregnancy act as a major risk&#xD;
      factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of an operational strategy to&#xD;
      prevent HBV mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) in Cambodia based on the use of rapid tests&#xD;
      HBs Ag and HBe Ag to screen HBV infection and a treatment by TDF for patients with a positive&#xD;
      HBeAg test with a &quot;test and treat&quot; strategy for those seen for Antenatal Care (ANC) from 24&#xD;
      weeks of amenorrhea. In all cases, vaccination of the newborn will be carried out according&#xD;
      to the national protocol in Cambodia i.e. 4 injections at 24 hours, 6, 10 and 14 weeks of&#xD;
      age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phase IV multicenter observational and interventional non randomized prospective study will&#xD;
      be conducted in 4 maternity in Cambodia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the proportion of active HBV infection in new-born at 6 months of&#xD;
      life estimated by HBs Ag positivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will aim to document the acceptability and the operational implementation of the&#xD;
      study using rapid tests usable in all health centers and a drug available in all the country&#xD;
      thanks to HIV national program. The results will be helpful for Cambodian government in order&#xD;
      to implement guidelines and algorithm follow-up for HBV-infected pregnant women.&#xD;

      Principal objective: Assess the effectiveness of a strategy to prevent HBV mother-to-child&#xD;
      transmission (MTCT) in Cambodia based on the use of rapid tests HBs Ag and HBe Ag to screen&#xD;
      HBV infection and a treatment by TDF for patients with a positive HBeAg test with a &quot;test and&#xD;
      treat&quot; strategy for those seen for Antenatal Care (ANC) from 24 weeks of amenorrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives Assess the feasibility and acceptability for patients and health care&#xD;
      providers of the rapid tests screening strategy Assess the acceptability of the test and&#xD;
      treat strategy for patients seen after 24 weeks of amenorrhea Describe the HBV viral load&#xD;
      (VL) decrease caused by the TDF Estimate the rate of HBV transmission to newborns according&#xD;
      to the time spent on TDF as well as initial viral load level and delivery viral load level&#xD;
      Estimate the rate of HBV transmission to newborns for HBe Ag negative women Describe the&#xD;
      correlation between HBV viral load level and HBe Ag status Describe subgroups of mothers and&#xD;
      new-borns for which the strategy seems more effective Assess TDF safety in mothers Analyse&#xD;
      the cost-effectiveness of the strategy compare to international guidelines (WHO, APASL)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each woman will be informed of the objectives and the total duration of the study as well as&#xD;
      the benefits and risks to participate. An information sheet in Khmer will be given to each&#xD;
      woman. The study will be composed of two phases of information's and consent. The first one&#xD;
      will be done during the HBs Ag screening using rapid test; the screening will be proposed to&#xD;
      all pregnant women attending ANC in one of the affiliated centres. The second phase will be&#xD;
      done during the inclusion visit and will concern only HBs Ag positive women. The study will&#xD;
      concern only HBs Ag positive women with 1) follow up of all HBsAg positive women from&#xD;
      inclusion up to 6 months postpartum 2) For HBeAg positive women, initiation of treatment by&#xD;
      fumarate de tenofovir disoproxil (VireadÂ®), with a daily administration of one 300mg pill.&#xD;
      Women will be treated from 24 weeks of amenorrhea until 6 weeks post-partum. For women with&#xD;
      first ANC after 24 weeks of amenorrhea, treatment will begin the day of inclusion. Treatment&#xD;
      will be given for 4 weeks and adherence will be estimated. In all cases, vaccination of the&#xD;
      newborn will be carried out according to the national protocol in Cambodia i.e. 4 injections&#xD;
      at 24 hours, 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 933 positive HBs Ag pregnant women will be enrolled including 280 HBe Ag positive&#xD;
      women and 653 HBe negative women.&#xD;
