  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to establish the relative bioavailability of budesonide and&#xD;
      formoterol delivered via Symbicort pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) with and without a&#xD;
      spacer device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration under each condition will occur with the concomitant administration of&#xD;
      activated charcoal to estimate exposure through the lung and without activated charcoal to&#xD;
      estimate total systemic exposure.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a randomised, open-label, single-dose, crossover study in healthy subjects&#xD;
      (males and females), performed at a single study centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comprise:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A screening period of maximum 28 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Four treatment periods during which subjects will be resident from the afternoon before&#xD;
           dosing with Symbicort until at least 24 hours after dosing; discharged on the morning of&#xD;
           Day 2; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A final visit within 5 to 7 days after the last administration of Symbicort. There will&#xD;
           be a minimum washout period of 3 days between each dose administration of Symbicort.&#xD;
           Subjects will receive single doses of Symbicort on 4 occasions under fasted conditions.&#xD;
           During screening, spirometry testing will be performed by a technologist or a qualified&#xD;
           designee to ensure subjects perform adequate manoeuvres to achieve optimal lung&#xD;
           function. Device and inhalation training will be conducted on admission to each&#xD;
           treatment period, and prior to dosing on Day 1 of each treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 7 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For total systemic exposure: Treatment B versus Treatment A&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For lung exposure: Treatment D versus Treatment C Treatment ratio will be assessed on&#xD;
           the ratio of log-transformed Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC of budesonide and formoterol using a&#xD;
           2-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) approach based on a repeated measures analysis of&#xD;
           variance (ANOVA) model including period and treatment as fixed effects, and subject as a&#xD;
           random effect. The estimated treatment differences and the 90% CIs on the log scale will&#xD;
           be back-transformed to obtain the Gmean ratios for each pair of treatments. The least&#xD;
           squares means (and 95% CIs), Gmean ratios and 90% CIs will be tabulated for each&#xD;
           comparison and analyte (budesonide and formoterol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size is 56 to ensure adequate number of subjects are randomised and at least 44&#xD;
      evaluable subjects complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming an intra-subject coefficient of variation (CV) of 33% (based on the variability of&#xD;
      AUC0-12 for budesonide and AUC0-12 and Cmax for formoterol observed in a similarly designed&#xD;
      crossover study in healthy adults), 44 evaluable subjects will give at least 80% power to&#xD;
      show that the 90% CI for the treatment effects lies entirely within the range 0.8 to 1.25,&#xD;
      i.e., would rule out a 20% change (on a log scale) in exposure to budesonide and formoterol.&#xD;
