      Patellar tendinopathy is a frequent overuse injury that causes pain and impaired performance&#xD;
      in jumping athletes. Exercise therapy is considered the best initial treatment option for&#xD;
      tendinopathies as clinical improvements in pain and function have been demonstrated. Although&#xD;
      painful eccentric exercise protocols have been promoted as standard care based on positive&#xD;
      results in early studies, a recent systematic review demonstrated that these are not&#xD;
      associated with improved tendon structure and are ineffective when applied in-season.&#xD;
      Progressive tendon-loading exercise therapy for patellar tendinopathy constitutes a novel&#xD;
      concept in sports medicine. A recent study advocates a progressive 4-stage criteria-based&#xD;
      exercise protocol as it results in a less reactive tendon and ability to restore collagen&#xD;
      alignment. This protocol consists of progressive isometric, isotonic, plyometric, and&#xD;
      sport-specific exercises. Isometric exercises have been shown to reduce pain and decrease&#xD;
      motor cortex inhibition of the quadriceps. This approach would enable jumping athletes to&#xD;
      resume sports within the limits of pain, with improved muscle function, and sufficient tendon&#xD;
      structure re-organization. The diagnostic imaging work-up of patellar tendinopathy typically&#xD;
      consists of ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or a combination of both.&#xD;
      Ultrashort echo time (UTE) MRI is an advanced MRI technique, which enables assessment of&#xD;
      tissues with short T2-time, such as tendon, the structure of which is invisible on regular&#xD;
      MRI. UTE has been shown to quantitatively depict changes in tendon microstructure and&#xD;
      therefore allows in-vivo evaluation of tendon regeneration. It is currently unknown whether&#xD;
      quantitative UTE MRI parameters change after exercise treatment, are related to clinical&#xD;
      symptoms of patellar tendinopathy, have prognostic value for exercise treatment response, and&#xD;
      offer additional value over ultrasound&#xD;

      Patellar tendinopathy ('jumper's knee') is a clinical condition of gradually progressive&#xD;
      activity-related pain at the insertion of the patellar tendon at the apex patellae. Prolonged&#xD;
      repetitive stress of the knee-extensor apparatus can lead to this common overuse tendinopathy&#xD;
      in athletes from different sports, resulting in pain and impaired performance in athletes.&#xD;
      High prevalence rates have been reported in jumping sports such as volleyball and basketball&#xD;
      (45% and 32% in elite athletes, respectively). Symptoms can be long-standing if not treated&#xD;
      appropriately in the initial stages. Furthermore, there is currently no strong evidence for&#xD;
      second-line treatments such as shockwave therapy and platelet-rich plasma. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      important to improve exercise protocols as a first treatment of choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tendinopathy is a widely accepted, generic term that encompasses any abnormal condition of a&#xD;
      tendon. Clinical symptoms include activity-related pain associated with tenderness, localized&#xD;
      swelling and impaired performance. Histopathologically, tendinopathy is characterized by&#xD;
      structural disorganization of the tendon collagen that alters the loading capacity of a&#xD;
      specific tendon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise therapy is considered as the best initial treatment option for tendinopathies as&#xD;
      histopathological changes and clinical improvements on pain and function have been&#xD;
      demonstrated. Most studies have been conducted using eccentric exercise protocols and early&#xD;
      studies showed positive effects, resulting in promoting these isolated painful exercises as&#xD;
      standard care. One hypothesis behind the potential beneficial effects of eccentric exercises&#xD;
      is that increased load results in increased collagen synthesis and subsequent healing&#xD;
      response. However, a recent systematic review demonstrated that the available literature does&#xD;
      not support observable structural change as an explanation for the response of eccentric&#xD;
      exercises. Furthermore, eccentric exercises may not be effective for reducing pain and&#xD;
      improving strength when used in-season and might even increase symptoms in jumping athletes&#xD;
      with patellar tendon pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progressive tendon-loading exercise therapy for patellar tendinopathy constitutes a novel&#xD;
      concept in sports medicine. A recent publication advocates a progressive 4-stage&#xD;
      criteria-based exercise protocol within the limits of pain, consisting of progressive&#xD;
      isometric, isotonic, plyometric, and sport-specific exercises, resulting in a less reactive&#xD;
      tendon, immediate decreased pain levels, diminished motor cortex inhibition of the quadriceps&#xD;
      muscles, and potential to restore collagen alignment. These new insights are completely&#xD;
      conflicting with the painful heavy-load eccentric exercise protocols currently applied as&#xD;
      usual care. It is currently unknown which exercise therapy is the best strategy for athletes&#xD;
      with patellar tendinopathy, as adequately powered randomized studies are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although clinical examination represents the gold standard in the diagnosis of patellar&#xD;
      tendinopathy, it is commonplace to perform diagnostic imaging of the patellar tendon to&#xD;
      confirm the diagnosis and rule out alternative diagnoses. Furthermore, imaging can be used to&#xD;
      estimate response to treatment. This diagnostic imaging work-up usually consists of magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound or, occasionally, a combination of both. On &quot;regular&quot;&#xD;
      MRI, increased tendon size and visually increased signal intensity within the proximal&#xD;
      patellar tendon can be observed in patellar tendinopathy , but altered tendon microstructure&#xD;
      is invisible. A novel innovative method to detect tendon abnormalities is the ultrashort echo&#xD;
      time (UTE) MRI technique. UTE enables accurate detection of changes in a reactive tendon both&#xD;
      visually and in a quantitative manner by measuring T2* relaxation time UTE MRI has also been&#xD;
      shown to quantitatively depict changes in tendon microstructure and, therefore, this&#xD;
      innovative imaging modality allows in-vivo evaluation of tendon regeneration. It is currently&#xD;
      unknown whether quantitative UTE MRI parameters change after exercise treatment, are related&#xD;
      to clinical symptoms of patellar tendinopathy, and have prognostic value for exercise&#xD;
      treatment response.&#xD;
