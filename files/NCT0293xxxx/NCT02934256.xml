    <textblock>
      Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a hereditary tumor predisposition syndrome caused by&#xD;
      mutations in the NF2 tumor suppressor gene. Individuals with NF2 have a higher likelihood to&#xD;
      develop multiple nervous system tumors, including schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas.&#xD;
      The hallmark of NF2 is bilateral vestibular schwannomas. Historically, most NF2 patients&#xD;
      experience complete hearing loss either from tumor progression or after treatment of the&#xD;
      tumors with surgery or radiation. Effective treatments are urgently needed for NF2 patients&#xD;
      with progressive hearing loss because hearing loss is associated with impairment in social,&#xD;
      emotional,and communication function and with increased depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies of NF2 patients treated with Erlotinib suggested that inhibition of&#xD;
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) could result in hearing improvement and reduction in&#xD;
      tumor size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much evidence implicates human epidermal growth factor (HER) receptors in vestibular&#xD;
      schwannoma growth.Some studies have demonstrated that Merlin, the NF2 gene protein product,&#xD;
      controls surface availability of the EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3 receptors in human and Drosophila&#xD;
      models. Besides, cell culture models of mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) support the role of&#xD;
      EGFR in NF2-associated tumorigenesis. Nf2-deficient cells in culture lack contact-dependent&#xD;
      inhibition of growth and continue to grow in confluent cultures. This effect appears to be&#xD;
      mediated by EGFR signaling. Treatment of Nf2-deficient cells with EGFR inhibitors such as&#xD;
      gefitinib can restore contact-dependent inhibition, suggesting that this class of drugs might&#xD;
      be useful for NF2 patients with progressive vestibular schwannomas. In this way, Icotinib can&#xD;
      inhibit the nutrition of the tumor and decrease the tumor's growth and metastasis. Based on&#xD;
      these studies, we perform this clinical trial to known the treatment effect and tolerability&#xD;
      of Icotinib on NF2.&#xD;
