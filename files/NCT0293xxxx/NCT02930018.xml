      The ESCAPE-NA-1 study is designed to determine the safety and efficacy of the&#xD;
      neuroprotectant, Nerinetide (NA-1), in reducing global disability in subjects with major&#xD;
      acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with a small established infarct core and with good collateral&#xD;
      circulation who are selected for endovascular revascularization.&#xD;

      Trial Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of the neuroprotectant, Nerinetide, in&#xD;
      reducing global disability in subjects with major acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with a small&#xD;
      established infarct core and with good collateral circulation selected for rapid endovascular&#xD;
      revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to determine the efficacy of Nerinetide in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reducing functional dependence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improving neurological outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improving activities of daily living&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reducing mortality rate The leading safety objectives are to determine the effect of&#xD;
           administering a dose of 2.6 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 270 mg) intravenous (IV)&#xD;
           infusion of Nerinetide to subject with acute stroke who are selected for endovascular&#xD;
           revascularization on serious adverse events (SAEs) and 90-day mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a Phase 3, randomized, multicentre, blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel&#xD;
      group, single-dose design. Subjects harboring an acute ischemic stroke and who are selected&#xD;
      for endovascular revascularization in accordance with local institutional practices and who&#xD;
      harbor a small established infarct core and with good collateral circulation will be given a&#xD;
      single, 2.6 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 270 mg) intravenous dose of Nerinetide (NA-1) or&#xD;
      placebo as soon as they are deemed to have met the enrollment criteria and with the intention&#xD;
      of starting administration within 30 minutes of randomization. The randomization will be by&#xD;
      stochastic minimization to balance baseline factors.&#xD;

    <description>Overall number of subjects experiencing a favorable functional outcome 90 days post-randomization, defined as 0 to 2 on the mRS.&#xD;
The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a valid and reliable clinician-reported measure of global disability that has been widely applied for evaluating recovery from stroke. It is a scale used to measure functional recovery (the degree of disability or dependence in daily activities) of people who have suffered a stroke. mRS scores range from 0 (best outcome) to 6 (worst outcome), with 0 indicating no residual symptoms; 5 indicating bedbound, requiring constant care; and 6 indicating death.</description>

The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a standardized neurological examination score that is a valid and reliable measure of disability and recovery after acute stroke. Scores range from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating increasing severity.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Patients with acute ischaemic stroke who were selected to undergo EVT (endovascular thrombectomy) were enrolled. The trial was done at acute care hospitals. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive a single intravenous dose of nerinetide (NA-1) or placebo. All patients underwent endovascular thrombectomy and received alteplase in usual care when indicated.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The trial drug was administered as soon as possible after randomisation.</pre_assignment_details>

The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a valid and reliable clinician-reported measure of global disability that has been widely applied for evaluating recovery from stroke. It is a scale used to measure functional recovery (the degree of disability or dependence in daily activities) of people who have suffered a stroke. mRS scores range from 0 (best outcome) to 6 (worst outcome), with 0 indicating no residual symptoms; 5 indicating bedbound, requiring constant care; and 6 indicating death.</description>

The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a valid and reliable clinician-reported measure of global disability that has been widely applied for evaluating recovery from stroke. It is a scale used to measure functional recovery (the degree of disability or dependence in daily activities) of people who have suffered a stroke. mRS scores range from 0 (best outcome) to 6 (worst outcome), with 0 indicating no residual symptoms; 5 indicating bedbound, requiring constant care; and 6 indicating death.</description>

The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a valid and reliable clinician-reported measure of global disability that has been widely applied for evaluating recovery from stroke. It is a scale used to measure functional recovery (the degree of disability or dependence in daily activities) of people who have suffered a stroke. mRS scores range from 0 (best outcome) to 6 (worst outcome), with 0 indicating no residual symptoms; 5 indicating bedbound, requiring constant care; and 6 indicating death.</description>
