    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of a remote patient monitoring&#xD;
      platform and alert system in reducing adverse events for hospitalized geriatric orthopedic&#xD;
      trauma patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Geriatric orthopedic trauma patients are a particularly vulnerable cohort due to their age&#xD;
      and medical complexity. These patients are often admitted to a floor unit with high&#xD;
      physician-to-patient and nurse-to-patient ratios, especially during hours of low staffing&#xD;
      intensity (eg, nighttime and weekend hours). As a result, during hours of low staffing&#xD;
      intensity the potential for acute deterioration with delayed reaction from the care team is&#xD;
      significant. The investigators aim to test the efficacy of a remote patient monitoring&#xD;
      platform to reduce adverse events in this population during hours of low staffing intensity.&#xD;
      The platform is a software called AlertWatch. It takes laboratory and vital sign data that&#xD;
      has been reported in the medical record and determines whether it meets a cut-off value that&#xD;
      is concerning for patient deterioration. If the value meets that cut-off, it sends a page to&#xD;
      a recipient clinician. The investigators will have a physician trained in intensive care&#xD;
      receive these alerts and respond to them by evaluating the patient and, in a consultative&#xD;
      capacity, assist the primary team, namely the orthopedic surgery service, in taking care of&#xD;
      the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to intervention and control arms at the outset of their&#xD;
      hospitalization. Patients in the intervention arm will receive standard of care monitoring&#xD;
      and the primary team responsible for the care of the patient will remain the orthopedic&#xD;
      surgery service, however, in addition, the AlertWatch software will be implemented and the&#xD;
      intensive care physician will be involved in the patient's care when there is an alert.&#xD;
      Patients in the control arm will receive standard of care monitoring and the orthopedic&#xD;
      surgery service will be the primary team responsible. The Investigators will measure whether&#xD;
      the intervention reduces adverse events in the study population compared with control&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be enrolled consecutively at the time of admission to the hospital. The&#xD;
      AlertWatch platform (510(k) FDA clearance K15335) has the ability to automatically detect&#xD;
      whether a patient admitted to a bed on the orthopedic surgery service meets inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. The platform will automatically randomize patients into the active arm or the&#xD;
      control arm of the study. For patients randomized to the active arm, the platform will&#xD;
      provide alert monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will also be enrolling intensive care physicians to participate in this&#xD;
      study. Physician participation is optional. In advance of the start of the study, they will&#xD;
      be provided information regarding the study and an informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AlertWatch platform has the ability to send an alert when it detects abnormalities,&#xD;
      particular trends, or combinations of abnormalities or trends. In this study, the&#xD;
      Investigators will use specific threshold values to alert for abnormalities and concerning&#xD;
      trends in patient data. When an alert is made, it will be sent to the in-house intensive care&#xD;
      physician's regular pager. The page will display the data. Orthopedic interns will continue&#xD;
      to monitor for patient data in the standard fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will institute a protocol in which an intensive care physician is receiving&#xD;
      alerts from AlertWatch during nighttime and weekend hours. The intensivist will: 1.) view the&#xD;
      alert, 2.) determine whether any subsequent action is warranted. Subsequent actions may&#xD;
      include: 1.) reviewing the patient's chart 2.) visiting the patient and/or his/her nurse 3.)&#xD;
      paging the orthopedic surgery team to discuss the patient's situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an extremely low risk that a patient's safety would be at all threatened in either&#xD;
      arm of the study. Patients who are assigned to the intervention arm and the control arm will&#xD;
      both receive the standard of care. Intervention arm patients will additionally have the&#xD;
      AlertWatch software relaying alerts to designated providers. The software does not create&#xD;
      new, previously non-existent data. It relays data that is already available and viewable by&#xD;
      all providers in the medical record for the patient. Given the nature of the intervention in&#xD;
      this study, the likelihood of any adverse events due to the intervention is extremely low.&#xD;
