  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter phase III trial of ramucirumab plus paclitaxel,&#xD;
      given as switch maintenance, versus continuation of first-line chemotherapy, given as per&#xD;
      standard clinical practice, in subjects with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      HER-2 negative gastric or GEJ cancer, without disease progression following 3 months of&#xD;
      first-line doublet chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The acceptable first-line or lead-in chemotherapy will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FOLFOX4:Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2. l-Leucovorin 100 mg/m2 5-fluorouracil 400/600 mg/m2. Cycle&#xD;
           length is 2 weeks +/- 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ModifiedFOLFOX6: Oxaliplatin a 85 mg/m2. l-Leucovorin 200 mg/m2. 5-fluorouracil 400&#xD;
           mg/m2 and 2400 mg/m2 46-hours continous infusion. Cycle length is 2 weeks +/- 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  XELOX:Oxaliplatin130 mg/m2.Capecitabine will be 2000 mg/m2 for 14 days. Cycle length is&#xD;
           3 weeks +/- 3 days.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment must be continued for up to 4 three-weekly cycles or 6 bi-weekly cycles, or for up&#xD;
      to a maximum of 12 weeks. Subjects with CR/PR/SD after oxaliplatinum compound and&#xD;
      fluoropyrimidine-based regimens, or without evidence of progressive disease in case of&#xD;
      non-measurable disease, will be randomized in 1:1 ratio between the two treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to randomization, subjects will be stratified based on Center; Prior gastrectomy: No&#xD;
      vs. Yes; Peritoneal carcinomatosis: Yes vs. No; Site of origin: GEJ vs. gastric.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks in the opinion of the Investigator;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Unresectable locally advanced or metastatic, histopathologically confirmed, HER-2&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Must have received lead-in chemotherapy in the first-line setting using one of the&#xD;
             fluoropyrimidines- and oxaliplatin-based doublet combinations as specified in Section&#xD;
             7 and continued for three months (i.e. 6 administrations for bi-weekly cycles regimens&#xD;
             or 4 administrations for three-weekly cycles regimens). Patients who had received&#xD;
             adjuvant cisplatin/oxaliplatin plus fluoropyrimidine-based doublet chemotherapy and&#xD;
             had recurrence beyond 12 months from its completion are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Must have radiological evidence of clinical benefit following the last dose of the&#xD;
             lead-in chemotherapy (either CR, PR or SD by RECIST v1.1 criteria in case of&#xD;
             measurable disease, or absence of progressive disease in case of non-measurable&#xD;
             disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Laboratory requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The patient has adequate hematologic function, as evidenced by an absolute&#xD;
                  neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1000/µL, hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL (5.58 mmol/L), and platelets&#xD;
                  ≥100,000/µL.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The patient has adequate hepatic function as defined by a total bilirubin ≤1.5&#xD;
                  mg/dL (25.65 μmol/L), and aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase&#xD;
                  (ALT) ≤ 3.0 times the upper limit of normal (ULN; or 5.0 times the ULN in the&#xD;
                  setting of liver metastases).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The patient has adequate renal function as defined by a serum creatinine ≤1.5&#xD;
                  times the ULN, or creatinine clearance (measured via 24-hour urine collection)&#xD;
                  ≥40 mL/minute (that is, if serum creatinine is &gt;1.5 times the ULN, a 24-hour&#xD;
                  urine collection to calculate creatinine clearance must be performed). The&#xD;
                  patient's urinary protein is ≤1+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis (UA; if urine&#xD;
                  dipstick or routine analysis is ≥2+, a 24-hour urine collection for protein must&#xD;
                  demonstrate &lt;1000 mg of protein in 24 hours to allow participation in this&#xD;
                  protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Coagulation: The patient must have adequate coagulation function as defined by&#xD;
                  International Normalized Ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5, and a partial thromboplastin time&#xD;
                  (PTT) ≤ 5 seconds above the ULN (unless receiving anticoagulation therapy).&#xD;
                  Patients receiving warfarin must be switched to low molecular weight heparin and&#xD;
                  have achieved stable coagulation profile prior to randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow up. Patients registered on this&#xD;
             trial must be treated and followed at the participating center.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Archival tumor tissue is required for exploratory research at enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Because the teratogenicity of ramucirumab is not known, the patient, if sexually&#xD;
             active, must be postmenopausal, surgically sterile, or using effective contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier methods) for the entire duration of the study including a minimum&#xD;
             of 12 weeks after dosing has been completed. Female patients of childbearing potential&#xD;
             must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to enrolment. Women must&#xD;
             not be breastfeeding.&#xD;
