      Microscopy remains a key indicator in drug efficacy testing performed in the context of&#xD;
      clinical trials for monitoring existing antimalarials or in the context of regulatory&#xD;
      clinical trials for registration of new drugs. It is one of the main diagnostic methods for&#xD;
      malaria diagnosis in general, as in an ideal setting it can provide low-cost accurate&#xD;
      diagnosis, determine the density of parasites in the blood, and accurately differentiate&#xD;
      between different malaria parasite species, characteristics vital to the implementation of&#xD;
      global plans for drug efficacy monitoring. Malaria rapid tests (RDTs), while useful for case&#xD;
      management, do not provide information on the parasite density nor the species&#xD;
      differentiation necessary for research and drug efficacy assessment. Microscopy therefore&#xD;
      retains key advantages over a number of newer technologies, but its reliability is severely&#xD;
      impeded by dependence on high technical competence of the human operators as well as&#xD;
      availability of high quality equipment and reagents. Recent studies have demonstrated the&#xD;
      frequent poor specificity and sensitivity associated with manual microscopy diagnostics in&#xD;
      operational conditions , , . Advances in digital microscopy performance and affordability&#xD;
      have now opened the door to potentially significant improvements in the performance of&#xD;
      malaria diagnostic microscopy, overcoming serious deficiencies in current drug efficacy&#xD;
      assessment, and more broadly in malaria diagnosis and management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intellectual Ventures Laboratory (IVL), in collaboration with Global Good Fund (GG), has&#xD;
      developed an initial microscope prototype to support its research into dark field imaging of&#xD;
      unstained malaria slides. The system consists of low cost electromechanical components for&#xD;
      scanning a standard slide, an optical train with a high numerical aperture objective, and an&#xD;
      image capture system. Captured images are analyzed with custom image analysis software&#xD;
      developed at GG/IVL, using algorithms that are designed for automatic malaria diagnosis,&#xD;
      without user input. Additionally, image processing algorithms have been built around&#xD;
      detection of Giemsa-stained malaria slides which is the current standard for malaria&#xD;
      microscopy. Initial results show excellent potential for sensitivity and specificity which&#xD;
      exceeds that of typical manual microscopists in the field. Based on the positive market and&#xD;
      needs assessment in January, 2013, given by stakeholders in the malaria diagnostics&#xD;
      community, GG/IVL are pursuing improvement and integration of this algorithm into a portable&#xD;
      microscope platform with characteristics similar to the prototype microscope already&#xD;
      developed at GG/IVL for dark field imaging. The prototype Autoscope was first tested in field&#xD;
      settings in Thailand in Nov 2014 - Jan 2015 at clinics operated by the Shoklo Malaria&#xD;
      Research Unit (SMRU). The goal of the first field evaluation was to assess the Autoscope in&#xD;
      with respect to its diagnostic performance and also its suitability for harsh conditions&#xD;
      typically encountered in field clinics. Further, user feedback on the design and&#xD;
      functionality was sought. The Autoscope and the accompanying image analysis algorithms have&#xD;
      since been further developed and a new version is now available for testing.&#xD;

      Study Design &amp; Procedure The primary purpose of this evaluation is to quantify the diagnostic&#xD;
      performance of the Autoscope version 2 prototype in a field setting. The performance of the&#xD;
      Autoscope version 2 prototype will be assessed by scanning of negative and positive slides&#xD;
      with the Autoscope version 2 and comparing the results with expert microscopy. Plasmodium&#xD;
      genus- and species-specific PCR will also be performed as an additional confirmatory test for&#xD;
      the detection of malaria parasites and their species if present. Testing by microscopy and&#xD;
      Autoscope will be performed in field clinic settings on Giemsa-stained stained slides&#xD;
      prepared from febrile patient blood collected from a finger-prick. Patient recruitment will&#xD;
      aim to recruit up to 80 slide-confirmed malaria cases (P. falciparum, P. vivax or other&#xD;
      species) per country (i.e., total 160 cases) have been included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient procedures Patients who present at the clinic will be screened to assess eligibility.&#xD;
      A consent form in the local languages (Karen or Burmese at SMRU sites, Bahasa in South&#xD;
      Sumatera at EOCRU site) will be administered to patients with a description of the intentions&#xD;
      of this study in order to protect human subjects before any study specific procedures are&#xD;
      conducted. It will be clearly stated that participation is voluntary and that the subject or&#xD;
      guardian is free to discontinue participation or withdraw consent to participate at any time&#xD;
      for any reason without prejudice to future care, and with no obligation to give the reason&#xD;
      for discontinuation nor for withdrawal. The subject or guardian will be allowed as much time&#xD;
      as needed to consider the information and the opportunity to question the authorized research&#xD;
      member, or other independent parties to decide whether they will (or allow his/her charge to)&#xD;
      participate in the study. Written informed consent will then be obtained by means of subject&#xD;
      or guardian dated signature or thumb print (if unable to write), with signed and dated&#xD;
      signature of a witness and dated signature of the person who presented and obtained the&#xD;
      informed consent. All individual written informed consent forms will be stored securely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children capable of understanding the study (approximately 7 years of age or above for SMRU&#xD;
      sites and 12 years of age or above for EOCRU sites) will be asked to sign an assent form. A&#xD;
      copy of the signed informed consent document(s) will be given to the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once informed consent has been obtained, the subject number will be assigned and recorded on&#xD;
      the screening and enrollment log. A few drops of blood (maximum of 150-200 µL) will be&#xD;
      obtained from a finger-prick and study-specific laboratory procedures as described below will&#xD;
      be performed. The patient will then receive clinical care as appropriate according to the&#xD;
      routine procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory procedures All laboratory procedures will be performed according to the applicable&#xD;
      standard operating procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the clinics (Wang Pha, Mawker Tai, Thailand and Hanura, South Sumatera, Indonesia)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood collection from finger-prick (maximum 150-200 µL), which will be used to prepare&#xD;
           slides.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform malaria RDT (part of routine practice for malaria detection), prepare 2 slides&#xD;
           each with thick and thin blood films, store remainder of blood sample for PCR to detect&#xD;
           and determine species of malaria parasites&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Microscopy of Giemsa-stained blood films (microscopists will remain blinded to RDT and&#xD;
           Autoscope results), record results&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Run Autoscope detection, record results, store images captured by the device At SMRU and&#xD;
           EOCRU&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of all slides by expert microscopists (microscopists will remain blinded to RDT&#xD;
           and Autoscope results)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PCR to detect and determine species of malaria parasites At the WWARN Laboratory,&#xD;
           Bangkok&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of field data to identify discrepant readings and tie-breaker readings in case of&#xD;
           discordance between results obtained on site and on re-checking of the slides Quality&#xD;
           Assurance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality control performed by WWARN expert microscopists on 20% randomly selected slides&#xD;
           or 25 positive and 25 negative slides per country, whichever is greater&#xD;
&#xD;
      The funder is Intellectual Ventures Lab/ Global Good and grant reference PA No.3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of Results&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sensitivity and specificity of the Autoscope version 2 prototype were 92.2% and 89.2%,&#xD;
      respectively. The accuracy was 90.03%. Parasite species were correctly determined in 132/158&#xD;
      slides (83.5%) and kappa value for species detection was 0.60(0.45-0.73). 45.6% of the&#xD;
      parasite density estimates from the Autoscope were within 25% range of the reference results,&#xD;
      yielding the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.78 (95%CI: 0.70-0.83).&#xD;
      Bland-Altman plot showed no systematic bias of the measurement. Differences between the 2&#xD;
      counts increased in higher parasite density (correlation coefficient (r) = 0.861, P &lt; 0.001).&#xD;
