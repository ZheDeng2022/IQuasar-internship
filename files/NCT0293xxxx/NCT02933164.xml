  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical investigation is to evaluate the effectiveness of modified&#xD;
      Sensor designs on the longevity (up to 180 days) of the Senseonics Continuous Glucose&#xD;
      Monitoring (CGM) System. The investigation will also evaluate safety of the Senseonics CGM&#xD;
      System usage, while in the clinic and during home use.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Male and Female Subjects meeting all of the following inclusion criteria will be included&#xD;
        in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects age ≥12 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Clinically confirmed diagnosis of diabetes mellitus for ≥1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has signed an informed consent form and is willing to comply with protocol&#xD;
             requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects meeting any of the following exclusion criteria at the time of screening will be&#xD;
        excluded from this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Female subjects of childbearing capacity (defined as not surgically sterile or not&#xD;
             menopausal for ≥ 1 year) who are lactating or pregnant, intending to become pregnant,&#xD;
             or not practicing birth control during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A condition preventing or complicating the placement, operation, or removal of the&#xD;
             Sensor or wearing of transmitter, including upper extremity deformities or skin&#xD;
             condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Symptomatic coronary artery disease; unstable angina; myocardial infarction, transient&#xD;
             ischemic attack or stroke in the past 6 months; uncontrolled hypertension&#xD;
             (systolic&gt;160 mm Hg or diastolic &gt;100 mm Hg at time of screening); current congestive&#xD;
             heart failure; history of cardiac arrhythmia (benign PACs and PVCs allowed). Subjects&#xD;
             with asymptomatic coronary artery disease (e,g, CABG, stent placement or angioplasty)&#xD;
             may participate if negative stress test within 1 year prior to screening and written&#xD;
             clearance from Cardiologist documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Currently receiving (or likely to need during the study period):&#xD;
&#xD;
             immunosuppressant therapy; chemotherapy; anticoagulant/antithrombotic therapy&#xD;
             (excluding aspirin); glucocorticoids (excluding ophthalmic or nasal). This exclusion&#xD;
             does include the use of inhaled glucocorticoids and the use of topical glucocorticoids&#xD;
             (over sensor site only); antibiotic for chronic infection (e.g.&#xD;
             osteomyelitis,endocarditis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. A condition requiring or likely to require magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Known topical or local anesthetic allergy&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Known allergy to glucocorticoids&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Any condition that in the investigator's opinion would make the subject unable to&#xD;
             complete the study or would make it not in the subject's best interest to participate&#xD;
             in the study. Conditions include but are not limited to psychiatric conditions, known&#xD;
             current or recent alcohol abuse or drug abuse by subject history, a condition that may&#xD;
             increase the risk of induced hypoglycemia or risk related to repeated blood testing.&#xD;
             Investigator will supply rationale for exclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Participation in another clinical investigation (drug or device) within 2 weeks prior&#xD;
             to screening or intent to participate during the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. The presence of any other active implanted device (as defined further in protocol)&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. The presence of any other CGM sensor or transmitter located in upper arm (other&#xD;
             location is acceptable)&#xD;
