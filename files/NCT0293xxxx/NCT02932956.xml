  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study enrolls patients who have GPC3-positive solid tumors currently. Patients may be&#xD;
      considered if the cancer has come back, has not gone away after standard treatment or the&#xD;
      patient cannot receive standard treatment. This research study uses special immune system&#xD;
      cells called GAP T cells, a new experimental treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect&#xD;
      for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer:&#xD;
      antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from&#xD;
      infectious diseases and possibly cancer. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special&#xD;
      infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including cells infected with&#xD;
      viruses and tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with&#xD;
      cancers. They have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have found from previous research that they can put a new gene into T cells&#xD;
      that will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. In preclinical studies, the&#xD;
      investigators made several genes called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), from an antibody&#xD;
      called GC33 that recognizes glypican-3, a proteoglycan found on solid tumors including&#xD;
      pediatric liver cancers (GPC3-CAR). This study will test T cells genetically engineered with&#xD;
      a GPC3-CAR (GAP T cells) in patients with GPC3-positive solid tumors (currently only&#xD;
      enrolling liver tumors).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GAP T cells are an investigational product not approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find the biggest dose of GAP T cells that is safe, to see how&#xD;
      long they last in the body, to learn what the side effects are and to see if the GAP T cells&#xD;
      will help people with GPC3-positive solid tumors. This study enrolls patients who have&#xD;
      GPC3-positive solid tumors (currently only enrolling liver tumors).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 24-30 subjects will participate in the treatment part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum of 180 mL of blood (not exceeding 3ml/kg/day) is collected from patients to grow the&#xD;
      T cells and a retrovirus (a special virus that can insert the GPC3 CAR gene into the T cells)&#xD;
      is used to genetically engineer them. After the CAR gene was put into the T cells, the&#xD;
      investigators make sure that they are able to kill GPC3 positive solid tumor cells in the&#xD;
      laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LYMPHODEPLETION CHEMOTHERAPY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies suggest that the infused T cells need room to be able to proliferate and&#xD;
      accomplish their functions and that this may not happen if there are too many other T cells&#xD;
      in circulation. Because of that, participants will receive treatment with cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      (Cytoxan) and fludarabine for 3 days before receiving the T-cell infusion. These drugs will&#xD;
      decrease the numbers of the participants' own T cells before the investigators infuse the GAP&#xD;
      T CELLS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHAT THE INFUSION WILL BE LIKE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After making these cells, they will be frozen. If the patient agrees to participate in this&#xD;
      study, at the time the patient is scheduled to be treated, the cells will be thawed and&#xD;
      injected into the patient over 5 to 10 minutes. The participant will receive the GAP T CELLS&#xD;
      48 to 72 hours after completing the chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a dose escalation study, which means that the investigators do not know the highest&#xD;
      dose of GAP T cells that is safe. To find out, the investigators will give the cells to at&#xD;
      least 3 participants at one dose level. If that is safe, the investigators will raise the&#xD;
      dose given to the next group of participants. The dose each patient gets depends on how many&#xD;
      participants get the agent before that patient and how they react. The investigator will tell&#xD;
      each patient this information. This will help the participant think about possible harms and&#xD;
      benefits. Since the treatment is experimental, what is likely to happen at any dose is not&#xD;
      known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the treatments will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas&#xD;
      Children's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical tests before treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam and History&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test (if the participant is a female who can get pregnant)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the participant is infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) the investigators will&#xD;
           do a test to measure the levels of the virus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of the participant's tumor by scans and the tumor marker alfa-fetoprotein&#xD;
           (AFP), if the participant's tumor produces this protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical tests during and after treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exams and History&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the participant is infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) the investigators will&#xD;
           repeat the test and monitor the levels of the virus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of the participant's tumor by scans (4-6 weeks after the infusion) and AFP&#xD;
           (if applicable at 1, 2, and 4 weeks after the infusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor biopsy between 2-4 weeks after the infusion and as clinically indicated&#xD;
           thereafter. For additional clinically indicated tumor biopsies, investigators will ask&#xD;
           for a portion of the sample for research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW-UP STUDIES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will follow the participant during and after the injections. To learn more&#xD;
      about the way the T cells are working in the participant's body, up to 60 mL (upto 12&#xD;
      teaspoons, no more than 3ml/kg/day) of blood will be taken from the participant before the&#xD;
      chemotherapy, before the T-cell infusion, 1 to 4 hours after the infusion, 3 to 4 days after&#xD;
      the infusion (this time point is optional ) at 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 8 weeks after the&#xD;
      injection, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 years and then every year for the&#xD;
      next 10 years. Total participation time for this study will be 15 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the time points listed above, if the T cells are found in the participant's blood at a&#xD;
      certain amount an extra 5 mL of blood may need to be collected for additional testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use this blood to look for the frequency and activity of the cells&#xD;
      that the investigators have given; that is, to learn more about the way the T cells are&#xD;
      working and how long they last in the body. The investigators will also use this blood to see&#xD;
      if there are any long-term side effects of putting the new gene (chimeric antigen receptor,&#xD;
      CAR) into the cells. In addition to the blood draws, because the participants have received&#xD;
      cells that have had a new gene put in them, the participants will need to have long term&#xD;
      follow up for 15 years so the investigators can see if there are any long-term side effects&#xD;
      of the gene transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a year, the participants will be asked to have their blood drawn and answer questions&#xD;
      about their general health and medical condition. The investigators may ask the participants&#xD;
      to report any recent hospitalizations, new medications, or the development of conditions or&#xD;
      illness that were not present when the participants enrolled in the study and may request&#xD;
      that physical exams and/or laboratory tests be performed if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When tumor biopsy is performed for clinical reasons the investigators will request permission&#xD;
      to obtain excess sample to learn more about the effects of the treatment on the participant's&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of death, the investigators will request permission to perform an autopsy to&#xD;
      learn more about the effects of the treatment on the participant's disease and if there were&#xD;
      any side effects from the cells with the new gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators would like to ask for participant permission to use tumor&#xD;
      biopsy for research purposes only. Associated risk with the biopsy will be discussed with&#xD;
      each participant in detail in a procedure specific consent form. The investigators will test&#xD;
      the sample to see if the GAP T cells can be found in the tumor and what effect they had on&#xD;
      the tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants develop a second abnormal cancer growth, significant blood or nervous system&#xD;
      disorder during the trial, a biopsy sample of the tissue will be tested.&#xD;
