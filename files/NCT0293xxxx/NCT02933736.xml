  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the proposed trial, patients will be administered ribociclib prior to surgical resection&#xD;
      of their tumor. Patients will be enrolled in time-intervals sequentially (non-randomized).&#xD;
      All patients will be orally-administered 5 doses of LEE011 (900 mg/d) with the final dose&#xD;
      occurring at one of 3 intervals before brain tumor resection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      900 mg/d is the maximally tolerated dose (MTD), as determined in a recent Novartis-sponsored&#xD;
      Phase I study for advanced solid tumor patients. The recommended dose expansion and Phase 2&#xD;
      is 600mg/d for 3 weeks on and 1 week off. Due to drug pharmacokinetics, the MTD (900mg) dose&#xD;
      will be used for pre-surgical dosing in order to maximize the opportunity to identify&#xD;
      relevant tumor pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the PK, and PD endpoints listed above, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain tumor&#xD;
      tissue will be collected intraoperatively (for gliomas, enhancing and non-enhancing tumor&#xD;
      tissue will be collected and analyzed separately). Additionally, blood samples will be&#xD;
      obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours after the final ribociclib dose is administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with tumors demonstrating positive PK and PD effects will continue treatment with&#xD;
      ribociclib (21 days on, 7 days off) after surgery. This will constitute the Phase II&#xD;
      component of the study. Patients will be treated until unacceptable toxicity is observed, or&#xD;
      until disease progression as assessed by radiographic or clinical metrics. Preliminary rates&#xD;
      of progression-free survival in patients with high-grade gliomas and high-grade meningiomas&#xD;
      treated with ribociclib will be measured through radiographic and clinical response metrics,&#xD;
      specifically Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria and investigator&#xD;
      discretion. Overall survival in patients with high-grade gliomas and high-grade meningiomas&#xD;
      treated with ribociclib will be assessed by medical record review and survival follow up.&#xD;

             effective contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;

                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement&#xD;
                  of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of&#xD;
                  hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for&#xD;
                  example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.&#xD;

                  barrier method of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have&#xD;
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile&#xD;

             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.&#xD;
             In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has&#xD;
             been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child&#xD;
             bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking drug&#xD;
             and for 21 days after stopping treatment and should not father a child in this period.&#xD;
             A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery&#xD;
             of the drug via seminal fluid.&#xD;
