    <textblock>
      Multinational real-life study of current psoriasis treatment strategies, topical treatment&#xD;
      patterns and treatment outcomes of these treatments, including the newly introduced&#xD;
      calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate aerosol foam fixed combination product Enstilar®&#xD;
      (calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multinational study aims to describe current treatment patterns and outcomes in the&#xD;
      diversity of the real life setting: local differences in access to drugs and current&#xD;
      treatment practices, and regional cultural differences, covering adult patients of all&#xD;
      backgrounds, sex, socio-economic standing, health background, comorbidity and co-medication.&#xD;
      A total of around 400 real-life prescribers in 3-8 countries are expected to participate over&#xD;
      the years, with each country contributing data to the study for around 2 years, starting data&#xD;
      collection within the first year after local market introduction of Enstilar®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The real-life prescribing and utilization patterns of topical prescription products approved&#xD;
      for treatment of psoriasis vulgaris in the individual participating countries will be mapped&#xD;
      and performance of the products in real life will be investigated based primarily on baseline&#xD;
      data from investigators and patient reported data contributed by the individual patient for 1&#xD;
      year. Patients are expected to enter data on their electronic device at baseline and at times&#xD;
      of treatment changes and other key events, and investigators are expected to contribute data&#xD;
      after each contact with the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be approached for informed consent to participate in the study after their&#xD;
      individual treatment plan has been decided. The study aims to include two patients on other&#xD;
      topical treatment for every patient planned to receive Enstilar® in order to ensure a&#xD;
      sufficient sample of Enstilar® treated patients to capture the diversity of real-life&#xD;
      prescription patterns in patients not on Enstilar®, and to allow for sufficiently powered&#xD;
      comparisons between Enstilar® and other real-world treatment strategies. A systematic&#xD;
      approach will be used to select eligible patients to be approached for study participation in&#xD;
      order to minimize selection bias and control seasonal variations.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Adult patients starting treatment with Enstilar® or other topical treatment of body and/or&#xD;
        extremities in one of the countries participating in the study. Patients receiving a&#xD;
        prescription renewal for an ongoing topical treatment are not eligible. Patients undergoing&#xD;
        systemic treatment can be included as well, provided they receive a prescription for&#xD;
        concomitant use of topical treatment on body and/or extremities and this is not a&#xD;
        prescription renewal. The minimum age may vary slightly, as in some countries adult age&#xD;
        differ from 18 years of age.&#xD;
