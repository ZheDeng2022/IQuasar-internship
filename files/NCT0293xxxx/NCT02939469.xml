      Since the invention of electrocardiogram (ECG), ECG has been an important part of clinical&#xD;
      practice. A primary reason for the popularity of the ECG is that it is non-invasive and can&#xD;
      be performed in any patient by placing electrodes on the skin. The present methods of ECG&#xD;
      recording focus on detecting electrical signals from the heart. the investigators propose&#xD;
      that with high frequency sampling and high pass filtering, the investigators can also record&#xD;
      SNA from the skin. The somata of the subcutaneous sympathetic nerves on the skin are located&#xD;
      at the ipsilateral cervical and stellate ganglia. Because the left stellate ganglion nerve&#xD;
      activity (SGNA) is known to trigger cardiac arrhythmias, including AF, VF and VF, It is&#xD;
      possible that skin SNA can also be used for arrhythmia prediction. the investigators tested&#xD;
      that hypothesis in our preclinical studies (supported by R01 HL71140) using canine models.&#xD;
      The results showed that subcutaneous nerve activity (SCNA) recorded with implanted electrodes&#xD;
      can be used to estimate stellate ganglion nerve activity(SGNA) in normal dogs and in a canine&#xD;
      model of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death. the investigators also showed that SCNA is&#xD;
      more accurate than heart rate variability in estimating cardiac sympathetic tone in&#xD;
      ambulatory dogs with myocardial infarction.Therefore, SKNA and SCNA may be useful in&#xD;
      estimating cardiac sympathetic tone. In addition to studying the autonomic mechanisms of&#xD;
      cardiac arrhythmia, these new methods may have broad application in studying both cardiac and&#xD;
      non-cardiac diseases. For example, sympathetic tone is important in the pathogenesis of heart&#xD;
      failure, atherosclerosis, peripheral neuropathies, epilepsy, vasovagal syncope, renal&#xD;
      failure, hypertension and many others diseases. Direct SKNA and SCNA recording may provide&#xD;
      new approaches to study the mechanisms of these common diseases. SKNA recording may also have&#xD;
      immediate clinical applications by assisting in the diagnosis and treatment of hyperhidrosis&#xD;
      (sweaty palms), paralysis, stroke, diabetes, and neuromuscular diseases. It may be used to&#xD;
      assist biofeedback monitoring performed by neurologists to control neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      disorders. Because of these potential clinical and commercial applications, the investigators&#xD;
      propose that this research project is significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b. Innovation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using conventional electrodes on the skin to record SNA. The neuECG utilizes the&#xD;
           conventional skin electrodes that are widely used in health care facilities. Skin SNA&#xD;
           had been recorded using microneurography techniques, and had been estimated using&#xD;
           cutaneous blood flow (vasodilator responses) skin temperature, skin conductance and&#xD;
           sweat release. However, microneurography cannot be used in ambulatory patients. The&#xD;
           other methods are not direct measurements of SNA. neuECG is the first method that can&#xD;
           directly and non-invasively measure the SNA from the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Automated real-time signal processing. the investigators will develop signal processing&#xD;
           software to automatically eliminate noise, such as that generated by muscle contraction,&#xD;
           electrical appliances, body motion, respiration, and radiofrequency signals. The&#xD;
           remaining signals are then processed to separately display in real time to provide&#xD;
           health care providers a new method to instantly estimate sympathetic tone. The ECG&#xD;
           signals are used for automated arrhythmia detection while the SNA signals are available&#xD;
           for risk stratification. This approach allows us to improve and broaden the clinical&#xD;
           application of Einthoven's original invention by simultaneous detecting ECG and SNA from&#xD;
           the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SKNA patterns as new biomarkers. the investigators have identified unique SKNA patterns&#xD;
           that precede the onset of human AF. If proven correct by Specific Aim 3, this new&#xD;
           biomarker can help physicians to estimate the arrhythmia risk and to predict the&#xD;
           efficacy of catheter ablation for AF.&#xD;

      Background Cardiac sympathetic innervation comes from the paravertebral cervical and thoracic&#xD;
      ganglia. Among them, the stellate (cervicothoracic) ganglion is a major source of sympathetic&#xD;
      innervation. It constantly connects with phrenic nerves and almost as often to the vagal&#xD;
      nerves.37 The paravertebral ganglia also directly connect with spinal nerves, which connect&#xD;
      with the intercostal nerves. These intercostal nerves split into ramus cutaneous lateralis&#xD;
      and a deep branch to the musculus rectus abdominis. Histological studies of human skin biopsy&#xD;
      confirmed the presence of abundant sympathetic nerves in arteriovenous anastomoses arrector&#xD;
      pilorum muscles, and arterioles. Using horseradish peroxidase as tracer, Baron et al and&#xD;
      Taniguchi et al found that all skin sensory and sympathetic neurons are located&#xD;
      ipsilaterally. The sympathetic somata are located in the middle cervical and stellate ganglia&#xD;
      as well as the thoracic ganglia. Because of the direct and extensive connections among&#xD;
      various nerve structures, it is possible for the sympathetic nerves in the various structures&#xD;
      to activate simultaneously. Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that SKNA recorded from&#xD;
      the upper thorax can be used to estimate the cardiac sympathetic tone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Utilize the differential frequency contents of ECG and SNA to record neuECG To preserve the&#xD;
      signal and eliminate noise, the American Heart Association (AHA) standard recommendation for&#xD;
      low pass filtering of the ECG is 150 Hz for adolescents and adults, and 250 Hz for children.&#xD;
      Higher frequency signals, although known to be clinically important, are routinely eliminated&#xD;
      by this low pass filtering. Because there is no need to record high frequency signals, the&#xD;
      conventional ECG and Holter monitoring devices do not have a wide bandwidth and high sampling&#xD;
      rate. neuECG recording takes a different approach. the investigators use equipment with wide&#xD;
      bandwidth (2K Hz) and high sampling rate (4K/s-10K/s) to record the signals from the skin.&#xD;
      The signal is then band passed between 0.5 Hz and 150 Hz to display ECG signal. The same&#xD;
      signals are then high passed at &gt; 150 Hz to reveal nerve activities. Figure 1 illustrates the&#xD;
      above concept. It shows Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analyses of the signals recorded from&#xD;
      the skin. High pass filtering at 150 Hz eliminated the ECG signals. The remaining high&#xD;
      frequency signals may contain both muscle and nerve activities. McAuley et al reported that&#xD;
      the electromyography (EMG) usually has a frequency of &lt;100 Hz. At most, small amounts of&#xD;
      muscle activities could reach 400 Hz. By high pass filtering at 500 Hz, the EMG is eliminated&#xD;
      but so are other signals with frequencies &lt; 500 Hz. The standard high pass setting for&#xD;
      microneurography study is 700 Hz. High pass filtering at 500 or 700 Hz increased the&#xD;
      specificity but reduced the sensitivity of SKNA recording. The signal to noise ratio is&#xD;
      reduced. However, the basic patterns of nerve discharges remain.&#xD;
