  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long term objective of the research is to identify new biomarkers of disease activity in&#xD;
      the human acute porphyrias. This pilot study is intended to provide pilot and feasibility&#xD;
      data needed to plan larger and more definitive future studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This translational pilot research is based on preliminary results using animal models. The&#xD;
      investigators will collect samples of blood, urine and feces from up to 50 participants with&#xD;
      well documented acute porphyrias, at 2 expert sites that are members of the Porphyrias&#xD;
      Consortium. Collection and analysis of these samples will be used to assess feasibility of&#xD;
      performing such studies in humans with acute porphyrias, recognizing that these disorders are&#xD;
      more heterogeneous than reproduced in animal models, and affect individuals who cannot all be&#xD;
      studied simultaneously and in large groups. Therefore, we will assess the feasibility of&#xD;
      methods for collecting, processing, storing and shipping samples at multiple study sites for&#xD;
      later biomarker analysis. Larger and more definitive studies of biomarkers will be designed&#xD;
      and implemented based on data and experience from this pilot-feasibility study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented diagnosis of acute porphyria.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. For AIP: Elevation in urine PBG, with normal or only slight increases in plasma&#xD;
                  and fecal porphyrins. Most (~90%) will have deficient activity of erythrocyte&#xD;
                  PBGD.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. For HCP: Elevation in urine PBG, with substantial increases in fecal porphyrins&#xD;
                  (almost entirely coproporphyrin III). In the absence of skin photosensitivity,&#xD;
                  most will have normal or only slight increases in plasma porphyrins.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. For VP: Elevation in PBG, with substantial increases in fecal porphyrins (mostly&#xD;
                  coproporphyrin III and protoporphyrin), increased plasma total porphyrins and a&#xD;
                  fluorescence emission maximum of diluted plasma at neutral pH near 626 nm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Another medical condition that might confound the results, as judged by the&#xD;
             investigator&#xD;
