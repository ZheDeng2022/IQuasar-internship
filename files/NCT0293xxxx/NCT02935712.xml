  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a phase I, first time in human (FiH), randomized, single-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, SAD study in male patients with T2DM, performed at a single study center.&#xD;
      The study will consist of 2 parts, (A and B) up to 60 male patients with T2DM aged 18 to 65&#xD;
      years will be included&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part A will assess the safety and tolerability of SAD of intradermal (ID) injection of&#xD;
      AZD8601 (modified VEGF-A RNA) and Part B will evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of ID&#xD;
      injection of AZD8601 in forearm skin. AZD8601 is a VEGF-A modified RNA under development as a&#xD;
      novel modality for local production of human VEGF-A protein and is developed for the&#xD;
      treatment of diabetic patients with ulcers. Each patient in Part A will be involved in the&#xD;
      study for 7 to 8 weeks. Each patient in Part B will be involved in the study for 5 to 6&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability variables includes Adverse events (AEs), Vital signs (BP, pulse),&#xD;
      ECG, Hematology, Clinical chemistry, Urinalysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include patients with T2DM that are on stable doses of 1 to 2 anti-diabetic&#xD;
      medications. The T2DM patients may also be on medications for comorbidities such as&#xD;
      hypertension, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, thyroid disorders, benign prostate hyperplasia&#xD;
      etc. (e.g. diuretics, statins, allopurinol, thyroxin), but must be healthy otherwise.&#xD;
