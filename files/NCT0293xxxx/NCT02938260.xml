  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia, accounting for one third of all&#xD;
      hospital admissions and 1% of all emergency department visits (ED). Approximately 65% of&#xD;
      those presenting to the ED with AF are admitted. There are also numerous reasons for patients&#xD;
      to get AF with rapid ventricular rate (AF RVR) during hospitalization. In the acute setting&#xD;
      these patients are often treated with diltiazem, a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel&#xD;
      blocker (ND CCB), or metoprolol, a beta blocker (BB). Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel&#xD;
      blocker (diltiazem and verapamil) use is considered harmful and national guidelines recommend&#xD;
      against use in patients with decompensated heart failure (HF). This recommendation is based&#xD;
      on studies with long-term treatment. The purpose of this study is to assess the difference&#xD;
      between metoprolol and diltiazem for the acute treatment of AF RVR in patients with HF with&#xD;
      reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AF and HF are frequently seen in the hospital setting. AF affects over 2 million people in&#xD;
      the United States, while HF affects over 5 million. These disease states have a significant&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality impact with AF leading to a 4 fold increase in stroke and 2 fold&#xD;
      increase in death, while 50% of patients with a new HF diagnosis will die within 5 years.&#xD;
      These two disease states share several common risk factors including, age, hypertension,&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, and heart disease. Based on this relationship and the changes in&#xD;
      myocardial structure, function, and conduction the two are also risk factors for one another.&#xD;
      Of patients with HF, 61.5% of men and 73% of women develop AF. Of those with AF, 73% of men&#xD;
      and 75.6% of women develop HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the AF guidelines by the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and&#xD;
      Heart Rhythm Society and the HF guidelines by the American College of Cardiology Foundation&#xD;
      and the American Heart Association recommend against the use of ND CCB in patients with&#xD;
      HFrEF. The HF guidelines specify to avoid ND CCB in patients with reduced LVEF, but also&#xD;
      mention avoiding most calcium channel blockers in general with the possible exception of&#xD;
      amlodipine, due to known adverse effects and potential for harm. However, short term use of&#xD;
      diltiazem for the acute control of RVR in patients with HFrEF has not been clearly evaluated.&#xD;
      Three studies compare the use of BB and ND CCB in the acute treatment of AF RVR. These&#xD;
      studies excluded those with severe (New York Heart Association Class IV) or decompensated HF,&#xD;
      however, they did not comment on patients with compensated HFrEF. Most of these studies&#xD;
      illustrate no difference, but the most recent study reported a success rate (heart rate (HR)&#xD;
      &lt;100 bpm within 30 minutes) of 95.8% with intravenous (IV) diltiazem and 46.4% with IV&#xD;
      metoprolol (p&lt;0.0001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      When comparing use of long term and short term therapy in patients with HFrEF a different&#xD;
      perspective emerges. Both BB and ND CCB have negative inotropic effects which can be harmful&#xD;
      during an acute HF exacerbation and worsen symptoms. However, BB are routinely recommended&#xD;
      for chronic use in HFrEF due to their added neurohormonal benefit, which over time delays HF&#xD;
      progression and reduces mortality. In contrast, long term treatment with ND CCB in those with&#xD;
      pulmonary congestion is associated with an increased cumulative rate of cardiac events&#xD;
      (hazard ratio 1.41). The comparative short term benefit in patients is still unclear. In a&#xD;
      small study, patients with AF RVR and severe HF, 97% treated with IV diltiazem had a HR&#xD;
      reduction of &gt;20% and no evidence of HF exacerbation. A second study of patients in&#xD;
      decompensated HF compared the use of IV metoprolol and diltiazem for control of AF RVR. Both&#xD;
      agents were equally effective at controlling heart rate with no difference in safety endpoint&#xD;
      or evidence of worsening heart failure. Neither of these studies specifically address&#xD;
      compensated HFrEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current literature focuses on the risks associated with ND CCB and patients with HFrEF, but&#xD;
      these effects are with long-term treatment. Studies in the acute setting often exclude those&#xD;
      with severe or decompensated HFrEF. Therefore, a study focusing on metoprolol versus&#xD;
      diltiazem for the acute control of AF RVR in patients with HFrEF could offer an insight into&#xD;
      current clinical practice.&#xD;
