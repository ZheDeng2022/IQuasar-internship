      Objectives: This study will determine the clinical efficacy of bleaching agent 37% carbamide&#xD;
      peroxide compared to 35% hydrogen peroxide on the change of color scores in anterior superior&#xD;
      teeth, in-office bleaching technique after 7, 14 and 37 days; and the Risk to the tooth&#xD;
      sensitivity before, during and 24 hours after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: Fifty patients will be selected for this single-blind, parallel,&#xD;
      randomized-controlled clinical trial. The whitening treatment with 37% carbamide peroxide or&#xD;
      35% hydrogen peroxide (control) will be carried out in a single application of 45 minutes for&#xD;
      two sessions with a 7-day interval. The sensitivity level will be assessed before, during and&#xD;
      24 hours after the procedure using verbal and analogic visual analogue (VAS) scales. Color&#xD;
      alteration will be assessed by a bleach guide scale 7 days after each session and 30 days&#xD;
      after the last session. Relative risk to sensitivity will be calculated and adjusted by&#xD;
      session; while comparison of overall risk will performed by McNemar's test. Data on the&#xD;
      sensitivity level for both scales will be subjected to the Mann-Whitney tests (α = 0.05). The&#xD;
      color change will be measured with a spectrophotometer using the CIE L * a * b * and the L*,&#xD;
      a * and b * parameter delta data, and ΔE and Δ00, will be individually subjected to two-way&#xD;
      repeated measures ANOVA test to compare the two bleaching techniques at each evaluation time&#xD;
      (α = 0.05).&#xD;

      Methods &amp; Materials: This clinical trial was approved by the Scientific Review Committee and&#xD;
      by the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects of the local university (CAAE&#xD;
      50511415.1.0000.5546).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design: This study will be a randomized-controlled, single-blind clinical trial with a&#xD;
      parallel design. The patients included will be submitted to two in-office bleaching sessions&#xD;
      with a 7-day interval receiving 35% hydrogen peroxide (control) or 37% carbamide peroxide in&#xD;
      a single application of 45 minutes; while the same treatments will be allocated for each&#xD;
      session. The study will be conducted at the clinic of the School of Dentistry of the local&#xD;
      university from May 2016 to December 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Patients included in this clinical trial will be at least 18 years old with&#xD;
      good oral health. Patients with any of the six upper anterior teeth with caries, restoration,&#xD;
      severe discoloration (e.g., stains caused by tetracycline), enamel hypoplasia, gingival&#xD;
      recession, dentin exposure, pulpitis, or endodontics will be excluded. Participants submitted&#xD;
      to previous bleaching procedures, presenting prior tooth sensitivity, pregnant or&#xD;
      breastfeeding will be also excluded. Only patients presenting all six upper anterior teeth&#xD;
      with shade mismatching with 2.5 M2 (Vita Bleach guide 3D-Master scale, Vita-Zahnfabrik, Bad&#xD;
      Sackingen, Germany) or darker will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample calculation will be based on the primary continuous outcome for superiority&#xD;
      control. Power of the test will be set at 80%, considering a type I error of 0.05; for a&#xD;
      minimum detectable difference between treatments 25%, based on a prior study using similar&#xD;
      bleaching agent, while a coefficient of variation of 30% of control treatment will be&#xD;
      expected. The calculation resulted in fifty patients, through the formula used n = f(α/2, β)&#xD;
      × [p1 × (100 - p1) + p2 × (100 - p2)] / (p2 - p1)2. The calculation resulted in fifty&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized list will be computer-generated by a person not involved in intervention or&#xD;
      evaluation. The participants were defined as blocks in the randomization process, where the&#xD;
      sequence of treatment (treatment or control) will be randomly set for each block by using&#xD;
      computer-generated tables (www.sealedenvelope.com). The sequence will be inserted into sealed&#xD;
      envelopes numbered from 1 to 50 that were opened by the operator only at the moment of the&#xD;
      intervention. The patients were numbered according to the sequence of enrollment. Neither the&#xD;
      participant nor the operator knew the group allocation determining blinding to the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to bleaching procedure, the teeth will be cleaned using rubber cups associated to&#xD;
      pumice and water. The shades of canine upper teeth will be assessed on a baseline with a&#xD;
      spectrophotometer Vita EasyShade (Vita-Zahnfabrik, Bad Säckinge, Germany) using the CIE L * a&#xD;
      * b *. 3 measurements on each tooth will be conducted, with the end result the average of 3&#xD;
      values (L *, a * and b *).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control treatment: A light-cured resin dam will be applied (Top Dam, FGM, Joinville, SC,&#xD;
      Brazil) on the gingival tissue corresponding to the teeth to be bleached. A 35% hydrogen&#xD;
      peroxide based bleaching agent (Whiteness HP Maxx, FGM, Joinville, SC, Brazil) will be mixed&#xD;
      and applied on the vestibular surface of teeth, in the ratio of 1 drop every 3 to the&#xD;
      thickener and peroxide, remaining for 45 minutes. After this time, the bleaching agent will&#xD;
      be removed. A second session will be as carried out after 1 week following the same&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Treatment: A 37% carbamide peroxide based bleaching agent (Power bleaching, BM4,&#xD;
      Palhoça, SC, Brazil) will be applied on the vestibular surface of teeth with a relative&#xD;
      isolation only using cotton roller, remaining for 45 minutes. After this time, the bleaching&#xD;
      agent will be removed. A second session will be as carried out after 1 week following the&#xD;
      same procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tooth sensitivity reported by patients will be assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS)&#xD;
      and verbal rating scale (VRS). The VAS consisted of a scale 10 cm in length ranging from 0&#xD;
      (absence of pain) to 10 (unsupportable pain). The patient set his or her level of sensitivity&#xD;
      by pointing on the scale corresponding to this level, while the distance from this point to&#xD;
      the 0 border will be recorded. For VRS, the patient reported his or her level of sensitivity&#xD;
      based on scores: 0 = none, 1 = light, 2 = moderate, 3 = considerable and 4 = severe. The&#xD;
      tooth sensitivity will be assessed during the bleaching, immediately after bleaching agent&#xD;
      removal and and up to 24 hours after each session. One week after each session and 30 days&#xD;
      after the last session the tooth color will be evaluated again using the CIE L * a * b * as&#xD;
      previously described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For color analysis, the parameter delta data L *, a * and b *, and ΔE and Δ00, will be&#xD;
      individually subjected to two-way repeated measures ANOVA test to compare the two bleaching&#xD;
      techniques at each evaluation time. Based on presence of any tooth sensitivity (scores&#xD;
      different from 0 for VRS), the absolute risk, odds ratio and relative risk will be calculated&#xD;
      regarding the treatments for each moment of evaluation/session of bleaching, as well as its&#xD;
      confidence intervals (95%). For each moment, differences on presence/absence ratios will be&#xD;
      analyzed by Fisher's exact test. For the overall risk related to each treatment, the odds&#xD;
      ratio will be adjusted to independent variable &quot;session of bleaching&quot; using the&#xD;
      Mantel-Haenszel statistic. The homogeneity of odds ratios will be analyzed by the Breslow-Day&#xD;
      and Tarone's tests. Following, the odds ratio estimated will be converted to relative risk&#xD;
      and the overall presence/absence ratios will be analyzed by the McNemar's test, considering&#xD;
      the study design (parallel).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For VRS, the data from scores observed in each time of evaluation/session of bleaching will&#xD;
      be submitted to the Mann-Whitney rank sum test. Despite the measurement of tooth sensitivity&#xD;
      using VAS giving a continuous outcome, data assessed with this scale did not show a normal&#xD;
      distribution (Shapiro-Wilk's test). Thus, data from VAS will be also analyzed by the&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney rank sum test, while one test per time of evaluation will be carried out. All&#xD;
      statistical analyses will be performed considering a 95% significance level (α = 0.05).&#xD;
