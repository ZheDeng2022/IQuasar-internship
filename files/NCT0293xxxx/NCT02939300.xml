      This research study is studying a combination of two drugs as a possible treatment for&#xD;
      Leptomeningeal Metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ipilimumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nivolumab&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers hope to study the effects of the combination of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab. Many&#xD;
      cancers use specific pathways (such as PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4) to evade the body's immune&#xD;
      system. Nivolumab and ipilimumab work by blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 pathways and thus&#xD;
      releasing the brakes on the immune system so it can stop or slow cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved Nivolumab and Ipilimumab as a&#xD;
      treatment option for melanoma, but has not approved them for use when cancer cells spread to&#xD;
      the cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;

             Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 2&#xD;
             weeks earlier. Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion&#xD;
             and may qualify for the study. If subject received major surgery, they must have&#xD;
             recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention&#xD;
             prior to starting therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should be excluded if they have an active, known or suspected autoimmune&#xD;
             disease. Subjects are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes&#xD;
             mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone&#xD;
             replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to&#xD;
             recur in the absence of an external trigger&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with&#xD;
             either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other&#xD;
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or&#xD;
             topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents&#xD;
             are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease. Subjects are permitted to&#xD;
             use topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids&#xD;
             (with minimal systemic absorption). Physiologic replacement doses of systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroids are permitted, even if &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents. A brief&#xD;
             course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (eg, contrast dye allergy) or for treatment&#xD;
             of non-autoimmune conditions (eg, delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by&#xD;
             contact allergen) is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As there is potential for hepatic toxicity with nivolumab or nivolumab/ipilimumab&#xD;
             combinations, drugs with a predisposition to hepatoxicity should be used with caution&#xD;
             in patients treated with nivolumab-containing regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should be excluded if they have had prior systemic treatment with an&#xD;
             anti-CTLA4 antibody&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should be excluded if they are positive test for hepatitis B virus surface&#xD;
             antigen (HBV sAg) or hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV antibody) indicating&#xD;
             acute or chronic infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should be excluded if they have known history of testing positive for human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). These&#xD;
             participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit&#xD;
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.&#xD;
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known history of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:&#xD;
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and&#xD;
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live&#xD;
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergy to study drug components&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody&#xD;
