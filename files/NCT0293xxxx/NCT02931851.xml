  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Relatives in intensive care units (ICU) are important partners in decision-making in the&#xD;
      treatment of critically ill patients and provide a significant resource in the care and&#xD;
      recovery of patients. Therefore, a professional, educational intervention targeting these&#xD;
      caregivers may have fundamental benefits with little risk. As in other fields, information is&#xD;
      searched in the internet, but this unselected information is often overwhelming and of little&#xD;
      use in this context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms of anxiety, stress and depression are common in affected relatives. The majority of&#xD;
      family members report some level of anxiety, depression and stress, sometimes even resulting&#xD;
      in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Importantly, an association between lack of&#xD;
      information and post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD has been reported. The large number of&#xD;
      potentially affected families poses a particular challenge to healthcare and may cause&#xD;
      substantial secondary costs to national economy.&#xD;

      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Phase: Empirical study (quantitative) of information needs - semi-structured interviews&#xD;
           with family members, physicians and caregivers&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Phase: Development of user friendly homepage with University of Applied Sciences&#xD;
           Joanneum and validation of the homepage with medical professionals and laypersons&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Phase: Randomized Controlled Trial (non-blinded) with &quot;placebo home page&quot; (N=110)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relatives in intensive care units (ICU) are important partners in decision-making in the&#xD;
      treatment of critically ill patients and provide a significant resource in the care and&#xD;
      recovery of patients. Therefore, a professional, educational intervention targeting these&#xD;
      caregivers may have fundamental benefits with little to no risk. As in other fields,&#xD;
      information is searched in the internet, but this unselected information is often&#xD;
      overwhelming and of little use in this context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Austria there are 2784 systemized intensive care beds with an average occupation of 3,6&#xD;
      days, representing 100 new admissions per year/ICU bed. This may translate to 500.000&#xD;
      affected family members per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of family members in the treatment process of ICU patients is a not very well&#xD;
      studied subject, especially in German-speaking countries. In contrast, in the Anglo-American&#xD;
      world, family members play a key role in the medical, financial and legal aspects of the&#xD;
      treatment process and have a decisive role in the successful treatment during and after&#xD;
      critical illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms of anxiety, stress and depression are common in affected relatives . The majority of&#xD;
      family members report some level of anxiety, depression and stress, sometimes even resulting&#xD;
      in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Importantly, an association between lack of&#xD;
      information and post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD has been reported. The large number of&#xD;
      potentially affected families poses a particular challenge to healthcare and may cause&#xD;
      substantial secondary costs to national economy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participation of relatives in the decision making process of ICU patients is negatively&#xD;
      affected by the uncertainty concerning the treatment path, medical procedures and&#xD;
      consequences for the families' life after ICU discharge. This likely leads to unnecessary&#xD;
      hospital readmissions, complicates rehabilitation of patients and requires adapted management&#xD;
      strategies for relatives. Therefore, it is important to provide sufficient information to&#xD;
      families in high quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship management with relatives places significant demands on ICU staff and&#xD;
      conflicts between physicians and relatives are common. So far, only a few randomized&#xD;
      intervention studies have been performed in this setting, but with promising results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The internet has revolutionized our world including the access to medical information. In one&#xD;
      study, almost 50% of ICU patients' family members used the internet for information purposes&#xD;
      within the first days of ICU treatment. This makes a web-based intervention in this setting&#xD;
      very promising. To our knowledge however, no RCT has yet evaluated the usefulness of a&#xD;
      web-based intervention on ICU patients' family members' quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following question should therefore be answered by our study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does targeted information and communication using new media (INTERVENTION) have a&#xD;
           beneficial influence on subjective and objective endpoints of patients and their&#xD;
           families?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Could this help in averting the negative effects of anxiety, stress, and depression? Are&#xD;
           new media accepted in clinical routine?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the project support the affected family members in their health literacy?&#xD;
