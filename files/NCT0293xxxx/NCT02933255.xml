      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immune system is the cells and organs in the body that recognize and fight infection and&#xD;
      cancer. The PROSTVAC vaccine might teach the immune system to find and kill certain prostate&#xD;
      cancer cells. Nivolumab is a drug that allows the immune system to fight tumors. Itmight help&#xD;
      PROSTVAC work better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the safety and effectiveness of the combination of PROSTVAC and nivolumab. To test&#xD;
      this for people with castration resistant prostate cancer and then for other people with&#xD;
      localized prostate cancer who are candidates for surgical removal of the prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men ages 18 and older with prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone scan&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT scan or MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor sample. This may be from a previous procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will get a combination of the study drugs over 8 weeks. They will have 1&#xD;
      visit for the initial injection then 3 booster injection / nivolumab infusion visits. Blood&#xD;
      will be tested at these visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the next 4 weeks, some participants will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An exam of the large intestine through the rectum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT and bone scans&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard hormonal treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Option to continue treatment every 3 weeks if their disease does not get worse. They will be&#xD;
&#xD;
      have scans every 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other participants will have surgery to remove the prostate in week 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a safety visit about a month after their last treatment. This will&#xD;
      include a physical exam, blood tests, and possibly scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If their cancer progresses, participants will leave the study and may enroll in a long-term&#xD;
      follow-up study. They will be contacted once a year to ask about their cancer and treatment.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune checkpoint inhibitors interfere with the immune system s autoregulatory mechanisms,&#xD;
      allowing for a potentially expanded and prolonged T-cell response with the possibility of&#xD;
      greater antitumor effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab is a fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that targets the PD-1 protein.&#xD;
      Specifically, the antibody binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1&#xD;
      and PD-L2, thereby releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response,&#xD;
      including anti-tumor immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROSTVAC (developed by the National Cancer Institute [NCI] and licensed to Bavarian Nordic&#xD;
      Immunotherapeutics, Mountain View, CA) is a therapeutic cancer vaccine for prostate cancer.&#xD;
      Early studies have demonstrated immunologic efficacy and suggested clinical benefit. A phase&#xD;
      III trial has completed accrual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous study combining the immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab and PROSTVAC suggested&#xD;
      greater efficacy than PROSTVAC alone. Additional studies have demonstrated the potential&#xD;
      efficacy of immunologic combination therapy with the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will aim to evaluate the impact of the combination of PROSTVAC and the immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab on the tumor microenvironment focusing on immune cell&#xD;
      infiltration as the primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      US-MRI imaging technology will be employed to sample the tumor before treatment and after&#xD;
      radical prostatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings from this study could serve as the basis for future studies with this&#xD;
      combination in this population of participants and more advanced disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety (For castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) lead-in cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate changes in T-cell infiltration in the tumor after neoadjuvant treatment with&#xD;
      PROSTVAC and nivolumab, relative to changes seen in a phase 2 trial with PROSTVAC alone in&#xD;
      the neoadjuvant setting- NCT02153918 (For the neoadjuvant cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must have histopathological documentation of adenocarcinoma of the prostate&#xD;
      prior to starting this study and evaluable biopsy tissue (e.g., unstained slides or blocks)&#xD;
      available for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the castration resistant lead in cohort, if histopathological documentation is&#xD;
      unavailable, a rising PSA and a clinical course consistent with prostate cancer would be&#xD;
      acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must have a performance status of 0 to 1 according to the ECOG criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematological eligibility parameters (within 16 days of starting therapy):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Granulocyte count 1,500/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet count 100,000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hgb &gt;= 8 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical eligibility parameters (within 16 days of starting therapy):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatic function: Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dl (OR in participants with Gilbert s syndrome, total&#xD;
      bilirubin &lt;= 3.0 mg/dL), AST and ALT &lt;= 2.5 times upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Creatinine &lt;= 1.5 X ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary focus of this study will be to evaluate PROSTVAC and nivolumab in the neoadjuvant&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lead-in cohort evaluating the safety and tolerability of this combination in the castration&#xD;
      resistant setting (CRPC cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this lead-in cohort in the CRPC setting, we will enroll a cohort in the neoadjuvant&#xD;
      setting evaluating the combination of PROSTVAC and nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lead-in safety cohort will require 10 participants and the neoadjuvant cohort will&#xD;
      require 17 evaluable participants. In order to allow for a small number of inevaluable&#xD;
      participants, the accrual ceiling will be set to 29 participants.&#xD;
