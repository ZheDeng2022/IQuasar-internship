  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of MK-5890 when&#xD;
      administered alone and in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in adults with advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors. The initial course of MK-5890 monotherapy or MK-5890 plus pembrolizumab&#xD;
      combination therapy will be for up to 35 administrations (approximately 2 years). The safety&#xD;
      and pharmacokinetics of MK-5890 when administered with pembrolizumab, pemetrexed and&#xD;
      carboplatin in adults with nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and MK-5890 when&#xD;
      administered with pembrolizumab and nab-paclitaxel in adults with triple-negative breast&#xD;
      cancer (TNBC) will also be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants receiving MK-5890 monotherapy who experience disease progression may be eligible&#xD;
      to switch to receiving MK-5890 plus pembrolizumab combination therapy for up to 35 cycles&#xD;
      (approximately 2 years) at the discretion of the Investigator and approval of the Sponsor.&#xD;
