  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: A growing body of epidemiological data suggests an increased risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      events associated with air pollution. One of the common air pollutants, ozone, has been shown&#xD;
      to induce oxidative stress and inflammation in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems.&#xD;
      This proposed study is to examine the efficacy of fish oil and olive oil in modulating&#xD;
      cardiovascular and pulmonary functions after ozone exposure. The objective is to understand&#xD;
      the mechanistic basis for the health effects of ozone relative to those air pollutants.&#xD;
      Treatment groups will include forty healthy young adults who will be given dietary&#xD;
      supplementation of fish oil or olive oil. A control group will consist of 20 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers who will receive no supplements. After 4 weeks, subjects will be exposed to clean&#xD;
      air for 2 hours on the first day, then ozone for 2 hours on the second day. Cardiac rhythm,&#xD;
      pulmonary function, vascular responses, endothelial function, and markers of coagulation and&#xD;
      airway inflammation pre- and post- ozone exposure will be measured. This study is designed to&#xD;
      build on the previous nutritional supplement interventional studies (UNC IRB # 07-0190 and&#xD;
      UNC IRB # 11-1807), in order to understand the mechanism of action of particulate pollutants&#xD;
      in comparison to that of ozone, a known oxidant air contaminant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: A total of sixty healthy 18-35 year-old male and female subjects will be&#xD;
      involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): Forty healthy young adults will receive dietary supplementation&#xD;
      consisting of fish oil or olive oil for 4 weeks. The control group includes 20 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers who will receive no supplements in the study. After 4 weeks of supplementation or&#xD;
      control regiment, each subject will be exposed to clean air for 2 hours on the first day,&#xD;
      then ozone for 2 hours on the second day.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ozone pollution is a common problem across the world, including in the US. This proposed&#xD;
      study is to examine the efficacy of fish oil and olive oil in modulating cardiovascular and&#xD;
      pulmonary functions after ozone exposure. Results from this study will also increase our&#xD;
      understanding of how ozone exposure adversely affects the functioning of the human&#xD;
      cardiovascular and respiratory systems. This understanding may be especially important for&#xD;
      patients with cardiopulmonary diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 60 people will participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You should expect to be in this study for about a month, but your participation could&#xD;
      possibly last for 6 months. There are 4 sessions, including a consenting session (today)&#xD;
      which will last for about 4 hours. The two exposure-day sessions will last approximately 8-9&#xD;
      hours each. There will also be an approximately 3-hour follow-up visit the day after your&#xD;
      last exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What will happen if you take part in the study? Before you agree to participate in this&#xD;
      study, you must read the consent forms in their entirety. The research and medical staff will&#xD;
      then answer all your questions and explain all the risks involved in this study to your&#xD;
      satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You should have already undergone a general physical examination to ensure that you are a&#xD;
      suitable candidate for this study. If you are a female, you will be asked about your&#xD;
      menstrual history. For all other female participants, a pregnancy test will be performed&#xD;
      today, and this will be repeated on the exposure day if more than 7 days since last pregnancy&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting Day We will go over the study in detail so that you will know what we will expect&#xD;
      from you as a participant and what you should expect from us as investigators. If you agree&#xD;
      to participate in the study, you will sign all study consent forms and receive one set of&#xD;
      signed copies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a breathing test (spirometry). You will breathe through a filter into a plastic&#xD;
      device. Your lung function test results should meet certain criteria (Both Forced Vital&#xD;
      Capacity (FVC) and Forced Expiatory Volume at the 1st second (FEV1) are equal to and greater&#xD;
      than 80% of the reference value) to allow you to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will undergo a procedure for for induced sputum. If you are a non-producer or the quality&#xD;
      of the induced sputum sample that you produce does not meet the study criteria (we will know&#xD;
      the sputum quality in the next two days), we will exclude you from the study. If that&#xD;
      happens, you will be reimbursed for the time and procedures for the consenting session. If&#xD;
      you qualify, you will be given instructions to prepare for the exposure sessions. Then you&#xD;
      will be scheduled for the exposure sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be give dietary supplementation of fish oil, olive oil or placebo for 4 weeks.&#xD;
      Dietary and medication instructions will be given to restrict certain types of food and&#xD;
      medicines during the supplementation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure days We will call you a few days before the exposure session to remind you of your&#xD;
      scheduled visit. You should avoid smoke, fumes, alcohol, and strenuous exercise 24 hours&#xD;
      prior to all visits, and abstain from pan fried or grilled meat after midnight of the&#xD;
      exposure day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to eat a light breakfast and arrive at the EPA medical station by 7:30 am.&#xD;
      Please understand that it is very important that you arrive by this time in order for the&#xD;
      study team to process all of the samples and data. Please note that we may have to cancel&#xD;
      your participation if you arrive late.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to exposure, you will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have your vital signs checked (heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen&#xD;
           saturation level, and fill out a symptom questionnaire electronically).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have your heart rhythm recorded by a Holter monitor. You will have (10)&#xD;
           electrocardiogram (ECG) leads attached to your chest. It may be necessary to clean and&#xD;
           shave the areas of your chest where these leads will be placed. Excessive deodorant,&#xD;
           skin lotions, and body sprays may interfere with the function of some of these leads.&#xD;
           Therefore, we ask you to not apply these to your chest area on the day you report to the&#xD;
           HSF. The leads will be connected to 2 monitors (small recording devices about the size&#xD;
           and weight of a cell phone) to obtain readings of your heart rate and rhythm. It is&#xD;
           preferable that the electrodes will stay in place for approximately 2 Â½ days as you will&#xD;
           have this measured several times during the study, however, you will be given the option&#xD;
           to remove the electrodes by the end of each exposure day. You will be asked to recline&#xD;
           quietly for 30 minutes while collecting your heart rhythm. It is important that you do&#xD;
           not fall asleep during this 30-minute period. These measurements will allow us to&#xD;
           determine whether wood smoke exposure causes small changes in the ability of your&#xD;
           nervous system to regulate how your heart beats.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have the diameter of an artery in your upper arm measured by an ultrasound machine&#xD;
           (BAU). The ultrasound operator will scan your arm with a probe and then place a&#xD;
           tourniquet on your arm, much like a cuff used to measure blood pressure. Measurement of&#xD;
           the size of the artery will be made two times. First, you will be asked to rest quietly&#xD;
           for 15 minutes, and then the first 90 second scan will be performed. Then the blood&#xD;
           pressure cuff on your arm will be inflated for 5 minutes in order to temporarily stop&#xD;
           the flow of blood. You may feel sensations similar to that when your foot &quot;goes to&#xD;
           sleep&quot;, such as &quot;pins and needles&quot; and tingling. After the pressure cuff is released, a&#xD;
           second scan will be taken of the artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have your retinas imaged using an ophthalmic camera before and after each exposure, and&#xD;
           on the follow-up visit. You will be asked to place your chin on a rest in front of the&#xD;
           camera. We will take pictures of the inside of both of your eyes. Glasses or contacts&#xD;
           have to be removed for this test. Please bring your own contact lens container and&#xD;
           solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approximately 60 ml blood drawn (about 4 tablespoons) before and after each exposure,&#xD;
           and on the follow-up visit. We will test this blood to see if wood smoke affects the&#xD;
           ability of your blood cells to function. A small portion of the blood sample will be&#xD;
           used to measure the relative content of various fatty acids present in your blood. With&#xD;
           your permission, we also store some of the blood that we obtain during the study for&#xD;
           yet-to-be-determined tests in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a breathing test (spirometry).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enter the exposure chamber and be exposed to filtered air or ozone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the exposure, you will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â¢ Undergo exposure for 2 hours to either clean filtered air or ozone in the chamber. You will&#xD;
      receive clean filtered air on one day and ozone on the other day. You will not be given the&#xD;
      information of the sequence of the exposure. Chamber conditions will be at a comfortable&#xD;
      temperature and relative humidity. You will do mild exercise on a stationary bicycle in the&#xD;
      chamber every other 15 minutes alternating with resting period for a total of 1 hour of&#xD;
      exercise per chamber exposure. The target ventilation rate will be maintained at 20 L/min/ m2&#xD;
      and monitored by using pneumotach method. A study coordinator or other trained person will be&#xD;
      seated outside the chamber observing you at all times. During the exposure, your heart will&#xD;
      be monitored and the amount of oxygen present in your blood will be monitored by placing a&#xD;
      device (pulse oximeter) on your finger. If it appears you are experiencing significant&#xD;
      discomfort, breathing or heart problems, the exposure will be terminated immediately. In&#xD;
      addition, you may elect to terminate the exposure at any time for any reason. If you do so,&#xD;
      you will be paid in full for that day's session but will be ineligible for further&#xD;
      participation in the study and any payments you would have received for future participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately following the exposure, you will repeat the pre-exposure procedures and have a&#xD;
      low fat lunch brought by you.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once you complete the above procedures, you will have about 1-2 hour waiting time before&#xD;
           the next procedure. You can bring your personal laptop or books to use during that time.&#xD;
           You will not be able to eat any food during this break time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have samples of your airway secretions collected using the induced sputum procedure. You&#xD;
           will be asked to breathe in different saline solutions (up to 5%) to help you&#xD;
           expectorate. We will coach you on the procedure. First, you will gargle and clear your&#xD;
           throat, and the cough up samples from deep in your chest and spit them into a cup. Your&#xD;
           lung function will be monitored during the procedure. Food must be avoided for 2 hours&#xD;
           prior to this test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be assessed and discharged by the study personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up visit (about 3 hours) You will return to the HSF the next morning (approximately 18&#xD;
      hours after your 2nd exposure) and you will repeat the pre-exposure procedures.&#xD;
