  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility and clinical benefits of the&#xD;
      AMDS to treat patients with acute DeBakey type I dissections and/or intramural hematomas&#xD;
      (IMH) involving the ascending aorta and aortic arch through open surgical repair.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AMDS is designed to complement the replacement of the ascending aorta with conventional&#xD;
      surgical technique utilizing a conventional polyester graft. AMDS is constructed of an&#xD;
      uncovered Nitinol wire braided stent attached proximally to a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)&#xD;
      felt graft component. The PFTE felt graft component excludes the FL at the distal aortic&#xD;
      anastomosis and the wire stent re-expands the dissection flap within the arch and descending&#xD;
      aorta, which aims to treat malperfusion and promote positive remodeling of the aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DARTS I Feasibility, Safety and Performance trial is a prospective, non-randomized,&#xD;
      non-blinded, single-arm, multi-institutional Canadian study evaluating the feasibility and&#xD;
      safety of the AMDS graft. A goal of 30 subjects will be enrolled at 1 site in Germany.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrollment period will span a minimum of 3 months from Institutional Review Board (IRB)&#xD;
      approval and site activation. Candidates for this study are adults who require repair of an&#xD;
      acute DeBakey type I aorta dissection and/or intramural hematoma (IMH). Patients will be&#xD;
      consented pre-operatively and enrolled patients will be followed for approximately 5 years&#xD;
      after their AMDS implantation date. Data will be collected at 10 time points: baseline&#xD;
      (pre-operatively), discharge, 1 month post-operatively, 3 months post-operatively, and 6&#xD;
      months post-operatively, 1 year post-operatively and thereafter, annually, for a total of 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
