      Back on Track is a quasi-experimental, mixed-methods study of a unique natural experiment&#xD;
      that will answer the question: what is the comparative effectiveness of different payer or&#xD;
      health-system strategies that aim to prevent unsafe opioid prescribing? The State of Oregon&#xD;
      is enacting a Medicaid reimbursement policy to enhance access to evidence-based&#xD;
      non-pharmacotherapeutic treatment options while restricting reimbursement for opioids for&#xD;
      back pain. We will assess whether the policy decreases unsafe opioid prescribing and improves&#xD;
      patient outcomes compared with usual back pain treatment practices in a comparable state,&#xD;
      California, that is not changing Medicaid payment policy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Back pain is one of the most common reasons patients seek medical care, and it can have a big&#xD;
      impact on patients' quality of life and functioning. Patients and providers are becoming more&#xD;
      frustrated with common back pain treatments like the long-term use of opioid medications and&#xD;
      steroid injections, which have been shown to have limited long-term impact on patients' pain&#xD;
      and day-to-day functioning and can have safety risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The State of Oregon recently changed what back and neck pain treatments they cover for its&#xD;
      Medicaid enrollees. This started to affect those insured by Medicaid in July 2016 and was&#xD;
      implemented by January 2018. These changes ended payments for treatments like long-term&#xD;
      opioid therapy and injections. They also expanded coverage for nondrug treatments, such as&#xD;
      acupuncture, osteopathic or chiropractic manipulation, physical/occupational therapy, and&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy. While experts agree that opioid use must be reduced, Oregon is&#xD;
      among the first states to try such strong measures to promote nondrug treatments and prevent&#xD;
      the use of long-term opioid treatment for back and neck pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Oregon Medicaid reimbursement changes for back and neck pain treatment create the&#xD;
      opportunity for a &quot;natural experiment.&quot; In this mixed-methods, observational study, we will&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of the reimbursement changes by comparing outcomes among patients with&#xD;
      back pain in Oregon who will have access to these expanded nondrug treatments to similar&#xD;
      patients seen in comparable clinics in California where expanded services for back and neck&#xD;
      pain are not covered by the type of comprehensive payer incentive undertaken in Oregon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, we will use electronic health record, Medicaid claims data, and data obtained&#xD;
      from a longitudinal patient survey to assess the impact of the changes on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients' pain severity, pain related functioning, and satisfaction with care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients' use of pain-related health care services&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Opioid use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unintended consequences, such as the use of illicit drugs (While we expect the Oregon&#xD;
           Medicaid change to result in many positive changes, limiting the use of opioids and pain&#xD;
           reducing procedures like injections may motivate some individuals to use drugs that were&#xD;
           not prescribed by their doctor.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, we will use qualitative research methods to characterize the facilitators and&#xD;
      barriers experienced by patients, health care providers, and clinic administrators and staff&#xD;
      in adopting the Medicaid reimbursement changes and their satisfaction with the constellation&#xD;
      of available and utilized services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, this study has three components: 1) patient survey, 2) administrative data-based study&#xD;
      (data-only), and 3) qualitative evaluation. This record focuses on the component of the study&#xD;
      in which subjects are able to enroll - the patient survey.&#xD;
