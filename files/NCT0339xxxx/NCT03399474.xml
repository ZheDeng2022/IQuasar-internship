  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous Regional Anesthesia (IVRA) was first used by August Bier in 1908. This technique&#xD;
      is easy to administer, reliable and cost-effective for short surgical procedures of the&#xD;
      extremities performed on an ambulatory basis with success rate of approximately 95% - 100% .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lidocaine becomes the local anesthetic of choice for Intravenous Regional Anesthesia (IVRA)&#xD;
      because of the lack of cardiac toxicity and neurotoxicity. But, delayed onset of action, poor&#xD;
      muscle relaxation and lack of postoperative analgesia are the major limitations of this&#xD;
      technique. Accordingly, many additives have been tried to overcome this problem. Muscle&#xD;
      relaxants, ketamine,ketorolac, clonidine and opioids are examples of these adjuvants, and&#xD;
      their effects have been studied in detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ideal anesthetic agent for IVRA should have rapid analgesic effect to reduce tourniquet&#xD;
      pain and its effects should last longer enough after deflating tourniquet. To achieve this,&#xD;
      other drugs including narcotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ketorolac, clonidine,&#xD;
      nitroglycerin (TNG), dexmedetomidine, magnesium, and neostigmine were used in combination&#xD;
      with lidocaine in different studies. This study aims 1- To compare the anesthetic and&#xD;
      analgesic efficacy of Dexmedetomidine and lidocaine versus lidocaine only during IVRA (Bier's&#xD;
      block) and 2-To compare anesthetic and analgesic efficacy of different doses of&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine when used as adjuvants to lidocaine during IVRA (Bier's block).&#xD;

      Preoperative evaluation of the patients will be done including medical history, physical&#xD;
      examination, and laboratory investigations. Patients should be in fasting state for at least&#xD;
      8 h before surgery, and the visual analog scale (VAS) (from 0 to 10: 0 = no pain up to 10 =&#xD;
      severe pain) will be explained to the patients to express their pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On arriving at the operating room, routine intraoperative monitors will be applied, such as a&#xD;
      noninvasive blood pressure monitor, a five-lead ECG, and a pulse oximeter. Two (20 G) venous&#xD;
      cannulae will be inserted, one in the dorsum of the operative hand and one in the other hand,&#xD;
      for fluid infusion during surgery and for any intravenous medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be premedicated with IV 0.05 mg/Kg of midazolam. After the patient is taken to&#xD;
      the operating room, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), peripheral oxygen saturation (SPO2)&#xD;
      and heart rate (HR) will be monitored. The operative arm will be elevated for 2 minutes then&#xD;
      exsanguinated with an esmarch bandage. A pneumatic double tourniquet will be placed a round&#xD;
      upper arm, and the proximal cuff will be inflated to 250 mmHg. Circulatory isolation of the&#xD;
      arm will be verified by inspection, absence of radial pulse, and loss of pulse oximetry&#xD;
      tracing in the ipsilateral index finger. After the bandage is removed, 40 ml of the&#xD;
      respective solutions will be injected over 20 seconds by an anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sensory block will be assessed by pinprick performed with a 22-gauge needle every 30&#xD;
      seconds until the dermatomal sensory block of medial and antebrachial cutaneous, ulnar,&#xD;
      median and radial nerves achieved. Motor function will be assessed by asking the patients to&#xD;
      flex and extend his/her wrist and fingers and complete motor block will be noted when no&#xD;
      voluntary movement is possible. Sensory block onset time will be noted as the time elapsed&#xD;
      from drug injection to complete sensory block achieved in all dermatomes. Motor block onset&#xD;
      time is the time elapsed from injection of study drug to complete motor block. After complete&#xD;
      sensory and motor blocks is achieved, the distal tourniquet will be inflated to 250 mmHg, and&#xD;
      the proximal tourniquet will be released and the surgery will be s started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAP, HR and SPO2 level will be recorded before application of tourniquet and after the&#xD;
      application of tourniquet every five minute and were measured after release of the&#xD;
      tourniquet, and postoperatively at 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hr, 3 hr, 4 hr, 6 hr and 24 hours. Pain&#xD;
      due to the tourniquet will be ssessed with visual analogue scale (VAS) scores (0 = no pain&#xD;
      and 10 = worst pain imaginable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Levels of sedation will be assessed with the Ramsey sedation scale as follows: 1-patient is&#xD;
      anxious and agitated or restless or both, 2-patients is cooperative, oriented and tranquil,&#xD;
      3-patient responds to command only, 4-patient exhibits brisk response to light glabellar tap&#xD;
      or loud auditory stimulus, 5-patient exhibits a sluggish response to light glabellar tap or&#xD;
      loud auditory stimulus, and 6-patients exhibits no response .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both VAS and sedation levels will be recorded before and after the application of tourniquet&#xD;
      and during the operation (10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 min). When pain due to tourniquet was&#xD;
      &gt; 3 on the VAS, patients will be given nalbuphine 5 mg intravenously increments up to 0.1&#xD;
      mg/kg and total administered dose will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxygen will be administered with face mask if SPO2 is lower than 91%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the operation patients will be asked to qualify the operative conditions such&#xD;
      as tourniquet pain or incisional pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tourniquet will be not deflated before 30 min and was not inflated more than 1.5 hours.&#xD;
      At the end of the operation, the tourniquet deflation will be performed by cyclic deflation&#xD;
      technique (the tourniquet was deflated three times in a cyclic manner with 10 seconds period&#xD;
      of deflation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory recovery time will be documented (time elapsed after tourniquet deflation up to&#xD;
      recovery of pain in all innervated areas determined by pinprick test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor block recovery time will be noted (the time elapsed after tourniquet deflation up to&#xD;
      movement of fingers). Also, first analgesic requirement time will be noted (the time elapsed&#xD;
      after tourniquet release to the first patient request of analgesic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the postoperative period if patients starts to complain (VAS &gt; 3); rescue analgesia will&#xD;
      be given in the form of paracetamol (Perfalgan®) 1gm IV drip and/or diclofenac sodium&#xD;
      (Voltaren®) 75 mg IM, and/or nalbuphine 5 mg IV (with maximum daily dose of 2 mg/Kg/day) till&#xD;
      VAS ≤ 3.And total amount of nalbuphine administered in first 24 hours to each group will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first 2 hours in the post-anesthetic care unit and later in the surgical ward,&#xD;
      patients will be questioned for circumoral numbness and tingling, nausea and vomiting, skin&#xD;
      rash, tinnitus, gastric discomfort and other side effects are noted if encountered and MAP,&#xD;
      HR and VAS scores will be assed every 2 hours postoperatively during the first 24 hours.&#xD;
