      • Background Infertility is a frustrating disease that affects many couples around the world.&#xD;
      Although there are many etiologies responsible for infertility , there are about 15-30 % of&#xD;
      couples who suffer from what is called &quot;Unexplained Infertility&quot;. About 25% of infertility is&#xD;
      caused by ovulatory disorders. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies these ovulatory&#xD;
      disorders into 3 groups. Group II includes women with hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian&#xD;
      dysfunction (predominately polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)) In unexplained infertility,&#xD;
      basic investigations that are done first to reveal the cause of infertility reveal normal&#xD;
      findings. These basic investigations should provide evidence of ovulation, adequate sperm&#xD;
      production and patency of the fallopian tubes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, with these routine investigations and even with other more sophisticated&#xD;
      investigations it is hard to reveal all possible abnormalities. Therefore, unexplained&#xD;
      infertility appears to represent either the lower extreme of the normal distribution of&#xD;
      fertility, or it arises from a defect in fecundity that cannot be detected by the routine&#xD;
      infertility evaluation. Couples with unexplained infertility suffer from both diminished and&#xD;
      delayed fecundity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to absence of specific abnormality in cases with unexplained infertility, the management&#xD;
      is usually empiric. Suggested treatment regimens include intrauterine insemination (IUI),&#xD;
      ovulation induction with oral or injectable medications, combination of IUI with ovulation&#xD;
      induction, and assisted reproductive technologies (ART).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder affecting young women&#xD;
      of reproductive age with the prevalence ranging between 2% to 18% according to different&#xD;
      population and diagnostic criteria. It has been suggested that uterine blood flow is impaired&#xD;
      in women with PCOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ovulation induction (OI) is by far the most commonly used treatment for women with WHO group&#xD;
      II anovulation and clomiphene citrate (CC) has historically been the most used drug In many&#xD;
      fertility guidelines, CC is recommended as the first-line treatment for women with group II&#xD;
      anovulation or PCOS who wish to conceive. However, other guidelines recommend both CC and&#xD;
      letrozole as first-line treatments. It is hypothesized that CC resistance and failure are&#xD;
      related to anti-estrogenic effects of CC on the endometrium, cervical mucus, and uterine&#xD;
      blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each month, the human endometrium undergoes a series of distinct cyclical changes in&#xD;
      preparation to receive the developing blastocyst. Such changes necessitate well-controlled&#xD;
      dynamic remodeling of the endometrial microvasculature through the processes of angiogenesis&#xD;
      and arteriogenesis. Abnormalities of endometrial blood perfusion have been associated with&#xD;
      several menstrual disorders including: dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, intermenstrual bleeding and&#xD;
      endometriosis. So, adequate blood perfusion of the endometrium is considered an important&#xD;
      factor for what is called &quot;endometrial receptivity&quot;. So it is possible that women with&#xD;
      unexplained infertility have decreased uterine and endometrial blood perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following implantation, there are certain changes that occur in the endometrium and its&#xD;
      vasculature. These changes occur simultaneously with the trophoblastic invasion of the spiral&#xD;
      arteries, and any kind of abnormalities in these changes has been associated with&#xD;
      complications during pregnancy like: recurrent miscarriage, preterm delivery, intrauterine&#xD;
      growth restriction and pre-eclampsia. So, the condition of the endometrium is very essential&#xD;
      for successful implantation of the gestational sac and one of the most important factors&#xD;
      affecting the endometrium is its blood perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usual methods of assessment of endometrium like measurement of its thickness and&#xD;
      description of its appearance are considered poor indicators of successful implantation and&#xD;
      pregnancy.Other tools of investigations include: uterine artery Doppler and pulsed wave&#xD;
      Doppler. It was found that information revealed from uterine artery Doppler alone may not&#xD;
      represent the perfusion of the endometrium. Also, pulsed wave Doppler is used to examine the&#xD;
      smaller downstream radial and spiral arteries and this reveals information from single&#xD;
      vessels rather than from the endometrium as a whole. On the other hand, 3D Power Doppler is&#xD;
      claimed to be the best investigatory tool for the study of endometrial blood perfusion as it&#xD;
      is more sensitive to low flow and thus overcomes the problems of angle dependence and&#xD;
      background noise associated with both color and pulsed wave Doppler. In addition, whereas&#xD;
      color Doppler provides qualitative information, the 3D Power Doppler signal can be&#xD;
      subsequently analyzed to produce quantitative information through one of several computer&#xD;
      software packages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Hypothesis: Null hypothesis: There is no difference in endometrial thickness, 2D and 3D&#xD;
      Power Doppler indices between normal fertile women, women with unexplained infertility and&#xD;
      women with PCOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative hypothesis: There is a difference in endometrial thickness, 2D and 3D Power&#xD;
      Doppler indices between above-mentioned groups.&#xD;
