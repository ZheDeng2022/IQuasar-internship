      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new drug ONC201 have been shown to kill breast cancer and endometrial cancer cells in the&#xD;
      laboratory. The exact mechanism of action is not completely clear yet, but the ONC201&#xD;
      destroys the mitochondria inside the cells. Blocking mitochondrial activity may kill tumor&#xD;
      cells, which would shrink tumors. Researchers want to see if ONC201 helps shrink tumors of&#xD;
      certain breast or endometrial cancers and if that effect is maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if ONC201 shrinks tumors with a lasting effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older who have metastatic breast cancer (hormone-positive or&#xD;
      triple-negative) or metastatic endometrial cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;Heart, blood, and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;CT and bone scans&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;Review of medical report and tumor sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a tumor biopsy before starting treatment and after 5 weeks taking the&#xD;
      study drug. A scan or ultrasound may be used to guide the biopsy. Patients will receive local&#xD;
      anesthetic and a needle will remove a small piece of tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be done in 28-day cycles. Every day 1 of each cycle participants will repeat&#xD;
      most screening tests, will be seen by the physician and receive a supply of the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take the study drug by mouth once every 7 days. They will keep a diary of&#xD;
      when they take the drug and any side effects. During cycle 1, participants will get weekly&#xD;
      calls to discuss their health and symptoms. Images will be repeated every 2 cycles to&#xD;
      evaluate reponse to the treatment.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Advanced breast cancer and endometrial cancer have limited treatment options. Current&#xD;
           treatments provide a modest improvement in progression free survival but no treatments&#xD;
           improve survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ONC201 is the founding member of a novel class of anticancer drugs called imipridones.&#xD;
           The exact mechanism of ONC201 is unknown at this time, but preclinical data suggests&#xD;
           that it causes global downregulation of mitochondrial genes leading to mitochondrial&#xD;
           damage and ultimately non-apoptotic cell death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preclinical studies have demonstrated that ONC201 selectively kills various cancer&#xD;
           cells, including breast cancer cells (hormone-receptor positive cell lines, HER2+ cell&#xD;
           line as well as triple negative breast cancer cell lines) and endometrial cancer cells,&#xD;
           while having little effect on normal cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An on-going phase I study of ONC201 has demonstrated clinical benefit in some solid&#xD;
           tumors, including endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: To determine the progression free survival (PFS) at 8 months of ONC201 in&#xD;
           metastatic hormone receptor positive breast cancer (HR+BC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: To determine the overall response rate (ORR) of ONC201 in metastatic triple&#xD;
           negative breast cancer (TNBC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: To determine the ORR of ONC201 in advanced endometrial cancer (EC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1 (HR+BC) requires prior treatment with greater than or equal to 2 lines of&#xD;
           hormonal treatment. No prior treatment required for cohorts 2/3 (TNBC and EC).&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  All patients will receive ONC201 at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 625mg by&#xD;
           mouth every 7 days with each cycle being 28 days long. Patients will receive ONC201 as&#xD;
           long as they derive clinical benefit or toxicity becomes impeditive&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be evaluated for toxicity every 4 weeks by CTCAE v5.0 and for response&#xD;
&#xD;
      every two cycles (8 weeks) by RECIST 1.1.&#xD;

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ONC201 has the potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             ONC201, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with ONC201.&#xD;
             These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;

             breaking, crushing, opening or otherwise altering the product formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of ONC201 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and&#xD;
             because imipridone agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are&#xD;
             known to be teratogenic. Female patients must either be of non-reproductive potential&#xD;
             (i.e., post-menopausal by history: greater than or equal to 60 years old and no menses&#xD;
             for greater than or equal to 1 year without an alternative medical cause; OR history&#xD;
             of hysterectomy, OR history of bilateral tubal ligation, OR history of bilateral&#xD;

             to use contraception or abstinence during the study and for and for at least 4 weeks&#xD;
             after the final dose of any study-related medications. Male patients must use at least&#xD;
             two forms of contraception during the study and for and for at least 4 weeks after the&#xD;
             final dose of any study-related medications or have a partner who is not of&#xD;
             reproductive potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR COHORT 2: TRIPLE NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received chemotherapy in the previous 3 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin); other investigational agents within 3 weeks or a PD1/PDL1&#xD;
             agent within 4 weeks prior to first dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have undergone radiotherapy within 4 weeks of first dose of study&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of another invasive malignancy within the last 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with symptomatic brain metastases or leptomeningeal involvement. Patients&#xD;
             with asymptomatic or brain metastases that have been treated with radiation at least 4&#xD;
             weeks prior to first dose of study treatment are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to imipridones or other agents used in study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a mean QTcF interval of &gt; 500 msec or receiving therapeutic agents known&#xD;
             to prolong the QT interval&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of cardiac arrhythmias including uncontrolled atrial fibrillation,&#xD;
             tachyarrhythmias or bradycardia, history of congestive heart failure, or myocardial&#xD;
             infarction or stroke in the previous 3 months will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of gastrointestinal illnesses that would preclude the absorption of&#xD;
             ONC201, which is an oral agent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with bone metastases who have initiated denosumab or bisphosphonate therapy&#xD;
             within 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ONC201 has the potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             ONC201, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with ONC201.&#xD;
             These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with ONC201.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have known active Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR COHORT 3: ENDOMETRIAL CANCER:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed persistent or recurrent&#xD;
             advanced or metastatic invasive endometrial cancer (EC) for which standard curative&#xD;
             measures do not exist or are no longer effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease, per RECIST 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have at least one lesion deemed safe to biopsy and be willing to undergo&#xD;
             mandatory biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women with endometrial cancer must have had at least one prior line of therapy in the&#xD;
             metastatic/recurrent setting but there is no limit to the number of prior chemotherapy&#xD;
             lines. Patients are eligible if they have received treatment with immunotherapy, such&#xD;
             PD-1 inhibitors, PD-L1 inhibitors or CTLA4 inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate renal function, defined as serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 X upper&#xD;
             limit of normal (ULN), or measured creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60&#xD;
             mL/min/1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate hepatic function, defined as AST and ALT levels less than or equal to 3 X ULN&#xD;
             and total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 X ULN, unless known diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome, where&#xD;
             bilirubin less than or equal to 5 mg/dl will be permitted. Gilbert's syndrome will be&#xD;
             defined as elevated unconjugated bilirubin, with conjugated (direct) bilirubin within&#xD;
             the normal range and less than 20% of the total. Total bilirubin will be permitted up&#xD;
             to 5 mg/dL, if patients have historical readings consistent with...&#xD;
