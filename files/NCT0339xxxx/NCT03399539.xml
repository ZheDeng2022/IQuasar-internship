    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of venetoclax when given&#xD;
      together with ixazomib citrate and dexamethasone and to see how well they work in treating&#xD;
      patients with multiple myeloma that has come back. Venetoclax and ixazomib citrate may stop&#xD;
      the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used&#xD;
      in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Giving venetoclax together with ixazomib citrate and dexamethasone may work better&#xD;
      in treating patients with multiple myeloma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of venetoclax in combination with ixazomib&#xD;
      citrate (ixazomib) and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma (MM). (Phase&#xD;
      1) II. To evaluate therapeutic activity of venetoclax in combination with ixazomib and&#xD;
      dexamethasone in patients with relapsed MM. (Phase 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe toxicities associated with venetoclax, in combination with ixazomib and&#xD;
      dexamethasone in patients with relapsed MM. (Phase 1) II. To describe toxicities associated&#xD;
      with venetoclax, in combination with ixazomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed MM.&#xD;
      (Phase 2) III. To evaluate progression free survival following treatment with venetoclax,&#xD;
      ixazomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed MM. (Phase 2) IV. To evaluate&#xD;
      therapeutic activity of venetoclax in combination with ixazomib and dexamethasone in subset&#xD;
      of patients with relapsed MM and t(11;14) translocation. (Phase 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore levels of BCL-2 family member proteins (BCL-2, BCL-x, MCL-1) on bone marrow&#xD;
      biopsies using ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNASeq) and immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of venetoclax followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive venetoclax orally (PO) daily on days 1-28, ixazomib citrate PO once weekly&#xD;
      on days 1, 8, and 15, and dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 for courses 1-12. Courses&#xD;
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 or 6 months for 3&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
