  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to test the safety of combination treatment with Avelumab and&#xD;
      Decitabine in newly diagnosed AML patients who are unfit for intensive induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open label phase I study with expansion to evaluate safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of Avelumab in combination with Decitabine in patients with untreated AML, who&#xD;
      are unfit for intensive chemotherapy. Decitabine will be given 20mg/m2 IV day 1-5, every 28&#xD;
      days. Avelumab will be given at 10mg/kg IV (initial dose) day 1, every 14 days. Using a&#xD;
      standard 3x3 statistical design, protocol defined Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) will be&#xD;
      assessed. In expansion stage, we will perform an expansion cohort of 9 additional patients&#xD;
      using the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) established in the Phase I portion.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Cytologically or histologically confirmed diagnosis of AML (except M3 acute&#xD;
             promyelocytic leukemia) according to WHO classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Previously untreated AML except for hydroxyurea.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Age ≥18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the&#xD;
             use of avelumab in combination with decitabine in patients &lt;18 years of age, children&#xD;
             are excluded from this study but will be eligible for future pediatric trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Performance status (ECOG) of 0-2 (see Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Not considered candidates for intensive remission induction chemotherapy at time of&#xD;
             enrollment based on EITHER:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  75 years of age OR &lt;75 years of age with at least 1 of the following: Poor&#xD;
                  performance status (ECOG) score of 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Clinically significant heart or lung comorbidities, as reflected by at least 1 of:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤50%. Lung diffusing capacity for carbon&#xD;
             monoxide (DLCO) ≤65% of expected. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) ≤65% of&#xD;
             expected. Chronic stable angina or congestive heart failure controlled with&#xD;
             medication. Liver transaminases &gt;3 × upper limit of normal (ULN). Other&#xD;
             contraindication(s) to anthracycline therapy. Other comorbidity the investigator&#xD;
             judges incompatible with intensive remission induction chemotherapy. The enrollee&#xD;
             declines intensive remission induction chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Creatinine clearance as estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault (C-G) or other medically&#xD;
             acceptable formulas ≥30 mL/min.vii. Cytogenetic features justify hypo-methylating&#xD;
             agents as induction treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks (3months).&#xD;
&#xD;

             transformed to AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Hydroxyurea would be permitted for control of elevated WBC prior to treatment and can&#xD;
             be continued for the first 4 weeks of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Women of childbearing potential (not surgically sterile or one year postmenopausal)&#xD;
             must have a negative result for a serum pregnancy test before study drug&#xD;
             administration on cycle 1 day 1 (within 3 days). Women of childbearing potential (not&#xD;
             surgically sterile or one year postmenopausal) must use a highly effective method of&#xD;
             contraception and must agree to continue use of this method for the duration of the&#xD;
             study and for 30 days after discontinuation of study drug. Acceptable methods of&#xD;
             contraception include abstinence, barrier method with spermicide, intrauterine device&#xD;
             (IUD) known to have a failure rate of less than 1% per year, or steroidal&#xD;
             contraceptive (oral, transdermal, implanted, or injected) in conjunction with a&#xD;
             barrier method.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. The patient, if a man, is surgically sterile or, if capable of producing offspring, is&#xD;
             currently using an approved method of birth control and agrees to continued use of&#xD;
             this method for the duration of the study (and for 30 days after taking the last dose&#xD;
             of study drug because of the possible effects on spermatogenesis). Acceptable methods&#xD;
             of contraception include abstinence, female partner's use of steroidal contraceptive&#xD;
             (oral, implanted or injected) in conjunction with a barrier method, female partner's&#xD;
             use of an IUD known to have a failure rate of less than 1% per year, or if female&#xD;
             partner is surgically sterile or one year post- menopausal. In addition, male patients&#xD;
             may not donate sperm for the duration of the study and for 30 days after taking study&#xD;
             drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria&#xD;
        apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering&#xD;
             the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents&#xD;
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients should be excluded if they have had prior treatment with an anti-PD-1,&#xD;
             anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or any other antibody or drug&#xD;
             specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or immune checkpoint pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with known CNS involvement will be excluded because of poor prognosis and&#xD;
             concerns regarding progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the&#xD;
             evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because avelumab is an agent with the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with avelumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
             with avelumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#xD;
             or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) might be enrolled if the viral load&#xD;
             by PCR is undetectable with/without active treatment and absolute lymphocyte count &gt;=&#xD;
             350/ul.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients with a positive test for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBV sAg) or&#xD;
             hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV antibody) indicating acute or chronic&#xD;
             infection might be enrolled if the viral load by PCR is undetectable with/without&#xD;
             active treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients with active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that might&#xD;
             recur, which may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive treatment&#xD;
             including systemic corticosteroids, should be excluded. These include but are not&#xD;
             limited to patients with a history of immune related neurologic disease, multiple&#xD;
             sclerosis, autoimmune (demyelinating) neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, myasthenia&#xD;
             gravis; systemic autoimmune disease such as SLE, connective tissue diseases,&#xD;
             scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's, ulcerative colitis, hepatitis;&#xD;
             and patients with a history of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson&#xD;
             syndrome, or phospholipid syndrome should be excluded because of the risk of&#xD;
             recurrence or exacerbation of disease. Patients with vitiligo, endocrine deficiencies&#xD;
             including thyroiditis managed with replacement hormones including physiologic&#xD;
             corticosteroids are eligible. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other&#xD;
             arthropathies, Sjögren's syndrome and psoriasis controlled with topical medication and&#xD;
             patients with positive serology, such as antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-thyroid&#xD;
             antibodies should be evaluated for the presence of target organ involvement and&#xD;
             potential need for systemic treatment but should otherwise be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
             residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone&#xD;
             replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to&#xD;
             recur in the absence of an external trigger (precipitating event).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with&#xD;
             either corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other&#xD;
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or&#xD;
             topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses &lt;10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are&#xD;
             permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease. Patients are permitted to use&#xD;
             topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids (with&#xD;
             minimal systemic absorption). Physiologic replacement doses of systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroids are permitted, even if &lt;10 mg/day prednisone equivalents. A brief&#xD;
             course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for&#xD;
             treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction&#xD;
             caused by contact allergen) is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients who have had evidence of active or acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal&#xD;
             abscess, GI obstruction and abdominal carcinomatosis which are known risk factors for&#xD;
             bowel perforation should be evaluated for the potential need for additional treatment&#xD;
             before coming on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Prior organ transplantation including allogenic stem-cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Vaccination within 4 weeks of the first dose of avelumab and while on trials is&#xD;
             prohibited except for administration of inactivated vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Clinically significant (i.e., active) cardiovascular disease: cerebral vascular&#xD;
             accident/stroke (&lt; 6 months prior to enrollment), myocardial infarction (&lt; 6 months&#xD;
             prior to enrollment), unstable angina, congestive heart failure (≥ New York Heart&#xD;
             Association Classification Class II), or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring&#xD;
             medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Persisting toxicity related to prior therapy (NCI CTCAE v. 4.03 Grade &gt; 1); however,&#xD;
             alopecia, sensory neuropathy Grade ≤ 2, or other Grade ≤ 2 not constituting a safety&#xD;
             risk based on investigator's judgment are acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Other severe acute or chronic medical conditions including colitis, inflammatory bowel&#xD;
             disease, pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis or psychiatric conditions including recent&#xD;
             (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior; or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study&#xD;
             treatment administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results&#xD;
             and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for&#xD;
             entry into this study.&#xD;
