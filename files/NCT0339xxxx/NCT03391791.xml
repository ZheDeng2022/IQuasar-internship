  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who previously took part in an Adaptimmune study and received genetically changed T&#xD;
      cells (including but not limited to MAGE-A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T and MAGE-A4ᶜ¹º³²T) are asked to take part&#xD;
      in this long term follow-up study. Subjects will be asked to join this study once they&#xD;
      complete the parent interventional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find out if the genetically changed T cells that subjects&#xD;
      received in the parent study have any long-term side effects. No additional study drug will&#xD;
      be given, but subjects can receive other therapies for their cancer while they are being&#xD;
      followed for long term safety in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a period of 15 years starting from last administration of the genetically changed T&#xD;
      cells, subjects will visit their study doctor for a check-up and to have blood tests to look&#xD;
      for any changes that might have happened because of the genetically changed T cells.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-therapeutic, multi-center, long-term follow-up (LTFU) study of subjects who&#xD;
      have received lentivirus-mediated genetically engineered T Cell Receptors in an Adaptimmune&#xD;
      sponsored clinical trial. The study is designed in accordance with FDA and EMA guidance on&#xD;
      gene therapy trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves up to 15 years post-infusion monitoring of subjects who have been exposed&#xD;
      to lentivirus-mediated gene transfer in Adaptimmune clinical studies. The study will include&#xD;
      subjects who have received various T cell receptors including but not limited to&#xD;
      MAGE-A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T and MAGE-A4ᶜ¹º³²T. Subjects will undergo clinical evaluation (i.e., new medical&#xD;
      history, physical exam, adverse events, and exposure to mutagenic agents, anti-cancer&#xD;
      therapies and investigational products in other clinical studies) with careful attention to&#xD;
      adverse events possibly related to gene transfer or lentivirus-induced diseases. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected for evaluating persistence of cells with lentiviral vector&#xD;
      sequences, the detection of replication competent lentivirus (RCL), and chemistry and&#xD;
      hematology laboratory assessments. Subjects will be followed for survival.&#xD;
