      This study aims to explore the pathways and targets of regulating globin expression, which&#xD;
      might be related to Colla corii asini (CCA, E'jiao) treating anemia in pregnant women with&#xD;
      β-thalassemia. Firstly, ten pregnant patients who meet inclusion criteria will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either the treatment group or control group in a 1: 1 ratio. The patients in the&#xD;
      treatment group will be given 15 g of CCA daily for 4 weeks and followed up, while the&#xD;
      control group will be treated with nothing and followed up in the same period. The&#xD;
      transcriptional test and bioinformatics analysis would be conducted to detect and determine&#xD;
      the potential pathways and targets of regulating globin expression before and after the&#xD;
      treatment. Secondly, sixty pregnant patients who meet inclusion criteria will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either the treatment group or control group in a 2: 1 ratio. The treatment group&#xD;
      and control group respectively received the same treatment and follow-up regimen as the&#xD;
      transcriptional study mentioned above. According to the results of the transcriptional study,&#xD;
      the target gene signaling pathway molecules, Hb concentration, and the levels of α-、β-、γ- and&#xD;
      δ-globin will be detected and compared.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Thalassemia is a type of hemolytic anemia disease caused by genetic defect of synthesis in&#xD;
      one or more globin chains. Among all the single genetic disorders, thalassemia has the&#xD;
      highest incidence rate in the world and causes heavy burdens on public health system. In&#xD;
      China, the southern provinces suffer from high incidence of thalassemia, which is&#xD;
      particularly common in the population of Guangdong, Guangxi and Yunnan provinces.&#xD;
      Epidemiological studies showed that in Guangdong alone about 17.83 % of the 14,332 pregnant&#xD;
      women across 21 regions examined were diagnosed as carriers of thalassemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies showed that after pregnancy, anemia in β-thalassemia patients tends to turn&#xD;
      more serious, the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes accordingly increase. Currently, no&#xD;
      consensus has been reached in treating pregnant thalassemia patients due to lack of safe and&#xD;
      effective treatment. Regulation of globin gene expression is the key link of β-thalassemia&#xD;
      treatment, but the accessible western medicines have many limitations, including bone marrow&#xD;
      suppression, carcinogenicity and teratogenicity, and are not suitable for pregnant patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In China, Colla corii asini (CCA, E'jiao) is a gelatin-like traditional Chinese medicine&#xD;
      refined from donkey hide and has been widely used in clinical antanemic therapy for more than&#xD;
      2000 years. In the last decade, many studies had addressed the effect of CCA on the anemia&#xD;
      using modern pharmacological approaches. The results indicated that CCA contains collagen&#xD;
      protein,glycogen and a variety of trace elements, a variety of amino acids, etc. the main&#xD;
      components of CCA can promote hematopoiesis by a number of mechanisms which eventually&#xD;
      increase the peripheral erythrocyte counts and Hb concentration. Therefore, the investigators&#xD;
      proposed that the hematopoietic effects of CCA might also contribute to the treatment of&#xD;
      thalassemia with insuffcient or abnormal Hb concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our previous clinical study showed that CCA can significantly increase the level of&#xD;
      hemoglobin and adult hemoglobin (HbA,α2β2) in the pregnant women with β-thalassemia, it was&#xD;
      speculated that CCA might induce β globin gene expression, which would be more beneficial to&#xD;
      pregnant women than the γ globin gene inducer. But its regulatory pathway is not clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to explore the pathways and targets of regulating globin expression by&#xD;
      using the transcriptomics method, which might be related to CCA treating pregnant anemia in&#xD;
      β-thalassemia patients. And then the results of transcriptomics study will be further&#xD;
      verified by expanding the clinical samples and implementing cell experiments, aiming to&#xD;
      explore the mechanisms of CCA in treating β-thalassemia with pregnant anemia by regulating&#xD;
      globin expression.&#xD;
