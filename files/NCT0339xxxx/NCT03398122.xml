      the purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aptinib in patients with&#xD;
      advanced HCC&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HCC The is a common malignancy in the world, especially in China. Advanced HCC treatment is&#xD;
      difficult and the prognosis is poor, which is still a great challenge and threat to the&#xD;
      medical profession. The advent of the molecular targeted drug, Sola, has made the treatment&#xD;
      dilemma of advanced HCC a breakthrough, but the efficacy and economic health ratio is far&#xD;
      from satisfactory. After Sola, many new molecular targeted drugs were studied, but failed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although multiple treatment options, but for HCC Patient-recommended treatment programs&#xD;
      require systematic treatment and surgery, TACE , local ablation and radiotherapy and other&#xD;
      multidisciplinary means of combination, the selection of appropriate patients, appropriate&#xD;
      means and timing to achieve individualized treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Aptinib Union TACE can be generated through embolization and angiogenesis by the dual&#xD;
      target of vascular suppression;2. TACE induces hypoxia, leading to an increase in the number&#xD;
      of hypoxia-inducing factors that increases VEGF and PDGFR , while VEGF the and PDGFR may be&#xD;
      important factors that induce tumor recurrence by stimulating tumor angiogenesis.&#xD;
