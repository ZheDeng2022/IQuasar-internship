  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this imaging study is to evaluate and improve the treatment planning techniques&#xD;
      for abdominal radiation therapy. To accurately treat a tumor with radiation, Computed&#xD;
      Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) are used to distinguish a tumor from&#xD;
      normal, healthy tissue. However the quality of these images can be distorted by motion from&#xD;
      breathing. To decrease motion, a patient may be asked to hold their breath or compress the&#xD;
      abdomen, but currently there is no standard or best management option for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will explore the use continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), a pressurized&#xD;
      breathing mask, during MRI or CT imaging to decrease motion in the abdomen and produce higher&#xD;
      quality images. With these additional images, we will also explore the feasibility of&#xD;
      creating treatment plans using the CPAP MRI images alone.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will undergo both CT and MRI prior to abdominal radiation therapy and CBCT and&#xD;
      orthogonal kV/MV images prior to each treatment delivery. A two arm study will be performed&#xD;
      and patients will be enrolled into a given arm according to their eligibility. Arm 1 is for&#xD;
      patients that are either not eligible for CPAP or that are unable to tolerate CPAP. These&#xD;
      patients will undergo breath-hold and 4D imaging for both CT and MRI without CPAP. Arm 2 is&#xD;
      for patients that are eligible for CPAP and able to tolerate CPAP. These patients will&#xD;
      undergo breath-hold CT without CPAP, 4D-CT with and without CPAP and 4D-MRI with CPAP. Two&#xD;
      specific aims will be investigated. In Aim 1, we will explore the feasibility of using a&#xD;
      MRI-only in Radiation Oncology workflow. A probabilistic classification method will be&#xD;
      utilized to generate a pseudo-CT from MRI to support treatment planning and image guidance&#xD;
      for radiation therapy. The quality of the pseudo-CT will be evaluated by comparing it with&#xD;
      CT. In addition, the reverse mapping will be investigated to create pseudo-MRI from CBCT to&#xD;
      improve visualization of treatment targets and soft tissue prior to treatment delivery. In&#xD;
      Aim 2, we will evaluate the utility of CPAP as a novel motion reduction methodology for&#xD;
      patients with liver and pancreas cancer, to this end CT images with and without CPAP will be&#xD;
      used. The evaluation will be based on the changes of motion magnitude, the achievable&#xD;
      volumetric reduction in treatment target volumes, and doses to the targets and critical&#xD;
      organs.&#xD;
