  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with azacitidine (an FDA&#xD;
      approved drug for the treatment of MDS) and high dose ascorbic acid in patients with TET2&#xD;
      mutations. This approach is intended to enhance the enzymatic activity of TET2 protein, which&#xD;
      in term may help to improve counts and symptoms, related to Myelodysplastic Syndromes and&#xD;
      Acute Myeloid Leukemia. This combination is specific to individuals who carry this mutation.&#xD;

      Primary Endpoint To estimate the overall response rate (ORR) of the combination of standard&#xD;
      dose azacitidine and oral dose of ascorbic acid in patients with MDS, AML, and MDS /&#xD;
      Myeloproliferative Neoplasm (MPN) overlap with heterozygous TET2 mutations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The safety profile of the combination in the targeted patient population&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Response duration&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Overall survival of the treated population (compared to matched historical cohort of&#xD;
           patients treated with single agent Azacitidine)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The identification of biomarkers that predict response to the combination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This is an open-label, phase II study that will be conducted at Cleveland&#xD;
      Clinic, Taussig Cancer Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Azacitidine will be administered intravenously or subcutaneously at a fixed dose of&#xD;
      75mg/m2/day for 7 consecutive days, (allowing for weekends, and holidays) of each 28-day&#xD;
      cycle. Ascorbic acid will be administered orally daily at 1 g/day three days prior to start&#xD;
      azacitidine and then continues daily for a total of 28 days of each 28 day cycle.&#xD;
