      The study evaluates the safety and efficacy of intralymphatic allergen-specific immunotherapy&#xD;
      given to adolescents and young adults who are allergic to grass or birch pollen and have mild&#xD;
      or moderate asthma. Patients will be treated with three intralymphatic injections; 1000 SQ-U&#xD;
      x3 with 4-5 weeks interval, or placebo with 4-5 weeks interval. The patients receiving&#xD;
      treatment will be given a fourth injection one year after the initial injections. The study&#xD;
      is conducted in collaboration between Professor Lars Olof Cardell (ENT), prof Gunilla Hedlin&#xD;
      (Pediatrics) and prof Marianne van Hage (Immunology)&quot;.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      30 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis due to birch or grass pollen are included. Study&#xD;
      subjects are randomized to intralymphatic injections with placebo or ALK Alutard 5-grasses /&#xD;
      birch or placebo. The patients receiving treatment will be given a fourth injection one year&#xD;
      after the initial injections.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Symptoms Score After Nasal Allergen Challenge</measure>
    <time_frame>At inclusion (pre-treatment), 12 months after inclusion (after first pollen season) and for the active treated patients 24 months after inclusion (after the second pollen season).</time_frame>
    <description>0,1 ml of ALK Aquagen birch or timothy 10 000 SQU/ml is deposited in each nostril and allergy symptoms are recorded. Symptoms during NPTs were scored according to the Lebel scoring scale. Symtom scores at 5, 15, and 30 minutes after nasal administration of the allergenextract were summed to represent the symptom-score at each nasal challenge (at inclusion, 12 months after inclusion and for the active patients 24 months after inclusion). The scoring system identifies nasal, eye, and ear symptoms: rhinorrhea, nasal pruritus, nasal congestion, ocular pruritus, watery eyes, and itchy ears, each graded on a scale from 0 to 3 points, and a total score was summarized after subtracting the starting score (min score is 0 and maximum score is 54 + the number of sneezes). Higher scores mean worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change on Visual Analogue Scale (VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>At inclusion (pre-treatment), 12 months after inclusion (after first pollen season) and for the active treated patients 24 months after inclusion (after the second pollen season).</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment effect was evaluated by asking the patients to compare their allergic symptoms during the last pollen season with the pollen season before treatment on a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (unchanged symptoms, no improvement) to 10 (total symptom relief, complete recovery).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>At inclusion (pre-treatment), 12 months after inclusion (after first pollen season) and for the active treated patients 24 months after inclusion (after the second pollen season).</time_frame>
    <description>Difference before and after treatment in Quality of Life. Quality of life was assessed using the Juniper Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, giving a score ranging from 1 to 7, and a change in score of 0.5 points is considered clinically relevant. Lower value is considered worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Allergen-specific Serum Immunoglobulin E (IgE) Levels Compared to Before Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>At inclusion (pre-treatment), 12 months after inclusion (after first pollen season) and for the active treated patients 24 months after inclusion (after the second pollen season).</time_frame>
    <description>Allergen-specific IgE levels were measured by ImmunoCAP (Thermo Scientific, Uppsala, Sweden) for birch (t3) and timothy grass (g6) pollen according to the manufacturer's instructions. A cutoff level ≥ 0.35 kUA/L was considered positive.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Asthma Symptom Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>At inclusion (pre-treatment), 12 months after inclusion (after first pollen season) and for the active treated patients 24 months after inclusion (after the second pollen season).</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma control 4 weeks before follow-up was estimated with the asthma control test. The score is based on a questionnaire with 5 questions concerning the patients asthma. Each question can be given a score from 1 to 5 points. The answers for each question is added together, where a minimum score of 5 and a maximum score of 25 can be obtained. Higher scores indicate improved outcome and a score of 19 or less suggests poorly controlled asthma.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pulmonary Function Measurement (Spirometry)</measure>
    <time_frame>At inclusion (pre-treatment), 12 months after inclusion (after first pollen season) and for the active treated patients 24 months after inclusion (after the second pollen season).</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 were measured according to international guidelines and results presented in % of predicted values according to the patients height, gender, age and weight.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Airway Inflammation Assessed by Exhaled Nitric Oxide</measure>
    <time_frame>At inclusion (pre-treatment), 12 months after inclusion (after first pollen season) and for the active treated patients 24 months after inclusion (after the second pollen season).</time_frame>
    <description>Nitric oxide in exhaled air, p.p.b. were measured according to international guidelines, and higher values indicate worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Symptom and Medication-score</measure>
    <time_frame>At inclusion (pre-treatment), 12 months after inclusion (after first pollen season) and for the active treated patients 24 months after inclusion (after the second pollen season).</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Symptom scores and Medication score were calculated taking into account the frequency: daily (4 points); every second day (3 points); 1 to 3 days per week (2 points); occasionally (1 point); never (0 points), for the following symptoms: blocked nose, rhinorrhea, fatigue, sneezing, and asthma symptoms, and for the following medications used: local and systemic antihistamines, nasal steroids, asthma medication, and eye drops. A minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 20 points for symptoms and 16 points for medication could be obtained. Higher values indicate worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Response to a Bronchial Challenge With Methacholine</measure>
    <time_frame>At inclusion (pre-treatment), 12 months after inclusion (after first pollen season) and for the active treated patients 24 months after inclusion (after the second pollen season).</time_frame>
    <description>Methacholine challenge to test the bronchial hyperresponsiveness in the airways of the included subjects. The subject will inhale increasing doses of methacholine. Spirometry is performed before and between each inhalation. The cumulative dose of methacholine needed to elicit at 20% decrease in FEV1 (PD20) is reported. Lower values indicate worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Allergen-specific Serum Immunoglobulin (Ig) G and Ig4 Levels Compared to Before Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>At inclusion (pre-treatment), 12 months after inclusion (after first pollen season) and for the active treated patients 24 months after inclusion (after the second pollen season).</time_frame>
    <description>Allergen-specific IgG and IgG4 level was measured by ImmunoCAP (Thermo Scientific, Uppsala, Sweden) for birch (t3) and timothy grass (g6) pollen according to the manufacturer's instructions. A cutoff 2 mg/L for IgG and 0.05 mg/L for IgG4 was considered positive.</description>

        <title>Change in Symptoms Score After Nasal Allergen Challenge</title>
        <description>0,1 ml of ALK Aquagen birch or timothy 10 000 SQU/ml is deposited in each nostril and allergy symptoms are recorded. Symptoms during NPTs were scored according to the Lebel scoring scale. Symtom scores at 5, 15, and 30 minutes after nasal administration of the allergenextract were summed to represent the symptom-score at each nasal challenge (at inclusion, 12 months after inclusion and for the active patients 24 months after inclusion). The scoring system identifies nasal, eye, and ear symptoms: rhinorrhea, nasal pruritus, nasal congestion, ocular pruritus, watery eyes, and itchy ears, each graded on a scale from 0 to 3 points, and a total score was summarized after subtracting the starting score (min score is 0 and maximum score is 54 + the number of sneezes). Higher scores mean worse outcome.</description>

        <description>Allergen-specific IgG and IgG4 level was measured by ImmunoCAP (Thermo Scientific, Uppsala, Sweden) for birch (t3) and timothy grass (g6) pollen according to the manufacturer's instructions. A cutoff 2 mg/L for IgG and 0.05 mg/L for IgG4 was considered positive.</description>
        <time_frame>At inclusion (pre-treatment), 12 months after inclusion (after first pollen season) and for the active treated patients 24 months after inclusion (after the second pollen season).</time_frame>
        <population>4 left the study before analysis of results; 3 active were excluded after the first treatment period because of deviations from the treatment protocol, and 1 placebo left the study after the first treatment period, before the follow-up. 11 patients (6 active, 5 placebo) did not have full analysis data sets, see limitations section for details.</population>
