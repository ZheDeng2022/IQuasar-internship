  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the investigator Randomized and compare the efficacy of 3 types of metabolic surgery in the&#xD;
      treatment of type 2 diabetes in obese patients, one of them is SASI bypass which is a&#xD;
      modification of Santoro's operation by performing a loop rather than Roux-en-Y bipartition&#xD;
      reconstruction and the investigator are reporting the first comparative clinical trial as&#xD;
      regards the clinical results of the outcomes of SASI bypass as a mode of functional&#xD;
      restrictive and neuroendocrine modulation therapeutic option for obese type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      from 2011 to 2017, investigators Randomized and collect data for the 3 operations SASI bypass&#xD;
      , Mini gastric bypass and Sleeve gastrectomy ) about thorough history, clinical examination&#xD;
      and laboratory investigations including basic preoperative investigations, lipid profile,&#xD;
      thyroid and suprarenal hormonal evaluation. In addition, patients may undergo further&#xD;
      assessment for pulmonary functions or gastroesophageal disease including endoscope. .&#xD;
      Abdominal ultrasound was done to exclude gall stones and to evaluate the degree of fatty&#xD;
      liver. Reduction the size of fatty liver was done by putting all patients on low-calorie&#xD;
      protein diet for 6 weeks. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis started 12 h before surgery with&#xD;
      low molecular weight heparin subcutaneous injections . Preoperative data included age,&#xD;
      gender, initial weight, initial body mass index (BMI), obesity complications and treatment&#xD;
      medications used (chest problems, diabetes, arterial hypertension and cardiac ischaemia,&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, gall stones, urinary stress incontinence,&#xD;
      joint pain, depression, infertility and heart burn). Postoperative data included hospital&#xD;
      stay, early postoperative complications during the first month (e.g. fever, collection,&#xD;
      bleeding, vomiting, leak and port site problems .Long-term complications more than 1 month&#xD;
      after surgery (e.g. nausea, vomiting, reflux, stricture, intestinal obstruction ,&#xD;
      hypoalbuminemia , anemia and calcium or iron or vitamin D , vitamin B12 deficiency and),&#xD;
      excess weight loss and BMI were collected.&#xD;
