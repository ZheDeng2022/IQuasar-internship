    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label phase II study, assessing the efficacy of elotuzumab in&#xD;
      elderly patients with multiple myeloma undergoing peripheral stem cell autologous graft&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients of 65 years of age or older, intensive treatment (TI) with hematopoietic stem&#xD;
      cell autologous graft (ASCH) is not considered as the gold standard. Nowadays, given the rise&#xD;
      of new treatments, new studies assessing TI with ASCH in elderly, seem required. The&#xD;
      association bortezomib (VEL) - thalidomide (THAL) - dexamethasone (DEX) is considered as the&#xD;
      standard induction (Kumar, Flinn et al. 2012, Ludwig, Viterbo et al. 2013). However, more and&#xD;
      more strategies with immunotherapies are developed. Furthermore, it looks encouraging to use&#xD;
      several monoclonal antibodies at different clinical development levels. Thus, elotuzumab&#xD;
      (ELO) is an IgG1 (immunoglobulin gamma-1) (IgGκ) humanized monoclonal antibody directed&#xD;
      against SLAMF7. SLAMF7 is a glycoprotein expressed by myeloma cells and natural killer (NK)&#xD;
      but not by healthy tissues. Consequently, elotuzumab can kill specifically myeloma cells&#xD;
      without affecting healthy tissues (Hsi, Steinle et al. 2008). A phase I study assessed the&#xD;
      safety of ELO in association with VEL, REV (Lenalidomide) and DEX in induction first-line&#xD;
      treatment in elderly patients with median age of 67 years (Usmani, Sexton et al. 2015). There&#xD;
      were no significant increase of side effects with this association compared with side effects&#xD;
      usually reported with VEL, REV and DEX. Thus, adding ELO could lead to an increase of&#xD;
      response rate, with no increase of toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For more than 10 years, the standard intensive treatment associates a MEL (MELPHALAN)&#xD;
      conditioning (200 mg/m2) with a blood graft. In a recent study, almost all patients aged&#xD;
      between 65-69 and 70-74 years received MEL at 200 mg/m2. The adverse events rate was similar&#xD;
      between the different ages and a very low non-tied relapse mortality. Thus, in elderly&#xD;
      patients selected, the use of MEL at 200 mg/m2 seems sure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, it's widely admitted that the conditioning treatment should be based on an&#xD;
      efficient drugs association with a limited toxicity. Studies assessing consolidation&#xD;
      treatment with an association of new drugs are limited. Initial results suggest that the use&#xD;
      of new drugs after intensive treatment (IT) with ASCH should increase response rate and&#xD;
      improve progression-free survival and global survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study IFM 2016-03 is to assess intensive treatment (IT) with AHSCT&#xD;
      (Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) in elderly and to associate the&#xD;
      different steps (induction, high dose conditioning, consolidation) with immunotherapy. Given&#xD;
      the prior results of IFM and international studies, a VGPR (Very Good Partial Response) rate&#xD;
      of around 85% is expected.&#xD;
