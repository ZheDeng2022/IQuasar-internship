  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Binge-eating is characterized by recurrent episodes of eating large amounts of - typically&#xD;
      high calorie - foods, eating much more rapidly than normal and until feeling uncomfortably&#xD;
      full, as well as feeling disgusted with oneself, depressed, or guilty after those episodes.&#xD;
      Two eating disorders are characterized by binge-eating as central diagnostic criteria,&#xD;
      binge-eating disorder (BED) and bulimia nervosa (BN). Binge-eating episodes in BN, but not&#xD;
      BED, are typically followed by compensatory mechanisms such as self-induced vomiting, and BED&#xD;
      is typically associated with obesity, while BN is not. Behavior studies such as ecological&#xD;
      momentary assessment (EMA) research of affect in an individual's naturalistic environment&#xD;
      have shown that negative affect and negative urgency (the tendency to act rashly when&#xD;
      distressed) often precede binge-eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators want to answer the following questions: Can negative affect in BN and BED&#xD;
      be linked to 1) altered dopamine related brain reinforcement learning, 2) to food value&#xD;
      computation and cognitive control circuit function, and 3) can dopamine related brain&#xD;
      activation predict eating and negative affect, indicating a brain based neurobiological&#xD;
      vulnerability. Answering those questions will help to define binge-eating based on regulation&#xD;
      of brain reward, cognition, and emotion circuit function and point toward potential&#xD;
      psychopharmacological interventions to normalize brain function and behavior.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim 1: To test on two study days, one neutral affect and one negative affect day&#xD;
      (affect induction) whether negative affect alters brain reinforcement learning in a dopamine&#xD;
      system anchored taste reward learning paradigm (a task for prediction error and reward value&#xD;
      computation) during functional magnetic resonance brain imaging (fMRI). Hypothesis 1: In&#xD;
      response to negative and compared to neutral affect induction, binge eating disorder (BED)&#xD;
      and bulimia nervosa (BN) will show increased positive prediction error and taste valuation&#xD;
      regression with striatum and insula activation compared to obese (OB) and healthy control&#xD;
      (HC) groups. This will be an indication that negative affect excessively activates dopamine&#xD;
      related reward circuit response in BED and BN. Specific Aim 2: To study during a food choice&#xD;
      paradigm the effects of negative affect on brain circuitry for cognitive control and food&#xD;
      valuation. Specific Aim 2a: To study brain circuitry for food valuation in response to&#xD;
      neutral or negative affect. Hypothesis 2a: In response to negative and compared to neutral&#xD;
      affect induction, BED and BN groups will show greater striatal activation when rating food&#xD;
      for taste, compared to OB and HC. This will indicate that BED and BN are associated with&#xD;
      increased affect-regulated motivation to approach high calorie foods after negative affect&#xD;
      induction and compared to OB and HC. Specific Aim 2b: To study brain control circuitry during&#xD;
      food choice in response to neutral or negative affect. Hypothesis 2b: In response to negative&#xD;
      and compared to neutral affect induction, BED and BN groups will show increased insula and&#xD;
      striatal, but lower dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activation compared to OB and HC&#xD;
      groups. This will indicate that negative affect activates automatic food reward circuit&#xD;
      response, but reduces cognitive control circuitry during food choice in BED and BN. Specific&#xD;
      Aim 3: To test whether brain activation predicts food intake or negative affect. Specific Aim&#xD;
      3a: To test whether brain activation can predict food intake during a post-fMRI scan test&#xD;
      meal. Hypothesis 3a: On negative- versus neutral-affect days, BN and BED will select more&#xD;
      food in a post-fMRI scan test meal; lower DLPFC and higher striatal activation during food&#xD;
      choice, and higher (prediction error) taste reward activation in insula and ventral striatum&#xD;
      will predict greater food intake. Specific Aim 3b: To test whether brain activation during&#xD;
      reward learning or food choice predicts negative affect measured by EMA on the study day, as&#xD;
      well as measured between study days in the individual's naturalistic environment. Hypothesis&#xD;
      3b: Insula, ventral striatum and DLPFC activation (taste prediction error task, food choice&#xD;
      task) during the negative affect condition will predict the intensity of negative affect&#xD;
      immediately after fMRI, as well as intensity of negative affect episodes during the days&#xD;
      between brain scans in the individual's naturalistic environment, suggesting a&#xD;
      neurobiological affective vulnerability.&#xD;
