  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of dapivirine gel administered rectally to&#xD;
      HIV-1 seronegative adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to two groups: Sequence A or Sequence B. Participants&#xD;
      in Sequence A will receive 2.5 g of dapivirine gel administered rectally via an applicator,&#xD;
      followed by a 2- to 4-week washout period. Participants will then receive a second dose of up&#xD;
      to 10 g of dapivirine gel administered rectally via a coital simulation device. Participants&#xD;
      in Sequence B will receive up to 10 g of dapivirine gel administered rectally via a coital&#xD;
      simulation device, followed by a 2- to 4-week washout period. Participants will then receive&#xD;
      a second dose of 2.5 g of dapivirine gel administered rectally via an applicator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be in the study for approximately 1 month and will attend 7 study visits.&#xD;
      Study visits may include behavioral assessments, physical examinations, blood and urine&#xD;
      collection, throat and anorectal sample collection, and PK sampling.&#xD;
