  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate a pilot of clinic-based intervention of asthma&#xD;
      education. After a scheduled outpatient encounter for well-child care or asthma care has&#xD;
      concluded, a pediatric nurse will teach participants (children and their caregivers) about&#xD;
      asthma, provide clearly written information about how to manage asthma, and discuss how to&#xD;
      manage asthma at home with cooperation between caregivers and children. Families will also&#xD;
      receive current asthma prescriptions in clinic, and colored labels will be attached to&#xD;
      medications in order to match the color scheme of asthma action plans (green labels for&#xD;
      controller medications, red labels for rescue medications). Families will be followed for 3&#xD;
      months after the first clinic visit, including a follow-up visit in clinic 1 month later and&#xD;
      a follow-up telephone call 3 months after starting. The nurse will reinforce key educational&#xD;
      points and review medication use at the follow-up clinic visit. Families will also be invited&#xD;
      to complete an additional in-depth interview following the 1 month clinic follow-up. The&#xD;
      investigator hypothesizes that knowledge, self-efficacy, and reported adherence with asthma&#xD;
      medications will increase for both caregivers and children/adolescents following the&#xD;
      intervention and labeling of delivered medications. In addition, the investigator&#xD;
      hypothesizes that children/adolescents will have more symptom free days and improved control&#xD;
      following the intervention.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a clinic-based intervention of asthma education and medication&#xD;
      labeling to promote medication knowledge and self-efficacy for adherence among both&#xD;
      caregivers and children. Approximately 40 children with uncontrolled persistent asthma and&#xD;
      their caregivers will be enrolled prior to outpatient visits for asthma care (well child care&#xD;
      or asthma-specific visits; total of 80 participants). After the scheduled encounter with a&#xD;
      provider has concluded, enrolled dyads will receive an intervention of nurse-delivered asthma&#xD;
      education and medication labeling. Dyads will then be followed prospectively for 3 months&#xD;
      after the index visit. This follow-up period will include a clinic-based follow-up with a&#xD;
      repeat of the intervention (1 month after enrollment, consistent with the follow-up interval&#xD;
      suggested by national guidelines for uncontrolled asthma) and a second follow-up by telephone&#xD;
      (2 months after clinic follow-up). Families will be invited to complete an additional&#xD;
      in-depth interview following the 1 month clinic follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children and adolescents 7-14 years of age will be screened for eligibility at a single&#xD;
      ambulatory care location: the Golisano Children's Hospital Pediatric Practice, a National&#xD;
      Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) accredited patient centered medical home (PCMH) in&#xD;
      urban Rochester, New York. The investigators plan to enroll a convenience sample of 40 dyads&#xD;
      of caregivers/children (total of 80 subjects) over an 8 month period. Children and&#xD;
      adolescents will be enrolled equally from two age-based categories (7-10 years, 11-14 years).&#xD;
      The range of child/adolescent ages is intended to select families with a range of shared&#xD;
      responsibility for asthma medication use between the caregiver and child/adolescent. Some&#xD;
      children independently use medications as early as six years old. On average, children bear&#xD;
      half of the responsibility for controller medication use by age 11 years and have more&#xD;
      responsibility than caregivers after age 13 years. Given these data, the specified age-based&#xD;
      sub-groups are structured to reflect family dynamics in which children have &lt;50% of&#xD;
      responsibility for medications (7-10 years old) and ≥50% of responsibility for medications&#xD;
      (11-14 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Procedures: Screening will occur in a rolling fashion from January 2018 through&#xD;
      August 2018. The investigators will identify potentially eligible children through a weekly&#xD;
      review of pediatric clinic patients ages 7-14 years old who are (1) scheduled for well-child&#xD;
      or asthma care over the following week, (2) have persistent asthma on their problem list, (3)&#xD;
      have a current (within the last year) prescription for an inhaled controller medication, and&#xD;
      (4) are covered by Medication or a Medicaid managed care program. After the reports are&#xD;
      furnished, Dr. Frey will conduct a brief review of the patient's chart to determine whether&#xD;
      key eligibility criteria are met (no known language barriers, no other significant medical or&#xD;
      developmental conditions). Remaining eligibility criteria (i.e. determination of&#xD;
      persistent/uncontrolled asthma per NHLBI guidelines) will be assessed during a single&#xD;
      screening phone call prior to the scheduled visit, or by approaching caregivers at the time&#xD;
      of scheduled visits if we are unable to reach caregivers by phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Assessment: The baseline survey assessment will be conducted following enrollment by&#xD;
      the team research assistant within a private space in the clinic. All survey instruments will&#xD;
      be available in English, and questions will be read aloud to the caregiver and child. If the&#xD;
      baseline semi-structured survey is not completed before the provider encounter, caregivers&#xD;
      will be given the option to complete the baseline either (a) before leaving clinic, or (b)&#xD;
      over the telephone; completion in the clinic will be preferred so that children/adolescents&#xD;
      can be separately interviewed in the presence of their caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication Selection and Delivery: Providers will be notified that their patients are&#xD;
      enrolled into the program, and will be tasked with determining whether any changes in daily&#xD;
      controller medications are indicated. The provider will electronically transmit prescriptions&#xD;
      for both rescue and controller medications to the Strong Outpatient Pharmacy, located within&#xD;
      the same building as the Pediatric Practice. All asthma prescriptions will be filled at this&#xD;
      pharmacy during the trial in order to ensure that medications will be available for labeling&#xD;
      in clinic, and parents will be informed of this during the consent process. The research&#xD;
      assistant will call the pharmacy to notify them of new prescriptions; once these asthma&#xD;
      prescriptions are filled, they pharmacy will send them to the Pediatrics Practice via the&#xD;
      institution's pneumatic tube system. Any prescription medications that are not directly&#xD;
      related to asthma management (including adjuvant therapies for allergic rhinitis) would be&#xD;
      sent to the pharmacy of their choosing for normal processing and patient pick-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nurse-delivered Education: The nurse will give the educational intervention after the&#xD;
      provider encounter concludes. Nurses will be trained in intervention delivery and national&#xD;
      asthma guidelines by Dr. Frey and Cindy Trubisky, Senior Director of Health Education for the&#xD;
      American Lung Association (ALA) in Rochester, NY. This intervention will be directed toward&#xD;
      both the caregiver and the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The nurse will give the parent and child a brief, scripted overview of asthma, and&#xD;
           discuss asthma control, asthma triggers, and indications for using inhaled controller&#xD;
           vs. rescue medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Parents will be given simple, written information about asthma and asthma management&#xD;
           designed for low health-literacy audiences, specifically written at or below 6th grade&#xD;
           reading levels, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Information on appropriate metered dose inhaler (MDI)/ spacer technique&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. An updated asthma action plan, with clear indications for when to use each inhaled&#xD;
                medication (i.e., controller vs. rescue medications).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. A list of other local asthma resources and smoking cessation resources (as&#xD;
                appropriate) will be given to caregivers&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The nurse will provide colored medication labels to distinguish controller from rescue&#xD;
           medications, following the action plan color scheme (green labels for controller&#xD;
           medications, red labels for rescue medications). These labels will be applied to&#xD;
           medications by the child/adolescent in clinic under nurse supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. If medications are not filled in the Strong Outpatient Pharmacy and thus not&#xD;
                available during the educational session, labels and instructions will be provided&#xD;
                for patients to label medications at home. Care coordinators will follow-up with&#xD;
                families to ensure appropriate labeling in this situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Teach-back methods will be used to elicit understanding of correct indications of&#xD;
                use for each medication (patient and caregiver).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The nurse will demonstrate the technique for MDI medications using a spacer, with&#xD;
           teach-back performed by both the patient and caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. They will discuss age-appropriate caregiver and child responsibility for asthma&#xD;
           management within the family, with an overview of transitioning responsibility designed&#xD;
           to reinforce the cooperative participation of both patients and caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patients will be asked to make a 1 month follow-up appointment for asthma care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Care Coordination: Pediatric practice care coordinators will contact all enrolled patient&#xD;
      families by telephone 1 week prior to the scheduled follow-up appointment. In addition to&#xD;
      functioning as a personalized reminder of the upcoming appointment, this phone call will also&#xD;
      allow care coordinators to identify any surmountable barriers to scheduled care and remind&#xD;
      families to bring all of the child's asthma medications to the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Assessments: The study, including all follow-up assessments, will continue until&#xD;
      the end of the 2018 calendar year. After the baseline assessment, each patient will have two&#xD;
      additional follow-ups. The first will be completed in clinic, approximately 1 month (~4-6&#xD;
      weeks) after the baseline visit. As all enrolled patients will have symptomatic or poorly&#xD;
      controlled persistent asthma, this follow-up interval is appropriate and supported by NHLBI&#xD;
      guidelines.(2) A brief follow-up survey will be conducted prior to the provider encounter,&#xD;
      and will include a repeat assessment of key measures from the baseline assessment. Additional&#xD;
      asthma education will be repeated at this clinic visit, with a specific emphasis on&#xD;
      reinforcing both the medication teaching and the importance of dyadic co-management. Asthma&#xD;
      medication refills will be delivered to clinic and labeled with stickers as necessary. The&#xD;
      second follow-up will occur approximately 2 months after the follow-up clinic visit (3 months&#xD;
      after baseline), and will be a semi-structured interview conducted over the phone by the&#xD;
      research assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-depth Interviews: During the clinic follow-up, caregivers and children will be invited to&#xD;
      separately participate in in-depth interviews before leaving clinic; this use of qualitative&#xD;
      research methods will allow for an enhanced understanding of family behaviors around&#xD;
      medication management. The interview guide will specifically explore respondent thoughts on&#xD;
      medication identification, the parent-to-child transfer of responsibility for medication use,&#xD;
      and the usefulness of different intervention components. Interviews will be conducted in&#xD;
      clinic if possible or over the phone if necessary; audio recordings will be transcribed.&#xD;
      Thematic analysis will be conducted on interview transcripts until theoretical saturation is&#xD;
      achieved within each subgroup of child/adolescent ages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compensation: Each participating caregiver/child dyad will receive $25 after completion of&#xD;
      the initial baseline assessment and clinic visit in the form of a prepaid debit card.&#xD;
      Participants will be paid an additional $25 after each follow-up assessment (one in clinic,&#xD;
      one by phone), and a final payment of $25 will be available for any dyads that decide to&#xD;
      participate in optional qualitative data collection (in-depth interviews). After the&#xD;
      telephone follow-up, payment will be sent via mail. Total payment will be no more than $100&#xD;
      per dyad.&#xD;
