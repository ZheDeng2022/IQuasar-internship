      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many people suffer from diarrhea every year. In the United States, it leads to about 130,000&#xD;
      hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths a year. Researchers want to test a tool that may show them&#xD;
      what germs cause diarrhea. It is a simple paper strip test and doesn t require electric&#xD;
      power. This may make it easier for health care workers to more quickly fight diarrheal&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test a tool that may detect what germs cause diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People already enrolled in an active NIH protocol who have diarrhea&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 1 or 2 studies. They will give information about their symptoms,&#xD;
      current medicines, and basic personal data. They will give a stool sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part of each sample will be tested in a lab. The rest will be stored indefinitely. No&#xD;
      personal data will be connected to the samples. The stored samples may be used in future&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive test results will be reported to a participant s primary doctor&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cross-sectional study to validate a new, simple, rapid and affordable point-of-use&#xD;
      pathogen identification research tool (hence forth referred to as the &quot;tool&quot;) of diarrheal&#xD;
      diseases for potential use in resource limited settings in the future. The tool was developed&#xD;
      under the terms of a National Institutes of Health (NIH) approved Clinical CRADA between NINR&#xD;
      and GoDx, Inc. The sensitivity and specificity of the tool in identifying several common&#xD;
      gastrointestinal (GI) pathogens in stool will be examined in participants with diarrhea. The&#xD;
      proposed validation study will constitute the initial assessment of the tool in a healthcare&#xD;
      environment. Once the detection validity and technical performance of the tool have been&#xD;
      evaluated in this context, the tool will be further tested in low resource healthcare&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be recruited from the Washington, DC, metropolitan area using&#xD;
      standard NIH recruitment practices, as well as from among participants in two existing&#xD;
      protocols (09-NR-0064, 12-NR-0195) which recruit and consent research participants with GI&#xD;
      disorders and diseases. Lastly, participants enrolled on other NIH protocols will be&#xD;
      recruited. Appropriate stool samples may also be sequestered from an exempt repository&#xD;
      protocol (09-NR-N228). All ages, ethnicities and both sexes will be considered for inclusion&#xD;
      in this study. The study population would reflect the demographics of the greater Washington&#xD;
      DC metropolitan area. Externally recruited participants and participants recruited from&#xD;
      existing protocols will be asked to supply stool samples. A total of 800 samples from&#xD;
      participants with diarrhea will be included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool samples will be collected from participants with diarrhea for which pathogen testing&#xD;
      using the NIH standard of care, BioFire FilmArray GI Pathogen Panel (FDA approved PCR based&#xD;
      pathogen diagnostic) by the Department of Laboratory Medicine (DLM) is indicated. Collected&#xD;
      stool samples will be tested for pathogens causing GI disease, using the FilmArray GI panel&#xD;
      by the DLM. Technicians in the NINR laboratories will test aliquots from the same stool&#xD;
      samples using our tool. The tool has been designed for detection of the most common diarrhea&#xD;
      causing pathogens. Of primary interest for this study are: Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli&#xD;
      - EPEC, Clostridium difficile C. difficile, Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli - EAEC, and&#xD;
      Campylobacter spp. Pathogens of secondary interests, but for which the study is not&#xD;
      specifically powered, will also be included and are: Shigella sp., Shiga Toxin-Producing&#xD;
      Escherichia coli - STEC, Salmonella spp., and Cryptosporidium spp. Participants will not&#xD;
      receive results from the tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The percent sensitivity (ability to make the correct positive identification), specificity&#xD;
      (ability to make the correct negative identification) and 95% confidence intervals will be&#xD;
      statistically determined by comparing the results yielded by the tool and the FilmArray GI&#xD;
      panel. Controlled laboratory experiments suggest &gt;90% specificity and sensitivity of the tool&#xD;
      for the detection of the specified pathogens.&#xD;

                  documented diarrhea defined as one or more loose or watery stools per day as&#xD;
                  defined by criteria a or b below:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Cases of acute diarrhea (i.e., diarrhea which is currently active or was&#xD;
                       experienced up to one day prior to sampling or still active during sampling)&#xD;
                       will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Cases of persistent diarrhea (i.e., diarrhea which is chronic or&#xD;
                       chronic-intermittently, i.e., once a week or more, experienced for at least&#xD;
                       2 to 4 weeks prior to sampling), will be included. In the case of chronic&#xD;
                       diarrhea, diarrhea does not have to be active on the day of, or immediately&#xD;
                       prior to (i.e., one day) sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Current enrollment in an active NIH protocol or enrollment in 12-NR-0195.&#xD;
