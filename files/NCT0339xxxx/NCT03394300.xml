    <textblock>
      High myopia or pathological myopia is associated with elongation of axial length longer than&#xD;
      26 mm or refractive error at least-6 diopter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High myopia is one of the most prevalent refractive condition globally with a higher risk of&#xD;
      other eye conditions Moreover in high myopic eyes the incidence of cataract is significantly&#xD;
      higher than in non myopic eyes and the progression is also faster.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculation of IOL in high myopic eyes remains a challenge often leading to unexpected&#xD;
      postoperative hyperopia the main potential sources of errors in IOL calculation for high&#xD;
      myopic eyes include AL measurement &amp; IOL constants used &amp;IOL power calculation formula used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      investigators suspect that the SRK I1 formula is inaccurate for myopic eyes, and that new&#xD;
      formulas are needed, taking into account all those factors that make up the dioptric power of&#xD;
      an eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Formulas for IOL power calculation had past four generations, first generation formulas were&#xD;
      theoretical and based on the same fundamental constant with no respect to anterior chamber&#xD;
      depth. Since then, Binkhorst, Holladay, Hoffer and Shammas had refined the existing&#xD;
      theoretical formulas where each of them developed his regression formula based on analysis of&#xD;
      their previous IOL cases .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work was amalgamated in 1980 and yielded the Sanders Retzlaff Kraff I (SRKI) formula The&#xD;
      second generation was designed by combining linear regression analysis and stepwise&#xD;
      adjustment for long and short eyes according to anterior chamber depth .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third and fourth generation formulas, started by Holladay in 1988, all aimed at better&#xD;
      calculation of the IOL power in eyes with extreme axial length where another term had&#xD;
      appeared which is IOL specific anterior chamber depth .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The accuracy of third and fourth generation formulas for IOL calculation in patients with&#xD;
      high axial myopia had not been fully evaluated For that, the need for more studies conducted&#xD;
      to evaluate such accuracy is crucial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted to evaluate the accuracy of different formulas used for IOL&#xD;
      power calculation in patients with high axial myopia undergoing cataract surgery&#xD;
