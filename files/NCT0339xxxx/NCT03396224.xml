      The objective of this post-market clinical follow-up study is to confirm the safety and&#xD;
      performance of the Avenir® Cemented Hip stem when used in primary total hip arthroplasty.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, non-controlled post-market clinical follow-up study to&#xD;
      fulfill the post market surveillance obligations according to Medical Device Directive and&#xD;
      MEDDEV 2.12-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to confirm the safety and performance of the Avenir Cemented&#xD;
      Hip Stem when used in primary total hip arthroplasty at 6 weeks to 6 months, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7&#xD;
      and 10 years post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Avenir Cemented Hip Stem is a straight double-tapered stem offering 9 standard and 9&#xD;
      lateralized versions, the same as the uncemented version, the Avenir-Mueller Stem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be evaluated by monitoring the frequency and incidence of adverse events and&#xD;
      through radiographic review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performance will be based on the implant survival, overall pain and functional performances,&#xD;
      subject quality-of-life and radiographic parameters of study subjects who received the&#xD;
      Avenir® Cemented Hip stem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implant survival will be based on removal or intended removal of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 130 patients will be enrolled into the study at up to 4 sites.&#xD;

    <measure>The results of the hip surgery will be determined by the Harris Hip Score</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Harris Hip Score is a questionnaire filled by the surgeon with the patient who received a hip implant. The domains covered are pain, function, absence of deformity, and range of motion. The pain domain measures pain severity and its effect on activities and need for pain medication.&#xD;
The function domain consists of daily activities (stair use, using public transportation, sitting, and managing shoes and socks) and gait (limp, support needed, and walking distance). Deformity takes into account hip flexion, adduction, internal rotation, and extremity length discrepancy. Range of motion measures hip flexion, abduction, external and internal rotation, and adduction.&#xD;
There are 10 items. The score has a maximum of 100 points (best possible outcome) covering pain (1 item, 0-44 points), function (7 items, 0-47 points), absence of deformity (1 item, 4 points), and range of motion (2 items, 5 points).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The patient's quality-of-life will be determined by the EQ-5D score</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for measuring health status. It is made up for two components.&#xD;
The description part: health status is measured in five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Mobility dimension asks about the person's walking ability. Self-care dimension asks about the ability to wash or dress by oneself. Usual activities dimension measures performance in &quot;work, study, housework, family or leisure activities&quot;. In pain/discomfort dimension, it asks how much pain or discomfort they have. In anxiety/depression dimension, it asks how anxious or depressed they are.&#xD;
Visual analogue scale: The patient marks his health status on the day of the interview on a 20 cm vertical scale with end points of 0 and 100. The bottom rate (0) corresponds to &quot; the worst health you can imagine&quot;, and the highest rate (100) corresponds to &quot;the best health you can imagine&quot;.</description>
