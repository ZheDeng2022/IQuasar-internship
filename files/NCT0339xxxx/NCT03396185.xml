  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the relapse free survival of patients who have&#xD;
      EGFR-mutant stage IIIA-IIIB Non-small Cell Lung Cancer and receive Icotinib as consolidation&#xD;
      therapy after synchronous or sequential chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, single arm, open label and prospective clinical study. Patients who&#xD;
      have EGFR-mutant stage IIIA-IIIB and unresectable lung adenocarcinoma will receive Icotinib&#xD;
      as consolidation therapy after synchronous or sequential chemoradiotherapy. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this study is relapse free survival. The secondary objectives are overall&#xD;
      survival, the frequency of adverse events and patients' quality of life.&#xD;
