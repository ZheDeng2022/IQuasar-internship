  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical significance and current evidence:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation dermatitis occurs commonly in patients receiving chemoradiation for nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      cancer; 50 to 60% develop grade 2 or higher dermatitis. This can result in significant&#xD;
      morbidity, reduced aesthetic appearance, decrease in quality of life and delays in treatment.&#xD;
      Current literature does not conclusively support the use of one agent over another for&#xD;
      prevention of radiation dermatitis. The choice of agents used in clinical practice is highly&#xD;
      variable, with aqueous agents being one of the commonest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate if the investigational product (StrataXRT), a&#xD;
      silicone-based gel, is superior to standard clinical practice in prevention of grade 2 or&#xD;
      higher acute dermatitis in patients receiving chemoradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted using a prospective, double-blind randomized control trial in 2&#xD;
      institutions. Each arm will receive standard radiation to a total dose of 70 Gray (Gy) with&#xD;
      concurrent chemotherapy. The primary objective is to compare the prevention of dermatitis and&#xD;
      the primary endpoint is reached when grade 2 or higher dermatitis according to the Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 scale occurs. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives will be evaluation of the time to onset of dermatitis, the time to complete&#xD;
      recovery from dermatitis and the degree of pain. Assessment of the patient's skin will be&#xD;
      done at baseline, weekly during treatment, 1 week post treatment and unless the skin has&#xD;
      resolved to baseline then every week up until 6 weeks post-treatment, which will mark the end&#xD;
      of follow-up. The safety end-point is reached when grade 4 dermatitis occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to demonstrate a 30% reduction in the incidence of grade 2 or higher&#xD;
      dermatitis with StrataXRT. Using a 2-sided test at significance level 0.05 to detect the&#xD;
      difference with a power of 80%, the investigators envisage a recruitment of 100-150 patients&#xD;
      in total. The study duration is estimated to be 2 years.&#xD;
