  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Motiview, an activity healthcare solution by Motitech, is finding solutions for elderly and&#xD;
      people with dementia by reducing unnecessary emergency department visits, preventing&#xD;
      falls/fall-injuries, improving management of complex health conditions, and improving brain&#xD;
      health/cognitive fitness. Motiview is based on the premise that many of the challenges faced&#xD;
      by this population may be caused by inactivity. The solution needs to effectively motivate&#xD;
      them to be active year round. It also needs to accomplish this without increasing the&#xD;
      resources within the health system. Motiview stimulates elderly people and people with&#xD;
      dementia to increase their physical activity and cognitive training. By using videos,&#xD;
      music/sound, the user can take a virtual bicycle trip through familiar surroundings and&#xD;
      memories while facilitating activity participation and adherence in the older adult. Motiview&#xD;
      is coupled to a mobile user-adapted cycle-trainer (TheraTrainer) that elicits physical&#xD;
      activity as the individual pedals the trip. The unique part is adapting films and music&#xD;
      according to the users' wishes and memories. By lessening the perceptions of difficulty,&#xD;
      monotony, and discomforts associated with physical activity, participation and the experience&#xD;
      of physical activity is enhanced. The research protocol of this project is designed to&#xD;
      document the added value of Motiview for achieving physical activity participation. The&#xD;
      hypothesis being that TheraTrainer bicycles will provide more activity when used with the&#xD;
      video/audio overlay. Qualitative data will be gathered on the social aspects and reminiscence&#xD;
      observed with the video/audit overlay from clients, care givers and staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information about Motiview can also be found on the website at https://www.motitech.no/en&#xD;

      Implementation will be conducted in two settings (Geriatric Day Hospital (GDH) Elisabeth&#xD;
      Bruyere Hospital and the Day Treatment Centre (DTC) Baycrest Health Sciences). The settings&#xD;
      selected have similar client profiles in terms of age, frailty, cognition, etc. Three subject&#xD;
      groups will be included to obtain a holistic understanding of the use of this technology:&#xD;
      geriatric program clients (clients) and their carers (carer) and staff (staff). All subjects&#xD;
      (clients, carers and staff) will consent to participate prior to continuing with study&#xD;
      involvement as documented below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Baycrest -&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clients&#xD;
&#xD;
      DTC clients will undergo their usual intake assessment conducted by the DTC clinical team.&#xD;
      Any clients who are determined to be medically unstable based on this assessment will not be&#xD;
      recruited for this study. At the end of this assessment, any clients who are eligible for the&#xD;
      study will be introduced to the study by the intake team. If they verbally consent to finding&#xD;
      out more details about the project, their contact information will be provided to a research&#xD;
      assistant (RA) who will then call the client with more information. If the client agrees to&#xD;
      participate, they will be scheduled to meet the RA when they attend their regular DTC session&#xD;
      during a time that does not conflict with treatment interventions or regular programming. At&#xD;
      this point, the clients may choose to take part in a consenting session with the RA, followed&#xD;
      by baseline testing. As a risk management strategy, the DTC clinical team will inform the&#xD;
      research staff if a client is determined to be unable to continue participation at any point&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carers will be asked to contact the RA if they have any questions regarding the research&#xD;
      project or if they would like to participate. On this call, the RA will confirm their&#xD;
      understanding of their involvement in the research project. If the carers agree to&#xD;
      participate, they will attend a session at Baycrest. During this session, the details of&#xD;
      participation will be explained and the carers will be asked to repeat the information that&#xD;
      has just been discussed, in order to ensure that they understand the consent form. Once they&#xD;
      are fully informed, they will sign the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staff&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following an informational session, consent forms will be left with the staff for them to&#xD;
      read on their own. They will be told to contact the RA if they have any questions regarding&#xD;
      the research project or if they decide to participate. The RA will then go to them at the DTC&#xD;
      to collect the consent form and will ensure understanding of their participation at this&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Bruyere -&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clients&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the initial intake call by the GDH staff, all clients will be informed that there are&#xD;
      research projects at the GDH that they may be eligible for. A verbal consent to contact will&#xD;
      be obtained over the phone during this initial call. Contact information will then be sent to&#xD;
      a recruitment coordinator who will then obtain consent for chart review to assess for&#xD;
      eligibility for the research projects. Provided the client meets the inclusion criteria for&#xD;
      the research project, the recruitment coordinator will then call back to inform them that&#xD;
      they are eligible for participation and asked for verbal consent to be contacted by a member&#xD;
      of the research team. If the client agrees to participate, they will be then invited to&#xD;
      Bruyere prior to their GDH program to provide written consent and for baseline testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following consenting and baseline testing with the client, the client will be told that the&#xD;
      project is also interested in the perceptions of carers (family, informal carers). Clients&#xD;
      will be asked to inform their carers of the study and to provide the RA's contact information&#xD;
      so the carer can call with any questions. The carer will be subsequently invited to attend&#xD;
      the baseline testing to provide written consent and to complete a semi-structured interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staff&#xD;
&#xD;
      An informational session regarding Motiview will be provided to inform staff about the&#xD;
      research project. Consent forms will be left at the end of the meeting for staff to read&#xD;
      through on their own. If they decide to participate, they can leave their signed forms with&#xD;
      the GDH reception for the research assistant in sealed envelopes that will be provided to&#xD;
      them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Baycrest -&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation: After the consenting and initial (baseline) testing session (which will be&#xD;
      held at a time convenient to the client attending the DTC program, and which does not&#xD;
      interfere with their regular programming/treatment intervention), the client will attend&#xD;
      their day treatment program as usual (i.e., 3 hours a day, twice a week on either Monday &amp;&#xD;
      Wednesday or Tuesday &amp; Thursday, for a duration of approximately 12 weeks). At Baycrest,&#xD;
      assignment to the experimental or control group will be determined by their day treatment&#xD;
      program schedule. If clients are scheduled for their program on Monday and Wednesday, they&#xD;
      will be provided with the opportunity to use the TheraTrainer with Motiview (Experimental&#xD;
      group). If they are scheduled for the program on Tuesday and Thursday, they will be provided&#xD;
      with the opportunity to use the TheraTrainer without Motiview (allocated to the control&#xD;
      group). Both groups will be informed that they have the option to use the TheraTrainer during&#xD;
      any free time between their scheduled treatment appointments, for the duration of their day&#xD;
      treatment program. Free time was selected so as to not disrupt a client's regularly scheduled&#xD;
      treatment plans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every time a participant chooses to use the TheraTrainer, an occupational/physical therapy&#xD;
      assistant hired for this project will assist the participant with his/her safe transfer onto&#xD;
      and from the TheraTrainer. The assistant will set up the TheraTrainer (and Motiview system,&#xD;
      if applicable). The assistant will record any field notes (i.e. reminiscence) that are&#xD;
      relevant for the study. After the completion of a cycling session, participants will be asked&#xD;
      micro-interview questions once per week to collect qualitative data about their cycling&#xD;
      session. In addition, the participants will be continuously observed by the&#xD;
      occupational/physical therapy assistant for the duration of each cycling session in the event&#xD;
      that any participant experiences adverse responses to the physical activity. If any concerns&#xD;
      arise related to the participants' ability to safely continue the cycling session, the&#xD;
      session will be ended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up outcomes: At the end of the study, participants will be asked to attend a&#xD;
      post-participation session where they will participate in a post-participation&#xD;
      semi-structured interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation: After consent is obtained, the carers will be taken through a semi-structured&#xD;
      interview to gain feedback about their opinions about their study partner's involvement with&#xD;
      the TheraTrainer and/or Motiview. Also, they will be asked about their general&#xD;
      characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: None for this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staff&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation: Following the study period, the staff will be taken through a semi-structured&#xD;
      interview to gain feedback about their opinions about the client's involvement with the&#xD;
      TheraTrainer and/or Motiview. Also, staff will be asked about their general characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: None for this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Bruyere -&#xD;
&#xD;
      Client&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation: If the GDH client agrees to participate, they will be invited, along with&#xD;
      their caregiver to Bruyere for one visit of approximately 30 minutes prior to their&#xD;
      participation in the GDH. During this session, they will be told again of their involvement&#xD;
      requirements for this study and signed written consent will be obtained. Subsequently,&#xD;
      baseline outcome measure testing will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will then attend the rehabilitation program as usual and will be encouraged by the staff&#xD;
      as part of their regular GDH program to use the TheraTrainer (one group with Motiview, one&#xD;
      group without Motiview). At certain times throughout the study, when a participant uses the&#xD;
      TheraTrainer as part of this investigation, study staff will take field notes to capture the&#xD;
      clients'/residents' level of social engagement, and other behavioural or anecdotal findings&#xD;
      that may emerge immediately prior to, during, or shortly after the exercise session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess clients' experiences, they will be approached by study staff once a week (on&#xD;
      different days throughout the week, depending on the client's schedule). The study staff will&#xD;
      ask the clients if they would like to answer a few short questions related to their&#xD;
      experience with the TheraTrainer (either with or without Motiview). Following their assent,&#xD;
      the clients will be asked a maximum of four short questions related to their exercise&#xD;
      experiences, reminiscence, and general health and well-being during each micro-interview.&#xD;
      Each client will have the opportunity to take part in up to six micro-interviews in total&#xD;
      throughout the study. The clients' responses will be audio recorded with their assent; for&#xD;
      those who do not wish to have their responses recorded, study staff will take field notes&#xD;
      related to the clients' responses instead (if assent is provided).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: When each client has completed their GDH program, they will be asked to return to&#xD;
      the Bruyere Continuing Care (room 441D) to complete the baseline outcome measures as a&#xD;
      pre-post design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semi-structured interview questions will be posed to all clients who elect to take part in&#xD;
      interview session as part of the study. The interviews will be held at the end of the study&#xD;
      period. The questions and prompts were developed with the aim of employing a phenomenological&#xD;
      approach, enabling the clients to elicit their own responses and experiences. Using the&#xD;
      interview guide to lead the discussion, client responses may be probed to gain further&#xD;
      clarity or insight. The interviews will be audio recorded by study staff. Study staff will&#xD;
      also write field notes to document client responses and other observations to supplement and&#xD;
      provide context for the transcripts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will continue until 15 clients (control group) have been enrolled and all have&#xD;
      completed their geriatric rehabilitation program. After 15 clients have finished the study,&#xD;
      Motiview will be placed into the GDH and recruitment of 15 (experimental group) additional&#xD;
      clients will commence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Same as Baycrest protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staff&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the first client enrollment, staff will participate in a brief session&#xD;
      (approximately 10 minutes) on proper use of the TheraTrainer, Motiview. The staff will be&#xD;
      encouraged to use the TheraTrainer and Motiview as part of their rehabilitation protocol&#xD;
      (TheraTrainer activity bikes will be used in place of the NuStep cycle currently in the GDH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semi-structured interview questions will be posed to all staff members who elect to take part&#xD;
      in an interview session as part of the study. The interviews will be held after 15 clients&#xD;
      use the TheraTrainer alone as well as after the 15 clients that use TheraTrainer and&#xD;
      Motiview. The questions were developed with the aim of employing a phenomenological approach,&#xD;
      which provides staff with the opportunity to elicit their own responses and experiences.&#xD;
      Using the interview guide to lead the discussion, staff members' responses may be probed&#xD;
      further to gain additional clarity or insight. The interviews will be audio recorded by study&#xD;
      staff. Study staff will also write down field notes to capture any notable observations and&#xD;
      to add further context to clients' responses, which will ultimately supplement the&#xD;
      transcripts.&#xD;
