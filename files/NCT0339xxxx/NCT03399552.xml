  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether the combination of avelumab and SBRT is safe&#xD;
      and what effect avelumab has on mesothelioma when given in combination with SBRT. In&#xD;
      addition, a goal of this protocol is to study the effect of radiation therapy on the immune&#xD;
      system. It is thought that radiation treatment may create a form of 'vaccine' against cancer&#xD;
      inside the body and immunotherapy may improve this effect. The combination of radiation&#xD;
      treatment and immunotherapy may be more effective against cancer than either radiation or&#xD;
      immunotherapy alone.&#xD;
