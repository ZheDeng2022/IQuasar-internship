  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, multi-site, open-label Phase II trial for subjects with metastatic,&#xD;
      hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer. The study will enroll 47 patients to&#xD;
      evaluate the anti-tumor activity of pembrolizumab with fulvestrant as measured by RECIST 1.1&#xD;
      tumor response and by progression free survival. We expect that if the immune response is&#xD;
      augmented by the addition of pembrolizumab, significant change in durability of response will&#xD;
      be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with pembrolizumab dosed at 200 mg intravenous infusion in&#xD;
      combination with standard fulvestrant 500mg intramuscular injection.&#xD;
