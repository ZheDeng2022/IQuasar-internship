      This is a phase 2 multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of nitazoxanide for the treatment of solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplant recipients with symptomatic diarrhea due to Norovirus. The study involves a total&#xD;
      of 160 Hematopoietic Stem Cell or Solid Organ transplant recipients, equal to or greater than&#xD;
      12 years of age with diagnosis of Norovirus who will be selected and randomly assigned (1:1)&#xD;
      to nitazoxanide or placebo group. The study duration is 60 months and subject participation&#xD;
      duration is 6 months. Given the safety of prolonged therapy with nitazoxanide, lack of&#xD;
      interactions with common post-transplant medications, putative antiviral activity and&#xD;
      prolonged duration of viral shedding we are assessing 56 doses of therapy. The longitudinal&#xD;
      monitoring phase will provide useful information on the course of host and viral responses in&#xD;
      subjects with chronic Norovirus infection with and without treatment. Randomization will be&#xD;
      stratified by age group (pediatric (12 through 17 years) vs. adult (greater than or equal to&#xD;
      18 years)), chronicity of Norovirus-associated symptoms (acute (less than 14 days) vs.&#xD;
      chronic (greater than or equal to 14 days)) and transplant type (solid organ (SOT)) vs.&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)). Enrolled subjects will participate in 2 phases of&#xD;
      the study: Treatment Phase, which will include dosing with the assigned study agent for 28&#xD;
      days. Longitudinal Monitoring Phase which will include telephone call on Days 35, 53, 113,&#xD;
      173. Primary objective is 1) to assess the clinical efficacy of nitazoxanide for the&#xD;
      management of acute and chronic Norovirus in transplant recipients.&#xD;

      12 years of age with diagnosis of Norovirus who will be selected and randomly assigned (1:1)&#xD;
      into two treatment groups: nitazoxanide or placebo. The study duration is approximately 60&#xD;
      months and subject participation duration is approximately 6 months. Given the safety of&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects should meet all of the following inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female age &gt; / = 12 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Recipient of a solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Positive test result for Norovirus within 14 days of enrollment that is obtained as&#xD;
             part of routine clinical care using a Norovirus testing available to the site.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Active GI symptoms (diarrhea, or vomiting) that, in the opinion of the PI, are&#xD;
             secondary to Norovirus. Patients must have active diarrhea, which is defined as at&#xD;
             least 3 days of Bristol 6 or 7 stools in the past 2 weeks prior to enrollment per&#xD;
             patient report.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Willing and able to provide written informed consent and assent before initiation of&#xD;
             any study procedures, consistent with local IRB policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects must be of non-childbearing potential or if of childbearing potential, must&#xD;
             be using an effective method of birth control or must be abstinent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Non-childbearing potential is defined as surgically sterile or postmenopausal for&#xD;
                  &gt; one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Effective methods of birth control include the use of hormonal or barrier birth&#xD;
                  control such as implants, injectable contraceptives, combined oral&#xD;
                  contraceptives, intrauterine devices (IUDs),or condoms with spermicidal agents&#xD;
                  during study period. Female subjects must be using an effective method of birth&#xD;
                  control or practice abstinence and must agree to continue such precautions during&#xD;
                  the study and for 30 days after the Day 28 study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A woman is eligible if she is monogamous with a vasectomized male.This subject is&#xD;
                  considered low risk and not required to use contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Agrees to complete all screening requirements, study visits and procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects meeting any of the exclusion criteria at baseline will be excluded from study&#xD;
        participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Other identified infectious causes of diarrhea at screening. Alternative diagnosis&#xD;
             requiring treatment would be considered a co-infection; if the testing is positive for&#xD;
             a pathogen that the PI does not feel is causing the symptoms, they may be included but&#xD;
             the PI or his/her designee must document that the positive test is not clinically&#xD;
             significant, does not require treatment and is not causing the symptoms making the&#xD;
             patient eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any condition that would, in opinion of the Site Investigator, place the subject at an&#xD;
             unacceptable risk of injury or render the subject unable to meet the requirements of&#xD;
             the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects receiving oral or intravenous immunoglobulin therapy concurrently or in the&#xD;
             14 days prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Nitazoxanide use for any illness in the previous 30 days prior to randomization.&#xD;

             receive experimental products at any time during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Known sensitivity to nitazoxanide or any of the excipients comprising the nitazoxanide&#xD;
             tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects unable to swallow oral medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects with ostomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Women who are pregnant or lactating or have a positive urine pregnancy test at&#xD;
             screening/enrollment/Day 1.&#xD;
