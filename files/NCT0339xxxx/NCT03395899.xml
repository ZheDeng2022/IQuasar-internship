    <textblock>
      ECLIPSE is an international, open label, window of opportunity phase II trial that aims to&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of immunotherapy based treatment combinations in women with untreated,&#xD;
      histologically confirmed, operable, ER+, HER2-negative breast cancer. The study is designed&#xD;
      with the flexibility to open new treatment arms as new treatments become available, or modify&#xD;
      the patient population e.g. with regards to biomarker status. Only combinations with adequate&#xD;
      safety data will be tested. The trial will include Luminal B and non-Luminal B patients&#xD;
      irrespective of PD-L1 status, but the number of patients with non-Luminal B tumours will be&#xD;
      capped at 50% of the total study population. Luminal B tumours will be defined as high Ki67&#xD;
      (≥20%) and/or histological grade 3 or alternatively defined via PAM50 assay. All other types&#xD;
      will be defined as non-Luminal B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomised with an approximately equal ratio (1:1:1:1) to one of&#xD;
      four treatment arms (three experimental arms: (1) Atezolizumab + Cobimetinib, (2)&#xD;
      Atezolizumab + Ipatasertib, (3) Atezolizumab + Cobimetinib + Bevacizumab and a control arm:&#xD;
      Atezolizumab alone. Additional patients may be enrolled to ensure balance among treatment&#xD;
      arms with respect to demographic and baseline characteristics, including potential predictive&#xD;
      biomarkers, to enable further subgroup analysis. Thereafter, the randomisation ratio will&#xD;
      depend on the number of experimental arms that are open for enrolment (e.g. if an arm is&#xD;
      added or enrolment in an arm is suspended pending analysis of results. Randomisation will&#xD;
      take into account arm-specific exclusion criteria and patients will be ineligible for a&#xD;
      specific arm if they meet any of the exclusion criteria outlined for that arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive treatment for 3 weeks prior to surgery or neoadjuvant therapy.&#xD;
      Thereafter, patients will either be considered for definitive surgery or primary medical&#xD;
      treatment (e.g. neoadjuvant chemotherapy) at the discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
      Surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be started within 3 weeks (±3 days) from the start&#xD;
      of the study treatment. Patients will not be allowed to receive endocrine therapy prior to&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
