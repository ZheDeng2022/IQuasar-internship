      This is a multi-centre, single arm phase 2 study of Pembrolizumab (Keytruda™ or MK-3475) in&#xD;
      treatment naïve patients with poor prognosis carcinoma of unknown primary site (CUP).&#xD;
      Participants will receive Pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously (IV) on Day 1 of each 3-week&#xD;
      cycle for up to 24 months. Patients will be evaluated for response every 9 weeks. Patients&#xD;
      with objective response to treatment and those with stable disease will continue to receive&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab. Patients with tumor progression will be discontinued from the study. Patients&#xD;
      with progressive disease (PD), but showing a clinical benefit, may continue on Pembrolizumab,&#xD;
      as per the discretion of the responsible Qualified Investigator. Response will be evaluated&#xD;
      as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1&#xD;
