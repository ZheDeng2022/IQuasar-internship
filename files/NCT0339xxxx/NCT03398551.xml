  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to get a proof of concept for using a computational model of fetal&#xD;
      haemodynamics, combined with machine learning based on Doppler patterns of the fetal&#xD;
      cardiovascular, cerebral and placental flows, to identify those at increased risk of adverse&#xD;
      perinatal outcomes such as stillbirth, perinatal mortality and other neonatal morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also compare the sensitivity and specificity of UmbiFlow device with the machine&#xD;
      learning model in predicting adverse perinatal outcomes&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pakistan is one of the countries where stillbirth rate (43/1000 total births) and neonatal&#xD;
      mortality rate (55/1000 live births) are among the highest in the world. The figures for&#xD;
      perinatal mortality remained unchanged between Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (PDHS)&#xD;
      1990-91 and PDHS 2012-13. It is hence important to evaluate new techniques to identify&#xD;
      high-risk pregnant women who can then subsequently receive personalized care to improve&#xD;
      perinatal outcomes. Fetal blood flow waveforms assessed via Doppler ultrasound to indicate&#xD;
      wellbeing of the fetus have been in practice for nearly four decades. Abnormal blood flow&#xD;
      patterns in the fetal circulation detected by Doppler ultrasound may indicate poor fetal&#xD;
      prognosis. These tracings will then be incorporated in a computational model and combined&#xD;
      with machine learning, will be used to predict adverse perinatal outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective one group cohort study for a period of twelve months which will be&#xD;
      based in Ibrahim Hyderi, a peri-urban settlement of approximately 70,000 on the south east of&#xD;
      Karachi. The sample size for this study has been calculated based on the outcomes of the&#xD;
      pregnancy and was estimated to be 525 pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment - Household surveillance will be done by community health workers (CHWs) in the&#xD;
      catchment area in a sequential manner to identify pregnant women. Eligible women between&#xD;
      22-34 weeks of gestation on last menstrual period (LMP) will then be explained regarding the&#xD;
      purpose of the study and invited for an ultrasound scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First and enrollment visit - The first visit window for the ultrasound scan will be between&#xD;
      22-26 weeks of gestation. This window is selected because pregnancies at risk may be better&#xD;
      identified and also visualization of fetal cardiac flow is possible. Based on the rigorous&#xD;
      surveillance, we anticipate that most women will be in this window. The following information&#xD;
      will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Socio-demographic information&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history, including exposure to tobacco, gravidity, parity, past obstetric&#xD;
           history (including number of miscarriages, stillbirths or neonatal deaths) and comorbid&#xD;
           conditions (pre-eclampsia, diabetes mellitus)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maternal anthropometry (height, weight and mid-upper arm circumference)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maternal blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemoglobin of the mother&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symphysiofundal height will be measured&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard obstetric Doppler evaluation including the four primary ultrasound measures of&#xD;
           fetal growth-head circumference, biparietal diameter, abdominal circumference, and femur&#xD;
           length is routinely performed for all pregnant women presenting at the center. These&#xD;
           parameters will be used to estimate fetal weight (automatically calculated by the&#xD;
           machine).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Focused Fetal Doppler Echocardiography - These would include transabdominal measurements&#xD;
           of the Doppler velocity of the umbilical artery, the middle cerebral artery (MCA),&#xD;
           ductus arteriosus, fetal aortic isthmus (AoI) and left and right ventricular outflow&#xD;
           tracts&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  UmbiFlow - Umbilical artery continuous wave Doppler image will also be obtained on these&#xD;
           women. The device will generate graphs for the flow pattern and calculate the resistance&#xD;
           index for the flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second visit - The second visit window of ultrasound scan will be between 30-34 weeks of&#xD;
      gestation. This will be applicable for all women who have had their first scan during 22-26&#xD;
      weeks of gestation as well as newly enrolled women during 30-34 weeks of gestational age.&#xD;
      Cardiotocography (CTG) will be performed for all recruited women during the second visit&#xD;
      followed by the Doppler examination. The same procedures as described in the first visit will&#xD;
      be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up - We will obtain contact information (phone number) from all enrolled women. A&#xD;
      trained research midwife will be responsible for making phone calls, as well as performing&#xD;
      household visits at pre-specified intervals for immediate and early identification of the&#xD;
      pregnancy outcome. A team of CHWs will perform home visits to the baby at post-natal day 1&#xD;
      and 6 and questions related to delayed cry, neonatal sepsis and hospital course (if any) will&#xD;
      be collected and the weight and length of the baby will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Verbal autopsy - The VA team will visit the family after the grieving period (at least 14&#xD;
      days after the death). VA will be performed using a structured tool&#xD;
      (http://www.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/WHO_VA_2012_RC1_Instrument.pdf ).&#xD;
