    <textblock>
      This phase III trial studies how well nivolumab and ipilimumab works with or without local&#xD;
      consolidation therapy in treating patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may help the&#xD;
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to&#xD;
      grow and spread. Local consolidation therapy, such as surgery or radiation therapy, may&#xD;
      improve survival outcomes in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. It is not yet known&#xD;
      whether giving nivolumab and ipilimumab with local consolidation therapy works better than&#xD;
      nivolumab and ipilimumab alone in treating patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether local consolidative therapy (LCT; radiotherapy +/- surgical&#xD;
      resection, radiofrequency ablation, or cryoablation for up to 3 lesions) followed by up to 2&#xD;
      years of treatment with ipilimumab (1mg/Kg every 6 weeks) and nivolumab (3 mg/Kg, every 2&#xD;
      weeks) prolongs overall survival (OS) compared with up to 2 years treatment with ipilimumab&#xD;
      (1mg/Kg every 6 weeks) and nivolumab (3 mg/Kg, every 2 weeks) alone in metastatic or&#xD;
      recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with non-progressive disease after 12&#xD;
      weeks of treatment with ipilimumab (1mg/Kg every 6 weeks) and nivolumab (3 mg/Kg, every 2&#xD;
      weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine whether LCT followed by up to 2 years of treatment with ipilimumab (1mg/Kg&#xD;
      every 6 weeks) and nivolumab (3 mg/Kg, every 2 weeks) prolongs overall survival compared with&#xD;
      up to 2 years of treatment with ipilimumab (1mg/Kg every 6 weeks) and nivolumab (3 mg/Kg,&#xD;
      every 2 weeks) alone in the subgroup of patients with oligometastatic NSCLC (up to 3&#xD;
      metastases) with non-progressive disease after 12 weeks of treatment with ipilimumab (1mg/Kg&#xD;
      every 6 weeks) and nivolumab (3 mg/Kg, every 2 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if there is a progression free survival (PFS) difference in the overall group&#xD;
      and the oligometastatic group in patients that receive LCT + ipilimumab/nivolumab vs.&#xD;
      ipilimumab/nivolumab alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine whether there is a PFS and (overall survival) OS difference in patients that&#xD;
      undergo complete vs. non-complete LCT after 12 weeks of induction treatment with ipilimumab&#xD;
      (1mg/Kg every 6 weeks) and nivolumab (3 mg/Kg, every 2 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine whether LCT improves time to progression of non-irradiated lesions&#xD;
      (TTP-NIL) and time to appearance of new metastases (TANM) in the overall study population and&#xD;
      the oligometastatic subgroup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine whether LCT improves the time to progression of target vs. non-target&#xD;
      lesions in the overall study population and the oligometastatic subgroup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess whether LCT prolongs PFS and OS in squamous histology and non-squamous&#xD;
      histologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To assess the safety and tolerability of nivolumab and ipilimumab with or without LCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To assess quality of life patient reported outcomes in patients treated with nivolumab&#xD;
      and ipilimumab with or without LCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII To explore the association of baseline genomic and gene expression profiles (from tumor,&#xD;
      germline deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA], and cell free [cf] DNA) with clinical benefit and&#xD;
      toxicities in patients treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab with or without LCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. To explore the association of baseline immune profiles (from tumor and blood) with&#xD;
      clinical benefit and toxicities in patients treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab with or&#xD;
      without LCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify novel prognostic and predictive markers present at diagnosis, and to determine&#xD;
      modulation of markers by induction immunotherapy in order to inform future translational&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1, 15,&#xD;
      and 29, and ipilimumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to&#xD;
      2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with non-progressive disease after completion of Induction Phase are randomized to 1&#xD;
      of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29 and ipilimumab IV&#xD;
      over 90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 6 weeks for 2 years in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive LCT consisting of surgery and/or radiation 14 days after completion&#xD;
      of Induction Phase. Patients then receive nivolumab and ipilimumab as in arm A beginning&#xD;
      within 4 weeks after LCT. Courses repeat every 6 weeks for 2 years in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 8 weeks and then every 3&#xD;
      months for up to 1 year.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer; if a diagnostic&#xD;
             biopsy is available, a pre-treatment biopsy is not required. Patients with a suspected&#xD;
             lung cancer may be consented, but pathology must be confirmed prior to initiating&#xD;
             treatment on study. Neuroendocrine carcinomas (e.g. small cell lung cancer [SCLC],&#xD;
             carcinoid tumors) are not eligible. Carcinomas with neuroendocrine differentiation are&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stage IV (according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] 8th edition)&#xD;
             measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in&#xD;
             accordance with International Conference on Harmonization-Good Clinical Practice&#xD;
             (ICH-GCP) guidelines and to the local legislation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For lung adenocarcinoma patients, patients must not harbor any EGFR sensitizing or ALK&#xD;
             fusion where there are standard care therapy options available. For patients with&#xD;
             histologies other than adenocarcinoma, EGFR and ALK status is not required.&#xD;
             Adenocarcinoma patients may be consented prior to the EGFR and ALK status being known,&#xD;
             but EGFR and ALK status must be determined prior to initiating therapy. EGFR and ALK&#xD;
             status may be determined using either tumor- or plasma-based, Clinical Laboratory&#xD;
             Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified assays. For patients with non-small cell lung&#xD;
             cancer (NSCLC), not otherwise specified (NOS), EGFR/ALK testing is not required, as&#xD;
             the frequency of alterations is exceedingly rare in this histology. Also, note that&#xD;
             patients with ROS1/RET alterations can be enrolled, as tyrosine kinase inhibitor such&#xD;
             as crizotinib aren't established as first line therapy for patients with these&#xD;
             alterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  One prior line of chemotherapy and/or targeted agents for metastatic disease are&#xD;
             permitted. This chemotherapy can include maintenance therapy, as long as it was given&#xD;
             in the front line setting. In addition, prior antiangiogenic therapy (e.g.&#xD;
             bevacizumab) is permitted if used as frontline treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Performance status of 0 or 1 if using Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group&#xD;
             (ECOG)/Zubrod.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or creatinine clearance (CrCl)&#xD;
             &gt;= 50 mL (if using the Cockcroft-Gault formula) (obtained within 14 days prior to&#xD;
             randomization/registration)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =&lt; 3 x ULN (obtained&#xD;
             within 14 days prior to randomization/registration)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total Bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x ULN (except subjects with Gilbert syndrome, who can have&#xD;
             total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL) (obtained within 14 days prior to&#xD;
             randomization/registration)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use appropriate method(s) of&#xD;
             contraception. Appropriate methods of contraception are as follows. Women will be&#xD;
             instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 26 weeks after the last dose of&#xD;
             investigational product. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with&#xD;
             WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 35 weeks after the&#xD;
             last week of nivolumab/ipilimumab (nivo/ipi). Note: WOCBP is defined as any female who&#xD;
             has experienced menarche and who has not yet undergone surgical sterilization&#xD;
             (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal. Menopause is&#xD;
             defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of&#xD;
             other biological or physiological causes. In addition, women under the age of 55 must&#xD;
             have a documented negative serum or urine test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             within 48 hours prior to the start of nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a&#xD;
             failure rate of less than 1% per year. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually&#xD;
             active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 35&#xD;
             weeks after the last dose of investigational product. Women who are not of&#xD;
             childbearing potential (ie, who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile) as well as&#xD;
             azoospermic men do not require contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with brain metastases are eligible if metastases are adequately treated and&#xD;
             subjects are neurologically stable (except for residual signs or symptoms related to&#xD;
             the central nervous system [CNS] treatment) for at least 2 weeks prior to the first&#xD;
             dose of nivolumab. In addition, subjects must be either off corticosteroids, or on a&#xD;
             stable or decreasing dose of =&lt; 10 mg daily prednisone (or equivalent) for at least 2&#xD;
             weeks prior to the first dose of nivolumab. Patients with asymptomatic, small (e.g. =&lt;&#xD;
             1 cm) brain metastases are 1) eligible provided that the patient is off&#xD;
             corticosteroids, or on a stable or decreasing dose of =&lt; 10 mg daily prednisone (or&#xD;
             equivalent) for at least 2 weeks prior to the first dose of nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects may receive radiotherapy for symptomatic metastases prior to enrollment&#xD;
             provided that there is at least one other non-irradiated lesion amenable to LCT at the&#xD;
             time of enrollment. When feasible, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or other&#xD;
             hypofractionated techniques are strongly encouraged.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic immunotherapy for metastatic NSCLC. Immunotherapy agents include, but are not&#xD;
             limited to, agents targeting the PD1/PD-L1 axis (e.g. nivolumab, pembrolizumab,&#xD;
             atezolizumab, durvalumab) or CTLA-4 (ipilimumab, tremelimumab) pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any approved anti-cancer therapy, including chemotherapy, or hormonal therapy within 3&#xD;
             weeks prior to the initiation of study treatment. The following exceptions are&#xD;
             allowed: hormone-replacement therapy or oral contraceptives&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women must not be breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients excluded with any prior treatment of pneumonitis requiring corticosteroids&#xD;
             within 60 days prior to the first dose of nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures required in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug&#xD;
             administration, impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy, or&#xD;
             interfere with the interpretation of study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior malignancy active within the previous 2 years. Patients with locally curable&#xD;
             cancers that have been apparently cured, such as basal or squamous cell skin cancer,&#xD;
             superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the prostate, cervix, or breast&#xD;
             with local control measures (surgery, radiation) are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should be excluded if they have an active, known or suspected autoimmune&#xD;
             disease. Subjects are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes&#xD;
             mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone&#xD;
             replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to&#xD;
             recur in the absence of an external trigger.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with&#xD;
             either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other&#xD;
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration (i.e.&#xD;
             disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs). Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal&#xD;
             replacement doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of&#xD;
             active autoimmune disease. Note that subjects are permitted to use topical, ocular,&#xD;
             intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids (with minimal systemic&#xD;
             absorption). Physiologic replacement doses of systemic corticosteroids are permitted,&#xD;
             even if &gt;10 mg/day prednisone equivalents. A brief course of corticosteroids for&#xD;
             prophylaxis (e.g. contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non-autoimmune conditions&#xD;
             (e.g. delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by contact allergen) is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As there is potential for hepatic toxicity with nivolumab or nivolumab/ipilimumab&#xD;
             combinations, drugs with a predisposition to hepatoxicity should be used with caution.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should be excluded if they are known to be positive for hepatitis B virus&#xD;
             surface antigen (HBV sAg) or hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV antibody)&#xD;
             indicating acute or chronic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should be excluded if they have known history of testing positive for human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergy to study drug components.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prisoners or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are compulsorily detained for treatment of either a psychiatric or&#xD;
             physical (infection disease) illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychological, familial, sociological or geographical factors potentially hampering&#xD;
             compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the study&#xD;
             treatment or interpretation of the study results.&#xD;
