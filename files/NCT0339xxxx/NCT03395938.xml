  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine amongst siblings of colorectal cancer patients:1. The knowledge, perception and&#xD;
      barriers towards screening colonoscopy. 2. The current screening colonoscopy adoption rate.&#xD;
      3. If patients would engage them through active engagement by healthcare providers in a bid&#xD;
      to improve their receptiveness towards and partake in colorectal cancer screening. 4. The&#xD;
      method(s) that Colorectal cancer patients adopt to communicate with them. 5. If tailored&#xD;
      interventions addressing logistical, psychological and cost barriers could increase the&#xD;
      adoption of screening colonoscopy.&#xD;

      Part I: Randomised control trial. Patients will be approached to participate in the study&#xD;
      following recovery from their initial operation, after approximately three months, which&#xD;
      often corresponds to the initial stages of adjuvant chemotherapy or active disease&#xD;
      surveillance. Upon obtaining informed consent for the participant, the number of age&#xD;
      appropriate siblings that are eligible for screening colonoscopy will be determined. Only&#xD;
      siblings who have fulfilled the study inclusion criteria will be contacted. Siblings who&#xD;
      accompany the participant for their follow-up appointment will directly be approached to&#xD;
      participate in the qualitative component of the study. The Colorectal cancer patient will&#xD;
      then be excluded from the Randomised control trial. However, given the findings of the&#xD;
      preliminary study, most of the first degree relatives who came with the patients are the&#xD;
      children and not siblings. As such the above mentioned scenario is unlikely. Participants&#xD;
      will be enrolled into the randomised control trial and randomised to either &quot;Intervention A&quot;&#xD;
      or &quot;Intervention B&quot;. &quot;Intervention A&quot; depicts current practices by having the research team&#xD;
      educate the participants on the Ministry of Health Singapore screening guidelines akin to&#xD;
      counselling sessions carried out during the patient's clinical consultation. The research&#xD;
      team would highlight that we would be happy to assist if necessary. The research team would&#xD;
      then contact the patients in 4 weeks to check if they have communicated with their siblings&#xD;
      and if they have gone for screening. The research team would also find out which method did&#xD;
      they adopt to communicate with their siblings.&quot;Intervention B&quot; involves a series of proactive&#xD;
      engagements in hope to spur patients into contacting their siblings and improve their&#xD;
      receptiveness towards colorectal cancer screening. The engagements would include (1) a sealed&#xD;
      envelope containing a cancer information sheet and an invitation letter directed towards&#xD;
      siblings for them to contact the research team, (2) weekly phone reminders to the&#xD;
      participants for a total of 4 weeks in a bid to remind participants of the need to convey the&#xD;
      screening message to their siblings. The envelope will contain information on the various&#xD;
      means for the siblings to contact the research team. These include communication means such&#xD;
      as electronic mails (emails), telephone, hard copy returned mails through pre-paid envelopes,&#xD;
      short messaging services (SMSs) or clinic consult. A soft copy can also be given if requested&#xD;
      by the patients.Once the participant has successfully contacted their siblings, the research&#xD;
      team would inquire about the means of communication and the research team will proceed to&#xD;
      invite the siblings to partake in the study. If the participant has yet contacted their&#xD;
      siblings, the research team would inquire from participants as to why so. The research team&#xD;
      will encourage the participant then to continue attempting to contact their siblings. Failing&#xD;
      which at the end of 4 weeks, if the siblings remain not contactable, the participants will&#xD;
      not be disturbed henceforth. Siblings who reject invitation to participate in the study will&#xD;
      also not be contacted by the research team. Where possible, reasons for not being able to&#xD;
      contact the siblings and rejections will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Siblings response rate will be determined in this study. The research team deem sibling&#xD;
      replies as either &quot;active&quot; or &quot;passive&quot; by the way they use to contact the research team.&#xD;
      &quot;Active&quot; approach would be for the siblings to contact the study team via the contact&#xD;
      information provided to patients. &quot;Passive&quot; approach would be for the siblings to give verbal&#xD;
      consent to the patient for the study team to contact them directly. This process is so&#xD;
      tedious due to the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) that has been passed that prevent&#xD;
      random calling of the siblings without informed consent.&#xD;

    <description>The research team would like to compare the percentage response rates of siblings amongst the two intervention arms. A positive response would count as a sibling contacting the study team with their interest to undergo education by the research team on the topic of colorectal cancer screening.&#xD;
The research team would divide the method of positive response via&#xD;
&quot;Active&quot; approach would be for the siblings to contact the study team via the contact information provided to patients.&#xD;
&quot;Passive&quot; approach would be for the siblings to give verbal consent to the patient for the study team to contact them directly.</description>
