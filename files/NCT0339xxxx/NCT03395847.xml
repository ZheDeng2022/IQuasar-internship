  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial studies how well pembrolizumab works in treating patients with&#xD;
      gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma that has spread to other places or cannot be removed by&#xD;
      surgery. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's&#xD;
      immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow&#xD;
      and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the overall response rate (ORR) of intravenous administration of pembrolizumab&#xD;
      by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 in adult subjects with advanced&#xD;
      (unresectable and/or metastatic) and previously treated gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR), time to&#xD;
      progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) using RECIST&#xD;
      1.1 and immune-related (ir)RECIST criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To perform exploratory biomarkers to study the correlation between immunological and&#xD;
      molecular changes in tumor tissues and peripheral blood with clinical outcomes (DOR, DCR,&#xD;
      TTP, PFS, and OS) using RECIST 1.1, and irRECIST rate of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the safety and tolerability of intravenous administration of pembrolizumab&#xD;
      or pembrolizumab plus ramucirumab in adult subjects with advanced (unresectable and/or&#xD;
      metastatic) and previously treated gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the association between PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry, shed PD-L1&#xD;
      levels, somatic gene expression profiling and antitumor efficacy of pembrolizumab based on&#xD;
      RECIST 1.1 imaging criteria as well as overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore the relationship between genomic variation and response to the treatment&#xD;
      administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Tissue and blood immune monitoring will be conducted through our immune platform group&#xD;
      as detailed per the biomarker section based on 3 biopsies done at the following time points:&#xD;
      1) pre-treatment, 2) 6 weeks after therapy, and 3) and an optional biopsy upon progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 21 days for up to 35 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12&#xD;
      weeks thereafter.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The subject (or legally acceptable representative if applicable) provides written&#xD;
             informed consent for the trial. The subject may also provide consent for future&#xD;
             biomedical research. However the subject may participate in the main trial without&#xD;
             participating in future biomedical research.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.&#xD;

             adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a documented advanced (metastatic and/or unresectable) gastroesophageal&#xD;
             adenocarcinoma that is incurable and for which prior first-line or later-line standard&#xD;
             of care (SOC) treatments have failed. There is no limit to the number of prior&#xD;
             treatment regimens. Prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy included in initial&#xD;
             treatment may not be considered first- or later-line SOC treatment unless such&#xD;

             to initiation of treatment on day 1, for biomarker characterization will be required&#xD;
             for enrollment of all subjects. Tissue from tumor progressing at a site of prior&#xD;
             radiation may be allowed for biomarker characterization upon agreement from Merck.&#xD;
             Subjects for whom newly-obtained samples cannot be provided (e.g. inaccessible or&#xD;
