  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the current study is to examine the contribution of intense pulsed light (IPL) for&#xD;
      relieving signs and symptoms of dry eye due to meibomian gland dysfunction. The effect of IPL&#xD;
      will be examined in a study designed as a randomized controlled trial. In the study arm,&#xD;
      subjects will undergo 4 treatment sessions, consisting of IPL pulses immediately followed by&#xD;
      meibomian gland expression (MGX). In the control arm, subjects will undergo the same&#xD;
      treatments, except that the IPL pulses will be disabled. For each subject, the duration of&#xD;
      the study will be 10 weeks, as explained in the detailed description.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Outcome measures (tear break-up time,meibography, self-assessed symptoms and close up photos&#xD;
      of the lid margins) will be measured at baseline. All subjects will receive 4 treatments at 2&#xD;
      weeks intervals. In each treatment session, a subject allocated to the study group will be&#xD;
      treated with intense pulsed light (IPL) administered in the malar region, from tragus to&#xD;
      tragus including the nose, 2-3 mm below the lower eyelids. Immediately following the IPL&#xD;
      administration, the subject will undergo meibomian gland expression (MGX) in both eyelids of&#xD;
      both eyes. Subjects in the control arm will receive exactly the same treatment, except that&#xD;
      the IPL administration will be sham. A single follow-up will occur at 10 weeks after the&#xD;
      baseline (or 4 weeks after the 4th treatment session). At the follow-up, the changes in the&#xD;
      outcome measures will be evaluated, and compared between the two arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each subject, the duration of the study will be 10 weeks: 1st treatment at baseline; 2nd&#xD;
      treatment at 2 weeks after baseline; 3rd treatment at 4 weeks after baseline; 4th treatment&#xD;
      at 6 weeks after baseline; and a single follow-up at 10 weeks after baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistically significant differences between the two arms will support the study hypothesis&#xD;
      that IPL treatment itself provides relief to both signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.&#xD;

    <masking>Single (Participant)</masking>
    <masking_description>Subjects in the study arm will receive a series of IPL pulses using the M22 IPL handpiece. In subjects of the control arm, the device will be disabled. The subject will feel the lightguide on the skin, will hear clicking sounds, but no light will be actually produced by the M22 device. Since during treatment both eyes of the subject will be fully occluded, no subject will be able to see if the treatment is actual or sham. There is no way to completely mask the subjects, since the IPL generally causes slight redness of the skin, and in some patients is may also cause some discomfort</masking_description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change of self-assessed symptoms with the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire, from baseline to follow-up. OSDI was collected per patient (one number per patient). The minimal number is 0 and the maximal number is 100. Higher scores mean worse outcome. A score of 0-12 is considered normal. A score of 13-22 is consistent with mild dry eye. A score of 23 to 32 is consistent with moderate dry eye. A score from 33 to 100 is consistent with severe dry eye.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline Eye Dryness Score (EDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change of self-assessed symptoms on a visual analog scale (VAS) , from baseline to follow-up, in both eyes. Values were collected separately for each eye. Correlation between eyes was removed by statistical methods. Scores were 0 (minimum) to 100 (maximum). Higher scores = worse outcome. VAS scores are not validated for dry eye. Hence, it is not known how to correlate VAS values to severity levels of dry eye. However, one can make estimations from the literature of VAS in other conditions. For example, in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain, in a VAS scale of 0 to 10 scores below 3.4 corresponded to mild pain, scores between 3.5 and 7.4 corresponded to moderate pain, and scores above 7.5 corresponded to severe pain. Using such results from other conditions, it is *estimated* that values between 0 and 34 correspond to mild symptoms, scores between 35 and 74 correspond to moderate symptoms, and scores above 75 correspond to severe symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Eye Dryness Score (EDS)</title>
        <description>Change of self-assessed symptoms on a visual analog scale (VAS) , from baseline to follow-up, in both eyes. Values were collected separately for each eye. Correlation between eyes was removed by statistical methods. Scores were 0 (minimum) to 100 (maximum). Higher scores = worse outcome. VAS scores are not validated for dry eye. Hence, it is not known how to correlate VAS values to severity levels of dry eye. However, one can make estimations from the literature of VAS in other conditions. For example, in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain, in a VAS scale of 0 to 10 scores below 3.4 corresponded to mild pain, scores between 3.5 and 7.4 corresponded to moderate pain, and scores above 7.5 corresponded to severe pain. Using such results from other conditions, it is *estimated* that values between 0 and 34 correspond to mild symptoms, scores between 35 and 74 correspond to moderate symptoms, and scores above 75 correspond to severe symptoms.</description>
