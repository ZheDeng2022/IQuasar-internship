  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Orthognathic surgery procedures are often used to correct for skeletal II and III skeletal&#xD;
      deformation, dental-facial-maxillary deformation, mandibular laterognathy and maxillofacial&#xD;
      asymmetry. The factors that motivate patients to undergo this procedure are: improvement of&#xD;
      chewing, speech and swallowing as well as aesthetic and psychosocial factors. Correction of&#xD;
      occlusal-facial defects requires team orthodontic, surgical and rehabilitation treatment. As&#xD;
      with any surgical procedure, various preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative&#xD;
      com-plications may occur. Late complications that may occur in variously long periods of time&#xD;
      from surgery include among others dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint, idiopathic&#xD;
      atrophy of the condyloid muscles and associated pain. After orthognathic operations, pain&#xD;
      occurs almost always, although the degree of its severity is a subjective sensation of each&#xD;
      patient. Regardless of intensity, the fight against pain is one of the basic activities in&#xD;
      post-operative care of the patient. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the physiotherapeutic method, which uses a slow-changing electromagnetic field and light&#xD;
      ener-gy emitted from high-energy LEDs - light emitting diode, Magnetholedoterpy, in reducing&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with dental-facial deformity require orthognathic surgery to improve face profile&#xD;
      and asymmetry, and to correct malocclusion. Positional changes in the mandible, jaw or both&#xD;
      jaws during can affect the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), chewing muscles, surrounding soft&#xD;
      tis-sue and symptoms of joint dysfunction (TMD). Pain is a natural response of the body to&#xD;
      injury and at the same time one of the symptoms defining the inflammatory reaction.&#xD;
      Orthognathic surgery procedures are often used to correct skeletal deformation II and III of&#xD;
      the skeletal class, dental-facial-maxillary deformation, mandibular laterognathion and&#xD;
      maximal-facial asymmetry. After-care care of the patient aims to minimize the risk of&#xD;
      complications and therapy of existing ones. Regardless of intensity, the fight against pain&#xD;
      is one of the basic activities in post-operative care of the patient. Some studies have shown&#xD;
      that patients undergo-ing physiotherapeutic care immediately recover from the surgery much&#xD;
      more quickly. The use of physical treatments allows to obtain a significant faster&#xD;
      improvement in the pain and associated swelling after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROBLEM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The motivating factors for patients undergoing orthognathic surgery are: improvement of&#xD;
      chewing, speech and swallowing as well as aesthetic and psychosocial factors. Correction of&#xD;
      occlusal defects requires a group orthodontic, surgical and rehabilitation treatment.&#xD;
      Surgical techniques that have evolved over the last decades now allow for almost any&#xD;
      displacement within the bony structures of the jaw and mandible. The pain after orthogonal&#xD;
      surgery occurs almost always, although the degree of its severity is the subjective sensation&#xD;
      of each patient. Patients above all experience pain from mild to severe. His post-operative&#xD;
      treatment is very important to reduce the stress caused the occurrence itself pain.&#xD;
      Postoperative pain is often controlled by the use of opioids, which are often used in the&#xD;
      United States. Cold compresses are also used in the stimulus treatment to reduce pain related&#xD;
      associated with the occurrence of edema. Regardless of intensity, the fight against pain is&#xD;
      one of the basic activities in post-operative care of the patient. Pharmacotherapy often&#xD;
      necessary also causes a number of adverse effects harmful to the whole organism. In order to&#xD;
      restore the physical and psychological comfort of patients after orthognathic procedures,&#xD;
      physiotherapeutic methods as well as physiotherapeutic devices can be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of the combined physiotherapeutic&#xD;
      method, which uses a slow-changing electromagnetic(ELF EMF) field and light energy, emitted&#xD;
      from high-energy LEDs, in reducing pain in patients after orthognathic surgery.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Rehabilitation of patients after orthognathic procedures was performed, in which orthognathic surgery was performed - Bilateral Sagittal Split Osteotomy (BSSO). In the study it was used treatments a combination physicotherapies that combines two therapeutic physical factors - the electromagnetic field and the electromagnetic wave of red and infrared light in the form of led light therapy generated by the Viofor JPS device (Med&amp;Life, Poland). Treatments with a slow-changing electromagnetic field were carried out using ring and elliptic applicators. Treatments with magnetoledotherapy using elliptical magnetic applicators combined with light. For physiotherapeutic purposes, led lighttherapy was used, which is a combined use of Extremely Low Frequency Magnetic Field (ELF-MF) and light coming from high energy LEDs (Light Emitting Diode) in the range of red (R) and infrared (IR). Therapies were used once a day, doing three described applications for a period of 10 days.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The visual analogic scale allows us to convert subjective sensations as pain on nu-merical data. A 10cm scale where 0cm is no pain and 10cm the worse imaginable pain, will be used and the subjects will be asked to mark a point on the scale repre-senting their pain. This instrument was used to compare VAS values on days 1, 5 and 10.</description>
