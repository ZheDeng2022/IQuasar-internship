      Although children and adolescents are more likely to have advanced disease at onset, they&#xD;
      generally have a significantly better chance of survival. With combined chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiotherapy, overall survival has been reported more than 75% in most pediatric studies.&#xD;
      However, little research focuses on long-term morbidities of children and adolescent&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) survivors, and most studies are small scale and have short&#xD;
      follow-up time. Therefore, this study analyzed the long-term morbidities of children and&#xD;
      adolescent NPC survivors after radiotherapy. Factors associated with those morbidities were&#xD;
      also analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We reviewed the medical records of all NPC patients younger than 18 years old treated at Sun&#xD;
      Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC) from February 1991 to October 2010. Detailed&#xD;
      medical records were taken from our institutional database. Patients were also followed using&#xD;
      comprehensive questionnaires and phone calls. We extracted data on clinical characteristics,&#xD;
      histopathology, imaging findings, treatment, outcomes, and late morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with early-stage (stage I and II) disease were treated with radiotherapy alone, and&#xD;
      patients with advanced-stage disease (stage III and IV) were treated with a combination of&#xD;
      radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Radiotherapy technology included conventional radiotherapy&#xD;
      (CRT) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We retrospectively reviewed these medical records to collect the required data. All survivors&#xD;
      returned to the hospital for follow-up examinations at least every 3 months for the first&#xD;
      year, at least every 6 months in the 2nd year, and at least every one year thereafter until&#xD;
      the latest follow-up. As part of our routine clinical practice, all patients underwent&#xD;
      follow-up MRI examinations of the nasopharynx and neck at least every 6 to 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radioactive toxicity on organs was evaluated based on National Cancer Institute Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 3.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses were performed using SPSS software, version 16.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Chi-squared&#xD;
      tests and binary regression analysis were used to compare the CI of treatment comorbidities&#xD;
      between different groups of survivors. A P value of 0.05 was chosen as the criteria for&#xD;
      statistical significance.&#xD;

      Introduction Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an uncommon childhood malignancy. As the high&#xD;
      incidence of local-regional advanced disease, its undifferentiated histology and its close&#xD;
      association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) , it is distinguishable from the adult form of the&#xD;
      disease. Treatment strategies for childhood NPC follow guidelines established for adults.&#xD;
      Although children and adolescents are more likely to have advanced disease at onset, they&#xD;
      generally have a significantly better chance of survival. With combined chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiotherapy, overall survival has been reported more than 75% in most pediatric studies.&#xD;
      However, late sequelae such as endocrinopathies, hearing disorder, dental problems, life-long&#xD;
      dry mouth, and secondary neoplasms have been reported. Little research focuses on long-term&#xD;
      morbidities of children and adolescent NPC survivors, and most studies are small scale and&#xD;
      have short follow-up time. Therefore, this study analyzed the long-term morbidities of&#xD;
      children and adolescent NPC survivors after radiotherapy. Factors associated with those&#xD;
      morbidities were also analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Materials Patients We reviewed the medical records of all NPC patients younger&#xD;
      than 18 years old treated at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC) from February 1991&#xD;
      to October 2010. Detailed medical records were taken from our institutional database.&#xD;
      Patients were also followed using comprehensive questionnaires and phone calls. All patients&#xD;
      were restaged according to the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) TNM&#xD;
      classification version 2009 of NPC. We extracted data on clinical characteristics,&#xD;
      histopathology, imaging findings, treatment, outcomes, and late morbidities. Informed consent&#xD;
      was obtained from all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment protocols The main treatment strategy for patients was based on the National&#xD;
      Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines. Patients with early-stage (stage I and II) disease&#xD;
      were treated with radiotherapy alone, and patients with advanced-stage disease (stage III and&#xD;
      IV) were treated with a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. NPC patients were&#xD;
      treated with a high-dose of radiotherapy to the nasopharynx and the involved lymph nodes of&#xD;
      the neck, and a moderate dose of radiation to uninvolved nodes and surrounding tissues.&#xD;
      Radiotherapy technology included conventional radiotherapy (CRT) and intensity-modulated&#xD;
      radiotherapy (IMRT). Patients between 1991 and 2004 received CRT. Post 2004, IMRT became the&#xD;
      standard strategy treatment. During the study period, chemotherapy guidelines for NPC were&#xD;
      implemented as follows: no chemotherapy for patients with stage I to II disease, and&#xD;
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy + neoadjuvant chemotherapy for stage III to IVa-c.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up We retrospectively reviewed these medical records to collect the required data. All&#xD;
      survivors returned to the hospital for follow-up examinations at least every 3 months for the&#xD;
      first year, at least every 6 months in the 2nd year, and at least every one year thereafter&#xD;
      until the latest follow-up. As part of our routine clinical practice, all patients underwent&#xD;
      follow-up MRI examinations of the nasopharynx and neck at least every 6 to 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation Criterion Radioactive toxicity on organs was evaluated based on National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 3.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Analyses were performed using SPSS software, version 16.0 (SPSS,&#xD;
      Chicago, IL). Chi-squared tests and binary regression analysis were used to compare the CI of&#xD;
      treatment comorbidities between different groups of survivors. A P value of 0.05 was chosen&#xD;
      as the criteria for statistical significance.&#xD;
