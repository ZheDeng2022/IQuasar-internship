    <textblock>
      This is a phase II multi-center study of nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine and cisplatin (NGC&#xD;
      triple regimen) as preoperative therapy in potentially resectable pancreatic cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DISEASE STATE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Potentially operable or borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma as assessed by&#xD;
           standard CT criteria and histologically confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Staging by pancreatic protocol, helical abdominal computed tomography (with contrast) or&#xD;
           MRI (with contrast) required (endoscopic ultrasound is not required).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No evidence of metastatic disease. Lymphadenopathy (defined as nodes measuring &gt;1 cm in&#xD;
           short axis) outside the surgical basin (i.e., para-aortic, peri-caval, celiac axis, or&#xD;
           distant nodes) is considered M1 (unless nodes are biopsied and are negative, then&#xD;
           enrollment can be considered after review with the study PI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potentially Resectable Pancreatic Cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No involvement of the celiac artery, common hepatic artery, and superior mesenteric&#xD;
           artery (SMA) and, if present, replaced right hepatic artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No involvement or &lt;180° interface between tumor and vessel wall of the portal vein&#xD;
           and/or superior mesenteric vein (SMV-PV) and patent portal vein/splenic vein confluence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For tumors of the body and tail of the pancreas, involvement of the splenic artery and&#xD;
           vein of any degree is considered resectable disease. Borderline Resectable Pancreatic&#xD;
           Cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor-vessel interface ≥180° of vessel wall circumference, and/or reconstructible&#xD;
           occlusion of the SMV-PV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor-vessel interface &lt;180° of the circumference of the SMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor-vessel interface &lt;180° of the circumference of the celiac artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reconstructible short-segment interface of any degree between tumor and hepatic artery.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to find out if the study drugs nab-paclitaxel, cisplatin, and&#xD;
      gemcitabine given together are safe and effective. The combination of nab-paclitaxel plus&#xD;
      gemcitabine has been studied in treating patients with pancreatic cancer, and as of&#xD;
      September, 2013 is approved for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer. In this study,&#xD;
      cisplatin will be added to nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine, and tested in people who have not&#xD;
      yet had any cancer therapy for the diagnosis of localized pancreatic cancer, as treatment&#xD;
      prior to surgery, with the goal of improving response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another name for nab-paclitaxel is Abraxane®. Nab-paclitaxel contains the same medication as&#xD;
      the prescription chemotherapy drug Abraxane®. Nab-paclitaxel is approved by the FDA for the&#xD;
      treatment of advanced breast cancer, and in September, 2013 nab-paclitaxel, combined with&#xD;
      gemcitabine, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cisplatin is approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced bladder cancer, advanced&#xD;
      ovarian cancer, and advanced testicular cancer and other childhood cancers. However,&#xD;
      cisplatin is not approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gemcitabine was approved by the FDA in 1996 for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. It is&#xD;
      also an approved treatment for ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nab-paclitaxel, cisplatin, and gemcitabine will be given weekly for 2 weeks followed by a&#xD;
      week of rest, for a total of 3 cycles. A cycle is defined as one set of 3 weeks of&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment. Patients will undergo surgery after a minimum of 3 weeks after Cycle&#xD;
      3 of chemotherapy. Following surgery, patients mayl be treated for up to 3 cycles of this&#xD;
      same chemotherapy combination.&#xD;
