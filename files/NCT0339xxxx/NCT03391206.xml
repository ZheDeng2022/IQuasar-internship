      The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical role of bioelectrical impedance&#xD;
      analysis (BIA) and the relationship between the occurrence of breast cancer related&#xD;
      lymphedema (BCRL) and dietary factors in breast cancer survivors who underwent surgical&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer survivors are at risk of complications of breast cancer-related lymphedema&#xD;
      (BCRL) after surgical treatments, which may negatively effect on the quality of life of&#xD;
      breast cancer survivors. Lymphedema has been clinically diagnosed by determining that a limb&#xD;
      is in fact swollen, and has arbitrarily been diagnosed in other etiologies. Limb&#xD;
      circumference differences of 2 cm, a 200 mL or more in limb, or a 5% volume change are some&#xD;
      of the objective ways that clinicians use to diagnose lymphedema. Although the arm&#xD;
      circumference measurement method is a simple and frequently used clinical method, there is a&#xD;
      disadvantage that the standardized reference point does not exist, the extracellular space&#xD;
      can not be measured, and the sensitivity is also low. The lack of evidence-based diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria to define lymphedema has presented tremendous difficulty in diagnosing lymphedema.&#xD;
      It is important to define such criteria for early detection and treatment of lymphedema.&#xD;
      Because of these limitations, many researchers are studying various methods for diagnosing&#xD;
      lymphadenopathy and methods of bioelectrical impedance have been studied, recently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioelectrical Impedance predicts body composition using the difference of electric&#xD;
      conductivity by flowing a minute current to human body.This principle is used to diagnose the&#xD;
      occurrence of lymphatic edema. In several studies, the single-frequency bioimpedance analysis&#xD;
      (SFBIA) of the two arms obtained from bioelectrical impedance measurements was expressed as&#xD;
      the ratio of the values of the operated and non-operated arms. However, it has not yet been&#xD;
      clarified as a diagnostic method. Therefore, more studies are needed to establish a diagnosis&#xD;
      method and a prediction method of lymphatic edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various risk factors of lymphedema such as axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and obesity&#xD;
      have been studied for early prevention. However, there are no studies on the relationship&#xD;
      between breast cancer related lymphedema, and dietary factors in breast cancer patients. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study was to compare the diagnosis of lymphedema with the measurement of the&#xD;
      arm circumference and the diagnosis of lymphedema through bioelectrical impedance values in&#xD;
      order to clarify the clinical role of bioelectrical impedance method as a diagnostic method&#xD;
      of lymphedema. To investigate the relationship between dietary factors, which are considered&#xD;
      to be related to the occurrence of lymphedema, the investigators examined the frequency of&#xD;
      dietary intake and analyzed the relationship between dietary factors and lymphatic edema.&#xD;

        This study was conducted on women who were followed up at Severance Hospital for breast&#xD;
        cancer survivors aged 20 years or older. Unilateral breast cancer patients at least 6&#xD;
        months after surgery were selected. They were voluntarily participated. The total number of&#xD;
        patients recruited in this study was 250. Of these, 228 patients were enrolled, except for&#xD;
        10 patients with bilateral breast cancer, 10 patients with poor medical records, and 2&#xD;
        patients who did not measure bioelectrical impedance. 228 patients diagnosed lymphedema by&#xD;
        arm circumference measurement.&#xD;
