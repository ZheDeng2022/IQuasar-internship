      The trial aims to evaluate role of metabolic factors including systemic 25-OH D and diabetes&#xD;
      in the adaptive immune response (haemagluttination inhibition titer) to influenza vaccine in&#xD;
      the elderly. The influenza vaccine administered in this study will be licensed trivalent&#xD;
      inactivated influenza vaccine. Elderly who are age above 65 including those with&#xD;
      co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus will be included. The study has its inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria to determine eligibility for participation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Novel, effective influenza vaccination strategies are needed in the elderly who have the&#xD;
      highest rate of influenza-related morbidity and mortality. Vaccine efficacy in the elderly is&#xD;
      reduced due to immunosenescence and/or, inflamm-aging. This phase IV clinical trial in 240&#xD;
      participants aims to evaluate metabolic predictors of influenza-vaccine specific immune&#xD;
      response in a multi-ethnic elderly community cohort in Singapore. Specifically, our novel&#xD;
      approach is to evaluate the immunomodulatory roles of vitamin D, diabetes and other metabolic&#xD;
      predictors. This study has translational implications (e.g. using vitamin D as an 'adjuvant',&#xD;
      evaluating biomarkers of vaccine efficacy) to enhance influenza vaccine immunogenicity in the&#xD;
      vulnerable elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential benefit: there is a possibility the vaccine may prevent influenza illness or&#xD;
      influenza related complication that might have otherwise occurred. This study will contribute&#xD;
      to body of knowledge of impact of metabolic factors (vitamin D, DM status) on influenza&#xD;
      vaccine immune response, and will be the first study of its kind to be done in an Asian&#xD;
      elderly population. Potential risks related to the blood draw and local/systemic side effects&#xD;
      from influenza vaccine are anticipated to be minimal.&#xD;

    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Healthy elderly population with stable comorbidities (in particular diabetes mellitus) is&#xD;
        chosen for this study to evaluate metabolic factors and predictors related to&#xD;
        immunosenescence, inflamm-aging and immune response to vaccination. Vaccination is one of&#xD;
        our key preventive measures for influenza yet additional insight is needed regarding&#xD;
        adaptive response in this vulnerable population, to ultimately lead to novel vaccination&#xD;
        strategies.&#xD;
