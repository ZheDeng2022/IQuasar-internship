    <textblock>
      Overcoming limitations of previous studies, the following research project will assess the&#xD;
      most significant acute and long-term complications of RT that affect HNC patients: oral&#xD;
      mucositis, dry mouth feeling, taste alteration and carious lesion incidence, all of which&#xD;
      negatively affect cancer treatment outcomes and the quality of life of cancer survivors. This&#xD;
      project was developed with an aim to study any possible correlations / links between the oral&#xD;
      sequelae of RT and the negative clinical outcomes listed, in order to help the development of&#xD;
      clinical management protocols for HNC patients to mitigate the effect on care and patient&#xD;
      comfort and its delivery in healthcare systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project comprises of a longitudinal cohort study of HNC patients correlating biodata of&#xD;
      biochemical salivary parameters, clinical outcomes and oral health status over a period up to&#xD;
      12 months post-RT, focusing on baseline pre-IMRT (T0), 6 months post-IMRT (T1) and up to 12&#xD;
      months post-IMRT treatments (T2). The ultimate goal is to identify possible predictive&#xD;
      markers in the saliva at T0 to assist with evaluation of oral mucositis severity in&#xD;
      individual HNC patients prior to start of treatment so that treatment can be adapted for such&#xD;
      high-risk patients individually, to either prevent or minimise the severity of this&#xD;
      consequence of RT.&#xD;

      1. Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
           Head and neck cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the world representing 4-5% of&#xD;
           all malignancies . Head and neck cancer (includes oral, nasal cavity, salivary glands,&#xD;
           paranasal sinus, pharynx, and larynx) is one of the top 10 most diagnosed cancers in the&#xD;
           UK . According to Cancer Research UK, there were 7591 newly diagnosed with oral cancer&#xD;
           in 2013 in the country, representing the 14th most common cancer in the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Radiotherapy (RT) is the first choice treatment for the majority head and neck cancer&#xD;
           patients, which is a localized treatment to control the tumour . More than 50% of head&#xD;
           and neck cancer patients receive RT delivered in fractions of 2 Grays (Gy) daily during&#xD;
           5 days per week until the end of their therapy dosage (mean cumulative dose 55-77 Gy).&#xD;
           RT stimulates cellular changes that destroy the tumor cells, but may affect dramatically&#xD;
           the healthy oral tissues altering the homeostasis of this complex environment. RT is the&#xD;
           cause of a wide range of adverse oral tissue reactions such as permanent damage of the&#xD;
           major and minor salivary glands (hyposalivation, xerostomia), modification of connective&#xD;
           and vascular tissues and a reduction the healing capacity especially in mucosal and&#xD;
           mineralised tissues (mucositis, caries lesion, osteoradionecrosis). In order to try to&#xD;
           diminish the adverse side effects of the RT three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography&#xD;
           (CT) planned radiotherapy known as intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has been&#xD;
           developed .&#xD;
&#xD;
           There are acute (mucositis) and late-onset adverse effects/sequelae that RT induces in&#xD;
           healthy oral tissues . Radiation-induced dental caries is the most common late effect,&#xD;
           but its origin and nature is not clear. RT related caries have a rapid onset as a result&#xD;
           of a combination of factors such as shift in oral microbial community composition&#xD;
           favouring acidophilic bacteria, hypo-salivation, poor oral hygiene and dietary&#xD;
           alterations . The patients often have little/no pain, even in the most severe cases.&#xD;
           Histological features show that the onset and development of caries is similar to non&#xD;
           RT-related ones but the sites affected are different. Indeed RT-related caries is more&#xD;
           frequent on the cervico-labial surface/ incisal edge of canines and incisors while non&#xD;
           RT-related ones are more frequent in the interproximal/ occlusal areas of the posterior&#xD;
           teeth (molar and premolars).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Also, caries associated with RT has a rapid circumferential progression which may lead&#xD;
           to tooth fracture. It is characterized by a localized lesion to the incisal or occlusal&#xD;
           surfaces which diffuse and progress in relation to irregular and generalized erosion of&#xD;
           the incisal edge of the tooth. In addition, mechanical changes (increased elastic&#xD;
           modulus and stiffness) within the tooth structure increase the wear of the incisal and&#xD;
           occlusal areas and could lead to complete fracture of the tooth.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Tooth destruction is one of the most severe consequences of RT and it may produce&#xD;
           complete edentulousness in 3 - 5 years. The dental management of RT patients is&#xD;
           challenging. It is necessary to gather a multidisciplinary team (restorative dentists,&#xD;
           periodontology, endodontic, dental hygienist, radiation oncologists, medical&#xD;
           oncologists, and oral surgeons) to maintain oral health and improve quality of life&#xD;
           (QoL). Almost 50% of cancer survivors reported depression, worry or tension related to&#xD;
           oral dryness symptoms. Hence, RT sequelae detrimentally affect the quality of life of&#xD;
           head and neck cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Overall, it is necessary the quantitative analysis of chemical matrix components,&#xD;
           proteins and microbial changes that occur in patients' teeth/oral cavity, who have&#xD;
           undergone RT, in order to determine the aetiology and pathophysiology of the two&#xD;
           prevalent side effects (caries/mucositis) to correlate with preventive measurement and&#xD;
           appropriate treatment care for this population. Finally, it is necessary to perform a&#xD;
           complete oral assessment using a validated index in order to create a baseline record&#xD;
           before the treatment and a validated measured to compare after the RT and with healthy&#xD;
           individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aim The aim of this project is to perform a well-controlled and integrated longitudinal&#xD;
           study of HNC patients correlating biodata of biochemical parameters, clinical parameters&#xD;
           and oral health status, to overcoming the limitations of previous studies, that examined&#xD;
           the different side effects of radiotherapy of HNC patients (reduced number,&#xD;
           retrospective, observational, short term follow up, lack of detailed clinical&#xD;
           assessment, focused into treatment of side effects).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The first objective of this study will be to perform quantitative analysis of oral/&#xD;
           dental status of HNC patients pre and post IMRT and analyse the possible associations&#xD;
           between the clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Followed by assessing salivary gland function of HNC patients pre and post IMRT by&#xD;
           analysing protein concentration and secretion rate and investigate the possible&#xD;
           associations between these proteins and clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Next objective is to determine the possible association between selected proteins&#xD;
           concentration and secretion rate and oral mucositis outcomes after IMRT, and therefore,&#xD;
           the final objective is to evaluate whether protein concentration or secretion rate of&#xD;
           saliva is a reliable predictor of mucositis presence and severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Null Hypothesis There will be no correlation between salivary biochemical composition&#xD;
           and oral side effects of radiotherapy in the HNC patients before and after radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Materials and Methods. Ethics application to Health Research Authority (IRAS Project&#xD;
           ID:199100). All the samples of the study would be obtained from the Special Care dental&#xD;
           Unit at KCL Dental Institute, Guy's Hospital and from the Dental Clinic at KCL Dental&#xD;
           Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples will include saliva, biofilm, mucosal swabs, carious dentine and/or teeth. The&#xD;
      samples collection will add approximately 10 to 20 min to the conventional treatment time.&#xD;
      All the samples will be collected at 3-time points before and after IMRT from the head and&#xD;
      neck cancer up to 12 months follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients over the age of 18 in order to analyse permanent dentition and the age range for&#xD;
      cancer patients are over 18 years old, both gender,at any stage of disease, except where&#xD;
      distant metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects withouth Head and neck cancer age and gender matched. Following these inclusion&#xD;
      criteria the next patients are excluded younger than 18 (non-permanent dentition), unable to&#xD;
      give the consent patients who have been administered antibiotics in the previous 3 months&#xD;
      because the oral microbiota could be altered , patients with systemic disease (such as&#xD;
      Sjogren syndrome), subjects with non-controlled systemic diseases, that can affect the&#xD;
      salivary flow and host defence mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Calculation Statement Statistical advice was obtained prior to start this study&#xD;
      in order to determine the sample size required by a suitable power calculation. The power&#xD;
      calculation was based on comparing the mean protein levels in head and neck cancer patients&#xD;
      before and after IMRT. A study with 80% power at 5% level of significance (Chaudhury et al.,&#xD;
      2015) will be able to detect the true difference in all parameters before and after cancer&#xD;
      treatment with an effect size of 0.5 (high according to Cohen 1988) using two tailed test&#xD;
      would require a total sample of 35 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the sample characteristics and other&#xD;
      clinical factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analysis will be carried out using STATA 15.1 (College Station, Texas USA,&#xD;
      www.stata.com), GraphPad Prism 8 software (La Jolla California USA, www.graphpad.com) and&#xD;
      Microsoft Excel 2018, after checking for normality. Normality of the data will be tested for&#xD;
      all the parametric analyses using histogram and box plots. Results expresses as a mean ± SEM&#xD;
      relative to the variables and 'n' represents the number of subjects, p &lt;0.05 value was&#xD;
      considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following samples will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  unstimulated whole mouth saliva (UWMS), saline solution rinse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  plaque biofilm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mucosal swabs collecting residual saliva from the inner cheek&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  excavated carious dentine tissue and/or extracted carious teeth. Sample collection will&#xD;
           add 15 min to the conventional treatment time. Samples will be collected during the day,&#xD;
           routinely between the hours 1:30pm to 3:30pm in the dental clinic in an attempt to avoid&#xD;
           diurnal variations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unstimulated Whole Mouth Saliva Sample Collection (UWMS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      UWMS samples will be obtained by passive drooling into a pre -weighed 50 mL sterile conical&#xD;
      polypropylene tube (Falcon; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) for 10 minutes. All&#xD;
      participants will avoid food and drink for at least 60 min prior to sample collection. The&#xD;
      samples wll be kept on ice at 4°C, After collection, the tubes will be re-weighed and the net&#xD;
      saliva volume calculated. Saliva samples will be labelled and stored in - 80 °C freezers for&#xD;
      further analysis. Saliva flow rate will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Oral Assessment Dry Mouth and Taste Report answering a question from a validated&#xD;
      questionaire by Fox et al (Fox et al., 1987) and a question extracted from the Late Effects&#xD;
      of Normal Tissue/Somatic Objective Management Analytic (LENT/SOMA) scoring system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral Mucositis Grading using The World Health Organization (WHO) Oral Toxicity Scale Dental&#xD;
      Assessment of carious lesions present from clinically visible change of colour to dark brown&#xD;
      on any surface to open lesions in the oral cavity. Number of teeth / decayed, missed or&#xD;
      filled (DMFT) will be included in the clinical assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      UWMS saliva samples Samples will be analysed for total protein content using the&#xD;
      Bicinchoninic Acid Assay (BCA), targeted protein concentration by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent&#xD;
      Assay (ELISA), Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) staining, Coomassie Brilliant blue and α-amylase&#xD;
      activity by the standard kinetic enzyme assay (Salimetrics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to biochemical analysis UWMS samples will be centrifuged at 10000 RPM for 5 mins at&#xD;
      4°C. The supernatant will be separated to be used to analyse protein content and the pellet&#xD;
      was preserved to perform DNA extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protein Analysis (Concentration and Secretion Rate) Mucin 5B mucin 7, IgA, α-amylase, albumin&#xD;
      carbonic anhydrase VI, acidic proline rich protein and statherin were selected due to their&#xD;
      relationship to host defence, antimicrobial, bacterial adherence, colonization, mucosal&#xD;
      pellicle, enamel pellicle, viscoelastic, rheological properties, lubrication, and&#xD;
      remineralization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total protein secretion rate will be calculated by multiplication of the salivary flow rate&#xD;
      and protein concentration in ug / min (Carpenter et al., 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mucin 5B and 7 will be quantified by PAS,α-amylase by a kinetic assay,IgA, albumin, cystatin&#xD;
      S, proline rich protein and statherin concentration in UWMS will be determined using ELISA.&#xD;
