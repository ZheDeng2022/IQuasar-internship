  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (or TTP for short) is a condition where blood clots form&#xD;
      in small blood vessels throughout the body. The clots can limit or block the flow of&#xD;
      oxygen-rich blood to the body's organs, such as the brain, kidneys, and heart. As a result,&#xD;
      serious health problems can develop. The increased clotting that occurs in TTP uses up the&#xD;
      cells that help the blood to clot, called platelets. With fewer platelets available in the&#xD;
      blood, bleeding problems can occur. People who have TTP may bleed underneath the skin forming&#xD;
      purple bruises or purpura, or from the surface of the skin. TTP also can cause anemia, a&#xD;
      condition in which red blood cells break apart faster than the body can replace them leading&#xD;
      to lower than normal number of red blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A lack of activity in the ADAMTS13 enzyme, a protein in the blood involved in blood clotting,&#xD;
      causes TTP. The enzyme breaks up another blood protein called von Willebrand factor that&#xD;
      clumps together with platelets to form blood clots. Some people are born with this condition,&#xD;
      others get the condition during their life. Many people who born with TTP experience frequent&#xD;
      flareups that need to be treated right away. If not treated It can be fatal or cause lasting&#xD;
      damage, such as brain damage or a stroke. BAX 930 is a medicine that replaces ADAMTS13 and&#xD;
      can prevent or control TTP flareups, called TTP episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this study is to compare the number of TTP episodes in people born with&#xD;
      severe TTP when they treated with BAX 930 versus when they are treated with the standard&#xD;
      treatment. Treatment will be given in 2 ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BAX 930 or standard treatment given to prevent TTP episodes from happening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BAX 930 or standard treatment given to control an acute TTP episode when it happens,&#xD;
           according to the clinic's standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both BAX 930 and standard treatment are given slowly through a vein (infusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit, the study doctor will check if you can participate in the study. If you&#xD;
      are eligible and enter the study, you will follow an assigned schedule and either start with&#xD;
      BAX 930 (Period 1) and then switch to standard treatment (Period 2) or start with standard&#xD;
      treatment (Period 1) and then switch to BAX 930 (Period 2). Everyone will be treated with BAX&#xD;
      930 again for Period 3. Each Period will last approximately 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you enter the study to control an acute TTP episode, you will follow a schedule receiving&#xD;
      either BAX 930 or standard care to treat your acute TTP episode. Once the acute TTP episode&#xD;
      has gotten better, you can decide to continue in the study and be given treatment to prevent&#xD;
      TTP episodes from happening, following the schedule above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another study's aim is to assess side effects from treatment with BAX 930 and standard&#xD;
      treatment. To do that, the study doctor will ask you questions about your health at each&#xD;
      study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study doctors will also check how long BAX 930 stays in the blood of the participants,&#xD;
      over time. They will do this from blood samples taken after participants receive their&#xD;
      specific infusions of BAX 930. This will happen at different times during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 month after all treatment has been completed, participants will visit the clinic for a&#xD;
      final check-up.&#xD;

    <description>The Peds QL is a generic health related quality of life instrument designed specifically for a pediatric population and captures following domains: physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, school functioning, psychosocial summary, physical health and total score. The Peds-QL total score consist of all 23 items of all domains. This modular instrument uses a 5-point scale: from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). Items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale as follows: 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0. Higher scores indicate better quality of life.</description>
