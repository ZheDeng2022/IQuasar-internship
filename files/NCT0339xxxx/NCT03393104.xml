  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of years lived with disability globally with&#xD;
      increasing concern about its impact in low- and middle-income countries like those situated&#xD;
      in Africa where most people are living in rural areas with limited access to health care.&#xD;
      Epidemiological studies in Nigeria suggest that the burden of chronic low back pain (CLBP) in&#xD;
      rural areas is greater than in urban areas, with both biomechanical and psychological factors&#xD;
      being implicated. However, despite the burden of CLBP in rural Nigeria, rehabilitation&#xD;
      services are lacking even at the rural primary healthcare centers due to the absence of&#xD;
      physiotherapists. Current clinical practice guidelines unanimously recommend education&#xD;
      including instruction on self-management options, and exercise as frontline interventions to&#xD;
      help individuals with CLBP. However, the specific content of these interventions are rarely&#xD;
      described. Patient education (PE) strategies incorporating both biomedical and psychosocial&#xD;
      information have been shown to be beneficial for CLBP. Moreover, exercises in the form of&#xD;
      motor control exercises (MCEs) have been proven to be effective for CLBP. However, RCTs&#xD;
      examining the effects of PE and MCE individually or in combination among rural&#xD;
      community-dwelling adults with CLBP are scarce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of PE and MCE program on selected&#xD;
      clinical and psychosocial variables among rural community-dwelling adults with nonspecific&#xD;
      CLBP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be recruited and assigned to one of three intervention groups that include&#xD;
      PE plus MCE group, MCE group, or PE group using a block random technique based on an&#xD;
      electronic randomization table generated by a computer software program. Blinded assessment&#xD;
      of all outcomes will be performed at baseline, 8 weeks after randomization and at 3, 6 and 12&#xD;
      months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes will be functional disability and pain intensity. Secondary outcomes will be&#xD;
      quality of life, global perceived recovery, fear-avoidance beliefs, pain catastrophizing,&#xD;
      back pain consequences beliefs, and physical performance (finger-floor test, repeated&#xD;
      sit-to-stand test, and the 50-foot walk test) Data will be analyzed using descriptive and&#xD;
      inferential (mixed-model ANOVA/linear mixed-effects model) statistics. All statistical&#xD;
      analyses will be performed on IBM SPSS Statistics ver. 23.0 (IBM Co., Armonk, NY, USA) at&#xD;
      alpha level of 0.05.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in functional disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks after beginning treatment, and 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Functional disability will be measured by Oswestry disability index (ODI). The questionnaire consists of 10 items with each item having six statements. All scores are summed, then multiplied by two to obtain the index (range 0 to 100) with higher score indicating greater disability.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks after beginning treatment, and 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Intensity will be measured by an 11-point (0-10) Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), in which 0 represents &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 represents &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks after beginning treatment, and 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be measured using the SF-12 health survey. The questionnaire consists of 12 items questioned weighted and summed to provide physical and mental health scores (PCS and MCS). The two composite scores are computed using the scores on twelve questions that range from 0 to 100, with higher score indicating better health.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in global impression of recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks after beginning treatment, and 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Global impression of recovery will be measured by an 11-point Global Perceived Effect Scale (GPES). it range from -5 (vastly worse) to 0 (unchanged) to +5 (completely recovered). Higher scores indicate better recovery.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in fear-avoidance beliefs</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks after beginning treatment, and 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Fear avoidance beliefs will be measured by the fear-avoidance beliefs questionnaire (FABQ). The questionnaire consists of 16 self-response items, rated on a seven-point ordinal scale from 0 to 6. It also contains two subscales, a 7-item subscale concerning work, and a 4-item subscale concerning physical activity. Each subscale scores are summed giving possible ranges for the physical activity subscale of 0-24 and for the work subscale between 0-42. Higher score indicate greater fear and avoidance beliefs.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain catastrophization</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks after beginning treatment, and 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Pain catastrophizing will be measured by the pain catastrophizing scale (PCS). The scale consists of 13 items rated on 5-point ordinal scale (0-5).The total score ranges from 0-52 with higher score indicating more catastrophic thoughts.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in back pain consequences beliefs</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks after beginning treatment, and 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The back pain consequences beliefs will be measured by the Back Beliefs Questionnaire (BBQ). The BBQ is a 14-item scale, with each item rated using a 5-point Likert scale. Nine items (1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, and 14) are used for scoring of the questionnaire resulting in a total score ranging from 9-45 with lower scores indicating the more pessimistic beliefs regarding the consequences of back pain.</description>
