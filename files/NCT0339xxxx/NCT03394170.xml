      The purpose of this study is to screen orthopedic surgery patients with and without a&#xD;
      diagnosis of osteoarthritis for the presence of 11 pathogens associated with periodontal&#xD;
      disease (PD) from a collection of oral rinse, synovial fluid and their synovium. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that there is a correlation between the presence of specific oral&#xD;
      pathogens in saliva, synovial fluid and synovial tissue with clinical diagnosis of OA.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis, affecting over 27 million people in&#xD;
      the US. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a less common form of arthritis, is believed to differ&#xD;
      from OA in its etiology, however both result in breakdown of cartilage. Studies have reported&#xD;
      the association between chronic or adult periodontal disease (PD), Porphyromonas gingivalis&#xD;
      (P. gingivalis), a gram-negative anaerobic bacterium, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Whether&#xD;
      or not there is an infectious component of osteoarthritis is of significant interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to screen orthopedic surgery patients with and without a&#xD;
      diagnosis of osteoarthritis for the presence of 11 pathogens associated with PD from a&#xD;
      collection of oral rinse, synovial fluid and their synovium. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that there is a correlation between the presence of specific oral pathogens in saliva,&#xD;
      synovial fluid and synovial tissue with clinical diagnosis of OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an association between OA disease status and the presence of one or more pathogens can be&#xD;
      confirmed, further studies can be undertaken to investigate the causative nature of oral&#xD;
      pathogens in the clinical manifestation of OA, and eventually may lead to development of&#xD;
      targeted therapies to prevent or slow the progression of OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will recruit 50 patients with indications for knee surgery, who fit the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria. Prior to surgery, patients will undergo an Institutional Review&#xD;
      Board (IRB) approved informed consent process for in vitro cellular and biochemical&#xD;
      characterization of their tissue. Two discreet populations, essentially normal knees and&#xD;
      confirmed osteoarthritic knees will be studied. All patients will provide specimens for&#xD;
      analysis, to identify the presence of oral pathogens in each participants saliva, synovial&#xD;
      fluid and synovium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation will include identifying the type and concentration of the following&#xD;
      perio-pathogenic bacteria that are known to cause periodontal disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Campylobacter rectus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Capnocytophaga species (gingivalis, ochracea, sputigena)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eikenella corrodens&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eubacterium nodatum&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parvimonas micra&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Porphyromonas gingivalis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prevotella intermedia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tannerella forsythia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treponema denticola&#xD;
