    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal timing of IV dexamethasone for&#xD;
      prolongation of ultrasound (US) guided supraclavicular brachial plexus block (SCB) in&#xD;
      patients undergoing unilateral hand or forearm surgery at the Toronto Western Hospital.&#xD;
      Investigators seek to answer which timing of IV dexamethasone will provide the maximum block&#xD;
      prolongation. Investigators hypothesize that IV dexamethasone administered either before or&#xD;
      after the block will further extend the duration of analgesia provided.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective double-blind randomized trial to evaluate the optimal timing of IV&#xD;
      dexamethasone. All patients undergoing isolated hand or forearm surgery under anesthetic will&#xD;
      be approached to participate. The patients will be consented on the day of surgery; all&#xD;
      patients will be fully informed of the procedures involved in the study. Once the patient has&#xD;
      consented to the study, they will be randomized to receive dexamethasone at one of four&#xD;
      different times: 1 hour before the block, during the block, 1 hour after the block and 2&#xD;
      hours after the block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance with routine pre-block management, non-invasive blood pressure,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram and pulse oximetry will be applied and intravenous access secured on the&#xD;
      non-operative side for infusion of a 0.9% saline solution. Prior to block performance all&#xD;
      patients will receive intravenous midazolam 1 - 4mg IV and / or fentanyl 25mcg IV for&#xD;
      anxiolysis and analgesia, respectively, as needed. The US-guided SCB will be performed under&#xD;
      sterile conditions by a staff regional anesthetist, regional anesthesia fellow or a directly&#xD;
      supervised resident with experience of at least 10 US-guided SCB performed for each approach.&#xD;
      Ultrasound examination above the clavicle will be performed using a high frequency linear&#xD;
      probe (5 - 12 MHz range) with either a Philips, Sonosite or GE ultrasound machine. The&#xD;
      brachial plexus, subclavian artery, first rib and pleura will be identified in the&#xD;
      supraclavicular fossa. A 22 - gauge insulated 50mm needle (Stimuplex, Braun Medical,&#xD;
      Bethlehem, PA) will be introduced in plane with the US and advanced to puncture the brachial&#xD;
      plexus sheath. Typically this is accompanied by a palpable 'fascial click'. A small amount&#xD;
      (0.5-1ml) of local anesthetic will be incrementally injected for needle tip hydro-location&#xD;
      and/or hydro-dissection at the discretion of the operator. After placing the needle tip near&#xD;
      the intersection of the first rib and the lateral aspect of the subclavian artery ('corner&#xD;
      pocket') 30mls of 0.5% bupivacaine will be injected incrementally in 5ml aliquots with&#xD;
      intermittent aspiration for blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blinded research associate will evaluate sensory loss and motor blockade every 5 minutes&#xD;
      until surgery starts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplemental mask oxygen IV fluid replacement and full monitoring will be continued&#xD;
      intraoperatively. Intravenous sedation will be used at the discretion of the attending&#xD;
      anesthetist and according to the patient's wishes as is the standard of care at our&#xD;
      institution. The dose of sedative and / or analgesic drugs will be recorded. Attendants will&#xD;
      be asked to avoid any intraoperative steroid therapy. Surgical duration will be recorded for&#xD;
      comparative analysis and exclusion of cases &lt;30 or &gt;180 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following surgery, patients will be transferred to the post-operative care unit (PACU) or&#xD;
      fast-tracked for discharge directly from the day case unit. The onset time of surgical pain&#xD;
      (if applicable) and first analgesic request will be recorded. Once oral intake is&#xD;
      established, patients will receive one of two analgesic preparations as needed; Tylenol#3速&#xD;
      (acetaminophen 300mg/codeine 30mg/caffeine 15mg per tablet) or Percocet速 (acetaminophen&#xD;
      325mg/oxycodone HCl 5mg) if intolerant to codeine. Patients will be evaluated at 1 and 2&#xD;
      hours postoperatively noting pain scores, analgesics received, block density and recovery&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On discharge from hospital, patients will receive a prescription of Tylenol#3速 as needed or&#xD;
      Percocet速 if intolerant to codeine. Patients will be given a home diary to complete. Patients&#xD;
      will be requested to record the time at which they first experience pain at the surgical&#xD;
      site, the time of first analgesic use and the time when they regain normal (or baseline&#xD;
      equivalent) strength in their fingers. Patients will be asked to complete diary entries at 8&#xD;
      hrs, 24hrs, 48hrs and 7 days post operatively. They will be asked to document their visual&#xD;
      analogue (VAS) pain score, cumulative analgesic consumption, side effects (numbness /&#xD;
      tingling in the operative arm, weakness in the operative arm, pain around the injection site,&#xD;
      bruising around the injection site, nausea and vomiting) and current VAS for satisfaction&#xD;
      pertaining to the analgesia received. Patients will be telephoned at the aforementioned times&#xD;
      to collect data from the diary, which was found the most reliable method of data collection&#xD;
      during a previous study. Finally, patients will be phoned at 3 months to ensure no long -&#xD;
      term numbness or weakness related to the nerve block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doses of oral codeine or oxycodone consumed by each patient will be converted into&#xD;
      equi-analgesic doses of oral morphine sulphate in order to facilitate comparison between&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
