    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical efficacy and toxicity of anti-PD-1&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody plus autologous dendritic cells-cytokine induced killer cell (DC-CIK)&#xD;
      immunotherapy combined with hyperthermia in advanced malignant mesothelioma&#xD;
      patients.Furthermore,to characterize response to therapy,the investigators intent to explore&#xD;
      the predictive biomarker for this regimen.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histological confirmed malignant mesothelioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have refused a first line platinum-based chemotherapy, or patients in&#xD;
             progression of disease after a maximum of one line of platinum-based therapy for&#xD;
             advanced disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Estimated life expectancy &gt; 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0,1 or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 to 80.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients whose most recent major surgery or drug or radiation therapy for malignant&#xD;
             tumors, if any, was at least 4 weeks ago at the subject enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)&#xD;
             criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate hematologic function, with WBC ≥ 3000/microliter, hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL (it is&#xD;
             acceptable to have had prior transfusion), platelets ≥ 75,000/microliter; PT-INR &lt;1.5&#xD;
             (unless patient is receiving warfarin in which case PT-INR must be &lt;3), PTT &lt;1.5X ULN&#xD;
             Adequate renal and hepatic function, with serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL, bilirubin &lt;&#xD;
             1.5 mg/dL (except for Gilbert's syndrome which will allow bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL), ALT&#xD;
             and AST ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in another clinical study with an investigational product during the&#xD;
             last 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  Patients with known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or&#xD;
             carcinomatous meningitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with serious intercurrent chronic or acute illness, such as cardiac disease&#xD;
             (NYHA class III or IV), hepatic disease, or other illness considered by the Principal&#xD;
             Investigator as unwarranted high risk for investigational drug treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a medical or psychological impediment to probable compliance with the&#xD;
             protocol should be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of an active acute or chronic infection including: a urinary tract infection,&#xD;
             HIV (as determined by ELISA and confirmed by Western Blot). Patients with HIV are&#xD;
             excluded based on immuno-suppression, which may render them unable to respond to the&#xD;
             vaccine;patients with chronic hepatitis are excluded because of concern that hepatitis&#xD;
             could be exacerbated by the injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on chronic steroid therapy (or other immuno-suppressives, such as&#xD;
             azathioprine or cyclosporin A) are excluded on the basis of potential immune&#xD;
             suppression. Patients must have had 6 weeks of discontinuation of any steroid therapy&#xD;
             (except that used as pre-medication for chemotherapy or contrast-enhanced studies or&#xD;
             for acute treatment (&lt;5 days) of intercurrent medical condition such as a gout flare)&#xD;
             prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and nursing women should be excluded from the protocol since this research&#xD;
             may have unknown and harmful effects on an unborn child or on young children. If the&#xD;
             patient is sexually active, the patient must agree to use a medically acceptable form&#xD;
             of birth control while receiving treatment and for a period of 4 months following the&#xD;
             last therapy. It is not known whether the treatment used in this study could affect&#xD;
             the sperm and could potentially harm a child that may be fathered while on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients evidence of interstitial lung disease will be excluded.&#xD;
