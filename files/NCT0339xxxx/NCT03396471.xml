      Single-arm phase 2 study to examine pembrolizumab and concurrent radiation to induce an&#xD;
      abscopal effect in patients with previously treated carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP16-268)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a proof-of-principle single-arm phase 2 study in patients with previously treated&#xD;
      CUP. All patients receive pembrolizumab combined with RT to a metastatic site, so as to&#xD;
      induce an abscopal tumor response. The treatment combination will be repeated with RT&#xD;
      delivery to a second metastatic site in a non-overlapping RT field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be compared with historical control. The primary endpoint is the confirmed&#xD;
      response rate (RR) in a non-irradiated site based on best responding abscopal lesion. This&#xD;
      study will also evaluate the following secondary endpoints: RR in a non-irradiated site based&#xD;
      on RECIST 1.1, adverse events, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS),&#xD;
      time-to-progression (TTP), and disease control rate (DCR).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health&#xD;

             tissue prior to start of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 72&#xD;
             hours prior to registration. NOTE: If the urine test is positive or cannot be&#xD;
             confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. NOTE: breast milk&#xD;
             cannot be stored for future use while the mother is being treated on study&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Willingness to provide tissue and blood samples for correlative research purposes&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior radiation to an area of the body which, if included in the current radiation&#xD;
             field, poses an unacceptably high risk of toxicity in the opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
             NOTE: A prior field that overlaps with the current field, by itself, does not exclude&#xD;
             the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any of the following&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Melanoma. NOTE: Positive tumor staining for S-100 or HMB45 alone does not exclude&#xD;
                  patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If immunostains are performed, and any of the below tests are positive:&#xD;
&#xD;

                       evidence for either lung or thyroid cancer (e.g. a dominant lung mass) are&#xD;
                       still eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Progressed on 4 or more lines of prior chemotherapy for this cancer. NOTE:&#xD;
             Bisphosphonates and neoadjuvant/adjuvant anticancer therapies (including locally&#xD;
             directed therapies) do not count as a line of therapy with regard to this exclusion&#xD;
             criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Co-morbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment&#xD;
             of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or&#xD;
             interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the&#xD;
             prescribed regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study&#xD;
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational&#xD;

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment. NOTE: Inhaled steroids or steroid injections for joint&#xD;
             disease are allowed.&#xD;

             Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events&#xD;
             due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other active malignancy which requires current treatment and which in the opinion of&#xD;
             the site investigator is likely to interfere with evaluation of disease assessment.&#xD;
             NOTE: Continuation of hormonal therapies is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;

             prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned&#xD;
             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using&#xD;
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include&#xD;
             carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery ≤ 4 weeks from registration. NOTE: Diagnostic laparoscopy (without other&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit&#xD;
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients in whom planned RT fields will include the heart, any of the following&#xD;
             heart conditions, if in the opinion of the investigator they pose unacceptably high&#xD;
             risk when combined with study treatment:&#xD;

               -  Prior symptomatic congestive heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Documented myocardial infarction ≤6 months prior to registration (pretreatment&#xD;

        of cardiac disease, or for prior history of cardiac disease. These conditions include but&#xD;
        are not limited to diseases related to cardiac valves, pericardium, myocardium,&#xD;
        atrioventricular delays or arrhythmias. It is strongly recommended that signs or symptoms&#xD;
        of potentially clinically significant disease be evaluated with comprehensive cardiac echo.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients in whom planned RT fields during the study will include the chest, any of&#xD;
             the following, if in the opinion of the site investigator they pose unacceptably high&#xD;
             risk when combined with study treatment:&#xD;

             the investigator they pose unacceptably high risk when combined with study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received live vaccine ≤ 30 days prior to registration. NOTE: Seasonal influenza&#xD;
             vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however&#xD;
