  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to detect persisting or early new activity of choroidal&#xD;
      neovascularization (CNV) due to age related macular degeneration (AMD) during the first 12&#xD;
      months following the first ranibizumab dose at baseline as assessed by weekly high resolution&#xD;
      optical coherence tomography (OCT). Detection of persisting or new signs of CNV activity at&#xD;
      OCT triggers further ranibizumab treatments considering that any ranibizumab injections can&#xD;
      maximally be applied as often as 2-weekly.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, 1-arm, monocenter study designed to evaluate the time course of early&#xD;
      re-activation of CNV assessed by High Resolution OCT. An OCT-guided high frequency (up to&#xD;
      2-weekly) intravitreal ranibizumab treatment in CNV due to AMD may prevent further growth and&#xD;
      early re-growth of CNV as evaluated by OCT at a weekly basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting, enrolled patients will receive one 0.5 mg ranibizumab intravitreal injection at&#xD;
      baseline (month 0). Afterwards all patients will undergo a weekly OCT assessment. Further&#xD;
      treatments, which can maximally be applied as often as 2-weekly, are triggered by persisting&#xD;
      or new signs of CNV activity at OCT as defined by intraretinal cysts or subretinal fluid. For&#xD;
      this study, a month is defined as 28 days, a 2-week period as 14 days. During the 12-month&#xD;
      study period, a maximum of 24 ranibizumab injections may be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis will not be performed. The study will be conducted in compliance with the&#xD;
      protocol, GCP and the applicable regulatory requirement(s).&#xD;
