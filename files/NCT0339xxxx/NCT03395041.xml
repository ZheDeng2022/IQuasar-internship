    <textblock>
      Recent studies have shown that the systemic inflammation caused by periodontal disease (PD)&#xD;
      can determine important changes in the coronary arteries, favoring atherosclerosis&#xD;
      progression and development of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). The aim of ATHERODENT study is&#xD;
      to assess the interrelation between PD, inflammation and progression of coronary&#xD;
      atherosclerosis in patients with ACS. Material and methods: This case-control observational&#xD;
      study will enroll 100 patients (group 1 - ACS and associated PD, and group 2 -ACS and no PD),&#xD;
      in whom the following data will be collected: (1) demographic and clinical data, (2)&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors, (3) full characterization of PD markers, (4) systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory biomarkers, (5) imaging biomarkers derived from transthoracic echocardiography,&#xD;
      computed tomography, coronary angiography, optical coherence tomography and intravascular&#xD;
      ultrasound, and (6) assessment of the presence of specific oral bacteria in samples of&#xD;
      coronary plaques collected by coronary atherectomy, which will be performed during&#xD;
      percutaneous revascularization interventions, when indicated in selected cases, in the&#xD;
      atherectomy sub-study. The follow-up will be performed at 1, 3, 6, 12, 15, 18 and 24 months.&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study will be represented by the rate of major adverse&#xD;
      cardiovascular events (MACE rates) in PD vs non-PD patients and in correlation with: (1) the&#xD;
      level of systemic inflammation triggered by PD and/or by ACS at baseline; (2) the&#xD;
      vulnerability degree of atheromatous plaques in the coronary tree (culprit and non-culprit&#xD;
      lesions); and (3) the presence and burden of oral bacteria in atheromatous plaques. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints will be represented by: (1) the rate of progression of vulnerability degree of&#xD;
      non-culprit coronary plaques; (2) the rate of progression of atheromatous burden and calcium&#xD;
      scoring of the coronary tree; and (3) the rate of occurrence of left ventricular remodeling&#xD;
      and postinfarction heart failure.&#xD;

      ATHERODENT is a case-controlled observational clinical study, conducted in two clinical&#xD;
      sites: University of Medicine and Pharmacy Tirgu Mures, Romania, and Cardio Med Medical&#xD;
      Center - Laboratory of Advanced Research in Multimodality Imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of ATHERODENT is to assess the interrelation between PD, inflammation&#xD;
      and atherosclerosis progression in patients who suffered an ACS and have concomitant PD vs&#xD;
      those with ACS and no PD, using (1) invasive and non-invasive imaging techniques for&#xD;
      characterization of vulnerable coronary plaques; (2) full characterization of PD; and (3)&#xD;
      complex assessment of systemic vulnerability based on systemic inflammation-related&#xD;
      biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of ATHERODENT are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to study the correlation between PD and coronary plaque vulnerability&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to assess the correlation between PD and severity of coronary atherosclerosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to assess the presence and burden of oral bacteria in coronary atheromatous plaques&#xD;
           collected during atherectomy and their relation with plaque vulnerability and evolution&#xD;
           following an ACS (in the atherectomy sub-study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline will be considered as the moment of the index event and related hospitalization. The&#xD;
      index event will be considered the ACS and patients will be randomized in the study at&#xD;
      maximum 7 days post ACS. The follow-up visits will be performed at 1, 3, 6, 12, 15, 18 and 24&#xD;
      months after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following procedures will be performed at baseline:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. recording of demographic and clinical data (age, gender, personal history)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. determination of serum lipids, blood counts, glycemia, urea, creatinine, liver enzymes&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. determination of the biomarkers expressing the severity of the acute coronary syndrome&#xD;
           and heart damage (hs-Troponin, NT-proBNP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. determination of serum levels inflammatory biomarkers and adhesion molecules at the&#xD;
           moment of the index event (hs-CRP, matrix metalloprotease, interleukin-6, VCAM, ICAM)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. determination of specific micro-RNAs related to plaque vulnerability&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. echocardiography (+ speckle tracking) for assessment of left ventricular function and&#xD;
           size&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. full characterization of PD (dental plaque/tartar, gingival retraction, gingival&#xD;
           bleeding, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. microbiological determination of oral bacteria from the periodontal pockets&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. non-invasive imaging by coronary angioCT for all the coronary tree and characterization&#xD;
           of vulnerability markers and atherosclerosis severity, using surrogate imaging&#xD;
           biomarkers such as calcium score, necrotic core, plaque burden, low density atheroma,&#xD;
           positive remodeling, epicardial fat volume&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. invasive imaging performed during invasive revascularization procedures, using&#xD;
           intracoronary imaging techniques (OCT, IVUS) and quantification of invasive imaging&#xD;
           biomarkers in culprit and non-culprit lesions, such as macrophage content, thickness of&#xD;
           fibrous cap and necrotic core.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. atherectomy of coronary culprit atheromatous plaques (in the atherectomy sub-study),&#xD;
           performed during the revascularization procedure when indicated, in selected cases,&#xD;
           followed by histological examination of the samples collected in order to identify&#xD;
           specific antigens related to oral microbiota in the atheromatous tissue of coronary&#xD;
           vulnerable plaques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up will be performed at 1, 3, 6, 12, 15, 18 and 24 months after randomization,&#xD;
      including assessment of clinical data, echocardiography and registration of MACE and adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, complex imaging assessment using Angio CT will be performed at 2 years to assess&#xD;
      atherosclerosis progression.&#xD;
