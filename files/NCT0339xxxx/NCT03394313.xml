  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are closely related. T2DM&#xD;
      risk equivalent for CVD and it remains the major cause of death in T2DM. Thus, patients with&#xD;
      T2DM and CVD disease are at very high-risk of CVD-related mortality. Therefore, more&#xD;
      aggressive metabolic and hemodynamic control is required in such patients to improve the&#xD;
      prognosis. We recently initiated a cardio-metabolic clinical service at the Heart Hospital,&#xD;
      where T2DM patients with existing CVD are simultaneously examined by Cardiologist and&#xD;
      Diabetologist for optimal metabolic and hemodynamic control. We would like to start a&#xD;
      clinical registry for all patients who attend this clinical service to collect import&#xD;
      clinical data about this population. This registry will serve an important source for future&#xD;
      clinical research in the field.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Various investigators have shown that type 2 diabetes is associated with out-of-hospital&#xD;
      cardiac arrest and mortality due sudden cardiac arrest [1,2]. In comparison to non-diabetic&#xD;
      patients, those with T2DM possess greater risk of cardiovascular morbidity and deaths, and&#xD;
      are considerably influenced by cardiovascular disease [3]. To assess the potential benefit of&#xD;
      T2DM prevention and treatment, as well as the future burden of T2DM-associated diseases can&#xD;
      help in better understanding of the T2DM and the risk of chronic cardiovascular&#xD;
      manifestations is warranted [4]. Herein, we would like to start a clinical registry for all&#xD;
      patients who attend this clinical service to collect import clinical data about this&#xD;
      population. This registry will serve an important source for scientific information that can&#xD;
      be used in future to design clinical research studies for better patient care and management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cardio-metabolic clinic has been recently established in the Heart Hospital to provide&#xD;
      state-of-the-art care for patients with T2DM and established heart disease, e.g. ischemic&#xD;
      heart disease, heart failure, etc. the health information of all patients attending the&#xD;
      cardio-metabolic Clinic for the care of their disease who provide their consent for the use&#xD;
      of their health information in the registry will be added to the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A data base for this registry will be created in Cerner which will be password protected.&#xD;
      Clinical information about patients attending the cardiometabolic clinic in the Heart&#xD;
      Hospital will be collected. Data will include demographics (age, gender, and nationality),&#xD;
      vital signs (Pulse rate, blood pressure), waist circumference , Weight, Canadian&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Class, New York Heart Association ( NYHA) class, history of&#xD;

      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: patients with T2DM and established heart disease, such as ischemic heart&#xD;
      disease, heart failure, etc. will be included in the study after obtaining the informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Subjects who do not have T2DM and existing heart disease will be excluded&#xD;
      from the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treating physicians will enter the list of patients attended his clinic to Power Trial.&#xD;
      The study investigators will update the list of the patients attended the cardio-metabolic&#xD;
      clinic on daily basis and the registry will transfer the information from the Cerner to the&#xD;
      registry database. The clinical service has been start from September 15, 2017, and each&#xD;
      patient who attended the clinic will be added to the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This registry is prospectively collecting the information from Cerner Clinical Viewer. For&#xD;
      future research the investigators who wish to utilize the registry data for their research&#xD;
      will have to seek Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval for their research proposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent Informed consent will be obtained from each patient who will attend the&#xD;
      cardiometabolic clinic to allow us to capture his clinical information into the registry&#xD;
      database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Withdrawal/ Withdrawal of Consent If the subjects withdraw his consent, the&#xD;
      information about his future follow-up visits in the clinic will not be added to the&#xD;
      registry. However, previous data added to the registry will continue to be available.&#xD;
