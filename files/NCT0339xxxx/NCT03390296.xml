      This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of anti-OX40 antibody&#xD;
      PF-04518600 (OX40) and how well it works alone or in combination with venetoclax, avelumab,&#xD;
      glasdegib, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, and azacitidine in treating patients with acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia that has come back or does not respond to treatment. Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as OX40, avelumab, and gemtuzumab ozogamicin, may help the body's immune&#xD;
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. Glasdegib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed&#xD;
      for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as venetoclax and azacitidine, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving OX40, venetoclax, avelumab,&#xD;
      glasdegib, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, and azacitidine may work better in treating patients with&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety of multiple combination regimens of IO-agents (PF04518600 [Ox40&#xD;
      agonist monoclonal antibody (mAb)], avelumab [PD-L1 antagonist mAb], hypomethylator therapy&#xD;
      (azacitidine), anti CD33 mAb (gemtuzumab ozogamycin, GO), Bcl-2 inhibitor (venetoclax) and&#xD;

      myeloid leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the composite complete response (CRc) defined as complete response (CR) +&#xD;
      complete response with incomplete recovery of platelets (CRp) + complete response with&#xD;
      incomplete recovery of counts (CRi) within 3 months of therapy initiation in patients with RR&#xD;
      AML of: Arm A. PF-04518600 alone, Arm B. azacitidine + venetoclax + GO, Arm C. azacitidine +&#xD;
      aveluma + GO, Arm D. azacitidine + venetoclax + avelumab, Arm E. Azacitidine + avelumab +&#xD;
      PF-04518600, Arm F. GO + glasdegib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the morphologic leukemia free survival (MLFS), partial response (PR),&#xD;
      hematologic improvement (HI) rate of patients with RR AML treated on arms A-F.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess relapse-free survival (RFS), time to next therapy (TNT), 4-week and 8-week&#xD;
      mortality, and overall survival (OS) of patients with RR AML treated on arms A-F.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess minimal residual disease (MRD) by multiparametric flow-cytometry at response&#xD;
      (+/- 1 month) and assess correlation of MRD to OS in arms A-F.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To study immunological and molecular features at baseline and at predefined time-points&#xD;
      on-therapy with each combination in the peripheral blood and bone marrow to include&#xD;
      quantification of immune ligand expression by the AML/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) blasts&#xD;
      and AML/MDS stromal components (myeloid-derived suppressor cell [MDSC]s, monocytes and&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cell [MSC]s) including galectin 9, 4-1BBL, ICOSL, PD-L1, PD-L2, OX-40L,&#xD;
      CD137L, others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To study immunological and molecular features at baseline and at predefined time-points&#xD;
      on-therapy with each combination in the peripheral blood and bone marrow to include&#xD;
      determination of the quantitative expression of positive and negative co-stimulatory&#xD;
      molecules including 4-1BB, CTLA-4, ICOS, PD-1, OX40, LAG-3, TIM-3, HLA-DR, Ki67, others on&#xD;
      T-lymphocyte subsets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To study immunological and molecular features at baseline and at predefined time-points&#xD;
      on-therapy with each combination in the peripheral blood and bone marrow to include&#xD;
      identification of the immunophenotype of tumor-infiltrating T-lymphocytes (TILs) pre- and&#xD;
      post-therapy including CD8+, CD4+ effector, CD4+ regulatory TILs and central memory, effector&#xD;
      memory, and naive T-cell subsets among the CD4 and CD8 populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To develop a micro-array based gene expression profile (GEP) predictor of response to the&#xD;
      immune combinations using either baseline ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing and/or&#xD;
      nanostring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To perform a validated next generation sequencing (NGS)-based analysis for the detection&#xD;
      of somatic mutations in the coding sequences of 28 genes commonly mutated in AML at baseline&#xD;
      and on treatment to identify baseline predictors and clonal evolution on treatment and/or&#xD;
      whole exome sequencing (WES) in selected cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To identify clonal T-cells by performing T-cell repertoire analysis at baseline and&#xD;
      longitudinally on therapy on the peripheral blood and/o bone marrow samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To assess levels of cytokines at baseline and longitudinally on therapy in peripheral&#xD;
      blood and/or bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ARMS A-G: RR AML: Patients with AML who are refractory or relapsed (any salvage) with&#xD;
             no available therapies or not candidates for available therapies. For patients with&#xD;
             prior MDS or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) or myeloproliferative neoplasm&#xD;
             (MPN) who transformed to AML, therapy received for MDS, CMML, or MPN is NOT considered&#xD;
             as prior therapy for AML with the exception of MDS or CMML treated with&#xD;
             hypomethylating agents (HMAs). Patients with MDS or CMML treated with HMA therapies&#xD;
             who progress to AML, and have no available therapies or are not candidates for&#xD;
             available therapies, will be eligible at the time of progression to AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy with hydroxyurea, chemotherapy, biological or targeted therapy (e.g.&#xD;
             FLT3 inhibitors, other kinase inhibitors), or hematopoietic growth factors is&#xD;
             permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 2.0 times upper limit of normal (x ULN).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase =&lt; 2.5 x ULN (aspartate&#xD;
             aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase =&lt; 5.0 x ULN if deemed related to&#xD;
             leukemia by the treating physician).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate renal function defined by an estimated creatinine clearance &gt;= 40 mL/min&#xD;
             according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula (or local institutional standard method).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the absence of rapidly progressive disease, the interval from prior treatment to&#xD;
             the time of initiation of protocol therapy will be at least 14 days for prior&#xD;
             anti-leukemic therapy, with the exception of hydroxyurea as noted below, OR at least 5&#xD;
             half-lives for cytotoxic/noncytotoxic agents, whichever is shorter. The half-life for&#xD;
             the therapy in question will be based on published pharmacokinetic literature&#xD;
             (abstracts, manuscripts, investigator brochure's, or drug-administration manuals) and&#xD;
             will be documented in the protocol eligibility document. The toxicity from prior&#xD;
             therapy should have resolved to grade =&lt; 1, however alopecia and sensory neuropathy&#xD;
             grade =&lt; 2 not constituting a safety risk based on investigators judgement is&#xD;
             acceptable. Since the effect of most IO-agents, HMA-therapies, SMO-inhibitors,&#xD;
             venetoclax may be delayed, use of hydroxyurea for patients with rapidly proliferative&#xD;
             disease is allowed before the start of study therapy and will not require a washout.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent therapy for central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis or continuation of&#xD;
             therapy for controlled CNS disease is permitted. Patients with a known history of CNS&#xD;
             disease or leukemic brain metastasis must have been treated locally, have at least 3&#xD;
             consecutive lumbar punctures (LPs) with no evidence of CNS leukemia, and must be&#xD;
             clinically stable for at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment and have no ongoing&#xD;
             neurological symptoms that in the opinion of the treating physician are related to the&#xD;
             CNS disease (sequelae that are a consequence of the treatment of the CNS disease are&#xD;
             acceptable).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females must be surgically or biologically sterile or postmenopausal (amenorrheic for&#xD;
             at least 12 months) or if of childbearing potential, must have a negative serum or&#xD;
             urine pregnancy test within 72 hours before the start of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of contraception&#xD;
             during the study and until 3 months after the last treatment. Males must be surgically&#xD;
             or biologically sterile or agree to use an adequate method of contraception during the&#xD;
             study until 3 months after the last treatment. Adequate methods of contraception&#xD;
             include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.&#xD;
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has&#xD;
                  been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients on&#xD;
                  the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that&#xD;
                  patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Combination of any of the two following:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or&#xD;
                       other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure&#xD;
                       rate &lt; 1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone&#xD;
                       contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).&#xD;

                       cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal&#xD;
                       suppository in case of use of oral contraception, women should have been&#xD;
                       stable on the same pill before taking study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Oral contraceptives are allowed but should be used in conjunction with a&#xD;
                  barrier method of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction.&#xD;
                  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they&#xD;
                  have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate&#xD;
                  clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have&#xD;
                  had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal&#xD;
                  ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the&#xD;
                  reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level&#xD;
                  assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.&#xD;
