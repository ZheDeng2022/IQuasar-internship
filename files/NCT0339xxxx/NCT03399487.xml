  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the most leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Most of the&#xD;
      patients with lung cancer are advanced stage at the time of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two oncogenes that are important in lung cancer are epidermal growth factor receptor&#xD;
      (EGFR) and K-ras, mutated in 10% and 15% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.&#xD;
      Large-scale DNA sequencing efforts have identified mutations in BRAF, PI3KCA and ERBB2 that&#xD;
      together represent another 5% of NSCLC patients. The success of EGFR tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitors (TKIs), such as gefitinib or erlotinib, and more recently ALK/MET TKI, crizotinib,&#xD;
      highlights the need to develop more genetically matched therapies. Therefore, genetic&#xD;
      classification of lung cancer has become increasingly important along with the advances with&#xD;
      targeted therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ROS1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase with constitutive kinase activity. ROS1 was previously&#xD;
      discovered in cell lines where ROS1 fused with other proteins to act as a driver oncogene. In&#xD;
      2007, Rikova et al reported ROS1 fusion as driver mutations in NSCLC cell line (HCC78;&#xD;
      SLC34A2-ROS1) and NSCLC patient (CD74-ROS1). Li et al also found about 1% of samples&#xD;
      harboring CD74-ROS1 fusion in 202 resected lung adenocarcinomas from never smokers. The&#xD;
      incidence was as high as 10% in East Asian population. Currently there are now at least 13&#xD;
      ROS1 fusion variants involving 8 fusion partners (CD74-, SLC34A2-, FIG-, TPM3-, SDC4-,&#xD;
      LRIG3-, ERZ-, KDERL2-) identified in ROS1 positive NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, preclinical and clinical data have shown ROS1-positive tumors are sensitive to&#xD;
      crizotinib, because of potentially high common amino acid residues in the kinase domain&#xD;
      between ALK and ROS1, which explain why crizotinib can inhibit both ROS1 and ALK to similar&#xD;
      extent. Preliminary report from a phase I clinical trial of crizotinib in the ROS1-positive&#xD;
      NSCLC expansion cohort showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 57%. Given that crizotinib&#xD;
      has made remarkable clinical outcomes in phase I trial of ALK-positive NSCLC patients,&#xD;
      clinical development of ROS1 inhibitors, including crizotinib, should be accelerated to&#xD;
      provide targeted therapies to ROS1-positive NSCLC patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, our group found the prevalence of ROS1 rearrangement reached up to 3.2% in&#xD;
      clinically selected population (never smokers) and 5% in genetically selected population&#xD;
      (EGFR-/ALK-wild-type). These data strongly suggests that ROS1 rearrangement is a potential&#xD;
      therapeutic target with relatively high incidence. In this study, investigator confirmed the&#xD;
      presence of ROS1 fusion by RT-PCR and correlation between FISH and IHC (Cell Signaling&#xD;
      Technology®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      LDK378 is an orally highly selective and potent ALK kinase inhibitor. In preclinical studies,&#xD;
      LDK378 has much lower IC50 values than crizotinib in cell lines engineered to express ROS1&#xD;
      rearrangement (0.15 nM versus 3 nM) and is approximately 20-fold more potent. LDK378 is a&#xD;
      potent inhibitor of tumor growth in rodent models of both ALCL and NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators suggest a phase II trial of LDK378 in advanced non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      patients with ROS1 rearrangement. The aim of current trial is to evaluate the antitumor&#xD;
      efficacy and safety profile of LDK378.&#xD;
