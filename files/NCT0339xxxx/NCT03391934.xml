      and assessor blinded), active controlled, and equivalency clinical trial with primary&#xD;
      endpoint of Progression-Free Survival of Cetuximab® (produced by CinnaGen) compared with&#xD;
      Erbitux® (Cetuximab, the reference drug) in patients with RAS wild-type Metastatic Colorectal&#xD;
      Cancer with the allocation ratio of 2:1.Patients who met the following criteria could be&#xD;
      recruited to receive the mentioned intervention randomly. Inclusion criteria: Male or female&#xD;

      The treatment modalities did not destroy or modify the cancer cells, The tumor either became&#xD;
      larger (disease progression) or stayed the same size after treatment, Discontinuation of&#xD;
      treatment, Death from any cause&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and Immunogenicity will also be assessed during the study.&#xD;
