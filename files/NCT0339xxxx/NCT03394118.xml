    <textblock>
      This study is designed to be a phase II, Open-label, single-arm, single-center study to&#xD;
      evaluate anti-tumor efficacy of TAGRISSO in NSCLC patients in whom T790 mutations are&#xD;
      detected by liquid biopsy using at least one of the samples such as plasma, bronchoalveolar&#xD;
      lavage fluid, and pleural effusion. Approximately 63 patients will be enrolled into the&#xD;
      trial, and expected study duration is 43 months from IRB and Korea: MFDA approval date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will continue the study drug (Osimertinib) until disease progression or&#xD;
      manifestation of unacceptable toxicity during the study period. The study drug will be&#xD;
      administered orally as one 80 mg tablet once a day. The initial dose of the study drug 80 mg&#xD;
      daily can be reduced to 40 mg once daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cycle of study treatment is defined as 28 days. Patients will be enrolled for 31 months and&#xD;
      will be followed-up regularly, and duration of follow-up for each patient will be 12 months.&#xD;
