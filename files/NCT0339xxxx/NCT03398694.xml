    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Radiosurgery</intervention_name>
    <description>Stereotactic radiosurgery will be delivered on all patients utilizing gamma knife or linear accelerator based techniques as per RTOG-9005 dosing criteria (Section 11 Table 1) based on tumor diameter with the exception that the largest lesion diameter to be treated with 15 Gy will be 5 cm. All apparent, previously untreated brain metastases will be treated with radiosurgery at this time.&#xD;
Radiosurgery will be performed 1-4 days prior to surgical resection. Vital signs and MRI Brain planning scan will be performed on the day of radiosurgery prior to the procedure.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Radiographically confirmed solid tumor brain metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Criteria for surgical resection of at least one metastasis per neurosurgeon discretion&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A diagnostic MRI Brain or CT Head demonstrating the presence of 1-4 solid tumor brain&#xD;
             metastases and lesion to be resected no more than 5 cm in any direction, performed&#xD;
             within 30 days prior to stereotactic radiosurgery. If multiple lesions are present,&#xD;
             then the total brain metastases volume can be no more than 30 cm3 excluding the lesion&#xD;
             to be resected.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. For known primary included in brainmetgpa.com, an estimated median survival no less&#xD;
             than 6 months per brainmetgpa.com&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. For unknown primary or known primary not included within brainmetgpa.com, an estimated&#xD;
             median survival no less than 6 months per PI discretion Note: If patient's estimated&#xD;
             median survival is calculated using a histology that is different than the histology&#xD;
             demonstrated in final pathology, the patient may remain eligible for all study&#xD;
             endpoints per PI discretion&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Surgical candidate per neurosurgeon discretion&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Surgical resection able to be performed within 1 - 4 days after radiosurgery&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Ability to provide written informed consent and HIPAA authorization. This will be&#xD;
             assessed by the consenting physician using general questions to determine the&#xD;
             patient's ability to understand the medical problem, proposed treatment, alternatives&#xD;
             to proposed treatment, and understand the consequences of the medical choices.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Platelet count &gt; 100 k/cumm, Hgb &gt; 7.5 gm/dL, INR &lt; 1.3, ANC &gt; 1.5 k/cumm&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients currently on cytotoxic chemotherapy or immunotherapy are eligible, not&#xD;
             including anti-VEGF therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. If a patient who meets all stated eligibility criteria is enrolled on study and then&#xD;
             discovered to be ineligible, the tissue obtained will still be deemed eligible to&#xD;
             remain in study for evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who received anti-VEGF therapy within 6 weeks prior to enrollment, as there&#xD;
             is increased risk of fatal brain hemorrhage with surgical resection&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Major medical illnesses or psychiatric impairments, which in the investigator's&#xD;
             opinion will prevent administration or completion of the protocol therapy and/or&#xD;
             interfere with follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with more than 4 brain metastases on MRI Brain or CT Head&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Lesion to be resected is more than 5 cm&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Total volume of metastatic disease more than 30 cm3 excluding lesion to be resected&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with leptomeningeal metastases documented by MRI or CSF evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Previous whole brain radiation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Previous radiation therapy to lesion to be resected&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Planned adjuvant focal therapy including additional radiation therapy to the brain&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Not a surgical candidate per neurosurgeon's discretion&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Not a radiosurgical candidate per radiation oncologist's discretion&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Surgery unable to be performed between 1 - 4 days after radiosurgery&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Women who are pregnant or nursing are not eligible as treatment involves unforeseeable&#xD;
             risks to the fetus or child&#xD;
