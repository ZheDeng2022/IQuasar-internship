    <textblock>
      Accumulating evidence suggests that the natriuretic peptide (NP) hormonal system has&#xD;
      important effects on metabolism. However, more information is needed to better understand the&#xD;
      effects of NPs on metabolism in humans. Therefore, the investigators propose a study to&#xD;
      determine the effects of b-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) on energy and fat metabolism in&#xD;
      humans. The investigators' primary hypothesis is that the administration of BNP will increase&#xD;
      energy expenditure in humans. The investigators' secondary hypothesis is that BNP&#xD;
      administration will promote changes in gene expression in fat tissue suggestive of fat&#xD;
      &quot;beiging&quot; in humans. Interventions that safely increase energy expenditure and promote fat&#xD;
      &quot;beiging&quot; represent potential strategies for treating metabolic dysfunction due to obesity.&#xD;

      As of 10/23/2020: awaiting supply of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The natriuretic peptide (NP) hormonal system is well-known for its important role&#xD;
      in blood pressure regulation. However, accumulating evidence suggests that the NPs have&#xD;
      significant effects on metabolism as well. For instance, administration of B-type natriuretic&#xD;
      peptide (BNP) to wild-type mice leads to increased energy expenditure, changes in gene&#xD;
      expression in fat tissue suggestive of fat &quot;beiging&quot; (which may be associated with&#xD;
      cardiovascular and metabolic benefits), and reduced fat accumulation. Although recent studies&#xD;
      in rodents suggest that NPs have important metabolic effects, there are few prospective data&#xD;
      on the metabolic effects of NPs in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators propose a physiologic, proof-of-concept study to determine the&#xD;
      acute effects of b-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) on energy and fat metabolism in humans. The&#xD;
      investigators' primary hypothesis is that the administration of BNP will increase energy&#xD;
      expenditure in humans. The investigators' secondary hypothesis is that BNP administration&#xD;
      will promote changes in gene expression in adipose tissue suggestive of a &quot;beige&quot; fat&#xD;
      phenotype in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan: The investigators propose the following research plan to address the&#xD;
      investigators' specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim: To investigate the acute effects of administration of BNP on energy expenditure&#xD;
      in humans. The investigators propose a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in 50&#xD;
      adults (25 lean and 25 obese) without significant medical problems. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to intravenous infusion of recombinant human BNP1-32 or normal saline (control),&#xD;
      with assessment of energy expenditure and other physiologic measures. After a 7-day washout&#xD;
      period, subjects will then undergo the other intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim: To determine the acute effects of BNP on gene expression in white adipose&#xD;
      tissue in humans. The investigators will assess markers suggestive of fat beiging in&#xD;
      subcutaneous white adipose tissue biopsies after BNP infusion vs. control. This secondary aim&#xD;
      will allow us to explore potential mechanisms underlying the hypothesized changes in energy&#xD;
      expenditure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In this cross-over study, each subject will receive BNP infusion at one visit and&#xD;
      control at the other visit, in random order. The sequence of the treatments will be&#xD;
      randomized. There will be a washout period (at least 14 days) between visits. Subjects will&#xD;
      be stratified by BMI category (lean or obese). To address the Primary Aim, energy expenditure&#xD;
      will be assessed via indirect calorimetry (metabolic cart). To address the Secondary Aim,&#xD;
      subcutaneous fat biopsies will be performed, and tissue will be analyzed for gene expression&#xD;
      of markers suggestive of fat beiging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Relevance: This study will generate novel human data regarding the effects of the&#xD;
      NPs on energy metabolism and adipose tissue. Interventions that safely increase energy&#xD;
      expenditure and promote a beige fat phenotype represent potential strategies for treating&#xD;
      obesity-associated metabolic dysfunction. The overarching scientific goals of this line of&#xD;
      investigation are (1) to elucidate the role of the natriuretic peptide system in&#xD;
      cardiometabolic health in humans, and (2) to investigate the potential for NP directed&#xD;
      therapies in obesity-associated cardiometabolic dysfunction.&#xD;
