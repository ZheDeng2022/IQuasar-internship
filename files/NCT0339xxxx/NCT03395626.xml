  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Probiotics, which are part of the human body, are microorganisms, which are known to have&#xD;
      beneficial effects when consumed in a certain amount, and have the function of controlling&#xD;
      intestinal flora and inhibiting inflammation. Recently, probiotics have received much&#xD;
      attention in the treatment of hypersensitivity syndrome. The aim of this study was to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of probiotic strains, ID-JPL934, in the diagnosis of irritable bowel&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall satisfaction with improvement of bowel habits such as diarrhea and constipation as&#xD;
      well as abdominal discomfort and abdominal discomfort in the group receiving ID-JPL934&#xD;
      capsules (test food group or test group) and control group (control food group or control&#xD;
      group) (0-10 point visual analogue scale) for each symptom before and after ingestion to&#xD;
      evaluate the degree of improvement of the symptoms. The purpose of this study was to&#xD;
      investigate the relationship between bacterial composition changes in the stool and the&#xD;
      improvement of symptoms in the patients before and after ingestion.&#xD;
