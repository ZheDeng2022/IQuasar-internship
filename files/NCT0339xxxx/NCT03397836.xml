      The Health Teams Advancing Patient Experience: Strengthening Quality (Health TAPESTRY) is a&#xD;
      community-based program led by primary care teams, that creates connections between trained&#xD;
      community volunteers, interprofessional health care teams, novel technology and community&#xD;
      engagement through improved system navigation. The overall vision is to help people stay&#xD;
      healthier for longer in the places where they live.&#xD;

      The Health Teams Advancing Patient Experience: Strengthening Quality (Health TAPESTRY)&#xD;
      involves recording a person's life and health goals, screening for health risks and needs,&#xD;
      and then initiating a plan that supports achievement of those goals and address risks and&#xD;
      needs. It includes four parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Trained volunteers connect with clients (patients) in their home to gather health and&#xD;
           social information and discuss and record life and health goals&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Interprofessional health care teams provide health care services to the client and&#xD;
           focuses on a plan to support them on meeting their health goals&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Technology is used to collect and share information&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Community engagement connects clients with resources and supports in the community&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial findings from Implementation Phase I: 6-month unblinded delayed intervention&#xD;
      pragmatic randomized controlled trial that took place in Hamilton, ON (HiREB File #14-726,&#xD;
      Clinical Trials.gov NCT02283723) showed significant differences between the intervention and&#xD;
      control group. Specifically, at 6-months the it was found:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a reduction in the intervention group versus control group in self-reported time sitting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an increase in minutes walking in the intervention group versus the control group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an increase in number of primary care visits in the intervention group versus the&#xD;
           control group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a reduction in odds of people experiencing 1 or more hospitalizations in the&#xD;
           intervention group versus the control group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding the feasibility of implementing Health TAPESTRY in other primary care sites is&#xD;
      important to evaluate its potential as an approach. Replication of these initial findings are&#xD;
      critical in terms of empirical support for the approach as well as spread and scalability in&#xD;
      the wider primary health care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six sites have been identified as Health TAPESTRY-Ontario implementation sites. It should be&#xD;
      noted that all appropriate site approvals will be obtained prior to implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Niagara North Family Health Team (Niagara-on-the-Lake) (Mary Keith, executive Lead; Dr.&#xD;
           Karen Berti, family health team lead)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. McMaster Family Health Team (Hamilton) (Doug Oliver, family health team lead)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Superior Family Health Team (Sault Ste Marie) (Michelle Brisbois, executive lead, Dr.&#xD;
           Sarah White, family health team lead)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Dufferin and Area Family Health Team (Dufferin County) (Lianne Barbour, executive Lead,&#xD;
           Dr. Mercedes Rodriguez, family health team lead)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Windsor Family Health Team (Windsor and surrounding area) (Sara Dalo, executive lead)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Harrow Family Health Team (Harrow and surrounding communities) (Margo Reilly, executive&#xD;
           lead, Dr. Alexandra Lindberg, family health team lead)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A broad alliance between Canadian Red Cross and the Department of Family Medicine has been&#xD;
      made, with Health TAPESTRY being a part of that alliance. As part of this partnership, the&#xD;
      Canadian Red Cross partner will recruit, train, schedule, and retain community volunteers to&#xD;
      operate in the 6 sites.&#xD;

    <description>Physical activity will be measured by the Short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Respondents indicate how many days in the past seven days and for how many minutes they have engaged in vigorous and moderate intensity activity and walking activity. Scores are calculated by multiplying the days by the number of minutes on one day, by the metabolic equivalent of task (8.0,4.0 and 3.3 for vigorous, moderate, walking activity respectively). Minimum score is of the scale is zero, with higher scores representing higher levels of physical activity.</description>

In addition, respondents are asked to rate their current health state on a scale from 0 ('worst health you can imagine') to 100 ('best health you can imagine'). A score from the five domains is calculated using a macro program and ranges from 0 to 1.</description>

    <description>The patient will receive in-home visits from trained volunteers who will collect information electronically using a tablet computer. The volunteers will collect information about the client's health goals, health risks, and needs using a specifically designed application (TAP-App). Once the data is gathered, it is summarized into a report (TAP-report) which is securely and electronically sent to the health care clinic (TAP huddle). The team can leverage clinic supports and/or community supports as they deem appropriate to help clients reach their health goals and address any needs and risks which were reported during the volunteer visits.</description>
