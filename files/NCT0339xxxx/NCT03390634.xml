  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is a common condition, where acid from the stomach&#xD;
      leaks up into the oesophagus (gullet) and causes symptoms such as heartburn and an unpleasant&#xD;
      taste in the back of the mouth. GORD can often be controlled with self-help measures and&#xD;
      medication. Occasionally, surgery to correct the problem may be needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A laparoscopic fundoplication is a keyhole (laparoscopic) procedure which is a highly&#xD;
      effective treatment. Although reflux-related symptoms are absent or well controlled in over&#xD;
      85% of patients at 5 years after the operation, younger patients may have higher expectations&#xD;
      that such an operation would hopefully last decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oesophageal physiology tests such as 24-hour catheter pH (potential of hydrogen) and&#xD;
      impedance involve passing a small tube into oesophagus via patients' nose to monitor the&#xD;
      presence of stomach content (acid or non-acid) in the oesophagus. The manometry test measures&#xD;
      the pressures and coordination of pressure activity within the oesophagus. Bravo™ wireless pH&#xD;
      monitoring uses a capsule that is attached to the oesophageal lining. These tests are often&#xD;
      used as part of a pre-operative evaluation before anti-reflux surgery (ARS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several measurements in these tests (also called parameters) could potentially anticipate&#xD;
      clinical outcomes following anti-reflux surgery. The evidence for parameters like duration of&#xD;
      acid exposure, number of reflux episodes and association with symptoms, pressures and&#xD;
      co-ordination of pressure activity in the oesophagus, came from studies which were not&#xD;
      designed in the most rigorous way to determine whether a cause-effect relation exists between&#xD;
      treatment and outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single centre, retrospective, observational study in which patients who had&#xD;
      pre-operative physiology testing and anti-reflux surgery at a tertiary centre in the last 10&#xD;
      years will be assessed for reflux symptoms and quality of life over the phone, based on three&#xD;
      validated questionnaires. The study is designed to evaluate correlations between oesophageal&#xD;
      physiology parameters and symptomatic response to ARS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, retrospective, cross-sectional study on patients who had anti-reflux&#xD;
      surgery and pre-operative oesophageal physiology testing over 10 years. The investigators&#xD;
      anticipate the recruitment of up to 350 subjects over 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be contacted over the phone and asked whether they would be interested&#xD;
      in joining the study. Candidates will be presented with details no less than the exact nature&#xD;
      of the study, the implications and constraints of the protocol. Subjects will be made aware&#xD;
      that no intervention will be made in this study, therefore taking part involves no risks or&#xD;
      side effects. If all questions that satisfy inclusion and exclusion criteria are answered&#xD;
      satisfactorily, and patients are happy to enter the study, participants will be consented&#xD;
      verbally over the phone. It will be stated that the participant is free to withdraw from the&#xD;
      study at any time for any reason without prejudice to future care, and with no obligation to&#xD;
      give the reason for withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once recruited the following assessments and interventions will take place:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients will be assessed based on the Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ) which is&#xD;
           designed to assess the frequency and severity of heartburn, regurgitation and dyspeptic&#xD;
           symptoms. Response options are scaled as Likert-type with scores for and severity. RDQ&#xD;
           demonstrated validity and reliability in multiple languages and represents a viable&#xD;
           instrument for assessing symptom severity and response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients will also be assessed based on The Reflux Symptoms Index (RSI) questionnaire&#xD;
           which evaluates the presence and severity of laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). RSI can be&#xD;
           completed in less than one minute. It is easily administered, highly reproducible and&#xD;
           demonstrated design- and criteria-based validity in multiple languages.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participants will finally be evaluated based on the Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease&#xD;
           Health-Related Quality of Life (GORD-HRQL) questionnaire which is aimed at typical&#xD;
           reflux symptoms and impact on the daily living. The questionnaire can be easily given&#xD;
           over the phone in less than 2 minutes. GORD-HRQL has been validated and is a reliable&#xD;
           and practical tool in several languages.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Data recorded will include the standard components of pre-operative oesophageal pH&#xD;
           monitoring and high-resolution manometry, reflux symptoms scores, PPIs (proton pump&#xD;
           inhibitors) usage, post-operative physiology studies and re-do anti-reflux surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Statistical analysis will involve multiple logistic regression and multiple linear&#xD;
           regression models. Sensitivity and specificity of each predictor will be measured using&#xD;
           the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. A minimum of 350 patients&#xD;
           for 5 predictors will define our sample size.&#xD;
