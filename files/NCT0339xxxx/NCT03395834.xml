      This study evaluates the change of tissue oxygenation during a vascular occlusion test using&#xD;
      two NIRS ( O3TM and INVOS®). NIRS probe will be attached on volunteer's forearm during&#xD;
      vascular occlusion test and tissue oxygenation change will be recorded&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been used to measure regional hemoglobin oxygen&#xD;
      saturation of tissue. Recently, it also has been used to monitor peripheral tissue oxygen&#xD;
      saturation, and micro-vascular reactivity using vascular occlusion test (VOT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      O3 TM is recently developed NIRS and there are only two clinical trials using this device,&#xD;
      until now. In one study, this device could adequately predict cerebral regional oxygen&#xD;
      saturation. And in the other study, peripheral tissue oxygenation was measured during&#xD;
      ischemic pre-conditioning in heart surgery and it showed correlation between O3 TM and other&#xD;
      NIRS ( EQUANOX) which has been used to monitor peripheral tissue oxygenation. But in this&#xD;
      study, study group was patient with heart disease and the deoxygenation and reoxygenation&#xD;
      rate during VOT was not not measured, which reflects tissue oxygen extraction and&#xD;
      micro-vascular reactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In NIRS devices, there are assumed cerebral arterial-venous ratio upon which oximetry values&#xD;
      are calculated. In INVOS®, assumed arterial-venous ratio is 25/75. In other NIRS, assumed&#xD;
      arterial-venous ratio is 30/70. But unlike other NIRS, O3 TM can change its preset&#xD;
      arterial-venous ratio between 25/75 and 30/70, and there are no studies compare oximetry&#xD;
      values between these two different settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators try to compare INVOS®, which has been used widely for&#xD;
      monitor tissue oxygenation, and two different settings of O3 TM ( arterial-venous ratio;&#xD;
      30/70 and 25/75). Three probes will be attached at same site simultaneously and the&#xD;
      investigators will measure change of tissue oxygenation, deoxygenation rate and reoxygenation&#xD;
      rate during vascular occlusion test&#xD;
