  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays there is an increasing demand by consumers on healthy food products prepared in&#xD;
      convenient forms, simple to use and not containing additives. In this sense, broccoli sprouts&#xD;
      (Brassica oleraceae var. italica) represent an interesting choice as they are rich in&#xD;
      glucosinolates, nitrogen-sulfur compounds, that are believed to counteract the negative&#xD;
      effects of diverse pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human studies have been focused on the antitumoral properties of these vegetables, however&#xD;
      there is less evidence on the anti-inflammatory properties of cruciferous vegetables in&#xD;
      humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As obesity is linked to an inflammatory component, the aim of the study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory action of broccoli sprouts in overweight adult subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We performed an interventional follow-up study to evaluate the effect of the daily&#xD;
      consumption of broccoli sprouts during 10 weeks (70 days). The study was conducted at the&#xD;
      Catholic University of Murcia under supervision of Consejo Superior de Investigaciones&#xD;
      Científicas (CSIC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was performed according with the Helsinki Declaration of Human Studies and approved&#xD;
      by the Ethical Committee of the Catholic University of Murcia as well as the Bioethics&#xD;
      Sub-Committee of the CSIC' Department of Ethics for the AGL-2013-46247-P project. Volunteers&#xD;
      (n=40; 21 M, 19 W) were recruited in the Catholic University of Murcia (UCAM) and all of them&#xD;
      were informed on the characteristics of the study and they signed the written-informed&#xD;
      consent. Dietetic and life style habits were recorded from all participants. There were no&#xD;
      drop-outs during the whole period of study and no adverse effects were reported due to the&#xD;
      broccoli sprout ingestion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One week before the beginning of the intervention period, subjects were asked to avoid the&#xD;
      consumption of Brassica vegetables (broccoli, radish, cauliflower, Brussel sprouts, mustards,&#xD;
      among others) and their derived products, and to follow a well-balanced diet (based on&#xD;
      Mediterranean diet), with no other food restriction criteria. These dietary instructions were&#xD;
      maintained during the entire period of study. Besides, they were requested to record any sign&#xD;
      of adverse effect, illness or deviation of the experimental diet. The subjects maintained&#xD;
      their usual lifestyles during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the first day, participants were given the portions of fresh broccoli sprouts to be taken&#xD;
      for the whole week (7 trays of broccoli sprouts of 30 g each) and each week they had an&#xD;
      appointment to provide them the fresh products. The intervention consisted on a 10-week&#xD;
      period which included daily consumption of a portion (30 g) of raw, fresh broccoli sprouts.&#xD;
      This amount is consistent with a half- serving according to WHO. Subjects were instructed to&#xD;
      ingest 1 tray per day and to keep the trays refrigerated (4º C) at home. The intake of the&#xD;
      broccoli sprouts was included in their normal daily diet and no specific time of consumption&#xD;
      was established, with the only limitation of avoid cooking of the sprouts and to consume them&#xD;
      fresh. Cooking procedures can affect the content of glucosinolates as well as their&#xD;
      bioavailability and therefore some recipes were provided to the participants to facilitate&#xD;
      the intake of the sprouts without affecting the phytochemical composition and absorption.&#xD;
      After the intervention period, a follow-up recovery period for all subjects continued for&#xD;
      other 90 days with no ingestion of broccoli sprouts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasting blood samples and 24-h urine samples were taken on day 0 (jst before starting the&#xD;
      intervention), day70 (end of intervention period), day 90 (20 days after end of intervention)&#xD;
      and day 160 (90 days after end of intervention). Blood samples were collected from each&#xD;
      subject by venipuncture from the antecubital vein; 3 mL were placed in heparin tubes and&#xD;
      centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 min at 4ºC. Plasma was aliquoted and stored at -80ºC until&#xD;
      analysis. Analysis were performed once each period was finished and in the same batch to&#xD;
      minimize analytical variations. The total volume of the 24h-urine was recorded to calculate&#xD;
      the absolute amounts of the compounds and metabolites excreted in the study period and&#xD;
      aliquots were frozen at -80ºC for further analysis. Body weight and percentage of fat mass&#xD;
      were measured as well and BMI calculated in each sampling time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Markers of inflammation as IL-6, C-reactive protein, IL-1β and TNF-α in plasma were&#xD;
      determined in our laboratory using high-sensitivity ELISA kits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Levels of glucosinolates, isothiocyanates and their metabolites were measured in urine by a&#xD;
      rapid, sensitive and high throughput UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS.&#xD;
