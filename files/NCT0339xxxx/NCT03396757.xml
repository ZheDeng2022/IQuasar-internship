      The timing of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in the context of severe acute kidney injury&#xD;
      (AKI) is one the most debated issues in critical care medicine. The Artificial Kidney&#xD;
      Initiation in Kidney Injury (AKIKI) was the first large prospective multicenter randomized&#xD;
      trial published on this topic. This study (published in the New England Journal of Medicine,&#xD;
      July 2017) showed no significant difference between an early and delayed RRT initiation&#xD;
      strategy in term of mortality. Nearly 50% of patients escaped RRT in the delayed strategy and&#xD;
      this strategy was associated with less catheter-related infections and faster renal function&#xD;
      recovery. Two (serum urea concentration &gt;40 mmol/l and oliguria/anuria for more than 72&#xD;
      hours) of the 5 criteria which mandated RRT in the delayed strategy are still open to debate&#xD;
      since they have never been shown to put patient at danger. To go further into our&#xD;
      investigation of RRT criteria, the investigators designed a study that would compare the&#xD;
      &quot;delayed strategy&quot; used in AKIKI that can now be considered as &quot;standard&quot; with another in&#xD;
      which RRT is delayed for a longer period in the absence of a life-threatening complication&#xD;
      (such as hyperkalemia or severe overload pulmonary edema).&#xD;

      The timing of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in the context of severe acute kidney injury&#xD;
      (AKI) is one the most debated issues in critical care medicine. The Artificial Kidney&#xD;
      Initiation in Kidney Injury (AKIKI) was the first large prospective multicenter randomized&#xD;
      trial published on this topic. This study conducted by our team (published in the New England&#xD;
      Journal of Medicine, July 2017) showed no significant difference between an early and delayed&#xD;
      RRT initiation strategy in term of mortality. Nearly 50% of patients escaped RRT in the&#xD;
      delayed strategy and this strategy was associated with less catheter-related infections and&#xD;
      faster renal function recovery. Two (serum urea concentration &gt;40 mmol/l and oliguria/anuria&#xD;
      for more than 72 hours) of the 5 criteria which mandated RRT in the delayed strategy are&#xD;
      still open to debate since they have never been shown to put patient at danger. To go further&#xD;
      into our investigation of RRT criteria,the investigators designed a study that would compare&#xD;
      the &quot;delayed strategy&quot; used in AKIKI that can now be considered as &quot;standard&quot; with another in&#xD;
      which RRT is delayed for a longer period in the absence of a potentially severe complication&#xD;
      (such as hyperkalemia or severe overload pulmonary edema).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AKIKI 2 study will be a prospective, multicenter, open-label, two-arm randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve 2 stages (an observational stage and a randomization stage) At any&#xD;
      time during these two stages, the occurrence of a potentially severe condition defined below&#xD;
      will mandate strong consideration for immediate RRT initiation unless a medical treatment can&#xD;
      very rapidly resolve the situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria that mandate strong consideration for RRT initiation at any time during the 2 stages&#xD;
      of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Serum potassium concentration &gt;6 mmol/l&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Serum potassium concentration &gt;5.5 mmol/l persisting despite medical treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Arterial blood pH &lt;7.15 in a context of pure metabolic acidosis (PaCO2 &lt;35 mmHg) or in a&#xD;
           context of mixed acidosis with a PaCO2 &gt;50 mmHg without possibility of increasing&#xD;
           alveolar ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Acute pulmonary edema due to fluid overload despite diuretic therapy leading to severe&#xD;
           hypoxemia requiring oxygen flow rate &gt;5 l/min to maintain SpO2&gt;95% (oxygen saturation)&#xD;
           or FiO2&gt;50% (inspired oxygen fraction) under invasive or non-invasive mechanical&#xD;
           ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Observational Stage: All patients receiving (or who have received for the present&#xD;
                episode) intravenous catecholamines and/or invasive mechanical ventilation and&#xD;
                presenting with AKI classification stage 3 of KDIGO classification [defined by at&#xD;
                least one of the following criteria: serum creatinine concentration of more than 4&#xD;
                mg/dl (354 µmol/liter) or greater than 3 times the baseline creatinine level,&#xD;
                anuria (urine output of 100 ml/day or less) for more than 12 hours, oliguria (urine&#xD;
                output below 0.3 ml/kg/h or below 500 ml/day) for more than 24 hours] and who have&#xD;
                no potentially severe condition mandating strong consideration for immediate RRT&#xD;
                initiation as described above will be included in an observational study. Clinical&#xD;
                and metabolic conditions will be closely monitored and RRT consideration will be&#xD;
                mandatory if one or more of these conditions (see above) occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Randomization stage: Patients presenting, either immediately after inclusion or&#xD;
                during their follow-up in the observational study, one or both of following&#xD;
                criteria: a serum urea concentration &gt;40 mmol/l and/or an oliguria/anuria for more&#xD;
                than 72 hours even in the absence of an above-mentioned potentially severe&#xD;
                condition will be randomly allocated to one of the two study treatment arms. One&#xD;
                arm is termed &quot;standard strategy&quot; (which was the delayed arm of AKIKI 1) and the&#xD;
                other a &quot;delayed RRT strategy&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Standard strategy&quot;: RRT is initiated within 12 hours after documentation of serum urea&#xD;
      concentration &gt;40 mmol/l and/or an oliguria/anuria for more than 72 hours. The timing of&#xD;
      initiation will be recorded and RRT sessions will be performed until criteria for cessation&#xD;
      are observed (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Delayed strategy&quot;: RRT will be initiated only if one or more of above-mentioned potentially&#xD;
      severe situations (see &quot;Criteria that mandate strong consideration for RRT initiation at any&#xD;
      time&quot;) occur (identical to those used during the observational study) or if serum urea&#xD;
      concentration reaches 50 mmol/L (this level being chosen in order to avoid extreme elevations&#xD;
      of serum urea levels as mentioned above). As already explained, the physician in charge will&#xD;
      be allowed to try a medical treatment of hyperkalemia, acidosis or pulmonary edema and the&#xD;
      decision to start RRT or not will be taken by him, according to his usual practice. The&#xD;
      duration of anuria will not constitute a criterion per se for RRT initiation. When required,&#xD;
      RRT will be performed with the same modalities and stopped according to the same criteria as&#xD;
      in the standard strategy, with special care to avoid dialysis disequilibrium syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice of RRT modality (intermittent or continuous technique) will be left at the study&#xD;
      site discretion. Several RRT modalities can be used in the same patient, according to&#xD;
      attending physician's indication. Duration of and interval between sessions, and device&#xD;
      settings as well as modality of anticoagulation are left at the investigator's discretion.&#xD;
      However, RRT will be prescribed and monitored according to national guidelines in order to&#xD;
      ensure optimal efficacy of RRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of RRT initiation in a context of high serum urea concentration (&gt; 40 mmol/l),&#xD;
      prevention of dialysis disequilibrium syndrome will be recommended. The management will be&#xD;
      left at clinician's discretion and will include one or several of the following measures :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Slow, gentle initial hemodialysis (dialysis time &lt;2 hours and low blood flow rate)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increasing dialysate sodium levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration of osmotically active substance by using a high-glucose-concentration&#xD;
           dialysate or administering hypertonic glucose in the venous line of the dialyser during&#xD;
           dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study centers have extensive experience in both acute kidney injury management and RRT&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal replacement therapy discontinuation will be contemplated when spontaneous diuresis &gt;500&#xD;
      ml/24h, and highly recommended if diuresis is &gt;1000 ml/24h without diuretic administration or&#xD;
      &gt;2000 ml/24h, in patients receiving diuretics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal replacement therapy cessation will be mandatory if diuresis (as defined above) is&#xD;
      present and serum creatinine level decreases spontaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If improvement of renal function is insufficient to achieve a spontaneous decrease in&#xD;
      creatinine level and/or if diuresis becomes lower than 1000 ml/24h without diuretics (or&#xD;
      lower than 2000 ml/24h under diuretics), RRT will be resumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal function recovery will be defined according to urine output as mentioned above and RRT&#xD;
      cessation without need for resumption in the following 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RRT will be initiated only if one or more of above-mentioned potentially severe situations&#xD;
      occur (identical to those used during the observational study. The physician in charge will&#xD;
      be allowed to try a medical treatment.) or if serum urea concentration reaches 50 mmol/L&#xD;
      (this level being chosen in order to avoid extreme elevations of serum urea levels as&#xD;
      mentioned above). Patients will not receive RRT whatever the duration of anuria/oliguria if&#xD;
      none of the above-mentioned indications for RRT is present. When required, RRT will be&#xD;
      performed with the same modalities and stopped according to the same criteria as in the&#xD;
      &quot;standard&quot; RRT strategy, with special care to avoid dialysis disequilibrium syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision to initiate RRT in the &quot;delayed strategy&quot; arm of the trial will have to be&#xD;
      approved by the attending physician(s) involved in patient's care in order to make sure that&#xD;
      it corresponds to her/his usual practice.&#xD;

Zero value will be given for patients with RRT initiated the first day of randomization who died before RRT weaning or who remained under RRT until day 28.&#xD;
With this definition, RRT-free days may concern days without RRT both before RRT initiation (a situation encountered by definition in the &quot; delayed strategy&quot; arm) and after RRT weaning (for the two strategies).</description>

The decision to initiate RRT in the &quot;delayed strategy&quot; arm of the trial will have to be approved by the attending physician(s) involved in patient's care in order to make sure that it corresponds to her/his usual practice.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Hospitalized in a study ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of acute kidney injury compatible with the diagnosis of acute tubular&#xD;
             necrosis in a context of ischemic or toxic aggression and who receive (or received for&#xD;
             the same episode) invasive mechanical ventilation and/or catecholamine infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute kidney injury stage 3 of KDIGO classification defined by at least one of the&#xD;
             following criteria: serum creatinine concentration of more than 4 mg/dl (354&#xD;
             µmol/liter) or greater than 3 times the baseline creatinine level, anuria (urine&#xD;
             output of 100 ml/day or less) for more than 12 hours, oliguria (urine output below 0.3&#xD;

        To be randomized (randomization stage), supplemental criteria must be fulfilled. These&#xD;
        criteria can appear either immediately after inclusion in the observational stage, or&#xD;
        during the follow-up of the patient in the observational stage, in the absence of any&#xD;
        non-inclusion criteria (listed below) at the time of randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Oliguria/anuria (urine output &lt;0.3 ml/kg/h or &lt;500 ml/day) for more than 72 hours or&#xD;
             serum urea concentration comprised between 40 and 50 mmol/l.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Affiliation to a social security regime&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Severe chronic renal failure (defined by a creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with inclusion criteria already present for more than 24 hours (to avoid&#xD;
             delayed inclusions)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AKI caused by urinary tract obstruction or renal vessel obstruction or tumour lysis&#xD;
             syndrome or thrombotic microangiopathy or acute glomerulopathy&#xD;
