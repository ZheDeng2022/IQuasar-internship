  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) study of 100 people&#xD;
      with a history of opioid use disorder releasing to WA Department of Corrections (DOC)&#xD;
      community corrections supervision in King County. Half of the subjects will receive treatment&#xD;
      as usual (e.g. referral to treatment or outpatient drug counseling by DOC community&#xD;
      corrections staff) and half will receive 6 months of intervention. The intervention involves&#xD;
      treatment decision making, in which the study interventionists help subjects understand&#xD;
      treatment choices, decide on the treatment that is best for them, get enrolled in treatment&#xD;
      and remain in treatment. The study does not provide treatment, but works with treatment&#xD;
      providers to facilitate access to care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are to determine: 1) whether study procedures can be implemented with&#xD;
      as designed, 2) whether offenders can be enrolled and maintained in the study, 3) which&#xD;
      medications/treatment options subjects select and their experiences and satisfaction with the&#xD;
      interventions, and 4) preliminary intervention effect size on outcomes of interest including&#xD;
      recidivism, drug use, hospitalization, and treatment enrollment and retention.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects in the intervention arm will begin a discussion with the interventionist about whether they are interested in treatment and medication choices for opioid use disorder. The interventionist will use a decision tool informed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA) guide to medication assisted treatment in order to help make an informed decision about treatment choices. Once a decision is reached, the Treatment Navigator will communicate with the subject periodically to assist with entering treatment and help with locating other social services as needed within the community. The Treatment Navigator will emphasize getting into treatment as quickly as possible once a decision is made. The Treatment Navigator and the subject will continue communicating throughout the 6 month study period. Subjects will also receive overdose education and be offered take-home naloxone.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>125 people releasing from prison were identified by Washington Department of Corrections with notifications sent to local community corrections officers of their approximate release dates. Of the 125 people releasing from prison, 63 were approached for study participation. Of the 63 who were approached, 44 declined participation or were not opioid users. Of the remaining 19 who were assessed, 2 were ineligible and 17 were consented. Of the 17 who were consented, 15 were assigned to groups.</pre_assignment_details>

Treatment Navigation (Intervention): Subjects in the intervention arm will begin a discussion with the interventionist about whether they are interested in treatment and medication choices for opioid use disorder. The interventionist will use a decision tool informed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA) guide to medication assisted treatment in order to help make an informed decision about treatment choices. Once a decision is reached, the Treatment Navigator will communicate with the subject periodically to assist with entering treatment and help with locating other social services as needed within the community. The Treatment Navigator will emphasize getting into treatment as quickly as possible once a decision is made. The Treatment Navigator and the subject will continue communicating throughout the 6 month study period. Subjects will also receive overdose education and be offered take-home naloxone.</description>

            <description>Initial discussion regarding opioid treatment options followed by 6 months of treatment navigation.&#xD;
Treatment Navigation (Intervention): Subjects in the intervention arm will begin a discussion with the interventionist about whether they are interested in treatment and medication choices for opioid use disorder. The interventionist will use a decision tool informed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA) guide to medication assisted treatment in order to help make an informed decision about treatment choices. Once a decision is reached, the Treatment Navigator will communicate with the subject periodically to assist with entering treatment and help with locating other social services as needed within the community. The Treatment Navigator will emphasize getting into treatment as quickly as possible once a decision is made. The Treatment Navigator and the subject will continue communicating throughout the 6 month study period. Subjects will also receive overdose education and be offered take-home naloxone.</description>
