  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NMDA antagonist drugs have increasingly been demonstrated to reduce symptoms of depression&#xD;
      and suicidal ideation. NeuroRx has developed a sequential therapy consisting of IV NRX-100&#xD;
      (ketamine HCL) for rapid stabilization of symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation&#xD;
      followed by oral NRX-101 (fixed dose combination of D-cycloserine and lurasidone) for&#xD;
      maintenance of stabilization from symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation. This study&#xD;
      will test the hypothesis that that NRX-100 is superior to placebo in achieving rapid&#xD;
      reduction in symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation in patients with Severe Bipolar&#xD;
      Depression and Acute Suicidal Ideation or Behavior within 24 hours of administration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and Rationale: NMDA antagonist drugs have increasingly been demonstrated to reduce&#xD;
      symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation. Specifically, NRX-100 (ketamine HCl, 0.5 mg/kg&#xD;
      IV over 40 minutes) has been shown to induce acute reductions in suicidality and depression&#xD;
      in patients with bipolar depression, relative to control. Numerous reports have documented a&#xD;
      50% reduction in the MADRS depression scale and a 75% reduction in suicidality following a&#xD;
      single infusion of ketamine in patients with suicidal ideation and depression. While the&#xD;
      repeat use of ketamine is not supported and may be contraindicated by the literature,&#xD;
      D-cycloserine (DCS), when combined with SSRI antidepressants in patients with treatment&#xD;
      resistant depression, and when combined with atypical antipsychotics, in particular&#xD;
      lurasidone (NRX-101), has shown separation from control and ability to maintain remission&#xD;
      from suicidality and depression over 6 weeks with oral use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To test the hypothesis that a single infusion of NRX-100 is superior to placebo infusion in&#xD;
      the rapid stabilization of patients with severe Bipolar Depression and Acute Suicidal&#xD;
      Ideation and Behavior (ASIB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Key secondary: To test the hypothesis that there is a more favorable reduction in the mean&#xD;
      change from baseline on the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) between NRX-100&#xD;
      and saline groups on day 1 and day 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: A multi-center, randomized, double-blind, trial involving a single IV infusion&#xD;
      to achieve response by 24 hours. The randomization will be 3:1 favoring NRX-100 (ketamine)&#xD;
      infusion (n=105) vs. Saline infusion (n=35). Subjects who respond successfully to treatment&#xD;
      will be offered enrollment in a six week followup study of NRX-101 (an oral fixed dose&#xD;
      combination of d-cycloserine and lurasidone) vs. standard of care in order to ascertain&#xD;
      maintenance of the ketamine effect.&#xD;
