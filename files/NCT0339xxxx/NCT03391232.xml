      Phase I/II clinical trial investigates the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of multiple doses of PolyPEPI1018 CRC vaccine as an add-on treatment to&#xD;
      the standard-of-care maintenance therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;
      Clinical responses will be evaluated by indiction of T cell responses, T lymphocyte&#xD;
      infiltration in accessible biopsy sites, and by objective tumor responses. This study will&#xD;
      also explore the accuracy of the predicted T cell responses in each patient using the&#xD;
      candidate companion diagnostic test and the correlations between clinical responses and&#xD;
      predicted T cell responses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, immunogenicity and efficacy of a multiple subcutaneous injection of&#xD;
      PolyPEPI1018 as an add-on immunotherapy to the standard-of-care maintenance therapy in&#xD;
      approximately 15 subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first part of the study investigates the administration of a single vaccine dose during&#xD;
      12-week follow-up period on an outpatient basis. Screening is performed in parallel with the&#xD;
      subject's completion of the standard-of-care first-line treatment and initiation of the&#xD;
      standard-of-care maintenance treatment. A single dose of PolyPEPI1018 is administered after&#xD;
      the subject initiates the maintenance regimen, and within 3 weeks after the eligibility CT&#xD;
      scan was performed. Subjects are monitored every 3 weeks for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part of the study investigates the administration of 3 vaccine doses (Weeks 0, 13,&#xD;
      26) then 12 weeks follow-up on an outpatient basis.&#xD;

    <description>The vaccine contains 6 synthetic peptides mixed with the adjuvant Montanide™. The peptides were selected to induce T cell responses against 12 dominant epitopes from 7 cancer testis antigens (CTAs), which are the most frequently expressed CTAs in colorectal cancer. The 6 peptides were optimized to induce long lasting CRC specific T cell responses.</description>
