  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects of three-dimensional conformal external-beam&#xD;
      photon radiotherapy (3D-CRT), proton, or brachytherapy accelerated partial breast irradiation&#xD;
      (APBI) in treating patients with breast cancer that has or hasn't spread from where it began&#xD;
      in the breast to surrounding normal tissue. Radiation therapy such as photon and proton&#xD;
      partial breast external beam radiotherapy, uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and&#xD;
      shrink tumors. Giving radiation therapy in different ways may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
      Brachytherapy, also known as internal radiation therapy, uses radioactive material placed&#xD;
      directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether photon or&#xD;
      proton partial breast external beam radiotherapy or partial breast brachytherapy works better&#xD;
      in treating patients with breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the rate of adverse cosmesis (defined as fair or poor cosmesis) with&#xD;
      accelerated 3 fraction APBI at 3 years, compared to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the acute and late toxicities of accelerated 3 fraction APBI. II. To evaluate&#xD;
      local disease control of accelerated 3 fraction APBI. III. To assess the rate of patient&#xD;
      reported adverse cosmesis at 2 years, compared to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess quality of life and other patient reported outcomes following accelerated 3&#xD;
      fraction APBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To compare the local control, acute and late toxicities, cosmesis, quality of life and&#xD;
      other patient reported outcomes between the three radiation therapy techniques (3D-CRT,&#xD;
      proton, brachytherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To evaluate clinical features, dose-volume parameters, and genetic variants associated&#xD;
      with fair and poor cosmetic outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT I: Patients undergo 3D-CRT APBI for 3-5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT II: Patients undergo proton beam radiation therapy APBI for 3-5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT III: Patients undergo brachytherapy ABPI for 3-5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 12 weeks, 12 months, and&#xD;
      annually for 5 years.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage difference in patients with adverse cosmesis (fair or poor cosmesis)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage difference in patients with adverse cosmesis will be estimated using a binomial estimator (number of women who had an adverse cosmesis event at 3 years minus number of women who had an adverse cosmesis event at baseline, and then divided by total number of women in the primary analysis) and a 95% exact binomial confidence interval.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The distant breast cancer recurrence cumulative incidence will be estimated using a competing risks method (Gooley et al.). The competing risks will be local/regional breast cancer recurrence and death.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of acute adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 90 days post-radiation therapy (RT)</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum grade for each type of acute AE will be recorded for each patient. Data will be summarized as frequencies and relative frequencies.</description>

    <description>This endpoint includes invasive IBTR, regional invasive breast cancer recurrence, distant breast cancer recurrence, death due to any cause, contralateral invasive breast cancer, and second primary non-breast invasive disease. The DFS will be estimated with a Kaplan-Meier estimator and curve. Estimates will be given for specific time points along with 95% confidence interval (CI)s.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 3 years</time_frame>

    <time_frame>At 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The values of the cosmesis instruments (patient self-reported and panel-assessed) will be summarized with the frequencies of fair or poor cosmesis events at baseline and 3 years, and the difference at 3 years, as well as their relative exact binomial confidence intervals.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The QOL measurements will be summarized at each time point as mean +/- standard deviation (SD) and median (minimum value, maximum value). Changes in the QOL measurements from baseline will be determined at each follow-up measurement. These will be displayed as spaghetti plots. The assessment of the changes at each time point will be done with a paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test, whichever is appropriate.</description>

             genetic mutation tests in order to enroll on the study. However, in the event a&#xD;
             patient is tested and is found to be a mutation carrier, she would be excluded from&#xD;
             the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Breast implants (patients who have had implants removed are eligible)&#xD;
&#xD;
