  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety of Talquetamab and to determine the&#xD;
      recommended Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2Ds) and dosing schedule assessed to be safe for Talquetamab&#xD;
      (Part 1 [Dose Escalation]) and to further characterize the safety of Talquetamab at the&#xD;
      recommended Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2Ds) (Part 2 [Dose Expansion]).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in 2 parts: dose escalation and dose expansion. The study will&#xD;
      evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary antitumor activity of&#xD;
      Talquetamab administered to adult participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.&#xD;
      The overall safety of the study drug will be assessed by physical examinations, Eastern&#xD;
      Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, laboratory tests, vital signs,&#xD;
      electrocardiograms, adverse event monitoring, and concomitant medication usage. Disease&#xD;
      evaluations will include peripheral blood and bone marrow assessments at screening (performed&#xD;
      within 28 days) and to confirm stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), or&#xD;
      relapse from CR. The end of study (study completion) is defined as the last study assessment&#xD;
      for the last participant in the study. Study record NCT04634552 is Phase 2 part of this study&#xD;
      and study record NCT03399799 is Phase 1 part of this study.&#xD;
