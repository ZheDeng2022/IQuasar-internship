  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical trauma is characterized by a tightly integrated sequence of neurohumoral and&#xD;
      immunological processes. When this is marked, it can manifest as a clinical entity called the&#xD;
      systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Previous studies reported that inflammatory milieu&#xD;
      in the postoperative period can be a harmful and potentially modifiable condition that may&#xD;
      affect postoperative recovery, which includes the level of pain, fatigue, dizziness, nausea&#xD;
      and vomiting (PONV), muscle weakness, and sleep quality and then increases the need for&#xD;
      hospitalization. The effect of postoperative inflammation-related immune suppression such as&#xD;
      the T-cell exhaustion and lymphocyte anergy may render the patient vulnerable to both&#xD;
      infection and the recurrence of malignancy on postoperative infection risk and malignancy&#xD;
      recurrence are currently subjects of intense speculation and investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucocorticoids are well known for their analgesic, anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive&#xD;
      agents and antiemetic effects. Though previous studies' results on postoperative outcome have&#xD;
      been positive and in favor of glucocorticoid use, with postoperative nausea and vomiting and&#xD;
      pain outcome parameters most significantly improved. However, high-dose methylprednisolone&#xD;
      treatment could result in decreases T-cells postoperatively. Based on these consideration,&#xD;
      the aim of our study was to assess the effect of a single low-dose preoperative&#xD;
      methylprednisolone (MP) 1 mg/Kg i.v. on postoperative pain and immune functions in patients&#xD;
      undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) under general anesthesia.&#xD;

      The eighty-one patients were randomly assigned either to the MP Group or the Control Group in&#xD;
      a 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated randomization number sequence. The group assignment&#xD;
      was sealed in sequentially numbered opaque envelopes. No stratiﬁcation or block randomization&#xD;
      was made. The envelopes were opened on the morning of surgery, and the trial drug was&#xD;
      prepared by a senior anaesthetist not otherwise involved in data collection. The MP group&#xD;
      received a single-dose of MP, 1 mg/Kg i.v. (Solu-Medrolw; Pﬁzer, Ballerup, Denmark) and the&#xD;
      Control group a single-dose of isotonic saline ( equal capacity with MP) i.v. The test&#xD;
      solution was administered just 30 mins before the operation. The patients, attending&#xD;
      anesthesiologists, surgeons, and data collectors were all blinded to patient group&#xD;
      assignment.The primary outcomes of the levels of T lymphocyte subsets of CD3+, CD4+, and&#xD;
      CD8+, and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio were measured at T0, T1, and T2. Postoperative pain scores were&#xD;
      evaluated by the visual analog scale (VAS) score16, where 0 indicates painlessness, and 10&#xD;
      indicates severe pain. The patients were asked to evaluate their pain at rest and during&#xD;
      coughing at 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours postoperatively. Total pump press numbers of PCA and&#xD;
      adverse effects during 24 hours after surgery such as hypotension, bradycardia, nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting, and dizzy were recorded and treated accordingly.&#xD;
