      Beginning in the mid-to late 1980s and accelerating through the 1990s and 2000s the shield of&#xD;
      antibiotic invincibility began to crack sufficiently so that it was apparent to everyone we&#xD;
      faced a serious problem. The investigators will demonstrate and expand the use of information&#xD;
      technology based on the ingenious weighted-incidence, syndromic, combination antibiogram&#xD;
      (WISCA) tool for the widespread use of automated clinician prompts enhancing empiric&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy as part of a comprehensive infection control stewardship program that&#xD;
      reduces antibiotic resistance. This research program will demonstrate that use of such a tool&#xD;
      lowers mortality, improves outcome, lowers antimicrobial resistance and reduces healthcare&#xD;
      cost.&#xD;

      The decade of the 1970s was a time when the PI was completing his training and beginning a&#xD;
      career in Infectious Diseases and Microbiology. This was an era when many new anti-infective&#xD;
      compounds were being introduced, ranging from novel penicillins to extended-spectrum&#xD;
      cephalosporins to aminoglycosides. The main antimicrobial resistance concern at the time was&#xD;
      Staphylococcus aureus that was no longer susceptible to penicillin; methicillin, oxacillin,&#xD;
      and nafcillin had solved that problem. Even for those strains that later were&#xD;
      methicillin-resistant (MRSA), vancomycin had been available since the 1950s. Later the&#xD;
      carbapenems and in the 1980s the newer fluoroquinolones, beginning with ciprofloxacin, were&#xD;
      introduced for clinical use. At the time it seemed that the challenge of treating serious&#xD;
      infection in humans had been met and that other diseases were a higher priority. Indeed, in&#xD;
      1978 one of the world's leaders in infectious diseases, Dr. Robert Petersdorf, commented that&#xD;
      &quot;Even with my great personal loyalty to Infectious Disease, I cannot conceive of the need for&#xD;
      309 more [graduating trainees in] infectious disease...unless they spend their time culturing&#xD;
      each other&quot;. However, in Alexander Fleming's 1945 Nobel prize lecture he warned of the danger&#xD;
      of antimicrobial resistance stating &quot;it is not difficult to make microbes resistant to&#xD;
      penicillin in the laboratory by exposing them to concentrations not sufficient to kill them,&#xD;
      and the same thing has occurred occasionally happen in the body . . . and by exposing (his)&#xD;
      microbes to nonlethal quantities of the drug make them resistant&quot;. It was also at this time&#xD;
      that Infection Control began as an established discipline with CDC offering the first course&#xD;
      in 1968 and the Joint Commission requiring a hospital position for Infection Control in 1969.&#xD;
      Subsequently, beginning in the mid-to late 1980s and accelerating through the 1990s and 2000s&#xD;
      the shield of antibiotic invincibility began to crack sufficiently so that it was apparent to&#xD;
      everyone we faced a serious problem. Resistance began to be reported in Gram negative&#xD;
      bacteria toward the newer cephalosporin, fluoroquinolone, and even the carbapenem drugs.&#xD;
      During this same period modern medicine witnessed the emergence and spread of a new&#xD;
      healthcare associated infection called Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, as well as&#xD;
      MRSA becoming pandemic. It was during this time that the initial studies focused on reversing&#xD;
      antimicrobial resistance began. In fact, Drs. Dale Gerding and Lance Peterson undertook the&#xD;
      first ever antibiotic cycling program using amikacin and gentamicin to demonstrate that&#xD;
      withdrawal of an antibiotic to which resistance had developed would restore the activity of&#xD;
      that drug. Humanity now faces a healthcare setting where as many as 70% of the bacterial&#xD;
      infections afflicting patients are resistant to at least one antimicrobial that was initially&#xD;
      active against historical bacterial ancestors. In a sense, the investigators have been&#xD;
      preparing for this funding announcement for nearly an entire career - and are confident that&#xD;
      the investigators can 'answer' the challenge of reversing antibacterial resistance and&#xD;
      reducing that threat for healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). The objectives are in the&#xD;
      main area that describes the focus for this application, which is Antimicrobial Stewardship:&#xD;
      Preventing the development and spread of resistant organisms in the healthcare setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two specific aims for this research program to accomplish. They are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Specific Aim 1: Complete development of the personalized weighted-incidence, syndromic,&#xD;
           combination antibiogram (WISCA) tool and validate its performance as a comprehensive&#xD;
           strategy to improve the treatment of infectious diseases for all hospitalized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - The investigators will demonstrate and expand the use of information technology based&#xD;
           on the WISCA for the widespread use of automated clinician prompts enhancing empiric&#xD;
           antibiotic therapy as part of a comprehensive infection control stewardship program that&#xD;
           reduces antibiotic resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Specific Aim 2: Demonstrate that use of such a tool improves patient outcome, lowers&#xD;
           antimicrobial resistance and reduces cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The clinical and economic outcome measures will include changes in length of stay,&#xD;
                duration of treatment, use of therapeutic drug monitoring, inpatient mortality,&#xD;
                adverse events from antibacterial therapy, admission and discharge location (with&#xD;
                the goal being fewer persons needing skilled care after discharge than is now&#xD;
                required), 30 day readmission rates, unintended consequences from antimicrobial&#xD;
                agent use, such as Clostridium difficile infection, antimicrobial drug cost and&#xD;
                antimicrobial susceptibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the investigator faculty are well aware of current developments in the relevant fields&#xD;
      and are actively involved in cutting edge research that will be applied in a comprehensive,&#xD;
      integrated fashion to solve the problem of antimicrobial resistant HAIs. The investigators&#xD;
      look forward to working on this Large Research Project with the Agency for Healthcare&#xD;
      Research and Quality for the improvement in the care of United States citizens.&#xD;
