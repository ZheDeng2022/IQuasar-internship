  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this prospective, multi-center, single arm study is to obtain further data&#xD;
      on the safety and performance of the StellarexTM 0.014&quot; OTW Drug-coated Angioplasty Balloon&#xD;
      in the treatment of lesions in &quot;below the knee&quot; popliteal (P3 segment) and infra-popliteal&#xD;
      arteries according to the Instructions for Use in Rutherford-Becker Classification (RCC) 3, 4&#xD;
      and 5 patient populations. This study will be conducted in Europe across up to 10 centers in&#xD;
      up to 75 subjects. Office visits will occur at 30 days, 6, 12, and 24 months post-index&#xD;
      procedure. Telephone visits will be collected at 36, 48, and 60 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a significant amount of evidence that the use of Paclitaxel-coated balloons in the&#xD;
      treatment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) has demonstrated favorable outcomes when used&#xD;
      to treat lesions in the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries. For subjects with lesions&#xD;
      in the infrapopliteal arteries, which includes lesions in the mid to distal popliteal artery&#xD;
      and below, a smaller profile balloon is necessary. Typically, lesions in the SFA and proximal&#xD;
      popliteal arteries are treated by larger diameter balloons and larger sized guidewires (most&#xD;
      commonly 0.018&quot; or 0.035&quot;) which are too large for vessels below-the-knee. For this reason,&#xD;
      the Stellarex™ 0.014&quot; OTW Drug-coated Angioplasty Balloon was developed as a line extension&#xD;
      to the Stellarex™ 0.035&quot; device in order to accommodate the treatment of these smaller&#xD;
      vessels. The Stellarex™ 0.014&quot; balloon has the same drug concentration and is manufactured&#xD;
      using a similar method as the Stellarex™ 0.035&quot; device. Additionally, the Stellarex™ 0.035&quot;&#xD;
      and 0.014&quot; balloon share a common balloon diameter of 4 mm, a size which was used to treat&#xD;
      lesions throughout the popliteal artery in the previous Stellarex 0.035&quot; studies. For the&#xD;
      reasons noted above, equivalence between the two devices has been demonstrated. Furthermore,&#xD;
      it is believed that the 0.014&quot; device will not demonstrate any performance differences nor&#xD;
      change the anticipated or residual risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, the current study has been developed in agreement with post-market&#xD;
      requirements as per the Post Market Clinical Follow up (PMCF) plan. The prospective design of&#xD;
      the study, the sample size and the selected outcomes will be able to provide the additional&#xD;
      clinical information to support the safe use and performance of the Stellarex 0.014&quot; device&#xD;
      in the intended population of patients with below-the-knee arterial disease.&#xD;

    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Major Adverse Limb Event (MALE) is defined as the composite of either major amputation or major re-intervention through 30 days of the index procedure. Major re-intervention is defined as creation of a new surgical bypass graft, the use of thrombectomy or thrombolysis or a major surgical graft revision such as a jump graft or an interposition graft. This is a single endpoint as it is a composite only subjects who do not have MALE or POD will be counted toward this endpoint MALE is defined as the composite of either major amputation or major re-intervention through 30 days of the index procedure. Major re-intervention is defined as creation of a new surgical bypass graft, the use of thrombectomy or thrombolysis or a major surgical graft revision such as a jump graft or an interposition graft. POD is all-cause death through 30 days of the index procedure.</description>

          4. Reconstitution of the target vessel at the ankle and run-off into a patent dorsalis&#xD;
             pedis or plantar arteries defined as &lt;50% stenosis by visual estimate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Is able and willing to provide written informed consent and comply with all required&#xD;
             follow-up evaluations within the defined follow-up visit windows prior to enrollment&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Life expectancy &gt; 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects with any medical condition that would make him/her inappropriate for&#xD;
             treatment with the Stellarex balloon as per the Instructions for Use (IFU) or in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator.&#xD;

          4. Subjects that in the judgment of the investigator would require treatment of the&#xD;
             contralateral limb within 3 days prior to the index procedure or 30 days after. Note:&#xD;
             Unless contralateral treatment is required to facilitate adequate access to the target&#xD;

                  dissection, embolic event). These inflow arteries must be treated without the&#xD;
                  need for laser, atherectomy, thrombectomy, cryoplasty, brachytherapy and&#xD;
