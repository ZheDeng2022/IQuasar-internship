      This study aims to validate whether the pattern of airway collapse recorded during&#xD;
      Drug-Induced Sleep Endoscopy (DISE) mirrors that of natural sleep, and to develop a model for&#xD;
      airway collapse. Sensors will be placed in subjects' upper airways during DISE and then&#xD;
      during in-lab sleep studies. The sleep study results will be compared with OR findings to&#xD;
      create an aerodynamic model for natural sleep and to assess whether airway observations&#xD;
      during DISE were valid representations of natural sleep.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) was developed in 1991 as a technique to characterize&#xD;
      upper airway collapse in patients with OSA. With the advent of various upper airway surgeries&#xD;
      introduced in recent years, DISE has become increasingly utilized by the sleep surgeon as a&#xD;
      surrogate for airway collapse during natural sleep in order to tailor a surgical approach for&#xD;
      each patient. Propofol and/or midazolam infusions are typically used for sedation in these&#xD;
      cases, however, there is limited evidence to suggest that these anesthetics reproduce natural&#xD;
      sleep architecture. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that the pattern of collapse observed&#xD;
      during DISE is reflective of natural sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to validate whether the pattern of collapse recorded during DISE&#xD;
      mirrors that of natural sleep. Furthermore, the investigators aim to develop a quantitative&#xD;
      in vivo model for airway collapse in order to further our understanding of the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of OSA. They will do this by comparing the findings from DISE with&#xD;
      aerodynamic readings from within the upper airway during natural sleep. The proposed&#xD;
      technique will employ technologies already approved by the FDA for clinical use. Capacitance&#xD;
      circuitry, airflow sensors, and/or pressure transducers will be suspended within the upper&#xD;
      aerodigestive tract along a thin, low-profile, and flexible tube. During Phase I of the&#xD;
      study, this aerodynamic probe will be placed in the OR during DISE along the upper airway,&#xD;
      namely in the retropalatal, retroglossal, and hypopharyngeal regions. Readings will be&#xD;
      correlated and calibrated with DISE findings in real-time. During Phase II, these sensors&#xD;
      will again be placed within the same patients during in-office sleep studies. The results&#xD;
      from the sleep study will be analyzed in conjunction with OR findings in order to create an&#xD;
      aerodynamic model for natural sleep. This will also allow the investigators to assess whether&#xD;
      airway observations during DISE were valid representations of natural sleep.&#xD;
