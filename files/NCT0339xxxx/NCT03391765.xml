  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study (M15-563) was a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, multiple-dose, multicenter,&#xD;
      long-term extension of NCT 02985879 (Study M15-562) in participants with progressive&#xD;
      supranuclear palsy (PSP). Those who completed the 52-week Treatment Period in Study M15-562&#xD;
      and met all entry criteria were eligible for enrollment into this study. This study planned&#xD;
      for a Treatment Period of up to 5 years and a post-treatment follow-up visit approximately 20&#xD;
      weeks after the last dose of study drug (including participants who prematurely discontinued&#xD;
      treatment). All participants received ABBV-8E12 as follows: those who received placebo in&#xD;
      Study M15-562 were randomized, in a 1:1 ratio, to either 2000 or 4000 mg; those who received&#xD;
      ABBV-8E12 at a dose of either 2000 or 4000 mg in Study M15-562 continued on the same dose in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was prematurely discontinued because the program for progressive supranuclear&#xD;
      palsy was discontinued due to lack of efficacy.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Rating Scale (PSPRS) Total Score From Baseline to Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The PSPRS consists of 28 items grouped in six domains: daily activities (by history); behavior; bulbar; ocular motor; limb motor; and gait/midline. Items are scored on a 0 to 4 scale, except for six items that are scored on a 0 to 2 scale, with the total score ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate more severe disability or movement abnormality. Positive values indicate worsening from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 52 in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part II (Activities of Daily Living)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is an Investigator-used rating tool to follow the longitudinal course of Parkinson's disease. The Part II score is the sum of the answers to the 13 questions related to Activities of Daily Living, and ranges from 0-52. Higher scores are associated with more disability. Positive values indicate worsening from baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-C) Score From Baseline to Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) score is a clinician's rating scale for assessing Global Improvement of Change. The CGI-C rates improvement by 7 categories: very much improved (1), much improved (2), minimally improved (3), no change (4), minimally worse (5), much worse (6), very much worse (7). The CGI-C score ranges from 1 to 7, with lower scores indicating improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 52 in Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living Scale (SEADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living (SEADL) scale consists of ten items intended to evaluate the daily life activities of a participant. The SEADL is composed of two sections: the first is a self-reported questionnaire in which participants grade their own daily life activities, such as dressing, using the toilet, resting, eating, and social activities (subjective assessment), and the second is an assessment of motor functions, such as postural balance, speaking, rigidity, and tremors, conducted by a clinician (objective assessment). It is a percentage scale divided into deciles, and the results are reported between 0% (bedridden) and 100% (healthy). Negative values indicate worsening from baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 52 in Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S is a clinician's rating of disease severity. The CGI-S rates severity of illness on a 7-point scale, using a range of responses from 1 (normal) through 7 (the most severely ill). This rating is based upon observed and reported symptoms, behavior, and function in the past 7 days. Positive values indicate worsening from baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change Score (PGI-C) Score From Baseline to Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The PGI-C is a participant's rating of the change in their PSP-related symptoms since initiation of study drug. Participants rated their change in status using the following 7-point scale: 1 = Very much improved; 2 = Much improved; 3 = Minimally improved; 4 = No change; 5 = Minimally worse; 6 = Much worse; 7 = Very much worse.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 52 in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Staging System Score (PSP-SS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Rating Scale (PSPRS) consists of 28 items grouped in six domains: daily activities (by history); behavior; bulbar; ocular motor; limb motor; and gait/midline. Items are scored on a 0 to 4 scale, except for four items that are scored on a 0 to 2 scale, with the total score ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate more severe disability or movement abnormality. The PSP-SS score is a composite of the dysphagia and gait items from the PSPRS. Positive values indicate worsening from baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Loss of Ability to Walk Independently as Measured by Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Rating Scale (PSPRS) Item 26</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The PSPRS consists of 28 items grouped in six domains: daily activities (by history); behavior; bulbar; ocular motor; limb motor; and gait/midline. Items are scored on a 0 to 4 scale, except for four items that are scored on a 0 to 2 scale, with the total score ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate more severe disability or movement abnormality. Item 26 pertains to gait, scored as either 0 (normal); 1 (slightly wide-based or irregular or slight pulsion on turns); 2 (must walk slowly or occasionally use walls or helper to avoid falling, especially on turns); 3 (must use assistance all or almost all the time); or 4 (unable to walk, even with walker; may be able to transfer).</description>

        <title>Change in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Rating Scale (PSPRS) Total Score From Baseline to Week 52</title>
        <description>The PSPRS consists of 28 items grouped in six domains: daily activities (by history); behavior; bulbar; ocular motor; limb motor; and gait/midline. Items are scored on a 0 to 4 scale, except for six items that are scored on a 0 to 2 scale, with the total score ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate more severe disability or movement abnormality. Positive values indicate worsening from baseline.</description>

          <description>The Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) score is a clinician's rating scale for assessing Global Improvement of Change. The CGI-C rates improvement by 7 categories: very much improved (1), much improved (2), minimally improved (3), no change (4), minimally worse (5), much worse (6), very much worse (7). The CGI-C score ranges from 1 to 7, with lower scores indicating improvement.</description>

        <description>The Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living (SEADL) scale consists of ten items intended to evaluate the daily life activities of a participant. The SEADL is composed of two sections: the first is a self-reported questionnaire in which participants grade their own daily life activities, such as dressing, using the toilet, resting, eating, and social activities (subjective assessment), and the second is an assessment of motor functions, such as postural balance, speaking, rigidity, and tremors, conducted by a clinician (objective assessment). It is a percentage scale divided into deciles, and the results are reported between 0% (bedridden) and 100% (healthy). Negative values indicate worsening from baseline.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 52 in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Staging System Score (PSP-SS) Score</title>
        <description>The Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Rating Scale (PSPRS) consists of 28 items grouped in six domains: daily activities (by history); behavior; bulbar; ocular motor; limb motor; and gait/midline. Items are scored on a 0 to 4 scale, except for four items that are scored on a 0 to 2 scale, with the total score ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate more severe disability or movement abnormality. The PSP-SS score is a composite of the dysphagia and gait items from the PSPRS. Positive values indicate worsening from baseline.</description>

        <description>The PSPRS consists of 28 items grouped in six domains: daily activities (by history); behavior; bulbar; ocular motor; limb motor; and gait/midline. Items are scored on a 0 to 4 scale, except for four items that are scored on a 0 to 2 scale, with the total score ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate more severe disability or movement abnormality. Item 26 pertains to gait, scored as either 0 (normal); 1 (slightly wide-based or irregular or slight pulsion on turns); 2 (must walk slowly or occasionally use walls or helper to avoid falling, especially on turns); 3 (must use assistance all or almost all the time); or 4 (unable to walk, even with walker; may be able to transfer).</description>
