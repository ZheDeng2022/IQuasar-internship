             recent acute hepatitis B); Negative HBsAg and positive for hepatitis B core antibody:&#xD;
             hepatitis B virus DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is necessary. Detectable&#xD;
             hepatitis B virus DNA suggests occult hepatitis B&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive Hepatitis C virus antibody (HCVAb): hepatitis C virus RNA by PCR is&#xD;
             necessary. Detectable hepatitis C virus RNA suggests chronic hepatitis C&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or evidence of any other clinically significant disorder, condition or disease&#xD;
             that, in the opinion of the investigator or Amgen physician, if consulted, would pose&#xD;
