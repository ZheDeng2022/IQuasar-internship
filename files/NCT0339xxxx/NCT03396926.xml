  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and best dose of capecitabine when given&#xD;
      together with pembrolizumab and bevacizumab, and investigates how well they work in treating&#xD;
      patients with microsatellite stable colorectal cancer that has spread to nearby tissues or&#xD;
      lymph nodes, has spread to other places in the body, or that cannot be removed by surgery.&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab and bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability&#xD;
      of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving capecitabine together with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab and bevacizumab may work better in treating patients with colorectal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)/maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      capecitabine when administered with pembrolizumab and bevacizumab. (Safety Lead-In Cohort)&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) to pembrolizumab plus capecitabine and&#xD;
      bevacizumab (complete or partial response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
      Tumors [RECIST] 1.1) in subjects with metastatic or locally advanced unresectable&#xD;
      microsatellite stable (MSS)/mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) colorectal carcinoma (CRC) that&#xD;
      is stable or progressing on fluorouracil (5FU)-based therapy. (Phase II Expansion Cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES (Phase II Expansion Cohort):&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab in combination with capecitabine&#xD;
      and bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate ORR per immune-related RECIST (irRECIST). III. To evaluate duration of&#xD;
      response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR) and progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1&#xD;
      and irRECIST and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Correlation of outcomes to line of therapy; stable disease or progression on a prior&#xD;
      regimen containing infusional 5-FU or capecitabine; prior exposure to bevacizumab; and&#xD;
      primary tumor location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore baseline immune profiles via PD-L1, and multiplex Immunohistochemistry (IHC)&#xD;
      for identification of potentially predictive biomarkers in patients with metastatic or&#xD;
      locally advanced, unresectable CRC treated with pembrolizumab-based combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To characterize the change in the populations of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs)&#xD;
      by IHC induced by pembrolizumab-based combination therapy in paired pre- and on-treatment&#xD;
      tumor biopsies from patients with metastatic or locally advanced, unresectable MSS / pMMR&#xD;
      CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the change in T cell repertoire via next generation sequencing (NGS) within&#xD;
      blood and tumor biopsy samples induced by pembrolizumab-based combination therapy in patients&#xD;
      with metastatic or locally advanced, unresectable MSS/pMMR CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To establish human immune system (HIS) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models from&#xD;
      pre-treatment biopsies to a) analyze change in immune cell profiles HIS PDX models using the&#xD;
      same techniques as described for corresponding patients, above and b) correlate response to&#xD;
      pembrolizumab-containing therapy in patients and HIS PDX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial safety lead-in will be performed to define the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over&#xD;
      30 minutes on day 1, bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1, and capecitabine orally (PO)&#xD;
      twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 35 courses in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 9 weeks until&#xD;
      disease progression, start of new anti-cancer therapy, death, or end of the study whichever&#xD;
      comes first&#xD;

    <description>A DLT evaluation of the first 6 patients will be conducted to confirm the safety of administering pembrolizumab at 200 mg (flat dosing) every three weeks with capecitabine and bevacizumab and follows the principles of standard 3+3 dose escalation studies. The All Subjects as Treated (ASaT) population will be used for the analysis of safety data in this study. The ASaT population consists of all allocated subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment. At least one laboratory or vital sign measurement obtained subsequent to at least one dose of study treatment is required for inclusion in the analysis including a baseline measure.

             warfarin or warfarin-derivative anti-coagulants for at least 7 days prior to starting&#xD;
             study drug, however, therapeutic or prophylactic therapy with low-molecular weight&#xD;
             heparin is allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Has history of known coagulopathy that increases risk of bleeding or a history of&#xD;
             clinically significant hemorrhage within 12 months of start of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Known bleeding risk including serious hemorrhage or hemoptysis within the last 3&#xD;
             months; major surgery within the past 8 weeks or minor surgery within the past 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Has known gastrointestinal bleeding or any other hemorrhage/bleeding event Common&#xD;
             Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade &gt; 3 within 6 months of start of&#xD;
             study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Has greater than 1+ proteinuria on a urine dipstick or equivalent routine laboratory&#xD;
             analysis will require further testing with a urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR);&#xD;
             UPCR must be calculated as follows: UPCR = protein concentration (mg/dL)/creatinine&#xD;
             (mg/dL); if the UPCR &gt;= 1, then the patient will not be eligible for study entry;&#xD;
             however, if urinalysis or equivalent routine laboratory analysis shows no protein,&#xD;
             then UPCR testing is not required&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Has a history of non-healing wounds or ulcers, or bone re-fractures within 3 months of&#xD;
             fracture&#xD;

         26. Has inadequately controlled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure greater&#xD;
             than 150 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure greater than 95 mm Hg). The use of&#xD;
             anti-hypertensive medications to control blood pressure is permitted. Retesting is&#xD;
             permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
         27. Has a history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy within 6 months&#xD;

         28. Has had clinically significant cardiovascular disease within 12 months of planned&#xD;
             start of study drug, including myocardial infarction, unstable angina, grade 2 or&#xD;
             greater peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic&#xD;
             attack, congestive heart failure, or arrhythmias not controlled by outpatient&#xD;
             medication, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty/stent&#xD;
&#xD;
         29. Has a known history of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or&#xD;
             intra-abdominal abscess within 6 months prior to planned start of study drug&#xD;
