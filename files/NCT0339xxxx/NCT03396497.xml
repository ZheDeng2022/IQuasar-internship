    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1B study designed to assess the safety and tolerability of LYC-55716 given in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab to subjects with metastatic NSCLC, and to assess the&#xD;
      combination for biologic and clinical activity in NSCLC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 18 subjects across 5 US sites will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will enter a screening period of up to 28 days, followed by continuous twice daily&#xD;
      administration of LYC-55716 in 28 day treatment cycles. Subjects will also be administered&#xD;
      pembrolizumab every 3 weeks as prescribed as standard of care by the Investigator in&#xD;
      accordance with the package insert.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will begin with a run-in cohort of 3 subjects to assess the safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of the LYC-55716/pembrolizumab combination. Subjects in the run-in cohort will be enrolled&#xD;
      singly at intervals of not less than 7 days in order to monitor for adverse reactions to the&#xD;
      combination. If no subjects in the run-in cohorts has a DLT, then the study may proceed to&#xD;
      the main cohort (15 subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive combination treatment until clinically significant disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity, or up to a maximum of 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Run-in Cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of the LYC-55716/pembrolizumab combination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the dose of LYC-55716 that is adequately tolerated when used in combination&#xD;
           with pembrolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Study Cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Further evaluate the safety and tolerability of the LYC-55716/pembrolizumab combination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Study Cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the cellular immune response in paired tumor biopsy samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate effects on circulating biomarkers in the blood of LYC-55716 with pembrolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the objective response rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the duration of response&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)&#xD;
