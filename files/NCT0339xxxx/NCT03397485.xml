  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the present study was to assess the effect of a growing-up milk on growth&#xD;
      and micronutrient status in children 12 to 30 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted in Cuernavaca, the state capital of Morelos, Mexico. The&#xD;
      investigators included children who attended day-care centers. These day- care centers are&#xD;
      part of a national government program which main objective is to support working mothers and&#xD;
      those who intend to work and do not have access to a health service and are at risk of&#xD;
      poverty. The study described herein is a randomized, parallel, double-blind, controlled trial&#xD;
      by administration of growing up milk (GM) and fortified milk (FM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results showed a significant improvement in linear growth in both supplemented groups, with&#xD;
      no statistical difference between treatments. By using an artificial, population-based&#xD;
      comparison group, the investigators conclude that this improvement was attributable to the&#xD;
      supplements.&#xD;

      The study was conducted in Mexico. The investigators included children 12 to 30 months of age&#xD;
      who attended day-care centers. These day- care centers are part of a national government&#xD;
      program which main objective is to support working mothers and those who intend to work and&#xD;
      do not have access to a health service and are at risk of poverty. The program also includes&#xD;
      single parents in charge of their family with children between 12 and 36 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study described herein is a randomized, parallel,double-blind, controlled trial by&#xD;
      administration of growing up milk (GM) and fortified milk (FM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and masking:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Moses-Oakford method was used to randomly assign 189 children to 1 of 2 groups in this&#xD;
      double-blind controlled trial by the administration of growth milk (Enfa-Grow® GM) (GM) and&#xD;
      fortified milk (FM). There were 96 children in the red-gray group and 93 in the blue-green&#xD;
      group, the study will be blinded until the statistical analysis is finished. One group&#xD;
      received GM and the other group receive FM. Both groups received 480 mL/d (240 mL at 7:00&#xD;
      a.m. and 240 mL at 16:00 p.m.). Both supplements were indistinguishable, same color, (white&#xD;
      milk powder) odor, and flavor except for the color-coding of the can. The color code was&#xD;
      unknown for researchers, field workers, users and analysts. Milk was offered to the children&#xD;
      5d/wk for a period of 4mo under supervision of the study personnel who recorded whether the&#xD;
      supplement was consumed as well as the amount.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators did not included children, who were breastfed at the time of the study,&#xD;
      neither child receiving multiple micronutrient supplementations. If a child had capillary&#xD;
      hemoglobin &lt;9.0g/dl, at baseline or was clinically sick was not included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Anthropometric measures Anthropometric measures were taken at baseline, 8 and&#xD;
      16wks. Weight was measured to the nearest 10g with an electronic scale (TANITA Scale, Tanita&#xD;
      Corp., Arlington Heights, IL capacity 14 kg for infants and 36 kg adults, Tokyo) and length&#xD;
      and height were measured to the nearest millimeter with a length board (Schorr Industries,&#xD;
      Glenn Burney, MD). Head circumference was taken with a flexible non-stretchable plasticized&#xD;
      measuring tape to the nearest millimeter (model, Hoechstmass-Rollfix 150cm). Field workers&#xD;
      were trained and standardized using standard techniques according to protocols. Weight,&#xD;
      length and head circumference were transformed to Z scores by using the 2006 World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) reference standards. Prevalence of stunting, wasting and underweight were&#xD;
      calculated using minus 2 z-scores for each indicator (length- or height-for-age,&#xD;
      weight-for-length or height- and weight-for-age) at specific cutoff points for age and sex.&#xD;
      Overweight /obesity were defined as weight for length/height above plus 2 z-Score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemoglobin concentration was determined in capillary blood samples obtained by finger prick&#xD;
      and measured in a Portable Photometer -HemoCue-, at baseline. According to selection criteria&#xD;
      if a child had &lt;9.0g/dl, the child was referred to the nearest health center. After overnight&#xD;
      fasting, venous blood samples (10ml) were drawn from antecubital vein at baseline and at 8&#xD;
      and 16 weeks thereafter. Samples were obtained by a trained nurse who had had experience&#xD;
      working with children and according to protocol procedures established by the Biosecurity&#xD;
      Commission at the National Institute of Public Health (NIPH). Capillary and venous blood&#xD;
      samples were taken at each day care-center. Capillary blood samples were taken only at&#xD;
      baseline. Some mothers were withdrawing from the study because of the blood sampling. Samples&#xD;
      were centrifuged using a portable centrifuge EBA8 (Hettich, Tuttlingen, Germany) at 280 X g;&#xD;
      20 min in situ and serum was stored in color-coded cryogenic vials, and preserved in liquid&#xD;
      nitrogen protected from light until delivery to the Biochemical and Nutrition Laboratory at&#xD;
      the NIPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once in the laboratory, samples were stored at -70ºC until ready to be analyzed. Each&#xD;
      micronutrient was measured as follows: Ferritin, zinc and folate: Commercial kits were used&#xD;
      to assess the serum concentrations of ferritin (Dade Behring Inc.) The serum concentrations&#xD;
      of zinc were measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy using a&#xD;
      Varian Vista Pro CCD spectrometer. The serum folate was released from protein using sodium&#xD;
      hydroxide, dithiothreitol, and potassium cyanide, and transformed into cyanocobalamin and&#xD;
      stable folates. Their concentrations were measured by competitive enzymatic immunoassays in a&#xD;
      TOSOH automated immune-analysis. Vitamin D: serum 25-OH-D3 was analyzed by CMIA using an&#xD;
      Abbott Architect module. Vitamin A: Serum retinol was extracted with 100% pure ethanol; the&#xD;
      ethanol was evaporated under a nitrogen flux and dissolved in 100 ml of 10% ethanol.&#xD;
      Determinations were performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in a Waters&#xD;
      instrument (Waters Co., Milford, MA, USA), using a 3.9 x 150 mm column Nova-Pak C18 ODS&#xD;
      (Waters Co.), with a mobile phase of CH3OH, 100% with a flux velocity of 1.5 ml/min, at a&#xD;
      wavelength of 325 nm. Serum lipids: lipid serum profile was determined by a gas&#xD;
      chromatographer (5890 Series II, Hewlett-Packard, United States) Morbidity data were&#xD;
      collected daily at each day care center. A checklist was used to record symptoms of diarrhea&#xD;
      and acute respiratory infections. Mothers or caretakers were asked to recall any symptoms&#xD;
      regarding milk consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socioeconomic status Information about the participant's household's characteristics, the&#xD;
      education level and parents' occupation was obtained by interviewing of the mother.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Milk powder was prepared and reconstituted every weekday at each day-care center&#xD;
      according to WHO and Day Care guidelines. In the morning approximately at 7a.m., trained&#xD;
      personnel prepared the milk according to the color-coding assigned to each child. Bottles&#xD;
      were used to facilitate measuring in milliliters. Each bottle was weighted before and after&#xD;
      preparing milk in a diet measuring scale (OHOUSE, model CS5000, capacity 5000gx2g).Trained&#xD;
      cups were also used. Each child received an individual bottle or cup with its own milk&#xD;
      (240ml). Once each bottle or cup was prepared it was given to the child. After the child&#xD;
      finished drinking the milk, leftovers were weighted and recorded in the consumption form.&#xD;
      Milk was prepared again (240ml) according to protocols before each child left approximately&#xD;
      at 16:00 p.m. Leftover milk was weighted, measured and recorded. Mothers or caregivers were&#xD;
      instructed on how to prepare powder milk at home according to WHO guidelines. This was done&#xD;
      on weekends and for children who drank milk before arriving to the day care center. Mothers&#xD;
      were given the amount of milk necessary to prepare 480 ml per day during the weekend. Mothers&#xD;
      registered the amount of milk left by the child in a consumption form and were trained to&#xD;
      estimate and register milk consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of micronutrient deficiencies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Folate: Children with serum concentrations of folate below&lt; 4ng/mL were categorized as&#xD;
           deficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ferritin: Children with serum concentrations below &lt;12 μg/L (LIS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Zinc: Children with serum concentrations below &lt;65 μg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Vitamin A: Children with serum concentrations below &lt; 20.02 ug/dL (&lt;0.70 µmol/l).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Vitamin D: Children with serum concentrations below &lt; 20nmol/L (&lt;8ng/ml) were considered&#xD;
           with severe deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Baseline general characteristics were compared between study groups&#xD;
      using the t statistic for independent samples. For categorical characteristics the&#xD;
      chi-squared statistic was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each continuous response variable -i.e. growth or micronutrients-, the differential&#xD;
      effect of supplementation was estimated with a multiple regression model that included an&#xD;
      indicator variable of study group, an indicator variable of the follow-up period and the&#xD;
      corresponding interaction of these two terms. For binary outcomes logistic regression model&#xD;
      was used. Baseline characteristics that significantly differed between study groups were&#xD;
      included as covariates. All standard errors were adjusted for data dependencies at the&#xD;
      subject level. Anthropometric continuous responses were analyzed assuming normality whereas&#xD;
      micronutrient continuous responses were assumed to have a lognormal distribution. For the&#xD;
      latter, the outcome variable was log transformed before estimating the model and adjusted&#xD;
      geometric means were obtained as post estimation. Adjusted probabilities were obtained after&#xD;
      fitting the logistic models and applying the inverse of the logit function to the linear&#xD;
      prediction. Adjusted geometric means and probabilities were obtained through predictive&#xD;
      margins and their standard errors through the Delta method; changes over time for these&#xD;
      predictive margins were obtained as average marginal effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A socioeconomic status indicator was obtained abstracting the first principal component from&#xD;
      household material characteristics and services. The first principal component explained 30%&#xD;
      of total variance.&#xD;
