  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of dietary carbohydrate and sugar consumption,&#xD;
      independent of energy content, on body fatness and metabolism in a rigorous feeding study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many people with obesity can lose weight for a few months, but most have difficulty&#xD;
      maintaining weight loss over the long term. Extensive research has shown that weight loss&#xD;
      elicits biological adaptations - including a decline in energy expenditure and an increase in&#xD;
      hunger - that promote weight regain. However, this observation leaves unanswered why average&#xD;
      body weight has recently increased among populations that are mostly genetically stable.&#xD;
      According to the Carbohydrate-Insulin Model, increased consumption of processed carbohydrates&#xD;
      during the low-fat diet era of the last 40 years has raised the average body weight being&#xD;
      defended by biological mechanisms on a population basis. Specifically, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that diets high in total carbohydrate (with or without added sugar) acting&#xD;
      through increased insulin secretion, alter substrate partitioning toward storage in body fat,&#xD;
      leading to increased hunger, slowing metabolism, and accumulation of body fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis, the investigators plan a randomized-controlled feeding study&#xD;
      involving 125 adults with obesity. During the run-in phase, participants will be given a&#xD;
      hypocaloric very-low-carbohydrate (VLC) diet, with adjustment of energy intake to produce 15&#xD;
      Â± 3% weight loss over 3 to 4 months on an outpatient basis. After weight stabilization,&#xD;
      participants will be admitted to a residential center for 13 weeks. During the first 3 weeks,&#xD;
      energy intake and expenditure will be closely monitored during weight-loss maintenance. Then,&#xD;
      energy intake will be individually &quot;locked&quot; at levels equal to energy expenditure and&#xD;
      participants will be administered one of three randomly-assigned test diets for 10 weeks. The&#xD;
      test diets include VLC, High Carbohydrate-Low Sugar (HC-LS), and High Carbohydrate-High Sugar&#xD;
      (HC-HS).&#xD;
