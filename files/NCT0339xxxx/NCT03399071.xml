  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single centre phase II trial of peri-operative chemo-immunotherapy in operable&#xD;
      gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma (GOA). This trial is designed to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of administering Avelumab, an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, with cytotoxic FLOT&#xD;
      chemotherapy for patients with operable GOA treated according to a peri-operative protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is in 2 stages: the first stage will establish the safe and tolerated maximum&#xD;
      administered dose (MAD) of Avelumab in combination with FLOT and the second stage will assess&#xD;
      the efficacy of this combination therapy in achieving pathological complete response (pCR)&#xD;
      and peri-operative safety.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive chemo-immunotherapy consisting of FLOT chemotherapy (Folinic acid&#xD;
      200mg/m2 iv infusion day 1, Oxaliplatin 85mg/m2 iv infusion day 1, Docetaxel 50mg/m2 iv day&#xD;
      1, Fluorouracil 2600mg/m2 over 24 hours iv) and the PD-L1 inhibiting monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      Avelumab. The safe dose of Avelumab in combination with FLOT will be established in a safety&#xD;
      run-in phase with a standard 3+3 design, starting with the recommended dose of 10mg/kg iv&#xD;
      Avelumab (dose level 0) in which a dose reduction to 7mg/kg iv (dose level -1) may occur.&#xD;
      Four cycles of two-weekly chemo-immunotherapy will be administered before surgery and four&#xD;
      further cycles post-operatively in patients who are fit enough to receive further&#xD;
      chemo-immunotherapy after surgery. Resectional surgery will take place 4-8 weeks following&#xD;
      the last dose of chemo-immunotherapy in patients who remain fit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety, efficacy and toxicities and to explore biomarkers of peri-operative&#xD;
      chemo-immunotherapy with Avelumab and FLOT.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Within 2 years of study opening</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of FLOT-A in the peri-operative setting in patients with operable GOAs. We aim to increase the pCR rate after peri-operative treatment from 10% (minimum expected path CR rate for peri-operative FLOT chemotherapy), to a superior pCR rate of &gt;25%, by adding Avelumab to FLOT.&#xD;
Complete histopathologic response is defined by no vital tumour cells neither in the oesophagus, the stomach nor in the regional lymph nodes. In cases of residual tumour, the response assessment will follow criteria described by Mandard et al.</description>

&#xD;
          1. Male/female patients aged ≥18 years&#xD;

             of distant metastases (M0) where the MDT believes that an R0 resection can be achieved&#xD;
             at the outset. T4 tumours will be excluded due to the variable need to prolong&#xD;
             pre-operative chemotherapy or chemo-radiotherapy as part of locally advanced protocol&#xD;
             to reduce margin involvement and improve resectability.&#xD;

             indicated) prior to study entry&#xD;

             Clearance is required. If available, the EDTA Clearance should always take precedence&#xD;
             over the Creatinine Clearance.&#xD;
