  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Work place related (lower) back pain in medical personnel is limiting to workability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though occupational prevention programs are increasingly established, data on the&#xD;
      effectiveness of training interventions offered at work-sites is largely missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized, investigator-blind, controlled feasibility study we aim to compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness of device assisted training therapy in comparison to a general recommendation&#xD;
      &quot;to stay active&quot; or group gymnastics in terms of pain frequency and intensity (main outcome).&#xD;
      Additional outcome variables are: quality of life, psychological well-being, work efficiency,&#xD;
      of sick-leave days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible employees (2 x 30) of the General Hospital of Vienna (AKH) over the age of 45 years&#xD;
      suffering from (lower) back pain (&gt;30 days/last year) of intensity ≥ 3 (numeric scale 0-10)&#xD;
      will be included in two parallel groups. Group I starts with a device (DAVID) assisted&#xD;
      training (40 training sessions; 2x / week) of the core trunk musculature. Group II gets&#xD;
      instructions and an advice on how to &quot;stay active&quot; during the first 6 months. Assessment will&#xD;
      be conducted before and after these 6 months; then groups are switched, thus, study subjects&#xD;
      act as their own controls.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Work place related pain syndromes of the (lower) back pose a major health problem for medical&#xD;
      personnel. Beside the discomfort and limitations of the affected patients, a severe&#xD;
      restriction of their ability to work must be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For secondary prevention of back pain, health promotion programs are recommended. These&#xD;
      consist of psychosocial and ergonomic interventions and, above all, a regular strengthening&#xD;
      of the stabilizing muscle groups. Specific strength and endurance training for the trunk&#xD;
      musculature with appropriate equipment is considered as a useful preventive measure and thus&#xD;
      commonly offered at large corporations, even during working hours of the staff. However, data&#xD;
      clearly demonstrating the effectivity and cost-effectiveness of these interventions is&#xD;
      largely missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study serves several purposes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On one hand, the feasibility of a randomized, controlled study is to be examined, which is to&#xD;
      prove the effectiveness of the medical training therapy in comparison to a general&#xD;
      recommendation &quot;to stay active&quot; or in comparison to group gymnastics. In particular,&#xD;
      logistical problems in the organization of training therapy and training compliance must be&#xD;
      clarified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, this pilot study serves to generate hypotheses. Several variables in&#xD;
      regard to possible changes due to the training intervention will be investigated. Collected&#xD;
      pilot data will be used for corresponding case number estimates of a subsequent confirmatory&#xD;
      study. The outcome variables are: number of back pain days and intensity, quality of life,&#xD;
      psychological well-being, work efficiency, days of sick-leave.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Randomized, investigator-blind, controlled pilot study with parallel group&#xD;
      comparison of outcomes in employees of the General Hospital of Vienna (AKH) over the age of&#xD;
      45 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Subjects 2 x 30 employees over the age of 45, who suffered more than 30 days of back&#xD;
      and / or lower back pain of moderate to high intensity ≥ 3 (numeric scale 0-10) in the last&#xD;
      year and suffer from pain in up to 3 body parts (in total) or less. Group I starts with a&#xD;
      machine assisted training, group II starts after a period of observation half a year later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Interventions 40 training sessions (2x / week) with DAVID training machines, which aim&#xD;
      to improve the strength, endurance and performance of the core trunk musculature. The&#xD;
      training will be initiated after a sufficiently long period of adjustment to the guidelines&#xD;
      of the American College of Sports Medicine. The training plan is created individually for&#xD;
      each subject. 4 to 6 people per hour can work out simultaneously. The training should be&#xD;
      completed in max 6 months or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group II gets instructions and an advice on how to &quot;stay active&quot; during the first 6 months.&#xD;
      Assessment will be conducted before and after these 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 6 months the groups are switched (group I with the initial DAVID machine assisted&#xD;
      training is left with recommendations to &quot;stay active&quot;; subjects from group II are now&#xD;
      trained for 6 months by means of 40 training sessions (2x / week) with DAVID assistance),&#xD;
      thus, study subjects act as their own controls.&#xD;
