  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an irregular heart rhythm associated with significant morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality. The pulmonary veins (the blood vessels carrying blood from the lungs into the&#xD;
      left atrium) have been shown to send electrical signals into the heart that can cause and&#xD;
      maintain AF. Pulmonary vein Isolation (PVI) is an established treatment where catheters are&#xD;
      passed into the atria of the heart to deliver lines of scar to electrically isolate the&#xD;
      pulmonary veins preventing them from transmitting these electrical signals into the left&#xD;
      atrium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ECG-I is a system which involves wearing a jacket with many ECG electrodes to record&#xD;
      electrical activity from the surface of the body. A CT scan then shows where these electrodes&#xD;
      are relative to the atria, and computer modelling is used to reconstruct the movements of&#xD;
      electricity on the surface of the heart and therefore identifying where the drivers (tissue&#xD;
      causing and maintaining AF) are located.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, not all patients respond to PVI due to the drivers of AF being located in&#xD;
      areas other than within the Pulmonary Veins. Identifying the drivers of AF is very difficult&#xD;
      and the role they play has yet to be proved scientifically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to enroll 100 patients with persistent AF and perform atrial mapping&#xD;
      using the ECG-I system. Solely pulmonary vein isolation will be performed. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed up to see if the distribution of drivers as predicted by the ECG-I predicts&#xD;
      outcomes. This may improve patient selection for this procedure.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the commonest heart rhythm disturbance and is associated with&#xD;
      significant morbidity and mortality. Catheter ablation (CA) is a procedure where catheters&#xD;
      (leads) are passed into the heart and energy is used to disrupt and isolate (by freezing or&#xD;
      cauterising) heart tissue causing AF. CA is an established therapy for AF. Success rates for&#xD;
      CA for paroxysmal AF lies in the region of 70% or better. However, success rates for&#xD;
      persistent AF is much lower and estimates lie in the region of 30-60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current CA protocols for AF centre on isolating the pulmonary veins (the pulmonary veins&#xD;
      drain into the left atrium) which have been proven to trigger AF. Pulmonary Vein Isolation&#xD;
      (PVI) ablation alone seems sufficient to remove the trigger for the vast majority of patients&#xD;
      with paroxysmal AF. However, in patients with persistent AF it is common for AF to continue&#xD;
      after the pulmonary veins have been electrically isolated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference in success rates between the paroxysmal and persistent form of AF is thought&#xD;
      to be due to changes within the heart atria after AF has been established for some time. In&#xD;
      persistent AF the atria dilate and remodel structurally and electrically, and therefore the&#xD;
      maintenance of persistent AF differs from paroxysmal AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persistent AF is thought to be maintained by focal sources, whether rotors or sites of radial&#xD;
      activation. Currently, targeting other sites within the atria in addition to PVI such as&#xD;
      fractionated electrograms (areas of electrical activity) are thought to be imprecise and&#xD;
      require extensive ablation. Often AF will persist despite targeting additional sites within&#xD;
      the atria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One particular challenge is to select patients likely to benefit from CA. CA carries an&#xD;
      approximate less than 1% risk of life threatening complication. Therefore being able to&#xD;
      select suitable patients is desirable in order to prevent unnecessary procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently clinical characteristics of patients or structural imaging have limited accuracy in&#xD;
      selecting patients likely to benefit from CA. Mapping studies have shown that patients with&#xD;
      persistent AF who have higher frequency signals near the pulmonary veins than being&#xD;
      distributed in the left atrial body are more likely to terminate to sinus rhythm (normal&#xD;
      heart rhythm) with PVI alone and to maintain sinus rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have suggested that patients undergoing standard PVI ablation procedures for&#xD;
      persistent AF who have coincidental interruption of drivers have a far better long term&#xD;
      outcome. This suggests that the characteristics of atrial heart tissue and electrical&#xD;
      activation patterns maintaining AF are likely to determine the response to ablation therefore&#xD;
      it may be possible to determine more directly and accurately the likelihood of success by&#xD;
      performing non-invasive mapping of the atria using the ECG-I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It appears that a proportion of patients with persistent AF will maintain sinus rhythm long&#xD;
      term after undergoing AF CA with standard PVI protocols alone. PVI can now be achieved&#xD;
      quickly and safely using technologies such as the Cryoballoon (A freezing technology).&#xD;
      Identification of patients that are likely to respond to PVI alone is therefore of great&#xD;
      interest as it (1) identifies patients that may respond to a conservative strategy, and (2)&#xD;
      in the absence of an effective strategy beyond PVI may allow de-selection of patients&#xD;
      unlikely to benefit from ablation at all.&#xD;
