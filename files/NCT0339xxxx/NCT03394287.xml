  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, Open-labeled, Randomised, Parallel, Non-comparative, Two-arms,&#xD;
      Investigator-initiated Clinical Trial of SHR-1210 (Anti-PD-1 Antibody) in Combination With&#xD;
      Apatinib (VEGFR2 inhibitor) in Subjects with Advanced Triple Negative Breast Cancer. Subjects&#xD;
      with advanced Triple Negative Breast Cancer will be recruited. Patients will be randomised to&#xD;
      two treatment arms of this study. One arm is SHR-1210 combination with apatinib daily dosing,&#xD;
      and the other arm is SHR-1210 combination with apatinib intermittent dosing; each arm will&#xD;
      enrolle10-29 subjects (Simons two stage design).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SHR-1210 combination with apatinib in&#xD;
      the treatment of advanced TNBC.&#xD;
