      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary immunodeficiency disorders, or PIDs, are diseases that weaken the immune system. This&#xD;
      makes it easier for a person to get sick. Some PIDs are mild and may not be diagnosed until&#xD;
      later in life. Other kinds are severe and can be identified shortly after birth. Researchers&#xD;
      want to learn more about PIDs by comparing data from relatives and healthy volunteers to&#xD;
      people with a PID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about PIDs, including their genetic causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 0 75 with a PID or their healthy biological relatives the same ages&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers ages 18 75&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and HIV blood test. They&#xD;
      may have a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may repeat the screening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood taken at screening will be used for genetic tests and research tests. Participants will&#xD;
      be told test results that affect their health. Some blood will be stored for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult participants with a PID may have a small piece of skin removed. The area will be&#xD;
      numbed. A small tool will take a piece of skin about the size of a pencil eraser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers may collect fluid or tissue samples from PID participants regular medical care.&#xD;
      They will use them for research tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with a PID will have 3 follow-up visits over 10 years (for infants, 2 years).&#xD;
      Visits will include a physical exam, medical history, and blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with a PID and their relatives will be called once a year for 10 years. They&#xD;
      will talk about how they are feeling and if they have developed any new symptoms or&#xD;
      illnesses.&#xD;

      This is a natural history study designed to investigate forms of primary immunodeficiency&#xD;
      disorders (PIDs), and to better define both new and previously described forms of PID,&#xD;
      including severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), combined immunodeficiency, natural killer&#xD;
      (NK) cell deficiency, and other disorders. Patients with clinical and/or laboratory evidence&#xD;
      of PID will be recruited at Children s National Health System (CNHS) and the National&#xD;
      Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Infants identified at birth with a&#xD;
      positive newborn screening for SCID and confirmed to have T-cell lymphocytopenia will also be&#xD;
      recruited at CNHS. Subjects with a known or unknown PID and infants with T-cell&#xD;
      lymphocytopenia will provide one or more blood samples during the course of the study to&#xD;
      enable immunologic and genetic investigations of immune pathways contributing to PIDs. These&#xD;
      subjects will also be followed clinically to longitudinally assess the natural history of&#xD;
      novel and known PIDs. Subjects will be followed over time with regard to their immunologic&#xD;
      phenotype, clinical disease (including incidence of infections, autoimmune phenomena,&#xD;
      allergic disease, or malignancies), and response to both preventative and definitive&#xD;
      therapies. Biological relatives who do not have PID and healthy adult volunteers will also be&#xD;
      eligible to serve as controls for this study.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        -INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects must meet one of the following 4 criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients (age 0-75 years) with a clinical diagnosis of a form of PID (either&#xD;
                  known or unknown). PID is defined by laboratory and/or clinical findings on two&#xD;
                  or more occasions that are consistent with a defect in innate or adaptive&#xD;
                  immunity. Specific PIDs are defined by the International Union of Immunological&#xD;
                  Societies guidelines. These subjects must also be willing to undergo genetic&#xD;
                  testing and to allow their biospecimens to be modified into iPS cells. Women of&#xD;
                  childbearing potential, or who are lactating, may be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Infants identified at birth with positive newborn screening for SCID and&#xD;
                  confirmed to have T-cell lymphocytopenia. These subjects must be willing to&#xD;
                  undergo genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Biological relatives (age 0-75 years) of a subject who meets criterion 1a or 1b&#xD;
                  but who do not have a PID themselves.Relatives may be mother, father, siblings,&#xD;
                  children, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and first cousins to a patient. There is&#xD;
                  no limit due to sex,&#xD;
&#xD;
                  race or disability. Women of child-bearing potential, or who are pregnant or&#xD;
                  lactating, may be eligible, however the volume of blood collected for research&#xD;
                  purposes will be reduced in consideration of their safety. Relatives must also be&#xD;
                  willing to undergo genetic&#xD;
&#xD;
                  testing&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Healthy volunteers (age 18-75 years) who are not related to another study&#xD;
                  subject, who do not have a PID, and meet the folllowing:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Weight is greater than 110 pounds&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Do not have a history of any heart, lung, or kidney disease, or bleeding&#xD;
                       disorders,&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Do not have a history of viral hepatitis (B or C), and have a negative&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Not infected with HIV&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Not to be pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. All subjects must be willing to allow their samples to be stored for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects with secondary causes of immunodeficiency are excluded from this study.&#xD;
             Secondary causes of immunodeficiency include HIV infection and immunodeficiency that&#xD;
             is deemed to be secondary to chronic use of immunosuppressive medications or&#xD;
             chemotherapeutic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pregnant women are excluded from study participantion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, contraindicates participation&#xD;
             in this study.&#xD;
