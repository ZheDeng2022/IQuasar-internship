  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is multicenter, double-blinded parallel group design, where participants with&#xD;
      moderate to severe asthma with AFAD will be enrolled. Participants will receive three doses&#xD;
      of 10 milligrams/kilogram (mg/kg) of GSK3772847 every 4 Weeks versus placebo along with&#xD;
      standard of care. Participants will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive either 10 mg/kg&#xD;
      GSK3772847 intravenously (IV) or matching placebo IV. Participants will receive study&#xD;
      treatment on Week 0 (Day 1), Week 4 and Week 8. The total duration of the study will be 28&#xD;
      Weeks and approximately 46 participants will be randomized.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The ACQ-5 is a five-item, self-completed questionnaire, which measures a participant's asthma control. The questions enquire about the frequency and/or severity of symptoms (nocturnal awakening, activity limitation, shortness of breath and wheeze) over the previous week. The response options for all these questions range from zero (no impairment/limitation) to six (total impairment/limitation) scale. ACQ-5 score is the mean of the five questions and ranges from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled). Baseline value is defined as the ACQ-5 assessment on Day 1. Change from Baseline is calculated as the post-dose value minus Baseline value.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The AQLQ is a disease-specific, self-administered quality of life questionnaire that was developed to evaluate the impact of asthma treatments on the quality of life of asthma sufferers. The AQLQ contains 32 items in four domains: activity limitation (11 items), symptoms (12 items), emotional function (five items), and environmental stimuli (four items). Participants were asked to recall their experience over the previous 14 days and respond to each question on a seven-point scale where a value of 1 indicates 'total impairment' and 7 indicates 'no impairment'. The total score is the mean of responses to all 32 questions and each individual domain score was calculated as the mean of the items within that domain. Hence, the total and domain scores were each defined on a range from 1 to 7 with higher scores indicating a higher quality of life. Baseline value is defined as the AQLQ assessment on Day 1. Change from Baseline is calculated as the post-dose value minus Baseline value.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study conducted in participants with moderate to severe asthma with allergic fungal airway disease (AFAD). The study was conducted across 4 countries-France, Netherlands, Russian Federation and the United Kingdom.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 17 participants were randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to receive either GSK3772847 10 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) or placebo. Recruitment in the study was terminated early due to the feasibility of completing the study in a timely manner.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>FeNO was assessed using a handheld electronic device. The measurements were obtained in accordance with the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society Recommendations for Standardized Procedures for the Online and Offline Measurement of Exhaled Lower Respiratory Nitric Oxide and Nasal Nitric Oxide. Participants did not use their rescue medication for at least 6 hours before each FeNO assessment, unless essential for clinical need. Baseline is the most recent recorded value before dosing on Day 1. Percent change from Baseline is calculated as (Ratio to Baseline minus 1)*100, where ratio to Baseline is the value at specified time point divided by Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Asthma Control Questionnaire-5 (ACQ-5) Absolute Score at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12</title>
        <description>The ACQ-5 is a five-item, self-completed questionnaire, which measures a participant's asthma control. The questions enquire about the frequency and/or severity of symptoms (nocturnal awakening, activity limitation, shortness of breath and wheeze) over the previous week. The response options for all these questions range from zero (no impairment/limitation) to six (total impairment/limitation) scale. ACQ-5 score is the mean of the five questions and ranges from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled). Baseline value is defined as the ACQ-5 assessment on Day 1. Change from Baseline is calculated as the post-dose value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) Total and Domain Scores at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12</title>
        <description>The AQLQ is a disease-specific, self-administered quality of life questionnaire that was developed to evaluate the impact of asthma treatments on the quality of life of asthma sufferers. The AQLQ contains 32 items in four domains: activity limitation (11 items), symptoms (12 items), emotional function (five items), and environmental stimuli (four items). Participants were asked to recall their experience over the previous 14 days and respond to each question on a seven-point scale where a value of 1 indicates 'total impairment' and 7 indicates 'no impairment'. The total score is the mean of responses to all 32 questions and each individual domain score was calculated as the mean of the items within that domain. Hence, the total and domain scores were each defined on a range from 1 to 7 with higher scores indicating a higher quality of life. Baseline value is defined as the AQLQ assessment on Day 1. Change from Baseline is calculated as the post-dose value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Responders to ACQ-5 at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12</title>
        <description>The ACQ-5 is a five-item, self-completed questionnaire, which measures a participant's asthma control. The questions enquire about the frequency and/or severity of symptoms (nocturnal awakening, activity limitation, shortness of breath and wheeze) over the previous week. The response options for all these questions range from zero (no impairment/limitation) to six (total impairment/limitation) scale. ACQ-5 score is the mean of the five questions and ranges from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled). A responder to ACQ-5 is defined as a participant who has a decrease from Baseline in ACQ-5 score of 0.5 or more at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Responders to AQLQ at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12</title>
        <description>The AQLQ is a disease-specific, self-administered quality of life questionnaire that was developed to evaluate the impact of asthma treatments on the quality of life of asthma sufferers. The AQLQ contains 32 items in four domains: activity limitation (11 items), symptoms (12 items), emotional function (five items), and environmental stimuli (four items). Participants were asked to recall their experience over the previous 14 days and respond to each question on a seven-point scale where a value of 1 indicates 'total impairment' and 7 indicates 'no impairment'. The total score is the mean of responses to all 32 questions. The total score was defined on a range from 1 to 7 with higher scores indicating a higher quality of life. A responder to AQLQ is defined as a participant who has an increase from Baseline in AQLQ score of 0.5 or more at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12.</description>

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: results in death; is life-threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; other important medical events that may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed before.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for the assessment of following clinical chemistry parameters: alanine aminotransferase, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, calcium, carbon dioxide, chloride, creatine kinase, creatinine, direct bilirubin, gamma glutamyl transferase, glucose, phosphate, potassium, protein, sodium and urea. Participants were counted in the worst case category that their value changed to (low, normal or high), unless there was no change in their category. Participants whose value category was unchanged (e.g., High to High), or whose value became normal, are recorded in the &quot;To Normal or No Change&quot; category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had values that changed 'To Low' and 'To High', so the percentages may not add to 100 percent (%). 'To Low' rows are not presented for tests that have lower limit of normal = 0.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Worst Case Post-Baseline Hematology Results Relative to Normal Range at Baseline</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the assessment of following hematology parameters: basophils, eosinophils, erythrocyte (Ery. ) mean hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), Ery. mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), Ery mean corpuscular volume (MCV), erythrocytes, erythrocytes distribution width, hematocrit, hemoglobin, leukocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils and platelets. Participants were counted in the worst case category that their value changed to (low, normal or high), unless there was no change in their category. Participants whose value category was unchanged (e.g., High to High), or whose value became normal, are recorded in the &quot;To Normal or No Change&quot; category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had values that changed 'To Low' and 'To High', so the percentages may not add to 100%. 'To Low' rows are not presented for tests that have lower limit of normal = 0.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Abnormal Electrocardiogram (ECG) Findings</title>
        <description>Twelve lead ECGs were obtained using a standardized ECG machine that measured heart rate, PR, QRS, QT and corrected QT interval (QTc). ECG measurements were done with the participant in a supine position having rested in this position for approximately 5 minutes before each reading. Clinically significant (CS) and not clinically significant (NCS) abnormal ECG findings at worst-case post-Baseline are presented. CS abnormal findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition. Data for worst-case post-Baseline is presented.</description>
