&#xD;
        3. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 3.1.Statistical Inference No formal hypothesis will be tested in&#xD;
           this study. This study will estimate the prevalence of Familial Hypercholesterolemia and&#xD;
           the related 95% confidence interval in the China outpatient population in pilot&#xD;
           hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2.Sample Size Considerations Based on initial feasibility analyses,revealed an&#xD;
           approximate annual patient population in cardiology outpatients is&#xD;
           1,000pts/month(50pts/day*20days) with lipid profile measured to be screened. It is&#xD;
           estimated that about 3000 patients out of cardiology department will measure their lipid&#xD;
           profile in the clinical laboratory, the working days for the outpatient department is&#xD;
           defined as 10mon, then total patients number in the outpatient will be about&#xD;
           4000pts/mon/center*10mon=40,000/center/yr. The prevalence of suspected patients based on&#xD;
           LDL-C level is 0.47%, then 188 clinical diagnosed patients/center/year to be transited&#xD;
           to the follow up period. Based on the planned site number of 6, total patient to be&#xD;
           enrolled to this study will be 1128. Based on the prevalence of HoFH is near&#xD;
           1/160,000~1/300,000, it is estimated that 1~2 HoFH patients will be identified from this&#xD;
           patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.3.Planned Analyses All summaries of the data will be descriptive in nature. For&#xD;
           categorical variables (including the primary outcome measure), the frequency and&#xD;
           percentage, with 95% confidence interval, will be given. Summary statistics for&#xD;
           continuous variables will include the number of subjects, mean, median, standard&#xD;
           deviation or standard error, 25th percentile (Q1), 75th percentile (Q3), minimum, and&#xD;
           maximum. The outcomes over time data will be evaluated using time to event analyses/Cox&#xD;
           proportional hazards models. All planned analyses will be descriptive. SAS version 9.2&#xD;
           (or a newer version) will be used for all Data Management and Statistical Analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.3.1.Description of Study Enrollment All subjects enrolled into the study who meet the&#xD;
           inclusion criteria will be included in the full analysis set and will be included in all&#xD;
           summaries and analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.3.2.Description of Subject/Patient Characteristics Clinical characteristics of&#xD;
           subjects in the study will be summarized. Measurements such as age will be based on the&#xD;
           status at the start of the observation period for the subject, and clinical&#xD;
           characteristics such as CV events will be captured throughout the 3.3.3.Primary Analysis&#xD;
           Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
           -To estimate the screen out rate of clinical diagnosed familial hypercholesterolemia in&#xD;
           outpatient department of China.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prevalence: Prevalence of suspected FH will be estimated using the patients' data who&#xD;
           visited the outpatients department in pilot hospitals and with measurable LDL-C data and&#xD;
           validated by China criteria and DNCL respectively. Prevalence will be reported annually&#xD;
           for the years 2017-2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
           -To describe parameters related to clinical management of diagnosed FH, including&#xD;
           patient demographics and characteristics, LDL-C and triglyceride concentrations, use of&#xD;
           lipid modifying therapies, and outcomes over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient demographics: Analyses of prevalence will be estimated for the following&#xD;
           demographic characteristics: age, gender, and region.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient clinical characteristics: The proportion of patients, calculated as percentage&#xD;
           of patients, for each of the following: BMI (obese/not obese), diabetes, CKD,&#xD;
           hypertension, any CVD history / number of CV events, smoking status (current /&#xD;
           previous). These will be measured both at baseline (time of FH diagnosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Current use of lipid-modifying therapies over time: Proportion of patients using LMT.&#xD;
           Analyses by type, dose and frequency will analysis with description statistical method.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  LDL-C concentrations over time. The LDL-C level will be follow up to the end of&#xD;
                study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Use of lipid-modifying therapies over time。 Proportion of patients using LMT.&#xD;
                Analyses by type, dose and frequency, and the proportion of patients on a&#xD;
                high-intensity statin regime and with high LDL-C will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Proportion of patients within and at distance from 2016 China guideline's LDL-C&#xD;
                target.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This will be calculated as the percentage of patients within 2016 China guideline LDL-C&#xD;
           target (&lt;2.6 mmol/L, &lt;1.8 mmol/L). LDL-C measurements will be followed up to the end of&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           -Incidence of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events The proportion of patients&#xD;
           having a fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular event will be calculated. Since there may be&#xD;
           competing risks with fatal / non-fatal events, analyses will be performed separately,&#xD;
           and in combination. All events occurring from date of enrollment of the study onwards&#xD;
           will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.3.4.General Considerations The first primary objective and all secondary objectives&#xD;
           will be addressed through descriptive statistics. The CV outcome will be evaluated using&#xD;
           time to event analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.3.5.Missing or Incomplete Data and Lost to Follow-up There are two types of data in&#xD;
           this study. For different data types, we will apply different methods to handle missing&#xD;
           data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For Medical records abstraction:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The missing age values will be imputed as the overall median to avoid case-wise&#xD;
           deletions. For some of the patients, certain physiological indicators were not measured&#xD;
           during hospitalization. These variables will be treated as a specific &quot;unmeasured&quot;&#xD;
           subgroup with clinical significance because not measured is not equal to &quot;missing&quot; and&#xD;
           may influence the outcomes. If we fit these variables as continuous in the models, we&#xD;
           could only arbitrarily consider these &quot;unmeasured&quot; as missing value as inappropriate.&#xD;
           Imputation also has limitations. Thus, to keep the models consistent with the features&#xD;
           of data, we will transform certain continuous variables into categorical ones, created&#xD;
           dummy variables accordingly, and including a specific category to indicate unmeasured.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For Baseline and follow-up questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Site investigators completed the questionnaires in an electronic data capture program on&#xD;
           a tablet computer (which allows real-time logic checks to ensure the accuracy and&#xD;
           completeness of data). All questions were required to be answered, except those that&#xD;
           were not applicable. There were options of &quot;refuse to answer&quot; and &quot;don't know&quot; for each&#xD;
           question.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. SAFETY DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING Due to the non-interventional nature of&#xD;
           this study, no pro-active safety data collection will take place. Only spontaneously&#xD;
           mentioned safety events and in-hospital clinical events will be collected in this study,&#xD;
           and reported follow by local regulation.&#xD;
