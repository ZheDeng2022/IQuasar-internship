  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness&#xD;
      of parent coaching sessions using video-based feedback, compared to the sessions without the&#xD;
      use of video-based feedback on parent strategy use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial of video-based feedback interventions for the&#xD;
      parents of young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In the beginning of the study,&#xD;
      each participant will be randomized to the video-based feedback condition (treatment&#xD;
      condition) or standard care procedure (control condition). All participants will be asked to&#xD;
      implement the strategies taught during the sessions in the home environment (e.g., following&#xD;
      the child's lead, sitting face-to-face). Participants randomized into the video-based&#xD;
      feedback condition (treatment condition) will be asked to video-tape their interactions with&#xD;
      their children (maximum 30 mins/week at home during free play, book reading, bath or meal&#xD;
      time routines). The therapist then will review the tapes and then use the recorded sessions&#xD;
      to give feedback on the parents' use of strategies in addition to providing in-vivo feedback&#xD;
      based on the live interactions during the sessions. For parents whose children are randomized&#xD;
      into the standard care condition, the families will receive coaching based on in-vivo&#xD;
      sessions as described above. For all participants, a battery of assessment (diagnostic,&#xD;
      developmental testing), will be administered at the beginning of the study participation, in&#xD;
      the mid-point at 3 months, at the end of their 6-month participation of treatment sessions,&#xD;
      and then at the follow-up period, 6 months after the end of their participation of the&#xD;
      treatment sessions.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Parent Strategies Rating</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, months 1-6, and follow-up (12 months)</time_frame>
    <description>This is a rating scale that is currently under development. It will be used to rate the parents' utilization of the strategies they are being taught throughout the intervention.Scores range from 19 to 100. Higher scores indicate effective and appropriate use of strategies taught in NDBI.</description>
