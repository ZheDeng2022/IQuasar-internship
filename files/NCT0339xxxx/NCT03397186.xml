      This research trial studies the immune changes following trabectedin in patients with sarcoma&#xD;
      that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery&#xD;
      (unresectable). Analyzing tumor tissue may help to understand the changes in immune cells in&#xD;
      or around the tumor or if there is an increase in immune cells in the tumor after receiving&#xD;
      trabectedin.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Percentage of tumor tissue in pre- and post-treatment biopsies comprised of T-cells, as&#xD;
      determined by flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore additional potential biomarkers including: numbers of tumor associated&#xD;
      macrophage (TAM) in tumor II. To explore additional potential biomarkers including: phenotype&#xD;
      (classically activated macrophages [M1] versus [vs] alternatively activated macrophages [M2])&#xD;
      as characterized by CD163, CD115, CD206 on infiltrating TAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore additional potential biomarkers including: phenotype of T cells infiltrating&#xD;
      tumor (CD4, CD8, markers of CD4 phenotype including FoxP3 and memory).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore additional potential biomarkers including: expression T cell inhibitory&#xD;
      markers (PD-1, CTLA-4, TIM3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To explore additional potential biomarkers including: recognition of autologous tumor by&#xD;
      expanded tumor infiltrating lymphocyte lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To explore additional potential biomarkers including: in tumor infiltrating lymphocyte&#xD;
      (TIL) expanded from myxoid/round cell liposarcomas, recognition of cancer testis antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo a biopsy at baseline and then receive trabectedin for up to 4 cycles.&#xD;
      Beginning 1 week after completion of cycle 2 and prior to cycle 3, patients undergo a second&#xD;
      biopsy. Patients who achieve clinical benefit (complete response [CR], partial response [PR],&#xD;
      stable disease [SD]) after the first post-treatment scan and who continue trabectedin for 4&#xD;
      cycles undergo a third biopsy after cycle 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;
