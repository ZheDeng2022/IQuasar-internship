    <textblock>
      Rationale: Radiation-induced cardiac and pulmonary toxicity after treatment for&#xD;
      intra-thoracic tumors is a clinically relevant problem, which may jeopardize the benefit of&#xD;
      (neo-adjuvant) (chemo) radiotherapy. Although cure rates are rising since the introduction of&#xD;
      neo-adjuvant chemoradiation (neo-CRT) as current standard treatment for esophageal cancer&#xD;
      (EC), recent studies showed that there is a substantial risk of non-cancer treatment-related&#xD;
      death in these patients. Furthermore, this risk is underestimated as the cause of death of&#xD;
      many patients remains unknown, since the distinction between tumor related and non-cancer&#xD;
      related death can be difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac and pulmonary toxicity and its interaction as seen in pre-clinical studies might&#xD;
      explain for these unknown deaths as suggested in several clinical studies. Clinical imaging&#xD;
      studies performed shortly after treatment showed changes in different cardiac function&#xD;
      parameters, all related to radiation dose parameters. Systematic imaging studies analysing&#xD;
      subclinical toxicities at longer follow up have never been performed, most probably because&#xD;
      of poor survival rates. However, identification of the magnitude of (subclinical)&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary toxicity, by performing several cardiopulmonary function tests, is essential&#xD;
      in this patient group as this toxicity is most likely the cause of the increased mortality&#xD;
      after thoracic radiotherapy. For future perspectives, these results can be used to select the&#xD;
      best diagnostic methods for a prospective cohort study to develop prediction tools for&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary toxicity..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The main objective of this study is to determine the most suitable diagnostic test&#xD;
      to identify cardiopulmonary (dys)function in EC survivors treated with neo-CRT followed by&#xD;
      surgical resection. Furthermore, we want to estimate the difference in cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      (dys)function in EC survivors treated with neo-CRT followed by surgical resection compared to&#xD;
      EC survivors who were treated with surgical resection alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Cross-sectional pilot study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 40 EC patients who were treated with curative intent by esophageal&#xD;
      resection with or without neo-CRT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable): Not applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: As this is an exploratory pilot study to determine the most&#xD;
      suitable diagnostic tests for future studies, there will be several endpoints related to&#xD;
      (sub)clinical cardiopulmonary dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signs of myocardial ischemia, systolic or diastolic dysfunction, rhythm and valve disorders,&#xD;
      pericardial effusion and fibrosis, myocardial fibrosis, focal wall motion disorders and&#xD;
      coronary calcifications will be analyzed. The cardiopulmonary (dys)function in EC survivors&#xD;
      treated with neo-CRT followed by surgical resection will be compared to cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      (dys)function in EC survivors treated with surgical resection alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Several tests will be performed at one time point, 5-10 years after given&#xD;
      treatment. If the findings of the test indicate cardiovascular complications, the patient&#xD;
      will be referred to the cardiologist for further analysis and/or preventive measures. As one&#xD;
      of the tests, cardiac MRI, including gadolinium (Dotarem 0.2 mmol/kg) enhancement will be&#xD;
      performed. Potential side effects of gadolinium include brief headache, nausea (feeling sick)&#xD;
      and dizziness for a brief time following the injection. Allergic reactions are rare.&#xD;
      Furthermore, a cardiac CT scan will be performed with a total radiation exposure of 0.6 mSv&#xD;
      (less than a third of the annual background radiation dose), the risks will be minimal.&#xD;

        Patients with EC treated with or without neo-CRT, alive without evidence of disease,&#xD;
        treated between 2000 and 2012 at the University Medical Centre Groningen will be eligible.&#xD;
        Twenty patients will be included in both treatment groups. Length of follow up after&#xD;
        treatment does not seem to be an important confounding factor as surgery is not considered&#xD;
        to be an important risk factor for late toxicity.&#xD;
