  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due to incurable and prevalence has increased steadily,&#xD;
      chronic respiratory disease is considered hazardous to health and quality of life of the&#xD;
      disease. GOLD treatment guidelines (global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease&#xD;
      guideline) pointed out the pulmonary rehabilitation is one of the non-drug treatment in&#xD;
      patients with severe COPD, shown to improve exercise capacity and reduce the short of&#xD;
      breathing, improve the quality of life and reduce the anxiety associated and depression and&#xD;
      improved survival advantages. Meanwhile, a few studies have examined effect the exercise&#xD;
      training in severe COPD patients' symptom distress and quality of life, so as to make severe&#xD;
      COPD patients to improve the effectiveness of the campaign to ongoing regular pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation movement, is considered an important issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been proposed that physical activity enhancement or exercise training can be effective&#xD;
      in improving symptoms and quality of life in these patients. However, it has not been&#xD;
      examined systematically. Therefore, the main purposes of this study are: 1.Prevalence of&#xD;
      symptom distress; 2.The physical preferences; 3.The relationship between quality of life and&#xD;
      physical activity; 4.Effects of Comprehensive Health coaching exercise training on improving&#xD;
      fatigue, sleep disturbances, quality of life, readmission, and survival. In the first year of&#xD;
      this study, a descriptive-correlational design will be used and in the second and third years&#xD;
      of study, the experimental design and prospective longitudinal study will be undertaken.&#xD;
      Instruments include motion sensors, physical activity scale, Physical Activity Preferences,&#xD;
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality of Life Index. Statistical analyses include descriptive statistics,&#xD;
      t-test, one-way ANOVA, latent growth modeling, Logistic models, GEE, and survival analysis.&#xD;
      Results from this study will provide important implications for improving symptom management&#xD;
      and quality of life for sever chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients.&#xD;
