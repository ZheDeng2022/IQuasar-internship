  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of cancer immunotherapy&#xD;
      ECI-006 and to determine its ability to induce a measurable immune response against the tumor&#xD;
      associated antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Cohort 1, ECI-006 will be administered 5 times by intranodal injection in melanoma&#xD;
      patients after resection of their tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Cohort 2, ECI-006 will be administered 9 times by intranodal injection on top of standard&#xD;
      of care anti PD1 in metastatic melanoma patients with stable disease after 3 to 12 months&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECI-006 activates key immunologically active cells to direct the immune system against the&#xD;
      cancer. Expected potential risks for ECI-006 are non-serious and related to the local&#xD;
      administration of the product. Hence, the therapy suggested here has the promise to offer&#xD;
      considerable benefit to patients without any major risk.&#xD;

             immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine or cyclosporine A (but not limited to&#xD;
             these) are excluded on the basis of potential immune suppression. Patients must have&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  At least 1 superficial cutaneous melanoma lesion ≥ 10 mm as measured by calipers&#xD;
                  and/or&#xD;

             the brain metastases are deemed stable and if the patient is eligible to receive&#xD;
             pembrolizumab as standard of care to treat his melanoma in the judgement of the&#xD;
             investigator. There must also be no requirement for immunosuppressive doses of&#xD;
             systemic corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents) for at least 8 weeks&#xD;
             prior to study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with primary uveal or mucosal melanoma.&#xD;
