      Rationale and Background: Since 2013, Butantan Institute has been performing passive&#xD;
      pharmacovigilance activities related to its triavalent, fragmented and inactivated vaccine&#xD;
      (IB TIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objetive: To conduct an active surveillance study focusing on the elderly and health care&#xD;
      professionals as part of Butantan pharmacovigilance plan, while passive surveillance&#xD;
      activities will continue. The pharmacovigilance plan, via active surveillance, is being&#xD;
      implemented in response to WHO requirements for pre-qualification of IB TIV.&#xD;
