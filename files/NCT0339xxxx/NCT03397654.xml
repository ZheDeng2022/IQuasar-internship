    <textblock>
      Open label, single arm, multi-centre study of pembrolizumab following trans-arterial&#xD;
      chemoembolization (TACE). Twenty-six to 32 evaluable participants with primary liver cancer&#xD;
      (hepatocellular cancer; HCC) will be assessed. The primary objective is to determine the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab following TACE. The secondary objective is to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab following TACE by improving progression-free survival&#xD;
      rates as measured by modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (mRECIST)&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Have an overall Child-Pugh score &lt;7&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Women of childbearing potential must be willing to use a highly effective method of&#xD;
             contraception as outlined in Section 6.9.2 for the course of the study through 120&#xD;
             days after the last dose of Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP). Note: Abstinence&#xD;
             is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the&#xD;
