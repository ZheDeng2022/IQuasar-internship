  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The background for performing the present study is to compare the mass calculations by CT&#xD;
      scanning and by invasive absolute blood flow measurements and thereby corroborating both&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although knowledge about the myocardial mass (in grams) of the different territories&#xD;
      belonging to the major coronary arteries, is of clinical importance to estimate risk of&#xD;
      coronary interventions (PCI, CABG) and to determine area of necrosis after myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, no invasive methodology has been available so far for reliable assessment of&#xD;
      mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Especially in the setting of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), it would be valuable&#xD;
      to have information about the absolute and relative myocardial mass distal to the location&#xD;
      where the intervention is planned. Such information is valuable for risk estimation and can&#xD;
      also be helpful in multivessel disease to determine the most adequate way of&#xD;
      revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both MRI and CT scanning have claimed to be able to estimate myocardial mass non-invasively,&#xD;
      but by the lack of any gold standard, none of these methods could be validated in vivo so&#xD;
      far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A relatively new development in CT technology is the calculation of fractional flow reserve&#xD;
      (FFR) by CT scanning, according to a sophisticated algorithm developed by Heartflow Inc. One&#xD;
      of the baseline assumptions in that algorithm is that myocardial mass is proportional to&#xD;
      resting blood flow, which seems a plausible assumption from a rational physiological point of&#xD;
      view.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, invasive calculation of absolute blood flow has become possible as well as&#xD;
      resistance measurement of the (microcirculation of the) myocardium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using that invasive technology (explained in the appendix to this protocol), it can be&#xD;
      assumed that measuring absolute maximum blood flow in a coronary artery as well as fractional&#xD;
      flow reserve for different territories or for different spots within one major coronary&#xD;
      artery, provides a basis for relative mass calculation. The background for performing the&#xD;
      present study is to compare these mass calculations by CT scanning and by invasive&#xD;
      measurements, thereby corroborating both methods.&#xD;

    <description>Absolute maximum flow will be measured, using the RayFlowÂ® multifunctional monorail infusion catheter. (This measurement takes a few minutes per artery, does not require any additional drug, but only 50-100 ml of saline per artery, and is not associated with any additional risk for the patient compared to the regular invasive procedure.</description>
