    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate a theoretically and empirically grounded implementation program&#xD;
      designed to foster shared decision-making in routine cancer care. The intervention program&#xD;
      consists of several components (e.g. training for health care professionals, patient&#xD;
      empowerment strategies) that will be rolled out in three clinics at a comprehensive cancer&#xD;
      center in Germany.&#xD;

    <description>Action to employ shared decision-making as measured by the German version of the Observer OPTION 5 scale using audio-recorded medical encounters. The Observer OPTION 5 scale measures the extent to which clinicians involve patients in decision-making. Each of the 5 items is assessed on a scale ranging from 0 to 4 with higher values indicating more involvement of patients in decision-making. A sum score is calculated (ranging from 0 to 20) and rescaled to be between 0 to 100, for ease of interpretation.</description>

    <description>The intervention is shared decision-making. The implementation strategy to foster shared decision-making in routine cancer care is a multicomponent implementation program. The implementation program consists of the following components:&#xD;
shared decision-making trainings for health care professionals,&#xD;
individual coaching for physicians,&#xD;
patient activation strategy,&#xD;
provision of patient information material and decision aids,&#xD;
revision of the clinics quality management documents, and&#xD;
critical reflection of current organization of multidisciplinary team meetings.&#xD;
Implementation: after baseline assessment (t0) for clinic 1, after assessment at t1 for clinic 2, after assessment at t2 for clinic 3.</description>
