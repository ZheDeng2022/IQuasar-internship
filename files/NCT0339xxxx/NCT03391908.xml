    <textblock>
      The aim of Multiplaque clinical study is to assess the vulnerability degree of the&#xD;
      atheromatous plaques, before and after a myocardial infarction (MI), based on multiomics&#xD;
      analysis, associated with invasive and non-invasive data. In this study, a multi-parametric&#xD;
      model for risk prediction will be developed, for evaluation of the risk that is associated&#xD;
      with the vulnerable coronary plaques in patients that have suffered an acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study, evaluation of the imaging characteristics of these coronary plaques will be&#xD;
      performed with the use of CT, OCT, IVUS and invasive angiography. We will study the&#xD;
      correlation between plaque evolution and (1) the degree of vulnerability at baseline, (2)&#xD;
      multiomics profile of the patients and (3) clinical evolution during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, new techniques for evaluation of the functional significance of coronary stenoses will&#xD;
      be studied and validated, such as calculation of the fractional flow reserve or determination&#xD;
      of shear stress in areas that are localized within the near vicinity of the vulnerable&#xD;
      coronary plaques.&#xD;

      This is a prospective cohort monocentric study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to research the vulnerability degree of ateromatous&#xD;
      plaques before and after a myocardial infarction, based on multiomics data, invasive and&#xD;
      non-invasive imaging data, in order to characterize the vulnerable coronary plaque and the&#xD;
      vulnerable patient, in patients who have suffered an acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina&#xD;
      or acute myocardial infarction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of factors associated with the risk for reinfarction in patients with&#xD;
           vulnerable plaques, according to their imaging characteristics of vulnerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of predictive factors for reinfarction in patients with vulnerable plaques,&#xD;
           according to the multiomics profile of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determination of the rate of adverse events and MACE rates (Major Adverse Cardiac&#xD;
           Events) according to the vulnerability degree of the coronary plaque at the index&#xD;
           moment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the efficiency of new methodologies for assessing vulnerable plaques:&#xD;
           coronary shear stress determination, trans-stenotic contrast gradient, quantification of&#xD;
           coronary plaque components through CT, OCT and IVUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the efficiency of non-invasive methodologies for assessment of the&#xD;
           hemodynamic significance of coronary stenoses.&#xD;
