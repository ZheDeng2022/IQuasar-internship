  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the functioning of particular types of&#xD;
      regions of the brain, specifically, those related to externalizing disorders such as&#xD;
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Oppositional Defiance Disorder (ODD), and&#xD;
      Conduct Disorder (CD). Brain function of children and adolescents with externalizing&#xD;
      disorders such as ADHD, ODD, and CD will be compared to the brain function of those without.&#xD;
      Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) will be used to monitor brain activity at work&#xD;
      and at resting states.&#xD;

      The goal of this research proposes to take a developmental neuroimaging approach to&#xD;
      elucidating brain mechanisms that lead to distinct forms of impulsivity in youth with&#xD;
      externalizing disorders, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),&#xD;
      oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and conduct disorder (CD). Roughly 12-15% of youth&#xD;
      suffer from at least one of these disorders (many of them have more than one) and they go on&#xD;
      to experience serious adverse outcomes over the course of their lifetimes including increased&#xD;
      rates of substance abuse, violence and criminality, maladjustment, and suicide. The absence&#xD;
      of a biological, and in particular a neurodevelopmental, understanding of the pathophysiology&#xD;
      of distinct kinds of impulsivity has been a major barrier to improving clinical care for&#xD;
      impulsive youth; it has hindered efforts at building better nosology, earlier and more&#xD;
      reliable diagnosis, and more effective treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) Initiative encourages clinical scientists to no&#xD;
      longer think in terms of single categorical diagnoses (whose boundaries may in fact be drawn&#xD;
      incorrectly), but rather to identify disorder-spanning constructs. Inspired by the RDoC&#xD;
      Initiative, our research aims to delineate the neural mechanisms of distinct forms of&#xD;
      impulsivity in youth from a transdiagnostic perspective that spans the three main&#xD;
      externalizing disorders, ADHD, CD, and ODD, as well as across subtypes of these disorders&#xD;
      (e.g., ADHD inattentive, hyperactive/impulsive, and combined types). More specifically, the&#xD;
      study aims to develop a new class of imaging-based biomarkers for specific forms of&#xD;
      impulsivity-markers that are rooted in aberrant brain maturation patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Developing neuroimaging markers of impulsivity could have a number of important clinical&#xD;
      impacts. For example, these markers could provide a basis for more objective diagnosis,&#xD;
      facilitate earlier diagnosis, catalyze the development of new treatments, and help to guide&#xD;
      the selection of treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, 270 youth subjects will be recruited, 135 with at least one externalizing&#xD;
      disorder and 135 matched controls, between the ages of 6-18 . All participants will receive&#xD;
      the following: 1) a comprehensive clinical/neurological assessment to quantify impulsivity&#xD;
      symptoms; and 2) an fMRI session (structural, diffusion tensor imaging, resting, and task).&#xD;
      Three cohorts are recruited: childhood (6-9 years; n=90), early adolescence (10-13 years;&#xD;
      n=90), and middle adolescence (14-18; n=90).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of the study is to use imaging results to generate normative maturational curves&#xD;
      for each component in the brain's regulatory control architecture using a multi-level linear&#xD;
      mixed effects model. Multivariate models that predict types of impulsivity based on component&#xD;
      expression will then be constructed.&#xD;
