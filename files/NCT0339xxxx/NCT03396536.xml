      The objective of this study is to evaluate patient discomfort while performing oral hygiene&#xD;
      (OH) around implants with and without keratinized mucosa (KM) and assess peri-implant soft&#xD;
      tissue esthetic satisfaction and other clinical parameters at the 3- and 6-month follow-up&#xD;
      visits. Group 1 will be implants with KM and Group 2 implants without KM. The hypotheses&#xD;
      underlying this proposal are (1) that dental implants surrounded by KM will have better&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes regarding discomfort during brushing compared with those that lack&#xD;
      KM; (2) that dental implants with KM will show more favorable clinical outcomes (plaque&#xD;
      index, bleeding on probing, pocket depth and peri-implant recession) compared with those&#xD;
      without KM and (3) that dental implants with KM will have higher patient peri-implant tissue&#xD;
      esthetic satisfaction compared with those without KM.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the oral cavity, the soft tissue of the alveolar ridge can be classified as keratinized&#xD;
      mucosa (KM) or alveolar mucosa (AM). Typically KM forms a cuff around an implant, while AM is&#xD;
      farther away and covers the alveolar ridge, as well the lips, the inside of the cheeks, the&#xD;
      floor of the mouth under the tongue. KM is pink in color and has a keratinized epithelium. AM&#xD;
      is red and has a non-keratinized epithelium. Due to anatomical or surgical reasons KM on the&#xD;
      buccal site might be missing. Therefore implants without KM have AM directly around their&#xD;
      collar. The two groups in the research will be defined according to the presence or absence&#xD;
      of KM. Group 1 will be implants with KM and Group 2 implants without KM. In Group 2 AM will&#xD;
      be directly present around the implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although specific situations recommend a minimal width of 2 mm of keratinized tissue around&#xD;
      teeth to prevent gingival inflammation, the influence of keratinized tissue on peri-implant&#xD;
      clinical and patient-reported outcomes still needs to be investigated. Many authors have&#xD;
      stated that that the presence of peri-implant keratinized mucosa is a prerequisite for the&#xD;
      maintenance of soft tissue health and have advocated for soft tissue augmentation procedures&#xD;
      around implants. Nevertheless, since other authors failed to demonstrate a significant&#xD;
      association between clinical inflammatory parameters and the quality of peri-implant mucosa,&#xD;
      soft tissue augmentation procedures are not recommended, unless the patient reports pain and&#xD;
      discomfort while brushing around an implant without KM or unless there are esthetic concerns.&#xD;
      Those recommendations are however not evidence-based. To the best of our knowledge no&#xD;
      prospective studies have been conducted to evaluate systematically discomfort during brushing&#xD;
      at implant sites and patient soft tissue esthetic assessment, with special emphasis on the&#xD;
      quality of peri-implant soft tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental implants can be placed according to a one-stage or a two-stage protocol. For two-stage&#xD;
      implant surgery, as is required for this study, there are the following steps (stages).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Implant placement surgery occurs. At this time, the implant is placed in the bone. A&#xD;
           cover screw is placed on top of the implant and then covered with mucosa (gums).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After a period of a few months to allow for healing, the mucosa (gums) on top of the&#xD;
           implant is opened making a small incision. The cover screw is removed. Then, an&#xD;
           additional implant piece called a healing abutment is placed that penetrates through the&#xD;
           gums. This healing abutment allows for soft tissues to heal around the implant abutment&#xD;
           before an impression is made for the manufacture of the implant crown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional steps are then required for placement of the implant crown (artificial tooth). For&#xD;
      this study, the baseline visit will be at the time of step 2. The implant will already have&#xD;
      been placed previously and the patient will be returning to the clinic for their scheduled&#xD;
      second stage surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discomfort while brushing at an implant site is a parameter that clinical trials should&#xD;
      include. In a recent study it was reported that 6 patients out of 16 reported discomfort&#xD;
      while brushing implants without KM, while no patients reported discomfort while brushing in&#xD;
      the group of implants with KM. Higher plaque accumulation was also found around implants&#xD;
      without KM. In this study, however, there were some limitations, such as a lack of&#xD;
      standardization in terms of OH instructions and absence of adequate description of the&#xD;
      outcome discomfort. Finally an esthetic evaluation of the implant-supported restoration was&#xD;
      not reported. Since patient esthetic evaluation on the appearance of the soft tissue is less&#xD;
      optimal than the overall esthetic evaluation and esthetic concerns might justify soft tissue&#xD;
      augmentation procedures around implants, further prospective studies should be focused on&#xD;
      patient soft tissue esthetic assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A survey was conducted to assess the validity and the reliability of a visual analogue scale&#xD;
      (VAS) for discomfort during brushing at implant site and VAS for esthetic satisfaction of the&#xD;
      soft tissue around implants (IRB #10863 Testing the validity and reliability of a survey to&#xD;
      record discomfort during brushing around dental implants and patient-assessed soft tissue&#xD;
      esthetic satisfaction at implant-supported restorations). The face and content validity of&#xD;
      the scales was assessed by showing them to 5 lay people and 5 postgraduate residents in the&#xD;
      Department of Periodontology at Tufts University School of Dental Medicine. The five lay&#xD;
      people were asked whether the questions on both surveys were phrased appropriately, and&#xD;
      whether the scales were clear. All subjects answered positively. The 5 postgraduate residents&#xD;
      reported that VAS was the appropriate method to measure the variable &quot;discomfort while&#xD;
      brushing around implants&quot; and to measure patient-assessed soft tissue esthetic satisfaction.&#xD;
      However, for both the 10 cm VAS scales, the majority of subjects (lay people and residents)&#xD;
      pointed out that there was a lack of directionality. Therefore it was decided to add numbers&#xD;
      to the scales. For discomfort during brushing the scale had on the left side displayed as 0&#xD;
      the absence of discomfort and on the right as 10 the maximum discomfort. For esthetic&#xD;
      satisfaction, the left side of the scale represented no satisfaction as 0, while 10 at the&#xD;
      right end of the scale represented extreme satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifteen (15) patients in the Department of Periodontology at Tufts University School of&#xD;
      Dental Medicine were recruited to assess the reliability of the VAS scales for discomfort&#xD;
      during brushing and for soft tissue esthetic satisfaction at implant sites. The following&#xD;
      question was asked: &quot;If the left side of the scale is the absence of discomfort and the right&#xD;
      side of the scale is extreme discomfort, how much discomfort do you have while brushing&#xD;
      around your implant?&quot;. The question for the second VAS was: &quot;If the left side of the scale is&#xD;
      no satisfaction and the right side of the scale is extreme satisfaction, how satisfied are&#xD;
      you with the appearance of the gums around your implant?&quot;. The patient marked a line with a&#xD;
      fine point marker or pen at the level of one of the numbers below the scales. The reliability&#xD;
      of the instruments was tested using the test-retest method, administrating the survey&#xD;
      instruments to the same subjects at a time difference of 30 minutes. Fourteen and 12 subjects&#xD;
      had the same results on both the first and second survey for discomfort during brushing and&#xD;
      soft tissue esthetic satisfaction. Therefore the 2 scales were considered a reliable method&#xD;
      to record the outcome of interests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to define, for the first time, whether the presence of KM&#xD;
      around dental implants is required from both patients' and clinicians' perspectives, a&#xD;
      concept with important clinical implications that has been the source of controversy in the&#xD;
      field. The need to include patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in implant dentistry has been&#xD;
      emphasized in many recently published reviews. Because patients ultimately seek professional&#xD;
      care to improve their own quality of life, optimal care is achieved not only if some specific&#xD;
      clinical standards are met, but also if patient expectations are satisfied and their quality&#xD;
      of life is improved. Indeed, in an evidence-based approach, it is important to address these&#xD;
      aspects of treatment as well. The impact of this study will be high, since its successful&#xD;
      execution will provide a rationale for using soft tissue augmentation procedures in implant&#xD;
      therapy, based on PROs and other clinical assessed outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>KM will be evaluated. The alveolar mucosa will be stained with Lugol's solution, by means of a cotton swab. A cotton roll will be soaked in the solution and gently applied on the mucosa around the implant. Since Lugol's solution is selective to the glycogen present in AM, the muco-gingival junction as the borderline between the blue-stained alveolar mucosa and KM can be easily identified.&#xD;
A manual periodontal probe with 1 mm markings will measure the distance from the peri-implant margin and the muco-gingival junction.&#xD;
Mucosal thickness (MT) will be measured after topical application of the anesthetics. MT will be evaluated inserting a 27G needle with a rubber stop 1 mm below the peri-implant mucosal margin at the mid-buccal aspect, until the abutment is engaged. The needle will be removed and the distance between the rubber stop and the point of the needle will be measured with a manual periodontal probe.</description>

        A sample size calculation was conducted using nQuery Advisor (Version 7.0). Assuming that&#xD;
        37.5% in the non-KM group (Group 2) have high discomfort and 2% in the KM Group (Group 1)&#xD;
        have high discomfort, a Type I error rate of 5%/2 = 2.5% per test and a power of 80% are&#xD;
        obtained as long as there are n=23 subjects with a KM implant and n=23 subjects with a&#xD;
        non-KM implant. To account for possible dropout, up to n=28 subjects with each type of&#xD;
        peri-implant mucosa group (for a total of up to 56 subjects) will be included in the study.&#xD;
        Up to 80 subjects will be enrolled in order to have 56 complete the study.&#xD;
