      The purpose of this study is to detail the precise temporal changes in the APR that occur in&#xD;
      response to exercise in order to determine the types of exercise that confer maximal&#xD;
      reparative fibrinolysis. Published research and preliminary studies conducted in our lab&#xD;
      suggest that different types of exercise will preferentially activate fibrinolysis over&#xD;
      coagulation, thereby promoting improved global tissue health [8]. As such, measuring markers&#xD;
      of the APR in healthy individuals 1) at rest, 2) walking (light intensity exercise), 3)&#xD;
      running (moderate intensity exercise), and 4) following endurance running (a marathon) will&#xD;
      allow us to establish a baseline for the temporal changes in the APR that avoid activation of&#xD;
      the procoagulant survival phase while maximizing the repair phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To measure the acute phase response fibrinolysis, plasminogen consumption, and&#xD;
           inflammatory profiles of healthy individuals before and after graded exercise (at rest,&#xD;
           light intensity, medium intensity) and after prolonged exercise at medium intensity as&#xD;
           defined by changes in fibrinolysis, plasminogen consumption, and inflammatory response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To track the APR through modulated exercise in order to determine the type of exercise&#xD;
           that enhances physiologic benefit and limits harm.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Injury, ranging from a paper cut that barely splits the skin to a high-speed motor vehicle&#xD;
      accident that rips through muscle and bone, causes a disruption of tissue compartments. This&#xD;
      breach of compartments disposes tissue to four principle problems: 1) bleeding, 2)&#xD;
      susceptibility to infection, 3) hypoxia, and 4) tissue dysfunction. The acute phase response&#xD;
      (APR) is the physiologic system that resolves these four problems of injury. It is divided&#xD;
      into two temporally distinct phases: survival and repair. The survival phase utilizes&#xD;
      coagulation and inflammation to temporarily seal off breached compartments in order to stop&#xD;
      bleeding and prevent the spread of infection. Once the life-threatening problems of&#xD;
      hemorrhage and susceptibility to infection have been resolved, the body enters the repair&#xD;
      phase, where it works to restore the disrupted blood supply and regenerate damaged tissue.&#xD;
      These processes, coupled together, replace the temporary sealant and restore the injured&#xD;
      tissue to its original form and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasmin is the key fibrinolytic protease that transitions the APR from survival to repair.&#xD;
      Plasmin is traditionally known for its ability to degrade fibrin clots. Previous work has&#xD;
      demonstrated that plasmin also activates many targets outside of fibrin degradation that are&#xD;
      essential for musculoskeletal tissue healing. Plasmin initiates the repair of injured tissue&#xD;
      by removing the temporary fibrin sealant required for hemostasis, which allows access for&#xD;
      repair machinery to enter the site of injury. Subsequently, plasmin activates proteases that&#xD;
      promote angiogenesis and cell differentiation to stimulate tissue regeneration. Without&#xD;
      adequate plasmin activity, the body fails to transition from survival to repair and is unable&#xD;
      to reconstitute the compartments damaged by injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All tissue injury activates the acute phase response. Exercise is a form of contained tissue&#xD;
      injury that harnesses the beneficial effects of the acute phase response to build muscle and&#xD;
      promote overall health. Given that the controlled injury of exercise minimizes compartment&#xD;
      disruption, there is a limited need to mount a response to hemorrhage or containment of&#xD;
      infection (survival). Exercise increases the metabolic requirement of muscle to the point&#xD;
      that it outstrips the supply of oxygenated blood and results in sustained hypoxia. In&#xD;
      response to hypoxia, plasmin stimulates angiogenesis and activates cells involved in tissue&#xD;
      regeneration (repair). In exercise physiology, if major injury is avoided, the body thereby&#xD;
      bypasses the survival phase and transitions into an early and prolonged repair phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite studies demonstrating alterations in the APR with exercise, the relationship between&#xD;
      the intensity of exercise and the extent of APR activation is not yet well defined [8-10].&#xD;
      Our aim is to gain a better understanding of the precise changes in the APR in order to&#xD;
      maximize the reparative potential of exercise. We hypothesize that moderate intensity&#xD;
      exercise selectively enhances plasmin-mediated fibrinolysis (repair) without inducing the&#xD;
      procoagulant arm of the APR (survival). Additionally, we propose that the systemic activation&#xD;
      of fibrinolysis achieved in exercise promotes global tissue health at spatially distinct&#xD;
      locations in addition to the site of initial tissue injury (hypoxic muscle). To evaluate&#xD;
      this, we will define the precise temporal changes in the APR in healthy individuals&#xD;
      participating in graded intensities of exercise (rest, light, and moderate). Through&#xD;
      elucidation of the precise temporal activation of the APR as it relates to the intensity of&#xD;
      exercise, it may allow future studies to develop an exercise regimen that harnesses the&#xD;
      reparative potential of fibrinolysis while avoiding the potentially harmful activation of the&#xD;
      procoagulant survival phase of the APR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to detail the precise temporal changes in the APR that occur in&#xD;
      response to exercise in order to determine the types of exercise that confer maximal&#xD;
      reparative fibrinolysis. Published research and preliminary studies conducted in our lab&#xD;
      suggest that different types of exercise will preferentially activate fibrinolysis over&#xD;
      coagulation, thereby promoting improved global tissue health [8]. As such, measuring markers&#xD;
      of the APR in healthy individuals 1) at rest, 2) walking (light intensity exercise), 3)&#xD;
      running (moderate intensity exercise), and 4) following endurance running (a marathon) will&#xD;
      allow us to establish a baseline for the temporal changes in the APR that avoid activation of&#xD;
      the procoagulant survival phase while maximizing the repair phase.&#xD;

           defined by changes in fibrinolysis, plasminogen consumption, and inflammatory response.&#xD;
