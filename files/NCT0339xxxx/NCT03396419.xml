  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the ImpACT-24col sub-study is to explore effect of SPG stimulation on the&#xD;
      augmentation of collateral blood flow and to relate it to the subject's cerebral blood flow&#xD;
      status, the extent of the collateral vessel potency prior to the stimulation and the relation&#xD;
      of the vessel occlusion site to the vasodilatory effect by using digital subtraction&#xD;
      angiography (DSA), the gold standard imaging technique to demonstrate collateral blood flow&#xD;
      dynamics. The results of this study will further promote the knowledge towards optimization&#xD;
      of SPG stimulation to treat acute ischemic stroke patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a leading cause of disability, death and health care expenditure. It is the second&#xD;
      most common cause of death worldwide, exceeded only by heart disease. Ischemic stroke&#xD;
      constitutes 83 to 90% of stroke cases in western countries. Occlusion of the Middle Cerebral&#xD;
      Artery (MCA) in the anterior circulation, or its branches is the most common site, accounting&#xD;
      for approximately 90% of infarcts and two thirds of all first strokes. Available therapies&#xD;
      include intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IV rt-PA) and mechanical&#xD;
      recanalization using thrombectomy (MT) devices. Both treatment approaches are primarily&#xD;
      focused on recanalization, i.e. aiming to restore artery potency and brain perfusion to&#xD;
      reduce the volume of cerebral infarction which thereby reduces functional deficits. Recent&#xD;
      meta-analysis of the results demonstrated that although MT is an effective therapy, still&#xD;
      over 50% of the treated patient do not recover. IV rt-PA treatment suffers from similar, more&#xD;
      significant, lack of effect in majority of patients. This lack of treatment success is&#xD;
      probably a result of inadequate micro circulatory collateral blood flow in the involved brain&#xD;
      tissue. Treatment targeting collateral cerebral blood flow augmentation is a promising&#xD;
      therapy, either as a stand-alone treatment, or as a complementary treatment post&#xD;
      recanalization. BrainsGate's device, the ISS, augments brain perfusion through the collateral&#xD;
      circulation. The augmentation of collateral blood flow is a result of stimulation of the&#xD;
      Spheno-Palatine Ganglion (SPG). The SPG is the source of parasympathetic innervations to the&#xD;
      anterior cerebral circulation, which comprises the middle cerebral artery, the anterior&#xD;
      cerebral artery, and their tributaries. Studies in rodents, dogs and monkeys have&#xD;
      demonstrated that stimulation of SPG neurons leads to a profound ipsilateral increase in the&#xD;
      CBF because of arterial vasodilatation, and that this leads in turn to augmentation of tissue&#xD;
      perfusion (see Figure 1). Moreover, previous studies, including histopathologic studies in&#xD;
      humans have revealed that the main neurotransmitters of this neuronal pathway are&#xD;
      acetylcholine (ACh), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and nitric oxide (NO). It is&#xD;
      interesting to note that NO is best known for its potent vasodilatory activity and its&#xD;
      capacity for neuroprotection and neurogenesis. Several studies have demonstrated that the&#xD;
      cerebral vasodilatation induced by SPG stimulation is indeed mediated through NO mechanisms&#xD;
      and that ablation of the SPG efferents to the cerebral vasculature leads to an increased&#xD;
      infract size in MCA-occluded rats. So far, imaging studies aiming to demonstrate collateral&#xD;
      blood flow augmentation due to SPG stimulation were not yet performed in human stroke&#xD;
      patients. It is highly important to study the effect of SPG stimulation on the augmentation&#xD;
      of collateral blood flow and to relate it to the subject's cerebral blood flow status, the&#xD;
      extent of the collateral vessel potency prior to the stimulation and the relation of the&#xD;
      vessel occlusion site to the vasodilatory effect. The purpose of the ImpACT-24col sub-study&#xD;
      is to explore these important questions by using digital subtraction angiography (DSA), the&#xD;
      gold standard imaging technique to demonstrate collateral blood flow dynamics. The results of&#xD;
      this study will further promote the knowledge towards optimization of SPG stimulation to&#xD;
      treat acute ischemic stroke patients. The ImpACT-24col study will be a sub-study of the&#xD;
      ImpACT-24B trial and eligible patients will be enrolled to both trials.&#xD;

    <description>Following implantation (according to the ImpACT-24B protocol), subjects will be transferred to the angio suite. A baseline brain digital subtraction angiography (DSA) will then be performed by a trained physician prior to initiation of SPG stimulation according to the ImpACT-24B protocol.&#xD;
Following the first SPG stimulation cycle of 4 minutes, a post-stimulation DSA will be performed.&#xD;
Based on the results of the post-stimulation DSA, the physician may perform an additional DSA following the second SPG stimulation cycle.&#xD;
The subject will then be transferred to the stroke department and will continue treatment according the ImpACT-24B protocol.</description>
