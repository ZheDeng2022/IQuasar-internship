      Access to effective treatment resources is a ubiquitous problem in behavioral health. There&#xD;
      is a need for effective interventions that are more easily accessed at a lower cost. This&#xD;
      study will compare outcomes for two models of treatment: 1) The experimental group, Therapy&#xD;
      Assistance Online (TAO), and 2) the comparison group, treatment as usual.&#xD;

      Access to effective treatment resources is a ubiquitous problem in behavioral health. There&#xD;
      is a need for effective interventions that are more easily accessed at a lower cost. This&#xD;
      stud will compare outcomes for two models of treatment: 1) The experimental group, Therapy&#xD;
      Assistance Online (TAO), and 2) the comparison group, treatment as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAO group TAO is a suite of tools for providing patient education, support, and&#xD;
      accountability delivered digitally. Educational materials are organized in an evidence&#xD;
      based-protocolled treatment for anxiety or depression. TAO participants will attend a once&#xD;
      weekly group in a computer lab. Each participant will complete an interactive educational&#xD;
      module and have a brief session with the group leader to discuss application of the content.&#xD;
      Participants will have access to a companion app they may use between sessions to practice&#xD;
      skills and reinforce learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment as Usual Group - After the completion of a psychosocial assessment, and development&#xD;
      of a treatment plan, clients are offered individual and group therapy sessions, case&#xD;
      management services, and medication management services depending on the diagnoses.&#xD;
      Individual and group therapy is often generic in nature as well, although some structured,&#xD;
      evidence-based treatments are offered such as Psycho-Education Multi-Family Group and Illness&#xD;
      Management Recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will receive an initial evaluation and screening to determine&#xD;
      diagnosis, appropriateness for the study, and level of care required. Informed consent will&#xD;
      include a statement indicating that agreement to participate will not affect access to&#xD;
      treatment. Those who do not wish to participate will receive care as usual. Patients who&#xD;
      agree to participate will be randomly assigned to either treatment as usual or treatment&#xD;
      augmented with TAO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Referral and Randomization Process -&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Therapist identifies a client who meets the inclusionary criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinician explains the availability of the TAO support services and the current study&#xD;
           and invites the client to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If the client agrees to participate, the clinician will explain the study and have the&#xD;
           client sign the consent to participate form and call customer care to determine if the&#xD;
           client will be in the experimental group (A) or control group (B).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. If client is assigned to the experimental group, the clinician will help the client&#xD;
           select a time to participate in the TAO support services each week. The clinician will&#xD;
           again explain the benefits of participation, seek a commitment to attend, and help&#xD;
           resolve any ambivalence of the client to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. If client is assigned to treatment as usual, the clinician will help the client select a&#xD;
           time to participate in group session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The referring clinician will then email the group therapist to inform him/her of the&#xD;
           referral.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introducing the TAO Support Services to Potential Clients -&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ask permission to share information about the TAO Support Services&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Explain that the TAO system provides mental health services through an electronic system&#xD;
           completed on a computer. Clients watch videos and complete modules on a computer for&#xD;
           approximately 45 minutes to an hour, one time each week for 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Explain that participation in these support services has been shown in other studies to&#xD;
           reduce symptoms, and that a current study is underway to determine if this will prove&#xD;
           helpful to clients at WHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Invite the client to participate in the study letting him/her know that agreeing to&#xD;
           participate in the study does not guarantee access to the TAO system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. If client agrees -&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Have client sign the consent to participate form.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Contact customer care to find out if the client is assigned to the TAO system or&#xD;
                the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. If assigned to the TAO system, help the client know when and where to meet for the TAO&#xD;
           session. Contact the group leader with client information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both the experimental group (TAO) and the control group treatment as usual&#xD;
      (TAU) will complete the OQ-45 at intake, and in each subsequent session. TAO participants&#xD;
      will also complete the Behavioral Health Measure-20 just prior to each group session on the&#xD;
      computer in the computer lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both the experimental group (TAO) and the control group (TAU) will complete&#xD;
      the OQ-45 at intake and at each group session. WE Well-being scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sessions completed. Demographics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be clients seeking treatment for anxiety and depression at Weber Human&#xD;
      Services. All participants will be adults (18 and over) who meet inclusion criteria. Clients&#xD;
      who agree to participant will be randomly assigned to a treatment condition. We will enroll&#xD;
      fifty clients per treatment condition and enrollment will be ongoing until the number is&#xD;
      reached. Active treatment will be 8 weeks, with follow-up at 3 months. Participants will not&#xD;
      receive renumeration for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers at (TAO Connect, Inc.) TCI will have no direct contact with the subjects. All&#xD;
      data collection will occur through the computer system. TCI technical support staff will have&#xD;
      minimal PHI: name, login, email address if the client requires any technical support.&#xD;
