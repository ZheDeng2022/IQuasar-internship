  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, uncontrolled, Phase 4 study including 10 patients who present in&#xD;
      hospital/urgent care setting with acquired methemoglobinemia. The population may include&#xD;
      pediatric and adult patients (males and females of all ages are included).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will run in both the EU and the US. The aim of the study is to confirm safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of ProvayBlueTM for the treatment of acquired methemoglobinemia and has been&#xD;
      requested by the US-FDA as a Post-Marketing requirements.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Acquired methemoglobinemia is defined as a level of methemoglobinemia &gt;30% or ≤30% in case&#xD;

             hemolytic anemia as well as lack of therapeutic effect;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known deficiency in Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate Hydrogen (NADPH)&#xD;
