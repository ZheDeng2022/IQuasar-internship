  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common nerve compression disorder in the upper&#xD;
      extremity. It can be treated with surgical or nonsurgical methods. When nonsurgical treatment&#xD;
      is indicated, local corticosteroid injection into the carpal tunnel can be used to reduce&#xD;
      pain and tingling sensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the most widely used ultrasound (US)-guided CTS-injection method are transverse&#xD;
      and longitudinal approach. Although we can accurately place needle within the carpal tunnel&#xD;
      using this approach and this approach is easy to learn, median nerve injury (MNI) is still an&#xD;
      inevitable complication and difficult to be treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MNI is the most serious complication associated with a local corticosteroid injection for CTS&#xD;
      among them. A MNI will be presented with shooting pain at the injection time or transient&#xD;
      exacerbation of CTS symptoms following the corticosteroid injection because of the pain which&#xD;
      often masked by anesthetic during injection. Permanent damage of MN should be considered if&#xD;
      the symptoms persist and exacerbate for more than 48 hours. A surgical intervention such as&#xD;
      neurolysis, resection or graft repair or a gentle debridement of the crystal from the nerve&#xD;
      may be performed in the patients with median nerve damage. Hence, early recognition of MNI&#xD;
      before corticosteroid injection may avoid the permanent damage of MN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, the aim of this study is to determine the relationship between the MNI with the&#xD;
      possible influencing factors and findings in the US-guided corticosteroid injection for&#xD;
      patients with CTS with and to compare the therapeutic efficacy in the patients with and&#xD;
      without MNI.&#xD;

      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was approved by our institutional review board (Tri-Service General Hospital);&#xD;
      however, patient consent was not required for the retrospective review of records and images&#xD;
      because patient anonymity was preserved. The patients with clinically suspected CTS evaluated&#xD;
      by the referring neurologist (F. C. Y.), and the clinical tests included (1) typical&#xD;
      symptoms, eg, hand numbness and pain in the distribution of the median nerve, nocturnal&#xD;
      worsening of symptoms, worsening symptoms while driving or gripping, (2) positive Tinel's&#xD;
      and/or Phalen's sign, (3) failure of splinting and/or hand rest. Patients with clinically&#xD;
      suspected CTS underwent US examination. The diagnoses of CTS in these patients were confirmed&#xD;
      by US and/or electrodiagnostic investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasonography:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The US was provided using a scanner (Xario 100; Toshiba, Tokyo, Japan) with a 7~18 MHz linear&#xD;
      transducer (PLU-1204BT). The US examinations were performed by an experienced technician&#xD;
      (C.Y. H.) with 6 years of musculoskeletal experience in US. The technician received&#xD;
      specialized training on the procedure used to scan the MN regarding the CTS and to record the&#xD;
      images and was directly supervised by the attending radiologist (Y.C.H.). The US images after&#xD;
      the US-guided hydrodissection were recorded by the attending radiologist (Y.C.H.). The&#xD;
      diagnosis of CTS was based on qualitative US criteria, with a cutoff value of ≥12 mm2&#xD;
      regarding the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the MN (CSA-MN) at the inlet of the carpal&#xD;
      tunnel. The diagnoses of CTS were confirmed by electrodiagnostic investigations in the&#xD;
      patients with US findings of the CSA-MN &lt; 12 mm2 at the inlet of the carpal tunnel. The&#xD;
      flowchart illustrating patient selection is shown in Fig. 1. All US images and the&#xD;
      measurements of cross sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve at the inlet of carpal tunnel&#xD;
      were saved in the picture archiving and communication system (PACS). All the patients with&#xD;
      clinically suspected CTS during the study period were examined using a standardized US&#xD;
      protocol previously described to assess the MN at the wrist level (Figure. 1). Within 1 month&#xD;
      after US-guided corticosteroid injection, we assessed the MN again with this manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound needle guidance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The US-guided injection procedure was performed in a standardized manner. The one-needle&#xD;
      two-syringe technique with US guidance was used where (1) one needle is used for anesthesia,&#xD;
      hydrodissection, and intra-carpal tunnel injection; (2) the first syringe is used to&#xD;
      anesthetize, hydrodissect, and dilate the intra-carpal tunnel space; and (3) the second&#xD;
      syringe is used to inject the corticosteroid therapy into the new hydrodissected space&#xD;
      (Figure 2). After hydrodissection, the empty lidocaine syringe was detached from the needle&#xD;
      while still in the carpal tunnel, and a 3-ml syringe prefilled with 10 mg triamcinolone&#xD;
      acetonide suspension was attached to the indwelling needle, and the treatment was slowly&#xD;
      injected into the hydrodissected neutral space that was closest to the MN. The injections&#xD;
      were performed in a standardized fashion by a musculoskeletal radiologist (Y.C.H.) with 13&#xD;
      years of experience in US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smith et al have recommended the needle should be passed above and below the median nerve to&#xD;
      fill the injectate around the median nerve with an ulnar approach. Although we can accurately&#xD;
      place needle within the carpal tunnel using this ulnar approach and this approach is easy to&#xD;
      learn, neurovascular injury may happened in the conditions of well-described anatomic&#xD;
      variation (eg, persistent median artery, bifida of MN), and unable supination of wrists. In&#xD;
      these patients with difficulty in performing hydrodissection, The investigators may abandon&#xD;
      needle redirection deep to the median nerve or chose the radial approach when clearly&#xD;
      identifying the fascial passage of the palmar cutaneous branch (PCB) of the MN (Figure 3).&#xD;
      The only mater in the radial approach the investigators need attention is the avoidance of&#xD;
      damage of the PCB of the MN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection The patients' medical records were reviewed by a neurologist (F.C.Y.).&#xD;
      Routinely, the investigators recorded clinical data (including sex, age, and side of&#xD;
      injection, height and weight [which were used to estimate BMI]), complications, and the&#xD;
      effect of treatment. Blood in the needle after US-guided hydrodissection was recorded as&#xD;
      vascular injury in the US-guided corticosteroid injection. The US images were analyzed by two&#xD;
      musculoskeletal radiologists (Y.C.H.) and (G.S.H.) who were blinded to the occurrence of MNI.&#xD;
      The investigators determined the absence of hyperechoic rim of MN on pre-injection US, the&#xD;
      inter-scan change of nerve echogenicity of MN at the inlet of carpal tunnel in consensus. The&#xD;
      investigators determined the swelling of MN including the flattening ratio (largest&#xD;
      diameter/smallest diameter) and cross-sectional area at the inlet of carpal tunnel at the&#xD;
      time of before and after the hydrodissection on the procedure US. The rater (Y.C.H.)&#xD;
      performed duplicate measurements, with the second measurement obtained 2 weeks after the&#xD;
      first. All measurements were performed with the aid of a PACS, a mouse pointer (cursor), and&#xD;
      automated computer calculation. The mean of two measurements was considered to be the final&#xD;
      value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that multiple pre-injection factors, including sex, age, side&#xD;
      of injection, patient BMI, diabetes mellitus, anatomic variation of MN (eg, persistent median&#xD;
      artery, bifida of MN), site of needle passed into the skin; and findings after&#xD;
      hydrodissection such as vascular injury and the US findings of MN after hydrodissection may&#xD;
      have relevance to MNI (Figure 4). To evaluate the relevance of these pre-injection factors to&#xD;
      MNI, we decided to convert these continuous variables into dichotomous variables. Subjects&#xD;
      were divided into old and young groups on the basis of a cutoff age of 40 years, thin and&#xD;
      obese groups on the basis of a cutoff BMI of 30, ulnar and radial approaches groups on the&#xD;
      basis of site of needle passed into the skin, hydrodissection in the superficial and deep to&#xD;
      the median nerve groups on the basis of needle redirection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ) is the most commonly used questionnaire&#xD;
      for the measurement of the severity of symptoms and functional status with reproducibility,&#xD;
      internal consistency, and validity in patients with CTS. The symptom severity subscale of&#xD;
      BCTQ (BCTQs) consists of 11 questions with scores from 1 point (mildest) to 5 points (most&#xD;
      severe), and the functional status of BCTQ (BCTQf) subscale is made up of 8 questions with&#xD;
      scores from 1 point (no difficulty in activity) to 5 points (unable to perform the activity&#xD;
      at all). Patients were seen in the subsequent clinical visit to determine outcomes. The&#xD;
      investigators also recorded the decrease of BCTQ between the before and after US-guided&#xD;
      corticosteroid injection as decrement of BCTQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis All the measurements regarding the change of MN were presented as mean ±&#xD;
      standard deviation. Intra-rater agreement was evaluated using the intra-class correlation&#xD;
      coefficient (ICC). Fisher's exact test was used to determine the association between MNI to&#xD;
      these independent factors before injection and findings after hydrodissection. Receiver&#xD;
      operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to determine the &quot;cut-off point&quot; for&#xD;
      predicting the presence of MNI. The patients with and without the diagnosis of MNI were&#xD;
      defined as 2 groups. The therapeutic efficacy of these 2 groups were compared by using a&#xD;
      Student t test (for BCTQ before corticosteroid injection, BCTQ after corticosteroid&#xD;
      injection, and decrement of BCTQ), as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the statistical tests were performed with the SPSS software (v. 16; SPSS, Inc. Chicago,&#xD;
      IL, USA). Significance testing was conducted using a two-tailed alternative hypothesis.&#xD;
      Differences were considered statistically significant for a p value of &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
