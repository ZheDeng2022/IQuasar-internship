  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a 40-week, blinded, placebo-controlled extension of Study TRCA-301&#xD;
      (NCT03317444). Eligible subjects who complete the 12-week treatment period in Study TRCA-301&#xD;
      have the option to participate in this extension study evaluating the long-term safety and&#xD;
      durability of effect of TRC101 in subjects with non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease&#xD;
      and metabolic acidosis. Eligible subjects will be treated with TRC101 or placebo once daily&#xD;
      (QD) on an out-patient basis for the subsequent 40 weeks. Subjects will continue to receive&#xD;
      the same blinded treatment (TRC101 or placebo) that they received in Study TRCA-301.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline in the parent study, TRCA-301, to the Week 52 Visit in the extension study, TRCA-301E.</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in the total score of the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Physical Function Domain (KDQOL-PFD) at the end of treatment. The KDQOL is a validated, kidney disease-specific measure of health-related quality of life. For study TRCA-301E, and the parent study TRCA-301, the 10-question Item 3 of the KDQOL, also known as the SF-36 Physical Function subscale, was selected to measure physical functioning and is referenced herein as the KDQOL-PFD. The KDQOL-PFD was chosen as a patient-reported outcome measurement to evaluate the effects of TRC101 on daily activities that may be adversely affected by loss of muscle caused by metabolic acidosis. The minimum score for each of the 10 questions is 0 (physical activity highly limited) and the maximum is 100 (physical activity not limited). The total KDQOL-PFD score is calculated by adding the scores for all 10 questions, for a minimum and maximum possible total KDQOL-PFD score of 0 or 100, respectively.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Duration of Repeated Chair Stand Test at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline in the parent study, TRCA-301, to the Week 52 Visit in the extension study, TRCA-301E.</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in the duration of repeated chair stand test at the end of treatment (Week 52). The five-times repeated chair stand test was used as a measure of lower extremity muscle strength. In this test, the time it took for a subject to repeatedly stand from a chair five times was recorded. This test is among the group of measures (gait speed, chair stand, and balance tests) comprising the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), which has been used as a predictive tool for possible disability and for monitoring physical functioning in older people.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Total Score of the KDQOL-PFD at the End of Treatment</title>
        <description>Change from baseline in the total score of the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Physical Function Domain (KDQOL-PFD) at the end of treatment. The KDQOL is a validated, kidney disease-specific measure of health-related quality of life. For study TRCA-301E, and the parent study TRCA-301, the 10-question Item 3 of the KDQOL, also known as the SF-36 Physical Function subscale, was selected to measure physical functioning and is referenced herein as the KDQOL-PFD. The KDQOL-PFD was chosen as a patient-reported outcome measurement to evaluate the effects of TRC101 on daily activities that may be adversely affected by loss of muscle caused by metabolic acidosis. The minimum score for each of the 10 questions is 0 (physical activity highly limited) and the maximum is 100 (physical activity not limited). The total KDQOL-PFD score is calculated by adding the scores for all 10 questions, for a minimum and maximum possible total KDQOL-PFD score of 0 or 100, respectively.</description>

In this test, the time it took for a subject to repeatedly stand from a chair five times was recorded. This test is among the group of measures (gait speed, chair stand, and balance tests) comprising the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), which has been used as a predictive tool for possible disability and for monitoring physical functioning in older people.</description>
