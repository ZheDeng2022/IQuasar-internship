      This study evaluate the safety and tolerance of MASCT-I(multiple-antigen specific cell&#xD;
      therapy) combined with PD1 antibody in patients with advanced gastric cancer who failed in&#xD;
      first-line chemotherapy. The study is divided into three stages: the first, second stage is&#xD;
      the stage of the dose climbing, and the third stage is the dose expansion stage. The patients&#xD;
      would be treated with MASCT-I single drug therapy, MASCT-I+ low dose PD1 antibody therapy,&#xD;
      and MASCT-I+ high dose PD1 antibody therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The multiple-antigen specific cell therapy which was developed by Hengrui Yuanzheng is&#xD;
      optimized continuously and has been upgraded from the first-generation MASCT technology to&#xD;
      MASCT-I. MASCT-I is to add PD1 antibody in vitro cell culture process of MASCT technology to&#xD;
      block PD1 receptor on immunocytes, relieving the brake at immunocytes' reinfusion and&#xD;
      interaction with tumor cells for enhancing the effectiveness of immunocytes killing tumor&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase I study to evaluate the safety and tolerance of MASCT-I combined with PD1&#xD;
      antibody in patients with advanced gastric cancer who failed in first-line chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 19-28 cases patients with advanced gastric cancer are to be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is divided into three stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first, second stage is the stage of the dose climbing, and the third stage is the dose&#xD;
      expansion stage. The first stage is MASCT-I, using 3+3 design, if the DLT≥33.3% from the&#xD;
      mononuclear cell collection to 14 days after the first MASCT-I infusion of T cells,the&#xD;
      experiment will be end. If the DLT&lt;33.3%, enter the second stage. The second stage is divided&#xD;
      into two groups: MASCT-I+PD1 antibody in low dose group and MASCT-I+PD1 antibody in high dose&#xD;
      group, using 3+3 design, if all patients in low dose group, the DLT≥33.3% from the&#xD;
      mononuclear cell collection to 14 days after the first MASCT-I infusion of T cells, the&#xD;
      experiment will be end. If DLT&lt;33.3% began high dose group. If all the patients in the high&#xD;
      dose group, DLT ≥33.3%, the corresponding high dose group treatment will be terminated,&#xD;
      entered the third stage, the dose of expansion, only by low dose treatment group of 10&#xD;
      patients of reentry. If all the patients in the high dose group, DLT&lt;33.3%, entered the third&#xD;
      stage. Only 10 patients in the high dose group were treated with the corresponding high-dose&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
