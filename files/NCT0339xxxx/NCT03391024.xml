  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For a significant number of patients suffering from back pain, even basic daily activities&#xD;
      become impossible. It is at this time that spinal surgery becomes necessary in order to&#xD;
      improve the patient's quality of life. To combat these symptoms, surgical implants (e.g.&#xD;
      pedicle screws, rods, etc.) are used to aid in stabilizing and correcting the deformities of&#xD;
      the spine, particularly after spinal decompression. Surgical navigation has a great potential&#xD;
      to improve the accuracy of correctly implanting these devices; however, present technologies&#xD;
      rely on intraoperative imaging that uses ionizing radiation (e.g. computed tomography,&#xD;
      fluoroscopy, etc.), require cumbersome set-ups, the physical attachment of fiducial markers,&#xD;
      and cannot account for patient motion. Therefore, the investigators propose a real-time&#xD;
      intraoperative optical topographical imaging based surgical guidance system capable of&#xD;
      accurately guiding the placement of implanted devices such as pedicle screws.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The hypothesis is that optical visualization of surgically exposed bony anatomy with&#xD;
      computerized navigation can accurately estimate subsurface anatomy and in the future,&#xD;
      potentially guide the placement of pedicle screws during spinal surgery. The specific&#xD;
      research aims are as follows: i) an intraoperative non-contact optical imaging system can&#xD;
      quantify the entry point and trajectory of pedicle screws implanted by the spine surgeon; and&#xD;
      ii) intraoperative optical imaging can predict the entry point and trajectory of pedicle&#xD;
      screws as verified by post-operative computed tomography (CT) scans.&#xD;
