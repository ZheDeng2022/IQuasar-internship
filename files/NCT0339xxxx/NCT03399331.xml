  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Oral mucositis (OM) is a significant complication occurring in approximately 40%&#xD;
      of patients on chemotherapy regimens. Ulcerative lesions of OM can be very painful, with&#xD;
      negative impact on diet, oral hygiene, and quality of life. Although a wide variety of agents&#xD;
      have been tested to prevent OM or reduce its severity, none have provided conclusive&#xD;
      evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of this study will be: to determine the efficacy of honey or olive oil on the&#xD;
      severity and pain of OM compared to placebo (standard care) and, (2) to assess which of the&#xD;
      two interventions is more beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Children/adults who receive honey (group 1) or olive oil (group 2) will have less severe&#xD;
           OM compared to the control group (Severity is measured by recovery time from OM and is&#xD;
           the primary outcome)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Children/adults who receive honey (group 1) OR Olive oil (group 2) will have less pain&#xD;
           than the control group. (Severity of pain is the secondary outcome Methods: A randomized&#xD;
           controlled study (RCT) will be used to evaluate the effect of topical application of&#xD;
           honey or olive oil, in the treatment of chemotherapy-related OM in 60 participants with&#xD;
           OM. The primary outcome will be the severity of mucositis, assessed by four trained&#xD;
           nurses blinded to the study group using the scale presented by the World Health&#xD;
           Organization (WHO). The secondary outcome will be pain also assessed by the four trained&#xD;
           nurses on the visual analogue scale ort eh Wong Faces scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relevance of this study lies in the possibility of challenging nurses in regard to the&#xD;
      problem of OM and in proving a possible herbal cure that may influence clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: The characteristics of the three groups will be described using mean and SD,&#xD;
      frequencies and percentages. Baseline differences between the two groups will be tested using&#xD;
      ANOVA for continuous data, and the Chi-square for categorical data. Kruskall-Wallis (chi&#xD;
      square) test will be used to find the association group assignment and WHO grades of OM and&#xD;
      ANOVA and RANOVA tests will be used to find the association between group assignment and the&#xD;
      pain scores. Bonferroni tests will be conducted to explore which of the three groups has the&#xD;
      better outcomes.&#xD;

      When parents or adults express interest in the study they will be approached by the Principal&#xD;
      investigator (LKB) or the 2 research nurses (RS or RA) who will make contact with the&#xD;
      children and their parents and explain the study, ,answer all their questions and concerns&#xD;
      and inform them about the study benefits/potential risks (see recruitment script appendix B&#xD;
      in proposal). If a parent approves to participate in the study, he/she will sign an informed&#xD;
      consent and any child above 7 will be asked to sign an assent form. The investigator will&#xD;
      also assure the parents that participation is totally voluntary and it is not a part of the&#xD;
      conventional treatment and that they have the full right to refuse participating and withdraw&#xD;
      from the study at any time, even after signing the consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment activities will take when the children are hospitalized at the Children's cancer&#xD;
      center in Lebanon (CCCL), 8 North and the Bone Marrow unit (BMT). Patients, parents and&#xD;
      children will also have access to flyers in the unit briefly explaining the study. Potential&#xD;
      subjects will be identified through reviewing daily census on the inpatient unit of CCCL, 8&#xD;
      north or the BMT unit. Participates will be screened for eligibility and will be excluded if&#xD;
      they have any condition that may affect the efficacy of treatment as listed in the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups, 20 patients in each group.&#xD;
      The randomization method will be prepared in advance by a statistician not involved in the&#xD;
      study, using a paper list-generated random assignment sequencel. Based on group assignment,&#xD;
      participants will receive a different compound applied topically to the oral mucosa 3 times&#xD;
      daily until healing, or for 7 days, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will receive 10cc of honey for adults and 5 cc for children, which will be supplied&#xD;
      directly from a New Zealand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 will receive maximum 5 g of extra virgin olive oil for adults and 2 cc for children&#xD;
      directly from a local distributor in south Lebanon. It will be stored in dark containers at&#xD;
      room temperature for use in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 will serve as control, which at our institution is 5cc sodium bicarbonate, 5cc&#xD;
      rinsidin and 5cc of mycostatin 4 times daily for children. For adults it is Caphosol in the&#xD;
      BMT unit and in the Basile inpatient unit it is the magic solution (without xylocaine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups 1 and 2 patients will be instructed to slowly rinse the honey or olive oil in their&#xD;
      mouths, swish it around for 1 minute duration, so as to make the honey or oil in contact with&#xD;
      the oral mucosa and slowly swallow so as to make better contact with the pharyngeal mucosa.&#xD;
      For group 3, patients will swish the respective solution for 1 minute then spit it out. The&#xD;
      order of the different solutions will be written in each medical record by the attending&#xD;
      physician and the nurse will observe the patient taking the solution and will document the&#xD;
      administration on the hospital flowsheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The independent variable for this study is either olive oil or honey The dependent variables&#xD;
      will be primary and secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The primary outcome will be the severity of OM measured by recovery time, defined as the&#xD;
           number of days from the initiation of treatment until healing or day 7 assessed by four&#xD;
           trained nurses on a daily basis and who are blinded to the study group using the scale&#xD;
           presented by the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO scale is based upon the&#xD;
           ability to eat and drink combined with objective signs of mucositis, namely erythema and&#xD;
           ulceration (7). Visualisation of the oral cavity is critical for scoring, as the&#xD;
           presence of oral ulcers delineates a WHO mucositis grade which ranges from 0 to 4 where&#xD;
           higher scores correspond to worse mucositis. The WHO scale is classified as follows:&#xD;
           grade 0=normal, no mucositis; grade 1=soreness and erythema; grade 2=erythema, ulcer,&#xD;
           can eat solids; grade 3=ulcers, require liquid diet only; grade 4=alimentation not&#xD;
           possible. The PI will establish inte-rater reliability with the four nurses by assessing&#xD;
           patients on the WHO scale. Each nurse will conduct the assessment and compare her/his&#xD;
           results with the PI, this will be done until a reliability of &gt;. 80 is achieved.&#xD;
           Reliability will be done before the study begins and then every month until the&#xD;
           completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The secondary outcome will be a pain assessed as per the institution's policy using the&#xD;
           Visual analogue 10cm scale (VAS) or the Wong faces scale. A 0 indicates no mouth or&#xD;
           throat pain and 10 indicates the most severe mouth or throat pain ( see appendix E in&#xD;
           the proposal). The construct, convergent and predictive validity of the VAS and the&#xD;
           Faces scales have been widely published (26). Pain scores of the oral mucosa will be&#xD;
           conducted twice a daily for study purposes. The patients will be assessed by their RNs&#xD;
           for pain which is documented in the patient charts twice per day in the morign and in&#xD;
           the evening (even in the absence of pain).&#xD;
