  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate the reduction of low-density lipoprotein&#xD;
      cholesterol (LDL-C) by evinacumab intravenously (IV) in comparison to placebo after 24 weeks&#xD;
      in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). The secondary objectives of&#xD;
      the study are to evaluate the effect of evinacumab IV on other lipid parameters, evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of evinacumab on LDL-C goal attainment, assess the effect of evinacumab on eligibility&#xD;
      for apheresis (using German and US apheresis criteria), evaluate the safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of evinacumab in patients with HoFH, assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of evinacumab in&#xD;
      patients with HoFH and evaluate the potential development of anti-evinacumab antibodies.&#xD;

    <measure>Percent Change in Calculated Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) From Baseline to Week 24 (Intent-to-Treat [ITT] Estimand)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Percent change was calculated as 100x(calculated LDL-C value at Week 24 - calculated LDL-C value at baseline)/calculated LDL-C value at baseline. The baseline LDL-C value was the last calculated LDL-C value obtained before the first dose of double-blind-study drug. The calculated LDL-C at week 24 was the LDL-C value obtained within the week 24 efficacy analysis window, regardless of adherence to treatment and subsequent therapies (intent-to-treat [ITT] estimand). The ITT population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose or part of a dose of double-blind study drug. Participants in the ITT population were analyzed according to the treatment group allocated by randomization (i.e., as randomized participant group).</description>

        <description>Percent change was calculated as 100x(calculated LDL-C value at Week 24 - calculated LDL-C value at baseline)/calculated LDL-C value at baseline. The baseline LDL-C value was the last calculated LDL-C value obtained before the first dose of double-blind-study drug. The calculated LDL-C at week 24 was the LDL-C value obtained within the week 24 efficacy analysis window, regardless of adherence to treatment and subsequent therapies (intent-to-treat [ITT] estimand). The ITT population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose or part of a dose of double-blind study drug. Participants in the ITT population were analyzed according to the treatment group allocated by randomization (i.e., as randomized participant group).</description>

Secondary prevention: Participants with progressive CV events with LDL-C &gt; 120 to 130 mg/dL (3.1-3.4 mmol/L). Percentage of participants who met EU apheresis eligibility criteria at Week 24 in the DBTP was reported; value obtained regardless of adherence to study treatment and subsequent therapies (ITT estimand). ITT population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose or part of a dose of double-blind study drug. Participants in the ITT population were analyzed according to the treatment group allocated by randomization (i.e., as randomized participant group).</description>

        <description>Absolute change in TC from baseline at Week 24 in the DBTP was reported; value obtained regardless of adherence to study treatment and subsequent therapies (ITT estimand). ITT population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose or part of a dose of double-blind study drug.
