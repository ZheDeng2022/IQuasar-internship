  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the potential of the rapid-acting anti-depressant&#xD;
      ketamine to decrease suicidality in Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of completed suicide in BPD is similar to that of depression or schizophrenia. There&#xD;
      is currently no specific medication treatment for BPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine is an FDA-approved anesthetic agent that has been shown to rapidly decrease&#xD;
      suicidality and improve mood in people with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Though symptoms&#xD;
      overlap, effective treatments for MDD and BPD differ. This clinical trial tests if ketamine&#xD;
      also decreases suicidality and improves mood in BPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will also measure several other outcomes after ketamine versus placebo in BPD:&#xD;
      adverse events, BPD symptoms, pain, social cognition, and neuroplasticity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial primarily tests the impact of ketamine on suicidal thoughts in Borderline&#xD;
      Personality Disorder (BPD). It also tests the impact of ketamine on symptom intensity (for&#xD;
      mood, BPD, and pain symptoms), social cognition, and neuroplasticity in people with BPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suicidal ideation and action are too common in BPD, occurring at rates similar to those in&#xD;
      people with depression or schizophrenia. Intensive psychotherapy helps, but many people with&#xD;
      BPD do not have access to that treatment, and not everyone responds to psychotherapy if they&#xD;
      do get access. No medication is FDA-approved for BPD, and no medication has been shown to&#xD;
      decrease suicidality in BPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine is a promising medication for this problem. It is an FDA-approved anesthetic&#xD;
      medication with N-methyl D-aspartate activity. Sub-anesthetic doses of ketamine decrease&#xD;
      suicidality and improve mood in people with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). This effect is&#xD;
      rapid, with symptom improvement within hours that endures approximately two weeks. People&#xD;
      with BPD can have symptoms that overlap with those of MDD, however, the effective treatments&#xD;
      for BPD and MDD differ. This clinical trial will test if ketamine, which is effective in MDD,&#xD;
      is also effective in BPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use semi-structured interviews and self-report questionnaires to&#xD;
      measure suicidal ideation and clinical symptoms (adverse events, mood symptoms, BPD symptoms,&#xD;
      and pain). Social cognition will be also be measured using both interviews/questionnaires and&#xD;
      cognitive psychology tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One proposed mechanism of ketamine's effect in MDD is increased neuroplasticity - opening a&#xD;
      window during which new learning can occur. This mechanism has been demonstrated in rodent&#xD;
      models of depression. In BPD, negatively-biased social interpretations impede meaningful&#xD;
      recovery and increase suicide risk over time. A post-ketamine neuro-plastic window may&#xD;
      provide an opportunity for revisions of rigid social attributions. The investigators will&#xD;
      test for changes in neuroplasticity using a cognitive psychology task and&#xD;
      electro-encephalography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline measures of demographics, life experiences, and symptoms may also be used to predict&#xD;
      outcomes or as co-variates in our analyses.&#xD;

    <description>The MADRS test includes 10 items and uses a 0 to 6 severity scale for each item, with higher scores indicating increasing depressive symptoms. Item 10 scores can range from 0 to 6 (with 0 indicating enjoying life, and 6 indicating explicit plans for suicide.)</description>

    <description>The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS SR-16) is a a self-report measure of depression. Each item is scored from 0-3.

    <measure>Change in preferred distance in Stop-distance paradigm (SDP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Timepoints will be at baseline and 3, 7, 14, 28 days after infusion</time_frame>
    <description>The stop-distance paradigm is a measure of preferred interpersonal distance (PID). Subjects begin the task standing face-to-face and 6 feet away from a test confederate. On each of 3 trials, the confederate slowly approaches the subject. The subjects are instructed to say &quot;stop&quot; to indicate their 1) preferred conversational distance, then a closer distance 2) &quot;if you start to feel uncomfortable&quot;. After each &quot;stop&quot;, toe to toe distance is measured using a tape measure, and mean PID for the three trials is computed separately for conversational and uncomfortable distance. A computerized version of the task may also be implemented for remote visits and administered in place of the in-person task.</description>

    <measure>Change in behavior in the Economic trust game</measure>
    <time_frame>Timepoints will be at baseline and 3, 7, 14, 28 days after infusion</time_frame>
    <description>The trust game is a multi-round economic exchange game. There are two roles in the game: investor and trustee. Study participants will play as the trustee. Each round, the investor is given a set number of points and can send any amount to the trustee. The investment triples and the trustee decides how much to repay the investor. Outcome measures are cooperation (amount returned to the investor) and coaxing (amount returned to investor on trials when poor prior returns from trustee have led investor to decrease investment).</description>

    <measure>Change in Social Adjustment Scale Self Report (SAS-SR) short version score</measure>
    <time_frame>Timepoints will be at baseline and 3, 7, 14, 28 days after infusion</time_frame>
    <description>This questionaire measures expressive and instrumental performance over the past two weeks in six role areas: (1) work, either as a paid worker, unpaid homemaker, or student, (2) social and leisure activities, (3) relationships with extended family, (4) role as a marital partner, (5) parental role, and (6) role within the family unit, including perceptions about economic functioning. The questions within each area cover four expressive and instrumental categories: performance at expected tasks; the amount of friction with people; finer aspects of interpersonal relations; and feelings and satisfactions. Each question is rated on a five-point scale from which role area means and an overall mean can be obtained, with higher scores denoting greater impairment. Role areas not relevant to the respondent can be skipped. Overall means are based on all items completed by the respondent. Scores range from 0 = no difficulties to 125 = broad difficulties in multiple domains.</description>
