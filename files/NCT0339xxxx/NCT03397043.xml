      In this study, the investigators will use the minimally invasive indicator amino acid&#xD;
      oxidation (IAAO) technique to determine protein requirements in weight-trained males. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that the present study will show that protein requirements for weight-trained&#xD;
      females are i) greater than the current RDA for non-active individual's comparable estimates,&#xD;
      and ii) greater than existing nitrogen balance-based estimates for weight-training&#xD;
      individuals&#xD;

      Provided that energy needs are met, the adequate ingestion of dietary amino acids is the most&#xD;
      critical nutritional factor to support the optimal remodeling and deposition of lean body&#xD;
      mass in individuals of all ages. Current recommendations according to the World Health&#xD;
      Organization/Food and Agricultural Organization suggest that daily protein requirements in&#xD;
      healthy, non-active adults are 0.8 g/kg/day. However, of primary interest in the present&#xD;
      study is the impact that exercise has on the nutritional requirement for dietary amino acids&#xD;
      in highly active adults - e.g., individuals performing weight training. Protein requirements&#xD;
      for individuals who participate in strength-based exercise training have been suggested to&#xD;
      range from 1.2-1.7g protein/kg/day (Rodriguez et al., 2009; Tarnopolsky, 1992; Phillips et&#xD;
      al., 2007), which equates to a 50-112% increase from the current RDA. The increased&#xD;
      requirement in this population may reflect the requirement for protein to repair/rebuild lean&#xD;
      tissues by promoting anabolism (Phillips, 2004). Nutritional requirements for dietary amino&#xD;
      acids in adults (both active and non-active) have traditionally been determined utilizing the&#xD;
      antiquated and often erroneous nitrogen balance technique (Costaneda et al., 1995; Campbell&#xD;
      et al., 1984), which is prone to underestimating protein requirements and therefore provides&#xD;
      challenges to making accurate nutritional recommendations (Humayun, Elango, Ball, and&#xD;
      Pencharz, 2007). This observation that nitrogen balance underestimates protein requirements&#xD;
      in non-active individuals could suggest that protein requirements are much greater than the&#xD;
      current WHO/FAO recommendation of 0.8 g/kg/day which was evaluated using the nitrogen balance&#xD;
      technique (Rand, Pellett and Young, 2003). As a result, there is a need to re-evaluate&#xD;
      recommendations utilizing advanced stable isotope methodology in order to characterize how&#xD;
      dietary amino acid needs may be modulated by physical activity. Recent studies using the&#xD;
      minimally invasive indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) technique have suggested that&#xD;
      protein requirements in young men are at least 50% higher than WHO/FAO guidelines based on&#xD;
      nitrogen balance data (Humayun, Elango, Ball, and Pencharz, 2007). Furthermore, resistance&#xD;
      training has been reported to increase (according to nitrogen balance methodology) protein&#xD;
      requirements by up to 75% Tarnopolsky et al., 1992). Therefore, in this study, the&#xD;
      investigators will use the IAAO technique to determine protein requirements in weight-trained&#xD;
      males. It is hypothesized that the present study will show that protein requirements for&#xD;
      weight-trained females are i) greater than the current RDA for non-active individual's&#xD;
      comparable estimates, and ii) greater than existing nitrogen balance-based estimates for&#xD;
      weight-training individuals.&#xD;
