  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a cluster randomized trial to test the effectiveness of a parental&#xD;
      support programme in pre-school class to promote healthy dietary habits and physical activity&#xD;
      and prevent obesity, delivered by teachers and school health services and in collaboration&#xD;
      with primary care. The control condition is standard care in schools. The 6-month programme&#xD;
      is carried out in schools in disadvantaged areas and is universal. It is based on Social&#xD;
      Cognitive Theory and consists of four components: 1) Health information to parents regarding&#xD;
      the child; 2) Motivational Interviewing with the parents by the school nurse concerning the&#xD;
      child; 3) classroom activities for the children with home assignments; and 4) a web-based&#xD;
      self-test of type-2 diabetes risk by parents, with follow-up in primary health care. The&#xD;
      primary outcome is assessed as the difference between the intervention and the control group&#xD;
      directly after the end of intervention at 6-months post baseline, and at follow-up 18 months&#xD;
      post baseline, adjusted for baseline values. The outcome variables are the intake of&#xD;
      unhealthy foods, unhealthy drinks, and healthy foods assessed by a newly developed method&#xD;
      using photo-based dietary assessment. The secondary outcomes are physical activity and time&#xD;
      spent sedentary measured by accelerometry, and measured BMI and waist circumference.&#xD;
      Hypothetical mediator variables are parental self-efficacy and parenting practices regarding&#xD;
      diet and physical activity assessed by questionnaire. Process evaluation will be performed&#xD;
      through interviews and questionnaires to study how well the programme was implemented in&#xD;
      terms of dose, fidelity, acceptability and feasibility. The programme is in line with the&#xD;
      latest evidence regarding the prevention of childhood obesity: that schools should be a focal&#xD;
      point of prevention efforts, interventions should involve multiple components, and include&#xD;
      the home environment. If effective, it will fill a large knowledge gap concerning&#xD;
      evidence-based health promotion practice within school health services to prevent overweight&#xD;
      and obesity and in the long term reduce social inequalities in health.&#xD;

      Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What are the effects of the programme on children's dietary habits, physical activity,&#xD;
           sedentary behaviour and body weight compared to standard care?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How is the programme implemented with regard to dose, fidelity, feasibility and&#xD;
           acceptability?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What are the mediators of the effects of the programme?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of schools, participants and setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key persons in municipalities in the Stockholm region received a one-page invitation letter&#xD;
      explaining the aim and content of the intervention and were invited to contact the project&#xD;
      leader for more information. Primary schools were eligible to participate if the proportion&#xD;
      of parents with university education was less than 50 percent compared to 57 percent at&#xD;
      national level. In total 18 schools with 18 school nurses agreed to participate but one&#xD;
      school dropped out before recruitment of parents had started. All parents with a child in&#xD;
      pre-school class (5-7 years old) were eligible to participate. Informed, written consent was&#xD;
      obtained from all participating parents (350 children and families).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as a cluster-randomised parallel trial with randomisation at&#xD;
      school level, with a wait-list control group. Baseline data was collected in&#xD;
      September-October 2017 (T0). Data will again be collected 6 months after the baseline at the&#xD;
      end of the intervention in April-May 2018 (T1), and at follow-up in April-May 2019 (18 months&#xD;
      post baseline, T2). Mediators will also be measured on one occasion during the intervention,&#xD;
      in February 2018 (TM). After the T2 measurement, the control schools will be offered the&#xD;
      intervention, including MI-training of the school nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The programme builds on Social Cognitive Theory and consists of four components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Health information: A 12-page brochure based on Swedish guidelines for diet and physical&#xD;
           activity contains facts and advice concerning parenting in relation to healthy food and&#xD;
           family meal times, sweets, snacks, ice-cream, soft drinks, fruit and vegetables,&#xD;
           physical activity, sedentary behaviour, screen time, sleep, and a theme regarding&#xD;
           cooperation between parents. The text is simple and short with many illustrations and&#xD;
           available in Swedish, English, and Arabic. Parents will receive a printed version of the&#xD;
           brochure from the school before the first MI session and it will also be available on&#xD;
           the project website throughout the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The MI session will be scheduled by the school nurse as part of the ordinary health&#xD;
           visit, where the child's height and weight is measured, and which also includes a&#xD;
           discussion about the child´s overall health. The aim of the MI session is to increase&#xD;
           positive parenting and interplay regarding the child's dietary and physical activity&#xD;
           behaviour in the home environment. Parents in the intervention group will be offered one&#xD;
           20 to 30 minute face-to-face MI session by the trained school nurse and another session,&#xD;
           depending on need, as determined by the nurse. During the session (conducted without the&#xD;
           presence of the child), the parents choose a specific behaviour that they wish to change&#xD;
           or maintain. Parents are supported in identifying a target behaviour using an&#xD;
           agenda-setting tool and in the exploration of personal values and the advantages of&#xD;
           change or maintenance, and assisted in goal-setting if applicable. School nurses will&#xD;
           undergo MI training. MI competence will be measured prior to start, post training and at&#xD;
           the end of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Nine manual-based classroom sessions of approximately 30 minutes duration will be&#xD;
           delivered by the teacher to the children. Various pedagogic materials are provided for&#xD;
           the sessions including a workbook for children to be completed with the parents.&#xD;
           Teachers will receive video-recorded instructions of how to use the teacher's manual&#xD;
           ahead of the start of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Parents complete a web-based test of their own risk of developing type 2 diabetes in&#xD;
           order to make them become conscious of a healthy lifestyle for the whole family. The&#xD;
           test contains 8 questions and yields a score between 0 and 26 points. Based on the&#xD;
           result, the parent is classified as being at low, somewhat elevated, medium, high or&#xD;
           very high risk. In case of medium or higher risk (≥15 points) the parent will be advised&#xD;
           by automatic feed-back to consult the local primary health care centre. General&#xD;
           information on health behaviours that minimise the risk for diabetes is provided to all&#xD;
           parents who take the test, regardless of score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children in the control schools will receive treatment as usual according to prevailing&#xD;
      guidelines for school health services and in addition parents receive the 12-page health&#xD;
      information brochure (component 1 of the intervention). Usual treatment means a visit of the&#xD;
      child accompanied by parents to the school nurse soon after the child begins school for a&#xD;
      discussion regarding the school situation, the child's overall well-being, relations with&#xD;
      friends, possible health and learning problems, and diet and physical activity. The&#xD;
      curriculum in pre-school class prescribes that pupils should be provided with opportunities&#xD;
      to experience different forms of physical activity, and to develop an understanding of how&#xD;
      health is affected and can be promoted in various ways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All questionnaires are filled in via the project website (www.enfriskskolstartplus.se) with&#xD;
      personal accounts for each family. Paper versions will also be available. In order to&#xD;
      increase the response rate to the questionnaires, weekly reminders are sent out via e-mail&#xD;
      and text messages. All outcomes are assessed as the difference between the intervention and&#xD;
      the control group directly after the end of intervention at 6-months post baseline, and at&#xD;
      follow-up 18 months post baseline, adjusted for baseline values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the intake at home of a composite score of indicator foods of&#xD;
      importance for energy-balance and health. Intake will be assessed using food frequency&#xD;
      questionnaire, the Children's Eating Habits Questionnaire which measures intake&#xD;
      retrospectively in the home during the preceding month. A new smartphone-based method will&#xD;
      also be used to estimate the intake of indicator foods eaten at home (volume) prospectively&#xD;
      through standardised photos taken by parents over two weekdays and one weekend day. A&#xD;
      relative validation study will be conducted in parallel during baseline, where both methods&#xD;
      will be compared to multiple 24-hour recalls. The intention is to use the photo-based method&#xD;
      for the primary outcome in the intervention study, if shown to be valid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are physical activity and time spent sedentary, which will be measured&#xD;
      objectively using accelerometers worn on a belt at the right hip (GT3X+, Actigraph, LCC,&#xD;
      Pensacola, USA) over 7 consecutive days. Children with at least 500 min of activity&#xD;
      registration per day for a minimum of three days, including at least one weekend day, will be&#xD;
      included in the analyses. Body composition (height, weight and waist circumference) will be&#xD;
      measured using standardised procedures using SECA instruments. Waist circumference will be&#xD;
      measured over the umbilicus, with the child standing upright with arms alongside the body and&#xD;
      after exhalation. BMI status will be defined according to the International Obesity Task&#xD;
      Force. BMI standard deviation score (BMI sds) will be calculated according to the&#xD;
      International Obesity Task Force references.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Covariates:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parental educational level and occupation is self-reported and a composite score will be used&#xD;
      to define socio-economic position consisting of the highest level of education attained, and&#xD;
      the occupation (according to Statistics Sweden) by either of the parents. A dichotomised&#xD;
      variable indicating low and high socio-economic position will be created. In addition, child&#xD;
      sex will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process evaluation will include intervention dose, fidelity, feasibility, acceptability&#xD;
      and a description of the context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose will be estimated quantitatively in the following way. Parents will be asked in a&#xD;
      non-judgmental way by the school nurse if they have read the brochure. The number of MI&#xD;
      sessions per family will be noted. Compliance with the teaching sessions and workbook&#xD;
      completion will be monitored by teachers in a logbook and whether they made any adaptations.&#xD;
      The result of the diabetes test will be available from the website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All MI sessions will be recorded and a random selection of 10-20 percent will be coded for MI&#xD;
      competence/fidelity using a standardised protocol by reliable coders. The MI competence of&#xD;
      all nurses in the intervention and control group will be assessed before the first MI&#xD;
      training in May 2017 by recording them having a standardised conversation with a trained&#xD;
      actor posing as a parent. This will be repeated after MI training in August/September 2017,&#xD;
      and again after the end of intervention in May 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of the intervention, semi-structured interviews with parents, school nurses and&#xD;
      head teachers will be performed to explore their views on the acceptability and feasibility&#xD;
      of the intervention. In addition, focus groups will be conducted with the children to explore&#xD;
      their perceptions of the activities in class and the home assignments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothetical mediators parental self-efficacy and observational learning/role modelling&#xD;
      will be measured by questionnaire in both mothers and fathers. The instrument used assesses&#xD;
      parental self-efficacy for influencing physical activity during the weekend, intake of&#xD;
      vegetables, sweets and chocolates, and sugar-sweetened beverages, each in three challenging&#xD;
      situations. Parental feeding practices, including modelling, will be measured using the&#xD;
      Comprehensive Feeding Practices Questionnaire covering both positive and negative practices.&#xD;
      The questionnaire will assess the parental feeding practices of involvement, environment,&#xD;
      food restriction for weight control, restriction for health reasons, encouragement of&#xD;
      balance, pressure to eat, monitoring, emotion regulation, food as reward, and modelling. For&#xD;
      assessment of parenting practices regarding children's physical activity, 25 items will be&#xD;
      used from an item bank currently being developed for this purpose. The items cover the&#xD;
      parenting practices modelling, pressure, encouragement, guided choice, involvement/praise,&#xD;
      co-participation, facilitation, monitoring, and restriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive a code and data will be depersonalised. All data collected&#xD;
      through the project website and otherwise will be stored electronically in password protected&#xD;
      folders on a secure data server at Karolinska Institutet. Measures to prevent loss of data&#xD;
      will be taken through the use of systematic back-up routines throughout data collection and&#xD;
      by data storage on servers with complete data back-up on a daily basis. Access to data will&#xD;
      be restricted to the research personnel working directly with data entry or analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences in continuous demographic variables at baseline between intervention and control&#xD;
      group will tested using independent t-tests for normally distributed data. Non-normally&#xD;
      distributed variables will be analysed by non-parametric tests. For categorical variables,&#xD;
      differences will be analysed by chi-square test. Effectiveness with regard to primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes will be analysed by mixed-effect regression analyses with two levels&#xD;
      (individual and school) with data at T1 or T2 as outcomes, according to the principle of&#xD;
      intention to treat. First, a crude model will be tested for all outcomes at T1 or T2 with&#xD;
      group as the predictor and adjusted for baseline values of the relevant outcome. Interaction&#xD;
      between group and child sex or group and parental SEP will be tested and analyses stratified&#xD;
      if significant interaction terms are found. All children with measurements at T0 will be&#xD;
      included and missing data will be handled with multiple imputation. The effect that any&#xD;
      missing data might have on results will be assessed by performing sensitivity analyses of&#xD;
      augmented data sets. Analysis will also be performed per protocol including only those&#xD;
      children whose parents have attended at least one MI session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analysis will be performed blinded to group allocation. Interviews and focus&#xD;
      groups will be transcribed verbatim and analysed using qualitative content analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary intake of unhealthy foods, unhealthy drinks and healthy foods is the primary outcome.&#xD;
      In the previous study, the intake of unhealthy foods was 1.7 ± 2.0 portions/day. In this&#xD;
      study, the aim is to achieve a difference in intake of unhealthy foods of 0.8 portions/day&#xD;
      between the intervention and the control group. With a power of 80% and significance level of&#xD;
      5% and an intra-class correlation coefficient of 2% (clustering at school level), at least 17&#xD;
      schools with 15 children in each school need to be recruited, 255 children in total.&#xD;
