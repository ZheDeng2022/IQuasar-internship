  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fruit and vegetables are a cornerstone of healthy dietary patterns and dietary guidelines&#xD;
      worldwide. The supporting evidence, however, is largely derived from observational studies of&#xD;
      protective associations with cardiovascular disease (CVD) in health-conscious populations or&#xD;
      from randomized trials of the effect of specific fruit or vegetable derived nutrients on CVD&#xD;
      risk factors. A growing body of literature has influenced a shift away from a focus on single&#xD;
      nutrients to a focus on whole foods and dietary patterns. To what extent fruit and vegetables&#xD;
      should contribute to dietary patterns for cardiovascular health and whether specific types of&#xD;
      fruit or vegetables should be recommended is unclear. Although previous systematic reviews&#xD;
      and meta-analyses have elucidated the association between the intake of total and some&#xD;
      specific fruit and vegetables with cardiovascular outcomes, a comprehensive synthesis&#xD;
      comparing the certainty of the evidence for the different types of fruit and vegetables in&#xD;
      relation to a range of cardiovascular outcomes has yet to be completed. We propose to conduct&#xD;
      a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available prospective cohort studies using the&#xD;
      Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess&#xD;
      the association between different types of fruit and vegetables and different cardiovascular&#xD;
      outcomes that include CVD, coronary heart disease [CHD], and stroke incidence and mortality.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A high intake of fruit and vegetables is a common trait among healthy dietary patterns and a&#xD;
      cornerstone of nutrition interventions for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. There is&#xD;
      an international consensus that at least 5 servings per day of fruit and vegetables is&#xD;
      beneficial to overall population health (WHO, 2003). This guidance, however, is largely&#xD;
      founded on observational studies showing protective associations of high intakes of fruit and&#xD;
      vegetables with CVD in health-conscious individuals (Reddy and Katan, 2004). Recommendations&#xD;
      to consume specific types of fruit and vegetables, such as citrus fruit and green leafy&#xD;
      vegetables, have been established mainly on the association of isolated nutrients with CVD&#xD;
      risk reduction in observational studies or the effect of isolated nutrients on CVD risk&#xD;
      factors in small randomized trials (Katamay et al., 2007). Given its prominence in dietary&#xD;
      guidelines, there is a need to determine the extent of CVD risk reduction that may be&#xD;
      attributed to the consumption of fruit and vegetables. As guidelines are shifting away from a&#xD;
      focus on single nutrients to a focus on whole foods and dietary patterns and achieving&#xD;
      adequate intakes continue to be a challenge worldwide and (Hall et al., 2009), there is also&#xD;
      an advantage in establishing which types of fruit and vegetables are associated with the&#xD;
      greatest protection in CVD incidence and mortality per serving. Although several systematic&#xD;
      reviews and meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies have demonstrated protective&#xD;
      associations between the intake of total fruit and vegetables and CVD risk (Aune et al.,&#xD;
      2017; Zhan et al., 2017; Gan et al., 2015; Wang et al, 2014; Hu et al., 2007; He et al.,&#xD;
      2007; Dauchet et al., 2006), few have focused on specific fruit and vegetables or explored a&#xD;
      range of cardiovascular outcomes which may have different etiologies. Several large&#xD;
      prospective cohort studies have recently been published which may strengthen the certainty of&#xD;
      the evidence by increasing the number of observations for the relationship between different&#xD;
      fruit and vegetables exposures and different cardiovascular outcomes. We propose to build and&#xD;
      expand on the exiting systematic reviews and meta-analyses by conducting a comprehensive&#xD;
      synthesis of prospective cohort studies comparing the certainty of the evidence for the&#xD;
      different types of fruit and vegetables in relation to a range of cardiovascular outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available prospective cohort studies&#xD;
      using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach&#xD;
      to assess the association between different types of fruit and vegetables and different&#xD;
      cardiovascular outcomes including CVD, CHD, and stroke incidence and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conduct of the proposed systematic review and meta-analysis will follow the Cochrane&#xD;
      handbook for systematic reviews of interventions and the GRADE handbook for grading the&#xD;
      certainty of the evidence and the strength of recommendations using the GRADE approach. The&#xD;
      reporting will follow the Meta-Analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) and&#xD;
      the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Sources:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) will be&#xD;
      searched using relevant search terms. Search of databases will be supplemented by manual&#xD;
      searches of bibliographies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective cohort studies exploring the relation of fruit and/or vegetable intake to&#xD;
      incident cardiovascular disease for a minimum follow-up time of 1 year will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data extraction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two independent reviewers will extract relevant information including study design, sample&#xD;
      size, subject characteristics, exposure form (i.e. total fruit and vegetables, citrus fruit,&#xD;
      green leafy vegetables, etc.), duration/person-years of follow-up, adjustments of models and&#xD;
      risk ratios for clinical outcomes derived from clinical event data across quantiles of&#xD;
      exposure. Any disagreements will be reconciled by consensus with arbitration by the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk of bias:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk of bias (ROB) will be assessed by two independent reviewers using the Newcastle-Ottawa&#xD;
      Scale (NOS). Up to 9 points can be awarded based on cohort selection (max 4 points), the&#xD;
      comparability of cohort design and analysis (max 4 points), and adequacy of the outcome&#xD;
      measures (max 3 points). Studies that receive ≥6 points will be considered as higher quality.&#xD;
      Again, any disagreements will be reconciled by consensus with arbitration by the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will assess 6 outcomes: CVD incidence and mortality, CHD incidence and mortality, and&#xD;
      stroke incidence and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Synthesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will pool the natural log-transformed relative risks for the 6 cardiovascular outcomes&#xD;
      using the inverse variance method with random effects models with data expressed as risk&#xD;
      ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Analyses will be conducted by extreme&#xD;
      quantiles analyses, comparing the highest with the lowest (reference) level of exposure. Data&#xD;
      will also be scaled to allow for per serving/day analyses. Between-study heterogeneity will&#xD;
      be assessed by the Cochran Q test and quantified by the I2 statistic with significance at&#xD;
      P&lt;0.1. An I2≥50% and P&lt;0.1 will be considered as evidence of substantial heterogeneity.&#xD;
      Sensitivity analyses and a priori subgroup analyses will be undertaken to explore sources of&#xD;
      heterogeneity. Sensitivity analyses will include the systematic removal of included cohorts&#xD;
      with the recalculation of summary estimates. A priori subgroup analyses will be conducted&#xD;
      when ≥10 cohort comparisons are available by age, sex, location of cohort, follow-up&#xD;
      duration, dietary assessment tool, risk of bias (NOS score). A separate subgroup analysis&#xD;
      will also be conducted by each domain of risk of bias by NOS. Meta-regression analyses will&#xD;
      assess the significance of categorical and continuous subgroups analyses. Dose-response&#xD;
      analyses will be undertaken using random-effects generalized least squares trend estimation&#xD;
      models (GLST) to assess linear relationships and spline curve modeling (the MKSPLINE&#xD;
      procedure) to assess non-linear relationships. If ≥10 cohort comparisons are available, then&#xD;
      publication bias will be assessed by visual inspection of funnel plots and formal testing&#xD;
      with the Egger and Begg tests at a significance level of p≤ 0.10. If publication bias is&#xD;
      suspected, then the investigators will attempt to adjust for funnel plot asymmetry by&#xD;
      imputing the missing study data using the Duval and Tweedie trim and fill method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grading the Evidence:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method will be&#xD;
      used to assess the overall certainty of the evidence for each of the cardiovascular outcomes.&#xD;
      This system grades the evidence as &quot;high quality&quot;, &quot;moderate quality&quot;, &quot;low quality&quot;, or&#xD;
      &quot;very low quality&quot;. Observational studies including prospective cohort studies start at a&#xD;
      &quot;low quality&quot; and then can be downgraded or upgraded based on established criteria. Criteria&#xD;
      to downgrade will include study limitations (weight of studies show risk of bias by NOS),&#xD;
      inconsistency (substantial unexplained inter-study heterogeneity, I2&gt;50%, P&lt;0.10),&#xD;
      indirectness (presence of factors relating to the population, exposures, and outcomes that&#xD;
      limit generalizability), imprecision (95% CI are wide or cross a minimally important&#xD;
      difference of 5% [RR 0.95- 1.05]), and publication bias (significant evidence of publication&#xD;
      bias or small-study effects). Criteria to upgrade will include a large magnitude effect (RR&gt;2&#xD;
      or RR&lt;0.5 in the absence of plausible confounders), a dose-response gradient, and attenuation&#xD;
      by plausible confounding effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge translation plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be disseminated through interactive presentations at local, national, and&#xD;
      international scientific meetings and publication in high impact factor journals. Target&#xD;
      audiences will include the public health and scientific communities with interest in&#xD;
      nutrition, physical activity, lifestyle modification, obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease. Feedback will be incorporated and used to improve the public health message and key&#xD;
      areas for future research will be defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will aid in establishing a stronger evidence-base to determine the extent to which&#xD;
      a high fruit and vegetable intake may be associated with reduction in incident CVD. It may&#xD;
      also bring to light categories of fruits and/or vegetables that could provide additional&#xD;
      benefit in CVD prevention.&#xD;
