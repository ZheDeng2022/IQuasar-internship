  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ultimate goal of periodontal therapy is the regeneration of periodontal tissues which&#xD;
      have been destroyed due to periodontal disease. Different modalities have been proposed to&#xD;
      obtain regeneration of periodontal tissues employing various bone grafts, bone substitute&#xD;
      materials, guided tissue regeneration (GTR), combination of bone grafts or bone substitutes&#xD;
      with GTR, and growth factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, a new, fully synthetic, nanocrystalline, unsintered, phase-pure hydroxyapatite (nano-HA)&#xD;
      has been suggested as a potential material for enhancing periodontal and bone regeneration&#xD;
      since its chemical composition and crystalline structure correspond to the calcium phosphate&#xD;
      component of natural bone and may have greater potential for resorption compared with&#xD;
      sintered hydroxyapatite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study performed in 2012, on 14 patients with paired intrabony periodontal defects of ≥4 mm&#xD;
      participated in split mouth design study. The defects in each subject were randomly selected&#xD;
      to receive nano-HA paste in conjunction with papilla preservation flaps or papilla&#xD;
      preservation flaps alone. Probing bone levels from a customized acrylic stent and probing&#xD;
      pocket depths were measured at baseline and again 6 months following surgery. No differences&#xD;
      in any of the investigated parameters were observed at baseline between the two groups.&#xD;
      Healing was uneventful in all patients. Both treatments resulted in significant improvements&#xD;
      between baseline and 6 months in all clinical and radio-graphic parameters. In conclusion,&#xD;
      they found that the nano crystalline hydroxyapatite bone graft in combination with collagen&#xD;
      membrane demonstrated clinical advantages beyond that achieved by open flap debridement&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concept of porous guided tissue membrane has been tested recently as a modality that&#xD;
      could stimulate bone formation of critical sized bone defects. Kim and co-workers claimed&#xD;
      that asymmetrically porous GBR membranes with dual BMP-2 and ultrasound stimulation may be&#xD;
      promising for the clinical treatment of delayed and insufficient bone healing. For guided&#xD;
      tissue regeneration in periodontal therapy, membrane perforations could allow for gingival&#xD;
      stem cells and periosteal cells to take part in supracrestal regeneration. The perforated&#xD;
      section of the membranes would stabilize supracrestal fibrin clot through mechanical&#xD;
      interlocking of fibrin strands with the membrane pores providing more membrane and clot&#xD;
      stability. It has been suggested that regenerative failures may result when the tensile&#xD;
      strength of the fibrin clot is exceeded, resulting in a tear and a long junctional epithelium&#xD;
      type attachment.&#xD;

      The study will be conducted on 12 individuals. The research esthetics committee of Faculty of&#xD;
      Dentistry, Ain Shams University will review the proposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be informed about the nature of the study and will fine an informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I - Selection of the patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be selected from the outpatient clinic of Oral Medicine and Periodontology&#xD;
      department, Faculty of Dentistry, Ain Shams University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the selected patients will be selected according to following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with history of periodontal surgery or medications including antibiotics and&#xD;
           non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for at least 3 months prior to the initiation of&#xD;

&#xD;
        2. Pregnant females as well as breast feeding mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Vulnerable groups as prisoners, mentally disabled, etc… All participants following&#xD;
           initial clinical examination and periapical radiographs will be given detailed&#xD;
           instructions in self-performed plaque control measures, including tooth brushing and&#xD;
           dental flossing. All patients will receive full mouth scaling and root planing using&#xD;
           ultra-sonic scalers and hand instruments under local anesthesia to minimize patient&#xD;
           discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II- Study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selected sites will be randomly &quot;double blinded study&quot; divided into two groups in a split&#xD;
      mouth design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group One:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The defects will be treated with open flap debridment followed by the placement of&#xD;
      nanohydroxyapetite* combined with perforated collagen membrane**.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group Two:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The defects will be treated with open flap debridment followed by the placement of&#xD;
      nanohydroxyapetite combined with non perforated collagen membrane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mucoperiosteal flaps will be adapted and sutured and the patients will be given&#xD;
      post-surgical instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III- Periodontal evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical parameters will be measured at one, three and six months postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Plaque index (PI): Criteria of plaque index (PI) of (Silness and Loe, 1969) 0: No plaque&#xD;
      in gingival area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. No plaque visible by the unaided eye, but plaque is made visible on the point of the&#xD;
           probe after it has been moved across surface at entrance of gingival crevice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Gingival area is covered with thin to moderately thick layer of plaque, deposit is&#xD;
           visible to naked eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Heavy accumulation of plaque, the thickness of which fills out niche produced by&#xD;
           gingival margin and tooth surface, inter dental area is stuffed with plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) Gingival index (GI): Criteria of the gingival index (GI) of (Loe, 1967) 0: Normal gingiva&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mild inflammation: slight change in color and slight edema; no bleeding on probing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. moderate inflammation: redness, edema and glazing; bleeding on probing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Severe inflammation: marked redness and edema; ulceration; tendency to spontaneous&#xD;
           bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3) Probing pocket depth (PPD) : Probing pocket depth (PPD) will be measured from the gingival&#xD;
      margin to the base of periodontal pocket to the nearest mm (Caton, 1989).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six readings will be recorded for each tooth: Mesiobuccal, mid-buccal, distobuccal,&#xD;
      mesiolingual, mid-lingual and distolingual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4) Clinical attachment level (CAL): Clinical attachment level will be measured from&#xD;
      cementoenamel junction to the base of pocket to the nearest mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B- Radiographic parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periapical radiographs and Cone beam computed tomography will be taken at base line and at&#xD;
      six months after the placement of barrier membranes combined with nanohydroxyapatite and the&#xD;
      following parameters will be measured:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sites will be measured first on periapical radiographs and later on CBCT with the help of&#xD;
      the ruler in the Image Tool software (University of Texas Health Science Centre, San Antonio,&#xD;
      TX) based on the method proposed by Misch et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three measurements will be performed for each site:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The height of the alveolar crest (AC): measured from the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) to&#xD;
           the AC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The depth of the defect, measured from the CEJ to the bottom of the defect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The width of the defect, measured from the highest point of the AC to the dental root&#xD;
           adjacent to the defect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The axial slices will be used to verify the presence of combined bone defects and identify&#xD;
      according to the classification of Goldman and Cohen.&#xD;
