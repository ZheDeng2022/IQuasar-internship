      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is form of non-invasive brain stimulation. It is&#xD;
      approved to treat depression. TMS may help decrease drug craving. It is important to&#xD;
      understand how TMS affects the brain. Such a better understanding would help to design ways&#xD;
      to treat drug addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn how TMS affects the brain when it stimulates an area in the front of the brain.&#xD;
      Also, to see how the stimulation affects the area stimulated and other connected areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy, right-handed adults ages 18 60 who are non-drug users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened under protocol 06-DA-N415.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have at least 3 visits. The first visit will last about 3 hours. All other&#xD;
      visits will last up to 6 hours. Participants cannot use drugs or alcohol at least 24 hours&#xD;
      before a visit. They cannot have more than half a cup of a caffeinated drink at least 12&#xD;
      hours before a visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each visit will include a brief medical history update, urine test for drugs and pregnancy&#xD;
      (if female), a breath test for alcohol and smoking, and questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a TMS orientation visit. A wire coil will be placed on the head. An&#xD;
      electrical current will pass through the coil to create a magnetic pulse that stimulates the&#xD;
      brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other visits will include 2 sessions of TMS-MRI. Participants will lie on a table that&#xD;
      slides into a cylinder. The TMS coil and the MRI coil will be placed over the head. Pictures&#xD;
      will be taken of the brain with and without stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a questionnaire about how they feel before and after each TMS&#xD;
      session and in a follow-up call 2 3 weeks after their last session.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Objectives: The goal of the protocol is to investigate acute modulations of brain activity by&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Using simultaneous TMS and functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI), we will evaluate TMS induced changes in brain activity, including&#xD;
      regional brain activation and inter-regional functional connectivity. Repetitive TMS will be&#xD;
      applied over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) with different frequencies and&#xD;
      interleaved with fMRI acquisition to provide online monitoring of brain activity.&#xD;
      Furthermore, we will assess the relationship between the TMS induced brain activity and the&#xD;
      anatomical connection obtained from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), using individual&#xD;
      variations in these imaging measures. Results from this study will help to understand the&#xD;
      underling mechanism of TMS and will provide insights for interpretation of TMS and fMRI data.&#xD;
      Study population: Up to 70 healthy, adults will be tested. Subjects must fit&#xD;
      exclusion/inclusion criteria for both TMS and MRI. We expect to enroll 70 subjects to arrive&#xD;
      at 50 who complete the protocol. Design: The study is a within-subject design with each&#xD;
      subject completing up to 4 TMS-fMRI sessions in two days (2 sessions per day) Outcome&#xD;
      measures: The outcome measures will be the effects of TMS on fMRI blood oxygen&#xD;
      level-dependent (BOLD) responses, TMS induced changes on resting state functional&#xD;
      connectivity, and their associations with relevant structural connectivity revealed by DTI.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be able to give valid informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be 18 60 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Justification: Many neural processes change with age, and these changes could&#xD;
                  introduce unwanted variability in both behavioral and MRI signals. In addition,&#xD;
                  the risk of difficult-to-detect medical abnormalities such as silent cerebral&#xD;
                  infarcts increases with age.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Screening tool: History. Government-issued forms of identification (e.g. driver s&#xD;
                  license, birth certificate) will be required when participant appears to be out&#xD;
                  of age range.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be in good health.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Justification: Many illnesses may alter neural functioning as well as fMRI&#xD;
                  signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Screening tools: Medical Assessment, Medical History and Physical Examination.&#xD;
                  Medical assessments include: Vital Signs, EKG, oral HIV test, height/weight&#xD;
                  measurements, urinalysis and blood sample. Tests on the blood sample include CBC,&#xD;
                  complete metabolic profile, TSH, ESR, STS and HIV (if needed to confirm a&#xD;
                  positive salivary test for HIV). The following individual laboratory results will&#xD;
                  independently disqualify individuals: Cholesterol &gt;250 mg/dl, Hemoglobin &lt; 10.5&#xD;
                  g/dl, WBC &lt; 2400/ (Micro)l, LFTs &gt; 3Xnormal, HCG positive, Casual serum glucose &gt;&#xD;
                  200 mg/dl, Urine protein &gt; 1+. The MAI will retain discretion to exclude at less&#xD;
                  extreme values, depending on the clinical presentation. (Serum glucose over 140&#xD;
                  mg/dl will be followed up with a fasting serum glucose assessment. Those with&#xD;
                  fasting glucose below 100 mg/dl may be considered for the protocol. Others will&#xD;
                  be rejected and referred for work-up.) MAI will make the final judgment on any&#xD;
                  questionable lab results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Right-handed.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Justification: Using right-handed individuals will reduce variability in BOLD MRI&#xD;
                  data.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Screening tool: Edinburgh Handedness Inventory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Personal history of stroke, brain lesions, previous neurosurgery, any personal history&#xD;
             of seizure or fainting episode of unknown cause, or head trauma resulting in loss of&#xD;
             consciousness, lasting over 30 minutes or with sequela lasting longer than two days.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Justification: Stroke or head trauma can lower the seizure threshold, and are&#xD;
                  therefore contra-indications for TMS. Fainting episodes or syncope of unknown&#xD;
                  cause could indicate an undiagnosed condition associated with seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Screening tool: TMS safety questionnaire, Medical History.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  First-degree family history of any neurological disorder with a potentially hereditary&#xD;
             basis, including migraines, epilepsy, or multiple sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Justification: Neurological disorders can lower the seizure threshold, and are&#xD;
                  therefore contra-indications for TMS. First-degree family history of certain&#xD;
                  neurological disorders with a hereditary component increases the risk of the&#xD;
                  subject having an undiagnosed condition that is associated with lowered seizure&#xD;
                  threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Screening tool: TMS safety screening, Medical History.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiac pacemakers, neural stimulators, implantable defibrillator, implanted&#xD;
             medication pumps, intracardiac lines, or acute, unstable cardiac disease, with&#xD;
             intracranial implants (e.g. aneurysm clips, shunts, stimulators, cochlear implants, or&#xD;
             electrodes) or any other metal object within or near the head that precludes MRI&#xD;
             scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Justification: Any metal around the head is a contraindication for both MRI and&#xD;
                  TMS, as both methods involve exposure to a relatively strong magnetic field.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Screening tool: TMS safety screening, MRI safety screening, Medical History.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Noise-induced hearing loss or tinnitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Justification: individuals with noise-induced hearing problems may be&#xD;
                  particularly vulnerable to the acoustic noise generated by TMS and MRI equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Screening tools: TMS safety screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use (any use in the past 4 weeks, chronic use within 6 past six months) of any&#xD;
             investigational drug or of any medications with psychotropic, anti or pro-convulsive&#xD;
             action.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Justification: The use of certain medications or drugs can lower seizure&#xD;
                  threshold and is therefore contraindicated for TMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Screening tools: MRI safety screening questionnaire, Medical history, Medical&#xD;
                  Assessments: Urine toxicology analyzes for presence of a broad range of&#xD;
                  prescription and nonprescription drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lifetime history of major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, mania,&#xD;
             or hypomania.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Justification: The population of interest here is a healthy control population&#xD;
                  with no psychiatric disorders. In subjects with depression, bipolar disorder,&#xD;
                  mania or hypomania, there is a small chance that TMS can trigger (hypo)manic&#xD;
                  symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Screening tools: MINI Screen Patient Questionnaire. Potential diagnoses will be&#xD;
                  further evaluated by a counsellor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of nicotine or history more than 20 cigarettes lifetime or history of&#xD;
             daily smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Justification: The population of interest here is a healthy control population&#xD;
                  with no substance use disorder and therefore a minimal cigarette exposure history&#xD;
                  in the control group is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Screening tools: Self-report, commercial urine cotinine test corresponding to&#xD;
                  non-smoker status for the specific test being used, typically corresponding to a&#xD;
                  urine cotinine under about 20 ng/ml, CO &lt;6.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Meet current DSM-5 criteria for any substance use disorder, smoke daily, or urine&#xD;
             toxicology positive for any illicit substance inconsistent with history given.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Justification: The population of interest here is a healthy control population&#xD;
                  with no substance use disorder. Current use of illicit substances could lower&#xD;
                  seizure threshold and is therefore contraindicated for TMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Screening tools: MINI Screen Patient Questionnaire. Potential diagnoses will be&#xD;
                  further evaluated by a counsellor, Drug Use Survey (DUS), Substance Use Disorder&#xD;
                  Evaluation, Medical Assessments: urine qualitative drug screen is performed for&#xD;
                  methadone, benzodiazepines, cocaine, amphetamine/methamphetamine, opiates,&#xD;
                  barbiturates, and tetrahydrocannabinol. Participants who test positive at&#xD;
                  screening (under protocol 06-DA-N415) will be evaluated with a neuromotor exam to&#xD;
                  further assess for current intoxication. For participants who are not found to be&#xD;
                  currently intoxicated, screening staff will assess for SUD and coherence of their&#xD;
                  drug use history and toxicology, with particular attention to substances for&#xD;
                  which they are positive and may require a return screening visit to demonstrate&#xD;
                  ability to produce a negative urine before allowing them to proceed to clearance&#xD;
                  for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have met DSM-5 criteria for any substance use disorder in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Justification: the population of interest here is a healthy control population&#xD;
                  with no present or past substance use disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Screening tools: MINI Screen Patient Questionnaire. Potential diagnoses will be&#xD;

          -  History of myocardial infarction, angina, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy,&#xD;
             stroke or transient ischemic attack, or any heart condition currently under medical&#xD;
             care.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Justifications: the risk of TMS for individuals with a heart condition is&#xD;
                  unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Screening tool: physical assessment (EKG), medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women or women with reproductive potential who are sexually active and not&#xD;
             using an acceptable form of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Justification: it is unknown whether TMS or MRI poses a risk to fetuses.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Screening tool: Medical assessments (urine pregnancy test) at the beginning of&#xD;
                  each visit that involves TMS or MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in an rTMS session less than two weeks ago.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Justification: in order to limit exposure to TMS, we will not enroll subjects who&#xD;
                  have received TMS less than two weeks ago.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Screening tool: TMS safety screening questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of Learning disability, ADHD or cognitive impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Justification: Cognitive impairment and learning disabilities are associated with&#xD;
                  alterations in brain regions and may introduce significant variably into the&#xD;
                  data.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Screening tool: self-report of special education classes, history of specific&#xD;
                  learning disability or mental retardation, Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of&#xD;
                  Intelligence (WASI), Medical history and Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale with follow&#xD;
                  up clinical interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-English Speaking&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Justification: There is no direct benefit to participants in this study, and some&#xD;
                  of the study procedures involve more than minimal risk. To include non-English&#xD;
                  speakers, we would have to translate the consent and other study documents and&#xD;
                  hire and train bilingual staff, which would require resources that we do not have&#xD;
                  and could not justify given the small sample size for each experiment. Most&#xD;
                  importantly, ongoing communication regarding safety procedures is necessary when&#xD;
                  participants are undergoing MRI and TMS procedures. The inability to effectively&#xD;
                  communicate MRI and TMS safety procedures could compromise the safety of&#xD;
                  non-English speaking participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Screening tool: self-report.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suspected or confirmed active SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Justification: COVID-19 is extremely infectious and can have serious&#xD;
                  consequences. Allowing participants with active infection would alter the&#xD;
                  risk:benefit ratio for non-treatment studies without a primary focus on&#xD;
                  SARS-CoV-2 to an unacceptable level of risk. In addition, COVID-19 can have&#xD;
                  cognitive consequences which would add unnecessary noise to the study data.&#xD;
                  Testing will continue as long as public health officials and/or NIDA medical&#xD;
                  personnel deem it appropriate.&#xD;

               -  Screening tool: 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) patient screening tool&#xD;
                  administered by phone prior to participant arrival. The current version of the&#xD;
                  screening tool to be used is available at&#xD;
                  http://intranet.cc.nih.gov/hospitalepidemiology/emerging_infectious_diseases.html&#xD;
                  ). Viral testing looking for SARS-CoV-2 in a specimen deemed appropriate by NIH&#xD;
                  such as nasopharyngeal or mid-turbinate swab. We reserve the right to change the&#xD;
                  specimen type as NIH approves new test procedures. This test may be carried out&#xD;
                  in-house at NIDA, NIH, at a community testing site or through a commercial&#xD;
                  vendor. Anyone with a positive symptom screen without a clear alternative&#xD;
                  explanation or a positive viral test will be excluded until they recover or (for&#xD;
                  asymptomatic cases) are no longer infectious. Additionally, participants will be&#xD;
                  asked about any lingering neurological and psychiatric symptoms such as&#xD;
                  difficulty with memory or concentration, changes in mood or new anxiety symptoms&#xD;
                  that may be a result of COVID-19 exposure. The MAI will evaluate any lingering&#xD;
                  symptoms to determine whether the potential impact on data is compatible with&#xD;
                  continuing in the study. MAI will also retain the ability to exclude for a&#xD;
                  suspicious symptom screen without positive viral test.&#xD;
