  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BCD-085 is an innovative drug, a monoclonal antibody against interleukin-17. The toxicity,&#xD;
      safety, and pharmacokinetics of BCD-085 were investigated in animals, in phase I clinical&#xD;
      study in healthy volunteers, and in phase III clinical study in patients with moderate to&#xD;
      severe plaque psoriasis. This clinical study aims at investigating the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      BCD-085 every other week regimen (after induction for the first 3 weeks) versus BCD-085 one&#xD;
      per month regimen (after induction for first 3 weeks) versus placebo in patients with&#xD;
      moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the efficacy and safety of BCD-085 versus placebo in patients with moderate to&#xD;
      severe plaque psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the efficacy of BCD-085 every 2 weeks versus BCD-085 every 4 weeks versus&#xD;
           placebo, based on the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI75, target sPGA score,&#xD;
           and on other secondary efficacy measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the proportion of patients in each study arm who develop adverse events with&#xD;
           multiple injections of BCD-085 and placebo. Compare the safety profiles of BCD-085 when&#xD;
           used every 4 weeks and when used every 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 4. To assess the immunogenicity of BCD-085 defined as the proportion of patients who&#xD;
           develop anti-drug antibodies (binding or neutralizing).&#xD;

    <measure>â€¢ The Proportion (Number) of Patients in Each Study Arm Who Achieved a PASI 75 at Week 12 of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) allows evaluating the extent and severity of skin symptoms of psoriasis. Body is divided into 4 areas for scoring (head, arms, trunk, legs); each area is scored by itself and scores are combined for final PASI: 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease).&#xD;
Relative (percentage) change in PASI score from baseline (screening) is calculated as 100 x (baseline value - time point t value) / (baseline value) PASI 75 indicates a 75% or greater reduction in PASI scores from baseline and is indicative of excellent disease improvement.</description>

          <description>Patients in this arm (85 subjects) will receive 120 mg BCD-085 (two SC injections, 60 mg in 1.0 mL each).

Relative (percentage) change in PASI score from baseline (screening) is calculated as 100 x (baseline value - time point t value) / (baseline value) PASI 75 indicates a 75% or greater reduction in PASI scores from baseline and is indicative of excellent disease improvement.</description>
