  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit Disorder with or without Hyperactivity (ADHD) is a frequent pathology in&#xD;
      children that has important consequences on schooling both in terms of academic level (due to&#xD;
      the attentional disorder) and behavior (disruption of the class). ADHD also has an impact on&#xD;
      family functioning, which can generate stress and family altercations. The homework period&#xD;
      can be a particularly tense time and a source of conflict with the child, which has negative&#xD;
      consequences on the family atmosphere, learning efficiency and of course academic success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to evaluate an innovative digital device (a smartphone application) to&#xD;
      accompany the child during homework periods.&#xD;
