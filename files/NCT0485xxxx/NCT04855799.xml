      This trial is being completed to learn about how Aquamin® affects gastrointestinal&#xD;
      permeability, or the control of material passing from inside the gastrointestinal tract&#xD;
      through the gut wall into the rest of the body, in people with ulcerative colitis (UC),&#xD;
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D), and in healthy individuals.&#xD;
