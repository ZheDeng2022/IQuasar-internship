             50 kg or more (45 kg or more for women) at the screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Those who do not have clinically significant congenital or chronic diseases and have&#xD;
             no pathological symptoms or findings upon medical examination at the screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Those who determined as suitable study subjects by the principal investigator (or a&#xD;
             delegated sub-investigator) in result of planned and conducted laboratory tests such&#xD;
             as hematology, blood chemistry, serum, and urine tests according to the&#xD;
             characteristics of the investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - 1) Those who have a clinically significant disease or have a history of such disease in&#xD;
        the digestive system, cardiovascular system, endocrine system, respiratory system,&#xD;

        system, musculoskeletal system, immune system, otorhinolaryngology, skin system and&#xD;
        ophthalmic system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2) Those who have a history of gastrointestinal surgery (except for simple appendectomy or&#xD;
        hernia surgery) that may affect the absorption of drugs or have gastrointestinal diseases&#xD;
        3) Those who have taken drugs that induce and inhibit metabolism enzymes such as barbital&#xD;
        drugs within 1 month of the first administration date, or have taken drugs that may&#xD;
        interfere with this clinical trial within 10 days of the first administration date.&#xD;
        (However, participation is possible depending on the characteristics of pharmacokinetics&#xD;
        and pharmacodynamics such as interactions with investigational products or half-life of&#xD;
        concomitant drugs) 4) Those who participated in other clinical trials or bioequivalence&#xD;
        studies and administered the investigational products within 6 months of the first&#xD;
        administration date.&#xD;
