  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute infection of the respiratory tract that&#xD;
      emerged in late 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In several studies, the cardinal signs of COVID-19 associated fever, cough, sputum and&#xD;
      dyspnea occurring in the first days of infection. In addition, myalgia was frequent&#xD;
      (14.9-32.3%) and digestive signs which may be inaugural were also reported, such as diarrhea&#xD;
      (3.8-5%) and nausea/vomiting (4-5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An increase in medical consultations for anosmia and ageusia without nasal obstruction has&#xD;
      also been reported in the context of the COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mild or non-existent symptoms, but also serious forms leading to death or a long stay in&#xD;
      intensive care, within a few months, the multiple clinical signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection were&#xD;
      identified. But, beyond the acute symptoms, doctors and patients are discovering a whole&#xD;
      range of disorders occurring more distantly, in hospitalized patients or not. In this context&#xD;
      of an emerging viral infection such as SARS-CoV-2, many unknowns are still present such as&#xD;
      the duration of symptoms or post-infectious sequelae in patients.&#xD;

      The scientific and medical world is mobilizing to accelerate the production of knowledge on&#xD;
      this virus, on the disease it causes as well as the means of curing and preventing it. But no&#xD;
      one yet knows how much it can cause immunological changes in the body. For some specialists,&#xD;
      this virus is even much more than a viral infection and causes a general disruption of the&#xD;
      immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Faced with the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers are a particularly exposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this research is to assess the presence of symptoms attributed to&#xD;
      COVID-19 at least 6 months after infection confirmed by RT-PCR test of healthcare workers.&#xD;
