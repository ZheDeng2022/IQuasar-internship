    <textblock>
      Specialized equipment is required to put pacemakers in the heart. This requires use of&#xD;
      radiation to see the wires or leads being implanted in the heart. Repeated radiation use can&#xD;
      result in permanent injury to the patient and to the doctor. The investigators aim to&#xD;
      investigate if they can use ultrasound to guide and help in the implantation of leads into&#xD;
      the heart. Ultrasound is a safe method and requires only a small handheld probe and a small&#xD;
      screen to see different structures in the heart. If ultrasounds proves successful as a tool&#xD;
      to reduce radiation then this would be very useful technical breakthrough. It would help&#xD;
      develop smaller centres where pacemakers can be implanted without purchasing xray equipment&#xD;
      and expensive setups.&#xD;

      Radiation quantity used in medicine is expanding year on year with increasing clinical uses&#xD;
      for medical illnesses and to visualize instruments being used during procedures such as&#xD;
      cardiac devices including pacemakers. The effects of radiation are not only on the patients&#xD;
      for their procedure but also a cumulative effect of radiation on the operators. The&#xD;
      stochastic effects of radiation have been well reported in the literature. Advancing&#xD;
      technologies such as 3-dimensional(3D) mapping systems have allowed for leads to be&#xD;
      identified using a 3D matrix and safely deployed to the myocardium. However, there are&#xD;
      significant costs associated with the use of 3D mapping systems resulting in this approach&#xD;
      not being widely adopted. Ultrasound use during implantation of cardiac implantable&#xD;
      electronic devices (CIED) has been utilized in the past to gain vascular access via the&#xD;
      axillary vein with good safety results. Experimental studies to visualize leads in the heart&#xD;
      and venous systems using 3D ultrasound showed optimism but has not translated to clinical use&#xD;
      due to lack of technology to improve the spatial and temporal resolution. The technology in&#xD;
      imaging resolution has improved over the last 5 years and likely can be used to visualize a&#xD;
      pacing lead in the heart. Techniques such as intravascular cardiac ultrasound have been used&#xD;
      to assist in implanting lead via coronary sinus in individuals who can have contrast&#xD;
      allergies. Therefore, transthoracic echocardiogram and ultrasound should be now of sufficient&#xD;
      quality to allow for successful pacemaker insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there has not been a feasibility study to evaluate complete ultrasound and&#xD;
      echocardiography-assisted pacemaker insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aim to utilize ultrasound and echocardiography to gain&#xD;
      vascular access and to direct the pacing lead into the right ventricle to allow for safe&#xD;
      pacemaker implantation. If this is successful, then this will allow for a larger study to be&#xD;
      conducted for single chamber devices including implantable cardioverter defibrillators.&#xD;
      Moreover, the investigators will be able to analyze the cost-effectiveness of this new&#xD;
      technique compared to the conventional technique of pacemaker implantation.&#xD;
