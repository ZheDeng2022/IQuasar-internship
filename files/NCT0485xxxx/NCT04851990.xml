      A randomised, parallel, pilot study to assess the safety and tolerability of long-term use of&#xD;
      patented transdermal patches in healthy adults. The study consists of 4 on-site visits: the&#xD;
      Screening Visit (Visit 1, Week -2), the Baseline Visit (Visit 2, Week 0), Visit 3 (Week 4),&#xD;
      and the End of Intervention Visit (Week 8).&#xD;
