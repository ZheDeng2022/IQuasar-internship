      500 patients will be prospectively recruited to undergo a fast breast MRI examination. The&#xD;
      women will be recruited for the study will meet the following criteria: 1. African American&#xD;
      2. negative DBT examination 11 months prior to recruitment 3. Heterogeneously and Extremely&#xD;
      breast densities 4. clinically asymptomatic- no palpable masses, focal thickening or&#xD;
      clinically significant discharge. Investigators will identify these patients EPIC database&#xD;
      utilizing the date of their last mammogram. Interested patients may contact our research&#xD;
      coordinators by the phone number provided in the recruitment materials. The study recruitment&#xD;
      information will also be shared with referring physicians. Physicians may also directly refer&#xD;
      patients to the study.&#xD;

      500 patients will be prospectively recruited to undergo an abbreviated or &quot;FAST&quot; breast MRI&#xD;
      examination. The women will be recruited for the study must meet the following criteria: 1.&#xD;
      African American 2. negative DBT examination no more than 11 months prior to the FAST MR 3.&#xD;
      Heterogeneously and Extremely breast densities as graded on their most recent mammogram 4.&#xD;
      clinically asymptomatic- no palpable masses, focal thickening or clinically significant&#xD;
      nipple discharge. Investigators will identify these women via the EPIC database utilizing the&#xD;
      date of their last mammogram. Interested women may contact our research coordinators by the&#xD;
      phone number provided in the recruitment materials. The study recruitment information will&#xD;
      also be shared with referring physicians. Physicians may also directly refer patients to the&#xD;
