  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate adenoma or benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) is a benign disease of the prostate&#xD;
      gland. It results in an increase in the volume of the prostate area located in contact with&#xD;
      the urethra. Compression of the prostatic urethra by the adenoma can cause lower urinary&#xD;
      tract disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The classic treatments in case of failure of medical treatment are endoscopic resection of&#xD;
      the prostate and adenomectomy, but these techniques are characterized by a significant&#xD;
      hemorrhagic risk that may require transfusions and prolonged hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimally invasive treatments with low morbidity have been developed to overcome these&#xD;
      drawbacks. They allow to propose a therapeutic solution adapted to patients: not tolerating&#xD;
      their medical treatment, wishing to keep antegrade ejaculation, elderly and/or frail, at risk&#xD;
      of bleeding, wishing an ambulatory treatment, refusing the conventional surgical techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Focal OneÂ® device was developed to treat prostate cancer using ultrasound energy. This&#xD;
      energy is delivered through a probe placed in your rectum. Connected to this probe, an&#xD;
      ultrasound machine will allow your doctor to see precisely which part of your prostate is&#xD;
      being treated. By heating the prostate tissue to a very high temperature in one treatment&#xD;
      session, the energy delivered will then destroy the tissue. Ultrasound guidance coupled with&#xD;
      the localized nature of the treatment allows the targeted area to be treated while respecting&#xD;
      the prostate tissue and structures adjacent to the prostate and thus reducing side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of prostate adenoma with HIFU would allow for localized destruction to reduce&#xD;
      prostate volume. The reduction of the compression of the prostatic urethra thus obtained&#xD;
      would allow an improvement of the urinary disorders. The treatment is performed transrectally&#xD;
      under real-time ultrasound control, which allows the adjacent structures to be respected,&#xD;
      thus preserving antegrade ejaculation and limiting the side effects.&#xD;
