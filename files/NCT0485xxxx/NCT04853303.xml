  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, sleep quality and pain are the common symptoms&#xD;
      experienced by children with cancer. These symptoms significantly devastate the children's&#xD;
      quality of life. Hypnosis is found to be effective in managing chemotherapy-induced nausea&#xD;
      and vomiting, sleep quality and pain in children with cancer. In addition, virtual reality is&#xD;
      shown to promote the effectiveness of hypnosis in managing these symptoms. However, no study&#xD;
      so far has examine it effectiveness in Hong Kong Chinese children with cancer. This study&#xD;
      aims to investigate the effectiveness in the use a virtual reality device to improve&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, sleep quality and pain among children with cancer&#xD;
      in Hong Kong.&#xD;

      This study is a randomized controlled trial. We recruit 180 children with cancer who are aged&#xD;
      9 to 18 and Chinese speaking and allocate them into experimental and control group. The&#xD;
      experimental group will receive a 15-minute hypnosis using virtual reality when they are&#xD;
      experiencing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, sleep quality or pain. The control&#xD;
      group will receive no intervention.&#xD;
