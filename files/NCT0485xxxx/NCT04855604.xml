      A cross-sectional study is expected to conducted by inquiring about the history, diagnosis&#xD;
      results and medication details of respiratory diseases of the outpatient pediatric patients&#xD;
      with respiratory diseases in the pediatric departments at specialist children's hospital at&#xD;
      the second class and above, general hospitals and maternal and child healthcare hospitals.&#xD;
      About 10,000 electronic questionnaires are expected to be collected in total, with about 100&#xD;
      participating hospitals and 100 electronic questionnaires from each participating&#xD;
      hospital.Diagnosis and treatment information of pediatric patients are expected to be&#xD;
      collected in the third week in April, July and October 2021 and in January 2022.&#xD;

      Respiratory diseases are easy-to-transmit among and are common in children, especially acute&#xD;
      respiratory infections in children which contribute to more than 60% of pediatric outpatient&#xD;
      cases. In pediatric internal medicine outpatient cases, trachitis/bronchitis, acute upper&#xD;
      respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, acute tonsillitis and asthma are the most common&#xD;
      diseases torturing pediatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children are prone to recurrent respiratory infections which may impose heavy burdens on&#xD;
      their families. Ten million children under 5 years old are killed by recurrent respiratory&#xD;
      infections every year. In China, daily outpatient visits of children with recurrent upper&#xD;
      respiratory tract infections account for 10%-20% of the total daily outpatient visits for&#xD;
      respiratory diseases. The outpatient medication for pediatric patients is found of&#xD;
      non-compliance issues. According to the data in 2014, more than 33.8% of pediatric patients&#xD;
      of all ages were given off-label medication, and more than 30% were given off-label&#xD;
      medication in treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be completed in 1 years with 10,000 participants taken from hospitals in&#xD;
      partnership with clinical research collaboration of National Clinical Research Center for&#xD;
      Respiratory Diseases, China, and analyze the status quo of diagnosis results and medication&#xD;
      details of respiratory diseases of the outpatient pediatric patients with respiratory&#xD;
      diseases in China.&#xD;
