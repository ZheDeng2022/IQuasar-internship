      Hypothesis 1: 18F-Fluciclovine PET/CT can correctly and easily identify the pancreatic&#xD;
      allograft and determine its viability&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Assess whether 18F-Fluciclovine can identify the pancreatic allograft accurately and&#xD;
      assess its viability and visibility&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: 18F-Fluciclovine PET/CT uptake in the pancreas (SUV) is related to total&#xD;
      pancreatic function and therefore can indicate whether the pancreatic allograft is at risk of&#xD;
      rejection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Assess whether 18F-Fluciclovine uptake in the pancreas can be a surrogate for&#xD;
      pancreatic function&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      18F-Fluciclovine is a synthetic L-leucine amino acid used clinically for PET imaging in&#xD;
      patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer following definitive therapy. The&#xD;
      pancreas accumulates striking amounts of Axumin, where it is considered a normal finding.&#xD;
      Pancreatic beta-cell function may be slow to recover following pancreatic transplantation and&#xD;
      may vary as a function of perioperative steroid administration, acute rejection, inadequate&#xD;
      islet cell transplantation, allograft pancreatitis or compromised blood supply. The viability&#xD;
      of the allograft is a common clinical concern and is difficult to assess based on insulin,&#xD;
      C-peptide, and blood sugar levels. Rapid identification of compromised allograft viability is&#xD;
      critical in the management of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pancreas transplants are usually assessed via ultrasound as a first-line modality. However,&#xD;
      visualization is largely obscured due to the intraperitoneal location of the transplant.&#xD;
      There is often overlying gas and due to the depth of the transplant, there is poor&#xD;
      visualization with ultrasound. Additionally, the transplant lacks a capsule&#xD;
&#xD;
      which results in its being ill-defined and difficult to distinguish from adjacent structures.&#xD;
      Computed tomography can also be used to assess pancreas transplants, however, most transplant&#xD;
      patients often have concurrent renal transplants which limits the use of intravenous&#xD;
      iodinated contrast. On non-contrast CT, it can be difficult to assess and distinguish the&#xD;
      pancreas transplant from the adjacent bowel. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can be useful&#xD;
      and has better soft-tissue contrast compared to CT. However, it has a similar issue with&#xD;
      regards to limited intravenous gadolinium contrast administration due to concurrent renal&#xD;
      transplant in this group of patients. In all three modalities, there is no functional&#xD;
      assessment of the allograft and whether there is still appropriate pancreatic function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the reason for our proposed study, given that 18F-Fluciclovine is readily taken up by&#xD;
      the pancreas and it would help radiologists readily identify where the allograft is located,&#xD;
      whether it is viable, and whether there is a normal function of the allograft. It should be&#xD;
      noted that leucine serves both as a fuel, as well as in a regulatory capacity for pancreatic&#xD;
      beta-cell function. However, uptake of 18F-Fluciclovine in the pancreas is not likely to be&#xD;
      specific for beta-cell function since acinar cell function requires L-amino acids. However,&#xD;
      overall pancreatic viability is relevant to both acinar cell and beta-cell function.&#xD;

    <description>Initial normal standardized uptake values (SUV) of the pancreas, liver, and blood pool will be obtained from 50archived previous 18F-Fluciclovine studies, as there are no normal ranges in the literature. This will be done by retrospective medical record review after a waiver of consent/authorization is obtained from the local IRB.&#xD;
Informed consent will be obtained from 10 patients with pancreatic allografts, and each will undergo an 18F-Fluciclovine study. These patients will not be suspected of having current rejection or allograft dysfunction. Timing of 18F-Fluciclovine PET/CT scans will be planned to coincide with standard-of-care imaging studies and laboratory tests.&#xD;
The 18F-Fluciclovine study will be compared with the patients' standard-standard-of-care US and/or CT with the assessment of ease of visualization of the pancreatic allograft.</description>
