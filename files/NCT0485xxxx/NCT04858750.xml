  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Indwelling double-J ureteral stent (D-J stent) are routinely placed in patients who received&#xD;
      ureteroscopic lithotripsy (URL) in Xinhua Hospital Urology Department. At present, three&#xD;
      types of D-J stents, namely Cook/Kang Yi Bo(KYB)/Urovisionare are used, and usually removed&#xD;
      in the day ward four weeks after surgery. This study intends to randomly divide patients with&#xD;
      urolithiasis based on the preoperative OABSS (overactive bladder symptom score) questionnaire&#xD;
      into three groups, namely Cook D-J stent group, KYB anti-reflux D-J stent group, Urovision&#xD;
      trigonal D-J stent group, with corresponding D-J stent indwelled for 4 weeks respectively.&#xD;
      The patient's USSQ ureteral stent symptom questionnaire）scale and OABSS scale were collected&#xD;
      at 1 week, 4 weeks (before the removal of D-J stents), and 5 weeks (1 week after removal of&#xD;
      D-J stents) after URL operation, and the D-J stents removed from the patients were collected,&#xD;
      and their drainage and anti-reflux effects were measured in vitro.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. In general, the heart, lung, liver and kidney function are in well condition, able to&#xD;
             tolerate surgical treatment, and comply with research requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Before the onset of urolithiasis, the patient has suffered from obvious overactive&#xD;
             bladder syndrome, or chronic lower urinary tract infection, or urinary anatomic&#xD;
             deformities, or had previously undergone urinary tract plastic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Other severe complications, infections, etc. that the researchers believe may make the&#xD;
             subject unsuitable for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The patient is not a local resident and insists on returning to his howetown for D-J&#xD;
             stent removal after the URL operation（so that we are unable to retrieve the D-J stent&#xD;
             and conduct the in vitro experiment）.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The patient refuses to sign the informed consent.&#xD;
