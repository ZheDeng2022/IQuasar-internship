  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research aims to evaluate the effects of a cognitive reeducation carried out with the&#xD;
      COVIRTUA Cognition software using a virtual environment, on real-life execution of activities&#xD;
      of daily living (ADL) for patients with post-stroke dysexecutive disorders. We will assess&#xD;
      patients' performances in achieving ADLs by the Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) throughout the&#xD;
      follow-up (3 months), based on the goals set at the beginning of management with each&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many post-stroke patients, especially those with frontal lobe lesions, have chronic&#xD;
      impairments in mental flexibility, leading to difficulties in decision-making, action&#xD;
      planning, or behavioural perseverance. Techniques for remediation of these dysexecutive&#xD;
      disorders are often performed in a hospital or in a liberal office. The possible progress&#xD;
      resulting from this rehabilitation is rarely transposed into the patient daily life&#xD;
      performances, executed in a richer and less controlled environment than the usual place of&#xD;
      re-educational. Here, we wish to assess the effective benefits (i.e. in carrying out the&#xD;
      activities of daily living) of a computerized rehabilitation program addressing executive&#xD;
      functions and based on virtual reality, simulating ADLs. We use in this study a multiple&#xD;
      baseline single case experimental design (AB design with a follow-up beyond), including for&#xD;
      each patient: pretreatment (phase A), treatment (phase B), and follow-up phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pretreatment includes a routine sensitivomotor neurological rehabilitation program that&#xD;
      doesn't specifically target executive functions in daily living activities (3 to 5 weeks&#xD;
      depending on randomization). Treatment consists in a 4 weeks virtual reality cognitive&#xD;
      training program, including four 45-minute sessions per week with an occupational therapist&#xD;
      for cognitive rehabilitation in a virtual environment with the COVIRTUA Cognition software.&#xD;
      The follow-up phase (5 to 3 weeks depending on randomization) includes no support for&#xD;
      executive functions, either in a rehabilitation centre or in a liberal office.&#xD;

    <description>Performance in carrying out activities of daily living will be evaluated in an ecological situation using Kiresuk and Sherman's 'Goal Attainment Scaling' (GAS) method. The individual goals to be achieved and performance levels of the GAS will be determined at inclusion, and evaluated twice a week during the three phases (A, B and follow-up phase). The primary outcome will be the evolution of the GAS score evaluated twice a week during 3 months.</description>
