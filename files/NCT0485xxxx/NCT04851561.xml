  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: COVID-19 is consistently spreading throughout the world, and the number of&#xD;
      recovered patients is steadily increasing. Accordingly, a significant number of individuals&#xD;
      will develop persisting post-COVID symptoms, while many of them will report on lasting&#xD;
      fatigue. The main objective of the current study is to assess risk factors for the&#xD;
      development of post-COVID-19 fatigue symptoms. As a secondary aim, the current study is&#xD;
      intended to identify pathophysiology and explanatory mechanisms for the post-COVID-19&#xD;
      fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and population: a nested case-control study will be conducted at Rabin Medical&#xD;
      Center (RMC), Beilinson Hospital. RMC runs a post-COVID-19 clinic for adult (age ≥18 years)&#xD;
      recovered individuals (diagnosed using a polymerase chain reaction test from a nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      sample), who are invited for a comprehensive medical evaluation. During a visit, all&#xD;
      individuals undergo pulmonary function testing and an evaluation by an infectious diseases&#xD;
      physician, a pulmonologist, and a social worker. The cohort of recovered COVID-19 individuals&#xD;
      evaluated at RMC will serve as the population from which the current study participants will&#xD;
      be consecutively sampled. The cases would be defined as such if report on lasting fatigue&#xD;
      symptoms which appeared following COVID-19, while at least two months have elapsed since&#xD;
      COVID-19 diagnosis and the lasting fatigue symptoms are present for at least six weeks. The&#xD;
      controls would be defined as those that did not report on fatigue symptoms at any time point&#xD;
      since one month following their diagnosis with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation protocol of cases and controls: All participating individuals (cases and controls)&#xD;
      will be assessed following the study protocol. The assessment will be conducted as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First assessment meeting (approximately one hour long) in which the participant will undergo&#xD;
      physical examination and blood tests, fill the study questionnaires [demographic, clinical&#xD;
      and post-COVID fatigue questionnaire; sleep assessment questionnaires (Epworth sleepiness&#xD;
      score [ESS], Pittsburg sleep quality index [PSQI], Insomnia severity index (ISI)]) and&#xD;
      depression severity questionnaire (the patient health questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]), and conduct&#xD;
      cognitive fatigue task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second assessment meeting: (approximately one hour long) in which the participants will&#xD;
      undergo a cardiopulmonary stress test (CPET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: The main dependent variable will be the presence of continuing fatigue&#xD;
      symptoms. The independent variables included demographic and clinical characteristics. The&#xD;
      demographic variables will include: age at diagnosis, sex, marital status and number of&#xD;
      children, occupational status (employed, unemployed, or retired), education (number of years&#xD;
      at school and higher education), and occupation. The clinical variables will include: smoking&#xD;
      status, alcohol and cannabis consumption, basic physical function (independent, limited in&#xD;
      certain activities, dependent in activities of daily living, or bedridden), background&#xD;
      illnesses, and pharmacotherapy. The acute COVID-19 history will be also collected: disease&#xD;
      severity according to the WHO criteria, symptoms (sore throat, nasal congestion, headache&#xD;
      anosmia/disguesia, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and&#xD;
      myalgia), need for hospitalization, hospital complications (veno-thromboembolism,&#xD;
      super-imposed bacterial infections), for individuals who were not hospitalized - the site of&#xD;
      isolation (home, hotel or another isolation facility) will be collected, time from onset to&#xD;
      symptoms resolution, pharmacotherapy directed at COVID-19, and information of other household&#xD;
      or family members who were also diagnosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods: Demographic and clinical variables of the patients with fatigue symptoms&#xD;
      (cases) and control group (free from fatigue symptoms) will be compared using bivariate and&#xD;
      multivariable conditional logistic regression models. Independent variables will be selected&#xD;
      to be included in the multivariable model based on the bivariate analysis. Odds ratios and&#xD;
      95% confidence intervals will be obtained from the conditional logistic regression models.&#xD;
      P&lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation: Disease severity may serve as a potential risk factor for the&#xD;
      development of lasting fatigue symptoms. A preliminary analysis revealed that in our cohort&#xD;
      of recovered COVID-19 patients, 20% were hospitalized due to their disease's severity. We&#xD;
      will therefore assume that the proportions of individuals required hospitalization during the&#xD;
      acute phase were 30% and 10% of the cases and controls, respectively. It is also likely that&#xD;
      approximately two thirds of our sample would report on persisting fatigue. Under these&#xD;
      assumptions, a sample size of 153 individuals (102 in the cases group and 51 in the control&#xD;
      group) will yield a statistical power of 80% at a significance level of 5% for detecting a&#xD;
      difference of 0.2 between two proportions.&#xD;

      The evaluation of both cases and controls will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination: a comprehensive physical examination, including neurological&#xD;
           assessment of motor function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests: complete blood count, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate,&#xD;
           thyroid functions (TSH, fT3, fT4), kidney and liver functions, creatine phosphokinase,&#xD;
           serum electrolytes, Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus serology testing, ferritin,&#xD;
           and serum vitamin B12 and folate levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep assessment: in order to estimate the quality and characteristics of sleep, the&#xD;
           participating individuals will independently fill the following sleep assessment&#xD;
           questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Epworth sleepiness score (ESS) - to generally evaluate subjective sleepiness (was&#xD;
                validated in Hebrew).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pittsburg sleep quality index (PSQI) - to evaluate the quality of sleep (was&#xD;
                validated in Hebrew).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Insomnia severity index (ISI) - to evaluate insomnia (a Hebrew version exists, but&#xD;
                the questionnaire is yet to be validated).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depression severity questionnaire: in order to screen for depression and to estimate the&#xD;
           degree of depression severity, the participating individuals will independently fill the&#xD;
           patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fatigue classification tool&#xD;
&#xD;
      For chronic fatigue syndrome, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) adopted&#xD;
      the clinical case definition suggested by the Institute of Medicine (IOM), and consolidated&#xD;
      criteria. We adopted the portion on fatigue from the CDC criteria for chronic fatigue&#xD;
      syndrome, and modified it to suit for the time frame and relations with COVID-19:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient has a substantial reduction or impairment in the ability to engage in pre-illness&#xD;
      levels of occupational, educational, social, or personal activities that persists for &gt;6&#xD;
      weeks and is accompanied by fatigue, which is often profound, is of new onset (appeared after&#xD;
      the diagnosis of COVID-19), is not the result of ongoing excessive exertion, and is not&#xD;
      substantially alleviated by rest. These symptoms are present at least half of the day time,&#xD;
      to at least a moderately severe degree.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will independently fill a designated form in which the aforementioned&#xD;
      criteria will be mentioned, followed by to statement from which the participant will circle&#xD;
      the one relevant for him:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The criteria above accurately describe my current situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The criteria above do not accurately reflect my current situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Assessment of exercise physiology: All participants will undergo a cardiopulmonary&#xD;
                stress test (CPET), under the guidance of sports and exercise physicians and&#xD;
                nursing staff. Electrocardiogram, spirometry, blood pressure and gas exchange&#xD;
                measuring will be assessed at rest. The participants will then undergo CPET&#xD;
                according to a modified Astrand treadmill test protocol. The test will be&#xD;
                terminated at maximal exercise or upon the appearance of limiting symptoms .&#xD;
                Continuous electrocardiogram and repeated blood pressure measuring will be&#xD;
                conducted at the recovery phase. Post-exercise spirometry will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Assessment of cognitive fatigue: in order to assess cognitive fatigue, all&#xD;
                participants will undergo the visual vigilance test. This test, that was designed&#xD;
                to be a measure of sustained attention, was previously implemented in individuals&#xD;
                with multiple sclerosis. This test will be conducted in a designated room in which&#xD;
                the participants will seat in front of a computer, and will independently conduct&#xD;
                the task after being instructed by the primary investigator or one of the&#xD;
                sub-investigators. During the task, the different alphabetical letters will be&#xD;
                screened at a rate of 500 milliseconds per each. The tested individual will be&#xD;
                instructed to press the space button whenever two specific letters (i.e. the target&#xD;
                letters) are presented. A total of 600 letters will be screened, of which 120 will&#xD;
                be the target letters. The test is to be repeated 3 times, 5 minutes for each run.&#xD;
                The percentage of correct presses, the number of errors and the mean reaction time&#xD;
                will be evaluated for each time period.&#xD;
