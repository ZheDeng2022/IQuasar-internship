  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 1937, Albert Szent-Gyorgyi received a Nobel Prize for discovering vitamin C and&#xD;
      flavonoids, as well as for exploring their biochemical properties. Originally, he gave the&#xD;
      flavonoids the name &quot;vitamin P&quot; because of their effectiveness in reducing the permeability&#xD;
      of blood vessels. This name was abandoned when it was realized that these substances were not&#xD;
      really vitamins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quercetin is extracted from a variety of plant sources, including the onion peel and the&#xD;
      seeds and pods of Dimorphandra mollis, a legume tree native to South America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although we are far from knowing everything about quercetin, its antioxidant,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory, and antihistamine (antiallergic) properties have been observed in numerous&#xD;
      in vitro and animal studies.&#xD;
