    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to investigate the metabolic effects of whey protein (whey&#xD;
      protein isolate, WPI, (LacprodanÂ® ISO.Water. from Arla Foods Ingredients) compared with&#xD;
      placebo when consumed by women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) from diagnosis&#xD;
      (around gestational week 28) to delivery. Any changes in substrate metabolism and energy&#xD;
      expenditure using indirect calorimetry will also be investigated. Differences in hunger and&#xD;
      satiety parameters as well as blood pressure and gestational weight gain will also be&#xD;
      assessed. Furthermore, analysis on the glucose response when the women consume the&#xD;
      intervention (whey or placebo) at home in their own environment 30 minutes before breakfast&#xD;
      at time of diagnosis (earliest week 28) and week 36 (four days following each time point)&#xD;
      will be made. The women will be monitored with continuous glucose monitors, activity monitors&#xD;
      and all meals will be provided for two days following the study days in the laboratory. At&#xD;
      delivery cord blood will be sampled for analysis on metabolic parameters and investigations&#xD;
      on epigenetics/DNA methylations. Complications to the delivery, neonatal outcomes,&#xD;
      anthropometrics of the child will also be assessed. Breast milk composition will also be&#xD;
      analyzed.&#xD;
