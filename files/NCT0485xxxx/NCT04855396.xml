  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are no therapeutic agents that have been shown to improve outcomes from severe&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury (TBI). Critical barriers to progress in developing treatments for&#xD;
      severe TBI are the lack of: 1) monitoring biomarkers for assessing individual patient&#xD;
      response to treatment; 2) predictive biomarkers for identifying patients likely to benefit&#xD;
      from a promising intervention. Currently, clinical examination remains the fundamental tool&#xD;
      for monitoring severe TBI patients and for subject selection in clinical trials. However,&#xD;
      these patients are typically intubated and sedated, limiting the utility of clinical&#xD;
      examinations. Validated monitoring and predictive biomarkers will allow titration of the dose&#xD;
      of promising therapeutics to individual subject response, as well as make clinical trials&#xD;
      more efficient by enabling the enrollment of subjects likely to benefit. Glial fibrillary&#xD;
      acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light chain (NfL) and high sensitivity c-reactive&#xD;
      protein (hsCRP) are promising biomarkers that may be useful as 1) monitoring biomarkers; 2)&#xD;
      predictive biomarkers in severe TBI trials. Although the biological rationale supporting&#xD;
      their use is strong, significant knowledge gaps remain. To address these gaps in knowledge,&#xD;
      we propose an ancillary observational study leveraging an ongoing severe TBI clinical trial&#xD;
      that is not funded to collect biospecimen. The Hyperbaric Oxygen in Brain Injury Treatment&#xD;
      (HOBIT) trial, a phase II randomized control clinical trial that seeks to determine the dose&#xD;
      of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) that that has the highest likelihood of demonstrating&#xD;
      efficacy in a phase III trial. The proposed study will: 1) validate the accuracy of candidate&#xD;
      monitoring biomarkers for predicting clinical outcome; 2) determine the treatment effect of&#xD;
      different doses of HBOT on candidate monitoring biomarkers; and 3) determine whether there is&#xD;
      a biomarker defined subset of severe TBI that responds favorably to HBOT. This proposal will:&#xD;
      1) inform a go/no-go decision for a phase III trial of HBOT by providing adjunctive evidence&#xD;
      of the effect of HBOT on key biological pathways through which HBOT is hypothesized to affect&#xD;
      outcome; 2) provide evidence to support further study of the first monitoring biomarkers of&#xD;
      severe TBI; 3) increase the likelihood of success of a phase III trial by identifying the&#xD;
      sub-population of severe TBI likely to benefit from HBOT; 4) create a repository of TBI&#xD;
      biospecimen which may be accessed by other investigators.&#xD;

      The Investigators will obtain an initial set of biospecimens (serum, plasma, CSF, DNA) as&#xD;
      soon as feasible after randomization to a HOBIT study arm, but no later than 24 hours from&#xD;
      injury. Subsequent biospecimens will be obtained every 8 hours (+/- 1 hour) for the first 24&#xD;
      hours post-enrollment. This will allow the characterization of acute changes in biomarker&#xD;
      levels. On study days 2, 3, 5, 7 and 14 biospecimens will be obtained once a day to allow&#xD;
      characterization of sub-acute changes in biomarker levels. If feasible, samples should be&#xD;
      collected at 8am (+/- 2 hours) to minimize the effects of circadian rhythm on biomarker&#xD;
      levels. In addition, during the first 5 days of the study, one set of biospecimen will be&#xD;
      collected 4 hours after HBO treatment to examine the acute effects of HBO treatment on&#xD;
      biomarkers. This will not apply to those randomized to non-HBOT groups. During the 6-month&#xD;
      visit, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of blood will be collected. In addition, for subjects who have an&#xD;
      external ventricular drain in place, 5 cc of CSF will be collected at each time point if&#xD;
      feasible. Since subjects are unlikely to have an EVD after the first week post-injury, CSF&#xD;
      samples will be collected only for as long as the EVD is in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BioHOBIT will utilize data collected in the HOBIT trial. This data includes: demographic data&#xD;
      and clinical data such as injury characteristics, vital signs, head CT findings, laboratory&#xD;
      data and data on physiologic parameters such as intracranial pressure (ICP), partial pressure&#xD;
      of brain tissue oxygen (PbtO2), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and cerebral perfusion pressure&#xD;
      (CPP), among others.&#xD;
