  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre open label phase II study evaluating the effect of lenvatinib&#xD;
      treatment for restoring radioiodine uptake and retention in radioiodine-refractory (RAI-R)&#xD;
      thyroid cancer to warrant I-131 therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RAI-R DTC patients starting standard-of-care lenvatinib treatment will be included in this&#xD;
      study. Prior to lenvatinib treatment, patients will undergo I-124 PET/CT to quantify RAI&#xD;
      uptake and retention at baseline. The first half of the intended sample size (cohort 1) will&#xD;
      be treated with lenvatinib for a total of 12 weeks. After 6- and 12-week treatment, patients&#xD;
      will undergo I-124 PET/CT dosimetry to evaluate the redifferentiation effect, assess expected&#xD;
      absorbed lesion doses and maximum tolerable activity. Results between 6- and 12-week&#xD;
      lenvatinib treatment will be compared to select the lenvatinib treatment duration that leads&#xD;
      to highest extent of redifferentiation. The next patients (cohort 2) will then receive&#xD;
      lenvatinib for either 6 or 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo subsequent I-131 therapy if a clinically meaningful lesion dose is&#xD;
      expected and toxicity is deemed acceptable. For all patients eligible for I-131 therapy,&#xD;
      lenvatinib is discontinued prior to administration of I-131 and intra-therapeutic I-131 SPECT&#xD;
      dosimetry will be performed for dose verification. Patients who are not eligible for I-131&#xD;
      therapy, will continue lenvatinib treatment at the discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsies are performed at baseline and after 6-week lenvatinib treatment to evaluate&#xD;
      alterations at the transcriptional and translational level in biopted tumor lesions. Patients&#xD;
      will be followed up according to current guidelines for a total of 9 months after initiating&#xD;
      lenvatinib treatment. Metabolic and biochemical response will be assessed using F-18 FDG&#xD;
      PET/CT and Tg levels, respectively.&#xD;
