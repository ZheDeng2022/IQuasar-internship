    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm longitudinal group to examine patient-reported outcomes, body mass and&#xD;
      mammographic density changes pre- and post- weight loss intervention of breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors using video conferencing telehealth visits.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will receive weekly group sessions of lifestyle counseling for the first 20&#xD;
      weeks, followed by every other week sessions in weeks 22 and 24, for a total of 6 months of&#xD;
      intervention. These group sessions, with 6 participants per group, will be delivered&#xD;
      virtually via a HIPAA Compliant Teleconference Platform. The expected number of participants&#xD;
      is at least 2 and no more than 6 in this 90-min group sessions which will be provided by a&#xD;
      counselor from Penn Center for Weight and Eating Disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The content of the sessions addresses the domains associated with behavioral weight&#xD;
      management, including nutrition, exercise, stress and emotion management, and lifestyle&#xD;
      modification strategies (to improve adherence to the diet and activity plan). Participants&#xD;
      will monitor energy intake and physical activity daily to help them achieve recommended&#xD;
      calorie and activity goals. Self-monitoring will be encouraged online with MyFitnessPal.com,&#xD;
      which will be shared with the study staff to increase accountability and provide opportunity&#xD;
      for feedback to participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will also be mailed a digital scale so they can weigh themselves each week&#xD;
      and report their weight to the group leader. Participants will be encouraged to start with at&#xD;
      least 10 minutes of moderately vigorous physical activity (e.g., brisk walking, swimming), at&#xD;
      least five days per week, building up to at least 30 minutes per day (150 minutes per week)&#xD;
      by week 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess feasibility and acceptance of telehealth weight loss&#xD;
      intervention by the participants. The participants will be asked to complete the following&#xD;
      surveys at two time points: baseline (pre-) and treatment end (at week 24). The participants&#xD;
      will complete the following psychosocial measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. City of Hope Quality of Life (COH-QOL) Instrument - Breast Cancer Patient (QOL-BC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) Short Form - that assess the&#xD;
           types and intensity of physical activity and sitting time in which people routinely&#xD;
           engage. It provides an estimate of total physical activity in MET-min/week and time&#xD;
           spent sitting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) (Depression)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Acceptability of Intervention Measure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, investigators will conduct an exit interview with each participant to assess the&#xD;
      acceptability of the intervention, the delivery of the intervention via telehealth, and the&#xD;
      patients' satisfaction with their treatment outcomes. Investigators will also solicit&#xD;
      suggestions for improvements to the program for future interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to measure changes from pre- to post weight-loss intervention&#xD;
      for 1) body mass and 2) mammographic breast density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess body mass changes, weight will be reported at baseline and after week 24 of the&#xD;
      intervention. The scale will be mailed to participants at the beginning of the study.&#xD;
      Participants' height from the electronic medical record will be used. Percent weight loss&#xD;
      will be calculated to assess weight change across participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess mammographic breast density changes, investigators will measure mammographic&#xD;
      density of annual mammogram pre- and post weight-loss program. Annual mammograms are&#xD;
      routinely performed for breast cancer survivors except for those who have had bilateral&#xD;
      mastectomy. Two annual mammograms will be used to measure mammographic density. The annual&#xD;
      mammogram performed between 1 month - 12 months prior to weight loss program initiation will&#xD;
      be used as baseline (pre-intervention). The post-intervention mammogram will be the first&#xD;
      annual mammogram performed after weight loss program. If routine annual mammogram occurs&#xD;
      during the 20-week weight loss program, then the next annual mammogram will be used for&#xD;
      breast density assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, study duration for each participant from enrollment to completion (mammographic&#xD;
      density) is estimated to be up to 24 months.&#xD;

    <description>To assess mammographic breast density changes, investigators will measure mammographic density of annual mammogram pre- and post-weight-loss program. Quantitative MBD will be analyzed using LIBRA, which is a fully-automated, free, and publicly available program that estimates MBD. Following digital segmentation, the LIBRA software analysis provides breast area, absolute dense area, and area percent density for each image of a mammographic study. Mean breast area (cm^2), mean dense area (cm^2), and quantitative MBD (%) will be calculated for each mammographic study as described.</description>
