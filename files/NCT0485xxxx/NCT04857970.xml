  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Routine electronic monitoring of health-related quality of life (REMOQOL) consists of&#xD;
      collecting HRQoL patients' data via an electronic device in order to provide these data to&#xD;
      healthcare providers. Collected data could be used by professionals to personalize care&#xD;
      through for instance, orientation towards personalized supportive care; assessment of&#xD;
      toxicities related to treatments or adapted treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of REMOQOL on the care relationship in&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are naïve&#xD;
      for systemic treatment. To do this, the investigators want to conduct a randomized trial at&#xD;
      the Besançon University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several teams are collaborating on this project: Methodology and Quality of Life Unit in&#xD;
      Oncology (UMQVC), pneumonology and medical oncology services of the Besançon University&#xD;
      Hospital and psychology laboratories of Franche-Comté and Burgundy Universities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The original aspects of this research are the particular interest in the care relationship&#xD;
      between physicians and patients, also taking an interest in the physician's experience, the&#xD;
      strong collaboration with researchers in psychology, the use of mixed quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative analysis techniques as well as the design of randomized study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      REMOQOL-Poumon is an interventional, prospective, randomized study, conducted in Besançon&#xD;
      University Hospital. Patients are randomized whether in the experimental arm or in the&#xD;
      control arm. Intervention in experimental arm consists of administration of HRQoL&#xD;
      questionnaires (QLQ-C30 &amp; QLQ-LC13) using the CHES software (Computer-based Health Evaluation&#xD;
      System) and presentation of the HRQoL scores to physicians via colored graphics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In control arm, HRQoL questionnaires (QLQ-C30+LC13) are administered in a paper-pencil way,&#xD;
      without transmission of results to physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed for four encounters with HRQoL collection. The primary outcome,&#xD;
      measured with the AREP questionnaire, is assessed after those four encounters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the follow-up, a semi-structured interview with a researcher in psychology and&#xD;
      concerning the care relationship is proposed to a sub-cohort of patients (around ten patients&#xD;
      in each arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each encounter, physicians are asked to answer a questionnaire on viewing and use of&#xD;
      HRQoL scores. Every physician will be interviewed on care relationship by a researcher in&#xD;
      psychology.&#xD;
