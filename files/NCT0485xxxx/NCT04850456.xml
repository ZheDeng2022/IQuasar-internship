  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The inflammatory storm in critically ill patients releases cytokines, causing systemic immune&#xD;
      damage, which may be an important cause of multiple organ failure and even death.&#xD;
      Inflammatory storms exacerbate the deterioration of the disease in those children. Gamma&#xD;
      globulin may be an effective option to control inflammatory storms. However, this preliminary&#xD;
      result needs to be verified from reliable and representative RCTs. In our study, we conducted&#xD;
      a retrospective study on the use of gamma globulin and an unused control group. At present,&#xD;
      the indications of IVIG are mainly focused on the neuromuscular system and the blood system.&#xD;
      We hope to establish a more appropriate and operable evaluation table for the suitability of&#xD;
      gamma globulin for clinical use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In severe infective patients who survive the initial inflammatory storm, the immune response&#xD;
      often evolves toward a state of immunosuppression, which contributes to increased mortality&#xD;
      and severe secondary hospital-acquired infections. However, the role of gamma globulin&#xD;
      therapy in patients with severe infection including sepsis and septic shock is discussed&#xD;
      controversially. We intend to retrospectively analyze the efficacy and application evaluation&#xD;
      of gamma globulin in severely infected children hospitalized in the intensive care unit.&#xD;
      Clinical and demographic data, as well as treatment outcome will be collected from the&#xD;
      electronic health record. It is expected to provide evaluation basis for clinicians to&#xD;
      formulate treatment plans and clinical pharmacists for special comments on the clinical use&#xD;
      of gamma globulin.&#xD;
