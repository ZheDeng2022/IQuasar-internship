      This is a prospective cohort study comparing the novel FDA-approved oral GnRH antagonist&#xD;
      ORIAHNN (elagolix, estradiol, and norethindrone acetate capsules; elagolix capsules) to&#xD;
      uterine artery embolization (UAE) or myomectomy (abdominal, laparoscopic, or hysteroscopic)&#xD;
      for treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding due to leiomyomas. Uterine leiomyomas, also called&#xD;
      fibroids, are hormone-dependent growths in the uterine muscle that are common in&#xD;
      reproductive-age women (1). Leiomyomas can often lead to heavy menstrual bleeding. Definitive&#xD;
      treatment for abnormal uterine bleeding due to leiomyomas is hysterectomy, but for patients&#xD;
      who desire uterine conservation, a variety of treatment options exist. Regulation of menses&#xD;
      with combined oral contraceptives or progestin only oral formulations are generally&#xD;
      considered first line treatment but are not curative or effective for many patients. Another&#xD;
      treatment option is a myomectomy, which is the surgical resection or removal of myomas.&#xD;
      Myomectomy can be performed via hysteroscopy or laparoscopy, or by a vaginal or an abdominal&#xD;
      approach. The route of removal depends on myoma location and patient symptoms. Another&#xD;
      treatment option is Uterine fibroid or uterine artery embolization (UFE/UAE). UAE is a&#xD;
      minimally invasive procedure where permanent particles are delivered to and block/embolize&#xD;
      the blood supply to the myoma via a fluoroscopy directed arterial catheter. This typically&#xD;
      leads to a decrease in fibroid size and associated bleeding (2). ORIAHNN, an oral GnRH&#xD;
      antagonist that was FDA-approved in 2020, has demonstrated significant decrease in&#xD;
      myoma-associated heavy menstrual bleeding compared to placebo (1) but has not been compared&#xD;
      to other standard of care interventions. The primary objective of this study is to compare&#xD;
      this novel medication to the common AUB-L treatments UAE and Myomectomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uterine fibroids, or leiomyomas, are common benign tumors in reproductive-age women. While&#xD;
      many women with fibroids are asymptomatic, 20-50% of women may have bulk symptoms, such as&#xD;
      pelvic pressure, urinary or gastrointestinal symptoms, and/or heavy menstrual bleeding (3-4).&#xD;
      Heavy menstrual bleeding can lead to severe anemia requiring treatment, which has negative&#xD;
      health and economic consequences (4). Fibroids are also associated with infertility and&#xD;
      recurrent pregnancy loss (3). Symptom character and severity depend on fibroid size and&#xD;
      location, and they can have a significant effect on women's quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibroid growth is dependent on estrogen and progesterone, thus common medical management of&#xD;
      symptoms uses hormonal agents, such as oral contraceptives, selective progesterone receptor&#xD;
      modulators, GnRH agonists, and intrauterine devices (3). Nonhormonal medical methods include&#xD;
      tranexamic acid, an antifibrinolytic agent that reduces menstrual blood loss, and&#xD;
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which reduce blood loss and improve pain relief (3).&#xD;
      Medical management is generally the first treatment strategy for symptomatic fibroids, but&#xD;
      definitive treatment is via a hysterectomy. A hysterectomy is the most common surgical&#xD;
      treatment of fibroids, but for women who desire to preserve the uterus, other surgical&#xD;
      options are available (4, 5). A myomectomy removes fibroids employing either hysteroscopic,&#xD;
      laparoscopic, abdominal approaches, or a combination of these methods. Another option for&#xD;
      fibroid management is uterine fibroid or uterine artery embolization (UFE/UAE). This&#xD;
      minimally invasive procedure uses a catheter to inject permanent particles inside uterine&#xD;
      arteries to occlude the blood supply to the fibroid(s). Both myomectomy and UAE have high&#xD;
      patient satisfaction rates. Both modalities also carry the risk of necessitating future&#xD;
      interventions if symptoms are not controlled or if fibroids recur (5). Patients who undergo&#xD;
      UAE have a slightly higher risk of further interventions compared to myomectomy (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For women who do not desire any type of surgical intervention or the UAE procedure, a new&#xD;
      type of medical treatment has become available. Oriahnn, produced by AbbVie, is a combination&#xD;
      of elagolix, an oral nonpeptide GnRH antagonist, and add-back therapy with estradiol and&#xD;
      norethindrone (1, 4). It is administered at a total daily dose of 600mg: 300mg elagolix with&#xD;
      add-back therapy in the morning and 300mg elagolix alone at night (4). Elagolix results in&#xD;
      rapid, reversible suppression of gonadotrophin and ovarian sex hormones, and was first&#xD;
      approved for treatment of endometriosis-associated pain (4). The side effects of elagolix are&#xD;
      related to the creation of the hypoestrogenic state and are mitigated with add-back therapy&#xD;
      (4). The dose and formula in Oriahnn showed a significant decrease in menstrual blood loss&#xD;
      compared to placebo with a favorable safety profile but has never been compared to any other&#xD;
      treatment for fibroids (4). It is FDA-approved for a treatment duration of 24 months (1).&#xD;
