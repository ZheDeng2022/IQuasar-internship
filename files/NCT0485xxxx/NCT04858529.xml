  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The neoCARHP study was a randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase III, neoadjuvant trial.&#xD;
      This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      docetaxel/carboplatin/trastuzumab/pertuzumab (TCHP) with docetaxel/trastuzumab/pertuzumab&#xD;
      (THP) neoadjuvant setting for HER2-positive breast cancer. Patients will be randomized at a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio into TCHP or THP, respectively, and will be treated every 3 weeks before&#xD;
      surgery.The primary endpoint was the percentage of pCR (ypT0/is, ypN0), which was defined as&#xD;
      the absence of any residual invasive cancer in both the breast and axillary lymph nodes.&#xD;
