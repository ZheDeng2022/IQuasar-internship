  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, randomized, phase Ⅲ study to treat subjects with RAS/BRAF wild-type,&#xD;
      unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer. The patients will be randomized into two arms&#xD;
      consist of Anlotinib (3 weeks/cycle) + CapeOx and Bevacizumab (3 week/cycle) + CapeOx at a&#xD;
      ratio of 1:1. This study is conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of Anlotinib and&#xD;
      Chemotherapy as first-line treatment in subjects with RAS/BRAF wild-type Metastatic&#xD;
      Colorectal Cancer.&#xD;
