  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled and open-label, multicenter efficacy and long-term&#xD;
      safety study of firibastat (QGC001) 1000 mg (2×500 mg tablets) administered po, QD, for up to&#xD;
      48 weeks in patients with difficult-to-treat/treatment-resistant HTN. Subjects will continue&#xD;
      to take their chronic antihypertensive therapies (at least 2 classes of antihypertensive&#xD;
      therapies) at the MTDs during the Run in Period and for the duration of the study. For&#xD;
      treatment-resistant subjects, one of the antihypertensive therapies must be a diuretic; for&#xD;
      difficult-to-treat subjects, the antihypertensive therapies do not have to include a&#xD;
      diuretic. Subjects will complete subject medication diaries during the Run-in Period. If&#xD;
      systolic automated office BP (AOBP) is ≥180 mmHg or diastolic BP (DBP) ≥110 mmHg at any visit&#xD;
      during the study (and repeated and confirmed within 30 min), the subject will be withdrawn&#xD;
      from the study and will receive appropriate treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For each subject, the study will include a Screening Visit, a Run-in Period, an Inclusion&#xD;
      Visit (Visit 2A, Day 0, and Visit 2B, Day 1), and up to 3 study treatment periods with clinic&#xD;
      visits and safety phone calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening assessments will be performed at Visit 1, Day -28. Eligible subjects will then&#xD;
      enter the Run-in Period, during which medication adherence will be assessed via a medication&#xD;
      diary. The duration of the Run in Period will be no less than 28 days and no more than 33&#xD;
      days; this time period allows for 2 repeat ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) recordings at&#xD;
      Visit 2A, if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria at the end of the Run in Period will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either Group A or Group B. A total of 200 subjects (100 in Group A and&#xD;
      100 in Group B) will be randomized to continue treatment with firibastat (QGC001) during&#xD;
      Period 3. Subjects will receive either double-blind firibastat (QGC001) or placebo for the&#xD;
      first 12-week study treatment period (Period 1), followed by open label treatment with&#xD;
      firibastat for 24 weeks (Period 2), or 36-weeks (Period 2 plus an additional 12-weeks of&#xD;
      open-label treatment in Period 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 2A, Day 0, an ABPM device will be installed for each subject who has successfully&#xD;
      completed the Run-in Period with a medication adherence ≥80%, and remains eligible to&#xD;
      participate in the study. The ABPM device will be set to record for at least 24 hours, with&#xD;
      the measurement frequency set at 30-minute intervals during the day (8:00 am to 10:00 pm&#xD;
      [theoretically 28 readings, 2 per hour]) and 60-minute intervals at night (10:00 pm to 8:00&#xD;
      am [theoretically 10 readings, 1 per hour]). Subjects must have a successful ABPM measurement&#xD;
      prior to being randomized and starting treatment with investigational product (IP) at Visit&#xD;
      2B, Day 1. An ABPM recording is considered successful if at least 21 daytime readings and 6&#xD;
      nighttime readings have been successfully recorded. A duration of less than 24 hours (e.g.,&#xD;
      23 hours and 30 minutes) would be acceptable for a successful ABPM recording providing it&#xD;
      successfully confirms 21 daytime readings and 6 nighttime readings. If the ABPM recording is&#xD;
      not successful, 2 further attempts are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a successful ABPM recording (assessed at Visit 2B, Day 1), subjects who still meet&#xD;
      the inclusion/exclusion criteria and who have a mean daytime systolic ambulatory blood&#xD;
      pressure (ABP) &gt;135 mmHg, will undergo visit-specific assessments and will be randomized to&#xD;
      Group A or Group B, and receive either firibastat (QGC001) or placebo for the 12-week&#xD;
      double-blind treatment period (Period 1), followed by open label firibastat for 24 weeks&#xD;
      (Period 2), or 36 weeks (Period 2 plus Period 3 [200 subjects]), in addition to their current&#xD;
      chronic antihypertensive treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Period 1, the investigator (or designee) will call subjects by telephone on Day 14 (±3&#xD;
      d) to collect any potential adverse events (AEs), check IP compliance, and record any&#xD;
      concomitant medications. Subjects will receive a second safety phone call during Period 2, at&#xD;
      Day 98 (±3 d).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will attend the study site for the following study visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 1: Visit 2A, Day 0; Visit 2B, Day 1; Visit 3, Day 42 (±3 d); Visit 4A, Day 84 (±3 d);&#xD;
      and Visit 4B, Day 85 (±3 d).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 2: Visit 5, Day 126 (±3 d); Visit 6, Day 168 (±3 d); Visit 7, Day 252 (±3 d); and&#xD;
      Visit 8, Day 280 (±3 d).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 3:Visit 9, Day 336 (±3 d), and Visit 10, Day 364 (±3 d). On completion of their final&#xD;
      study treatment period, subjects will attend an End of Treatment (EOT) Visit. A safety&#xD;
      follow-up will be performed at the End of Study (EOS) Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects who stop study treatment at the end of Period 2, the EOT Visit will be at Visit&#xD;
      7, Day 252 (±3 d), and the EOS Visit will be Visit 8, Day 280 (±3 d).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who continue study treatment into Period 3 will not attend Visit 8, Day 280 (±3 d).&#xD;
      Subjects who stop treatment with firibastat (QGC001) after Period 3 will attend an EOT Visit&#xD;
      at Visit 9, Day 336 (±3 d), and an EOS Visit at Visit 10, Day 364 (±3 d).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who discontinue the study early should undergo an Early Termination Visit, and an&#xD;
      EOS visit 28 days (±3 d) after the last dose of IP (except in the case of consent&#xD;
      withdrawal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be assigned to one of 5 pharmacokinetic (PK) subgroups; 50 subjects (at&#xD;
      selected sites) will undergo an enhanced PK sampling schedule (6 PK samples will be collected&#xD;
      according to the PK subgroup sampling schedule), and 700 subjects will be assigned to the&#xD;
      standard PK sampling schedule (2 PK samples will be collected according to the PK subgroup&#xD;
      sampling schedule).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each study visit, AOBP, orthostatic BP, and heart rate (HR) will be measured, and other&#xD;
      visit-specific procedures will be performed, including electrocardiograms (ECGs), clinical&#xD;
      laboratory evaluations, clinical examinations, collection of blood for PK samples and the&#xD;
      biomarker N terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-ProBNP), and monitoring of AEs and&#xD;
      concomitant medications. At the EOS Visit (safety follow-up) assessments will include&#xD;
      clinical examination, AOBP, orthostatic BP, ECG, HR, and clinical laboratory assessments, AE&#xD;
      monitoring, and concomitant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allergic skin reactions and/or diabetes insipidus (DI) are considered adverse events of&#xD;
      special interest (AESIs) with immediate notification during the study treatment period.&#xD;
