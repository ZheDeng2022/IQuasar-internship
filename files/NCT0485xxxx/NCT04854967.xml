  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to decrease inappropriate oxygen use for patients with COPD who have&#xD;
      recovered from a recent hospitalization. The investigators are testing a new program that&#xD;
      will stop oxygen prescriptions for patients that no longer need it and will instead provide&#xD;
      them with training in skills that have been shown to help patients breathe better.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the intervention program or usual care.&#xD;
      After 12 weeks the investigators will determine if the program helped stop unnecessary oxygen&#xD;
      prescription. The investigators will also determine if health status, distance walked during&#xD;
      six minutes, and symptoms of breathlessness after walking are different between participants&#xD;
      who received the program and those who did not. The investigators will meet with&#xD;
      participating patients and their providers after the study is complete to find out how they&#xD;
      feel about this program and if it would be possible to put this change into practice.&#xD;

      The purpose of this pilot study is to test an intervention designed to decrease inappropriate&#xD;
      oxygen use for patients with COPD who have recovered after a recent hospitalization.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to usual care vs. an oxygen de-implementation intervention.&#xD;
      Patients assigned to the oxygen de-implementation intervention group will have their active&#xD;
      oxygen prescription discontinued, be educated on pursed lip breathing and receive inhaler&#xD;
      training. A follow-up assessment will occur at 12 weeks. The primary outcome at 12 weeks will&#xD;
      be discontinuation of oxygen. Secondary outcomes include health status as measured by the&#xD;
      Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ), tele-six minute walk test (6MWT) distance, and Borg&#xD;
      dyspnea scale assessed after the tele-6MWT. Among the intervention group, the investigators&#xD;
      will also assess acceptability and feasibility of the intervention for patient participants&#xD;
      and their providers.&#xD;

    <measure>Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The disease-specific health status will be measured by the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) total Score. The measurement will be defined as the total score of the CCQ at 12 weeks. The CCQ was developed to assess symptoms, functional status, and COPD control and has been used in clinical trials to assess disease specific health status. The measure has strong internal consistency, reliability and validity, and is responsive to change over short time periods. The CCQ consists of 10 items grouped into three domains (symptoms, functional status and mental state), and one total score. Responses range from 0 (never) to 6 (almost all the time). The total score is calculated by adding all the responses and dividing by the total number of items to produce a final score that ranges from 0-6.</description>

    <measure>Post tele-six minute walk test (tele-6MWT) Borg Dyspnea scale</measure>

    <description>The Borg dyspnea scale assesses the difficulty that a patient is having with breathing at the current moment, and ranges from 0 (nothing at all) to 10 (maximal). Within one minute of completing the tele-6MWT, the participant will be asked to grade the severity of their dyspnea based on the modified Borg dyspnea scale.</description>

    <description>The estimate of costs related to the intervention will be obtained by tracking duration of intervention content and processes. The duration of tasks related to identification and evaluation of subject, enrollment and the intervention will be collected. These tasks will be broken down by level of skill required and a cost estimate calculated.</description>
