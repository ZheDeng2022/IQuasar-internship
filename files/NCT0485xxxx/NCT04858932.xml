  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reduction in appetite and/or food intake among older individuals is referred to as anorexia&#xD;
      of aging (AOA, also known as Geriatric Anorexia). AOA is linked with myriad comorbidities&#xD;
      associated with aging, contributes significantly to adverse health consequences in old age,&#xD;
      and has been used as a predictor of morbidity and mortality. The overall aim of this study is&#xD;
      to assess the feasibility and burden of the proposed in-laboratory and out-of-laboratory&#xD;
      assessments to study Geriatric Anorexia. This will be accomplished with the use of&#xD;
      questionnaires as well as devices that evaluate movement, metabolism, body weight&#xD;
      composition, glucose levels, and nutritional scale.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate movement, metabolism, body weight composition, glucose levels,&#xD;
      and nutritional scale in healthy adults. Subjects, age 65 to 85 years will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will consist of an initial (in-clinic) intake visit on Day 1 where the&#xD;
      subject will be screened and enrolled in the study after signing an informed consent&#xD;
      document, followed by an at-home phase where the subject will wear a watch like device on one&#xD;
      wrist. After training, the subject will return for their Day 8 in-clinic visit, where the&#xD;
      subject will repeat some intake assessments and activities, as well as some additional&#xD;
      standing and walking activities. The subject will then be asked to perform at-home activities&#xD;
      and assessments with the use of a smart phone, digital food scale, smart body weight scale,&#xD;
      and continuous glucose monitor, while continuing to wear the watch-like device and a movement&#xD;
      measurement device around their waist (Days 8-21). A final in-clinic visit will take place on&#xD;
      Day 21 for final assessments and device collection. A +/- 4 days will be allocated for the&#xD;
      scheduling of all visits to accommodate subject's schedules and commitments. All&#xD;
      in-laboratory activities will take place in the Laboratory for Human Neurobiology while&#xD;
      in-home activities will be completed in the subject's home. The study procedures will be&#xD;
      identical for all subjects for the three groups.&#xD;
