  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will examine the effects of eight weeks of equine assisted activities (EAA) on&#xD;
      co-regulation, basal physiological values, and symptom severity in veterans with&#xD;
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Heart rate, respiration rate, surface electromyography&#xD;
      (EMG) and plasma concentrations of cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and oxytocin will&#xD;
      be measured at rest and during dyadic interaction tasks (human to human or human to horse) to&#xD;
      assess effects of EAA on these measures. Additionally, standard and regularly used&#xD;
      questionnaires will be used to monitor PTSD symptom severity during the study and 6-month&#xD;
      follow-up period. EAA is expected to lower PTSD symptom severity, and mitigate other&#xD;
      physiological changes associated with PTSD.&#xD;
