  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      esketamine is an optical isomer of ketamine. Compared with ketamine, esketamine has the&#xD;
      characteristics of higher effective value, stronger receptor affinity, less adverse reactions&#xD;
      of nervous system, and pharmacokinetics is controllable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Domestic and foreign studies have focused on the therapeutic effect of esketamine on major&#xD;
      depression, but less attention has been paid to perioperative depression.This study intends&#xD;
      to explore the effect of small doses of esketamine on patients with breast&#xD;
      cancer.Postoperative depression and pain are observed.&#xD;

      This study intends to explore the effect of small doses of esketamine on patients with breast&#xD;
      cancer.WE pay attention to :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Safety of low-dose single intravenous injection of esketamine (1)The influence of&#xD;
           intraoperative vital signs of patients after medication, such as blood pressure and&#xD;
           heart rate fluctuation; (2)the duration of recovery after anesthesia; (3)postoperative&#xD;
           adverse reactions, such as nausea and vomiting, dizziness and diplopia, respiratory&#xD;
           depression, laryngeal spasm, delirium agitation, etc&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Effect of single intravenous injection of low-dose ketamine on postoperative depression&#xD;
           in patients undergoing radical mastectomy (1) 1 day before surgery, 2 days, 5 days, 30&#xD;
           days, 90 days after surgery Hamilton Depression Scale scores; (2) The serum leptin level&#xD;
           1 day before surgery, 2 days after surgery and 5 days after surgery; (3) Correlation&#xD;
           between depression scale score and leptin level&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Effects of low dose esketamine on acute and chronic pain in patients undergoing radical&#xD;
           mastectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  visual analogue scale scores at 6, 12 and 24 hours after surgery;&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  visual analogue scale scores at 3, 5, 30 and 90 days after surgery;&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  the number of analgesic remedies&#xD;

    <masking_description>esketamine 10ml (5mg/ml) and normal saline 10ml were respectively set as drug A or drug B.&#xD;
Without the knowledge of the experimenter, the predetermined dose of drug A or B will be given to the experimenter before induction of anesthesia, with 0.05 mL /kg for each patient.&#xD;
After all samples are collected, the third party will announce the grouping and medication.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>depression score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline score at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The total rough score is the sum of all the scores in the 20 items, and then the rough score is multiplied by 1.25 to take the round part to get the standard score.&#xD;
An SDS score of 53 to 62 is classified as mild depression, 63 to 72 as moderate depression, and 73 or more as major depression.</description>
