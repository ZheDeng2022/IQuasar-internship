      Various gait deviations are observed in children with cerebral palsy. Our aim was to&#xD;
      determine the effect of cognitive task (CT) and motor task (MT) on gait in children with&#xD;
      cerebral palsy (CP). 15 children with CP, between 9-15 years old, with Communication Function&#xD;
      Classification System (CFSS) level I, with Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS)&#xD;
      and Manual Ability Classification System (MACS) level I-II were included in the study. The&#xD;
      gait with four different conditions (single gait, CT, MT and CT&amp;MT) was evaluated by Kinovea&#xD;
      video analysis method on a 10-meter course.&#xD;

      All children with CP were instructed to walk on the track under four different conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single: Walking without task at a self-selected speed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive Task (CT): Walking while counting down rhythmically from 20 in threes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motor Task (MT): Walking while carrying an empty box&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT + MT: Walking while carrying an empty box and counting down rhythmically from 20 in&#xD;
           threes&#xD;
&#xD;
      The task was explained to individuals by a physiotherapist. The individuals were not allowed&#xD;
      to use orthosis during walking performance. Running was not accepted. 30 seconds were given&#xD;
      to take a break between tasks. The physiotherapist followed the individuals along the track&#xD;
      in case of any falling. If the child was not able to complete the track (falling or need to&#xD;
      rest), the evaluation was accepted uncomplete and was excluded from the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Kinovea-08.15 software program was used to assess all of the outputs (images and videos)&#xD;
      from the camera&#xD;
