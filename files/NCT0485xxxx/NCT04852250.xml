  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, multicentre observational study in patients suffering from RAS mutant&#xD;
      mCRC with primarily unresectable metastases, who are planned to be treated with FOLFOXIRI and&#xD;
      bevacizumab or who have already received ≤ four cycles FOLFOXIRI and bevacizumab as&#xD;
      first-line treatment of metastatic disease. The patients are randomised in a 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      compare the rate of patients in whom secondary interventions (e.g. resection, ablation) are&#xD;
      performed in curative intent when secondary intervention options are assessed by a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary centralized tumour board (Arm A) versus when secondary intervention options&#xD;
      are not assessed by a multidisciplinary centralized tumour board (Arm B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients evaluated in the study will receive chemotherapy with FOLFOXIRI plus&#xD;
      bevacizumab. After this induction/conversion therapy, imaging (CT or MRI) will be performed&#xD;
      to evaluate resectability. In Arm A, a multidisciplinary, centralized tumour board will&#xD;
      assess options of secondary intervention to be performed in the context of a generally&#xD;
      curative treatment approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there are secondary intervention options according to the judgement of the centralized&#xD;
      tumour board, they will be listed in their respective sequence and the assessment will be&#xD;
      communicated to the participating physician or his/her deputy at the study center. The&#xD;
      decision, whether or not any secondary intervention is performed as recommended by the&#xD;
      centralized tumour board as well as the kind of interventional procedures is up to the&#xD;
      discretion of the treating physicians and surgeons of each patient. Any secondary&#xD;
      intervention is recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluating the primary endpoint, the first interventions performed in one organ (e.g. liver)&#xD;
      are rated when performed in a generally curative context (e.g. even in the presence of lung&#xD;
      metastases that need to be approached in a further intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Arm B, no centralized tumour board will be integrated in to clinical decision making and&#xD;
      patients will be treated according to institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of treatment cycles with FOLFOXIRI and bevacizumab will be according to local&#xD;
      clinical routine and medical guidelines, recommended are 8 to 12 cycles FOLFOXIRI in&#xD;
      combination with bevacizumab, followed by a maintenance therapy with fluoropyrimidine (FP)&#xD;
      plus bevacizumab until progression.&#xD;
