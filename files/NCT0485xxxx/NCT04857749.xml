    <textblock>
      The aim of this experimental study is to evaluate the effect of nurse navigation in the&#xD;
      management of symptoms associated with head and neck radiotherapy. All head and neck cancer&#xD;
      patients who meet the study criteria of the Radiation Oncology Clinic of Selçuk University&#xD;
      Medical Faculty Hospital will be included in the study. According to the previously prepared&#xD;
      randomization list, the study group consisted of a total of 88 people, 41 in the experimental&#xD;
      group and 47 in the control group. While the standard treatment approaches of the hospital&#xD;
      are applied to all patients, a nursing navigation program will be applied in addition to the&#xD;
      patients in the experimental group.Quality of life and toxicity criteria will be applied to&#xD;
      all patients as measurement tools.&#xD;

      The navigation program will be started on the day patients start their treatment. Before&#xD;

      forms will be obtained just before starting treatment, and the patient identification form,&#xD;
      CTCAE v5.0 toxicity criteria and EORTC QLQ-H &amp; N35 scales will be applied. Quality of life&#xD;
      measurements will be repeated at the end and middle of the treatment. In addition, weight&#xD;
      measurements and laboratory follow-up of the patients will be done at the beginning and at&#xD;
      the end of the study. NCSS (Number Cruncher Statistical System) 2007 program will be used for&#xD;
      statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics, parametric and non-parametric tests will be&#xD;
      used to evaluate data.&#xD;
