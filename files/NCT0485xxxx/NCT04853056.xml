  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies evaluating VR are quite insufficient. In the study we determined in the emergency&#xD;
      room between the ages of 4-10, cold vibration and virtual reality will be compared, and the&#xD;
      success of the first attempt, pain, fear and anxiety will be evaluated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      It was planned to evaluate the effect of virtual reality, cold vibration device application&#xD;
      on the first attempt success, procedure-related pain, fear and anxiety during pediatric&#xD;
      intravenous line placement in children aged 4-10 years in the pediatric emergency unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Patients who watch videos with virtual reality glasses or who are applied cold vibration&#xD;
      device during the vascular access procedure have a high first-attempt success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: The pain, fear, and anxiety scores of the patients who watch videos with virtual reality&#xD;
      glasses or who are applied cold vibration device during the venipuncture procedure are lower.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned to include children between the ages of 4 and 10 who will be given vascular&#xD;
      access in the Dokuz Eylül University Pediatric Emergency Unit. Between December 2020 and&#xD;
      January 2021, it is planned to include patients selected by stratified randomization method&#xD;
      in accordance with the sampling criteria. In the Gpower statistical program, based on the&#xD;
      results of one-way variance analysis used in the comparison of pain and anxiety scores in the&#xD;
      study of Canbulat et al. It was determined that a sample was required. In the study, it was&#xD;
      planned to fulfill the parametric test assumptions and to have 50 children for each group and&#xD;
      150 children for the total sample, considering 10% loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion / exclusion criteria in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children between the ages of 4-10&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The child agrees to voluntarily participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parents agree to voluntarily participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtaining consent form from the child and parent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The child does not have a physical and psychological deficit to prevent him from wearing&#xD;
           the glasses to be worn on his head so that he can watch virtual reality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who will be peripheral IV line accessed will be allocated to the groups according to&#xD;
      randomization. The child and parents will be informed and after their consent, the group they&#xD;
      belong to will be determined. No additional intervention will be made to the patient in the&#xD;
      control group and will be observed during the procedure after obtaining her consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard approach will be applied to all pediatric patients. Standard approach; Providing&#xD;
      information about the procedure, introducing the nurse himself, choosing the region together,&#xD;
      being with the parent and talking to the child during the procedure. No additional&#xD;
      intervention will be made to the patient in the control group, and until the intervention&#xD;
      begins, &quot;How old are you? Which grade are you in? What is the name of your favorite friend?&#xD;
      Which sport do you like better? &quot; Attention will be distracted by asking questions such as.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By introducing a virtual headset to the selected child to the video monitoring initiative&#xD;
      group with virtual glasses, it will be said that he can watch videos by wearing the virtual&#xD;
      headset during the procedure (Figure 1). The video he wants to watch together will be&#xD;
      determined. If virtual glasses are desired to be removed during the procedure, the child will&#xD;
      be excluded from the study. One of the 3 interesting videos will be determined by the&#xD;
      researchers, with the preference of the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the cold vibration group, bee Buzzy will be attached to the arm where the nurse will&#xD;
      perform the peripheral IV line access. Bee Buzzy confuses nerves and reduces pain thanks to&#xD;
      its cold wings and vibration. help distract attention during the injection period, reduce the&#xD;
      feeling of pain and fear. Buzzy will be tied 5 cm above the area where blood will be taken,&#xD;
      and after waiting 15 seconds, vascular access will be opened by the nurse. It will be wiped&#xD;
      with disinfectant before and after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each patient included in the study is taken to the chair where the intervention will be&#xD;
      performed (the starting hour/minute of the procedure will be recorded), the patient will be&#xD;
      monitored and pulse, respiration, and blood pressure will be measured. The child will be&#xD;
      evaluated by the nurse before the procedure with the Emotional Appearance Scale for Children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's pulse, respiration, blood pressure will be measured again (minutes will be&#xD;
      recorded). Pulse, respiration and blood pressure will be re-evaluated at the 5th minute of&#xD;
      the beginning of the procedure. At the 5th minute of the procedure, the child will be asked&#xD;
      to evaluate the most painful moment he feels during the procedure with a Facial Expressions&#xD;
      Rating Scale and a Color Analog Scale. The child will be given the Child Fear Scale (CFS) and&#xD;
      the Child Anxiety Scale-State to evaluate how anxious and afraid he or she is during the&#xD;
      procedure. You will be asked to mark it with a pencil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research data will be collected by the following data collection forms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socio-Demographic Data Collection Form Procedure Follow-up Form Pain scale Fear Scale Child&#xD;
      Anxiety Scale-State Emotional Appearance Scale for Children&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socio-Demographic Data Collection Form: The Socio-demographic Data Collection Form consists&#xD;
      of questions about the sociodemographic characteristics of the children and parents who will&#xD;
      participate in the study. Sociodemographic features; It includes &quot;age, gender, diagnosis,&#xD;
      date of last bloodletting&quot; regarding the child, and &quot;age, closeness to the child, educational&#xD;
      status, number of children&quot; for the parent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure Follow-up Form: The child's difficult vascular access intervention score, procedure&#xD;
      initiation time, vital signs, and first attempt success will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wong-Baker FACES (WBS) Pain Rating Scale. This scale uses in children aged 3 and older to&#xD;
      rate pain severity, ranges from 0 (very happy/no pain) to 10 (hurts worst).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Child Fear Scale (CFS). The Child Fear Scale will use.This one-item scale measures&#xD;
      procedure-related fear in children, consists of five sex-neutral faces, ranges from 0 (no&#xD;
      fear) to extreme fear. This rating scale ranges from 0 to 4. It ranges from a no fear&#xD;
      (neutral) face (0) on the far left to a face showing extreme fear on the far right. Higher&#xD;
      scores mean a worse outcome. The rater response indicates the level of fear. It can be used&#xD;
      during the procedure for children aged 5-10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Children's Anxiety Meter (CAM-S). The Children's Anxiety Meter assesses children's&#xD;
      anxiety and uses before medical procedures. This scale is drawn like a thermometer with a&#xD;
      bulb at the bottom and also includes horizontal lines at intervals going up to the top&#xD;
      (0-10). This scale ranges from 0 to 10. Higher values represent higher anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emotional Appearance Scale for Children: This scale allows direct behavioral observation,&#xD;
      consists of 5 different behavioral categories; 'Facial Expression', 'Speaking', 'Activity',&#xD;
      'Interaction' and 'Cooperation Level'. Scale scoring is done by reviewing the descriptions of&#xD;
      behavior in each category and selecting the numerical value that most represents the observed&#xD;
      behavior. Each category is scored from 1 to 5. The total score is made so that the numerical&#xD;
      value is between 5-25 by adding the points obtained for each category. Higher scale score&#xD;
      indicates the appearance of more negative emotional behaviors.&#xD;
