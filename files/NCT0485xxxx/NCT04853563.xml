  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about optimal level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in patiens who&#xD;
      recieved invasive mechanical ventilation for acute decompensated heart failure. We therefore&#xD;
      sought to compare clinical outcome according to low versus high PEEP.&#xD;

    <description>Starting at the day of randomization, and the days on non-invasive ventilation do not count. Successful extubation is defined as at least 24 hours wihtout reintubation independent of invasive assisted ventilation in survivor. Non-survivor within 28 days: ventilator-free day counted as 0, ventilator-free day among only survivor at 28-day will be counted for primary endpoint.</description>

    <description>Immediate after initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation and randomization, the PEEP level is set to be at 8 cmH2O with an inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) between 0.21 and 0.6. Thereafter, the PEEP level is adjusted to 1 cmH2O higher to a minimum PEEP level of 10 with every 30 minutes.</description>

    <description>Immediate after initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation and randomization, the PEEP level is set to be at 5 cmH2O with an inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) between 0.21 and 0.6. In this arm, the PEEP level is adjusted to 1 cmH2O lower to a minimum PEEP level of 3 with every 30 minutes while maintaining a partial pressure of arterial blood oxygen above 65 mmHg or SpO2 &gt;92% with pulse oxymetry.</description>
