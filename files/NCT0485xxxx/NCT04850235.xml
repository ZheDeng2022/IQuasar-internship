  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) has been recommended in&#xD;
      the treatment of locoregionally-advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), with docetaxel,&#xD;
      cisplatin (DDP) and 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) shown to be an effective regimen. Capecitabine is&#xD;
      the precursor drug of 5-fluorouracil, and has been used in replace of 5-fluorouracil in NPC&#xD;
      patients. Nab-paclitaxel (Nab-PTX) is a novel albumin-bound paclitaxel with a superior&#xD;
      therapeutic index to docetaxel. We sought to find out the efficacy of Nab-PTX in three-drug&#xD;
      triplet (Nab-PTX, DDP and capecitabine) and decide the best administration dose of Nab-PTX.&#xD;

      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) has been recommended in&#xD;
      the treatment of locoregionally-advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), with docetaxel,&#xD;
      cisplatin (DDP) and 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) shown to be an effective regimen. Capecitabine is&#xD;
      the precursor drug of 5-fluorouracil, and has been used in replace of 5-fluorouracil in NPC&#xD;
      patients. Nab-paclitaxel (Nab-PTX) is a novel albumin-bound paclitaxel with a superior&#xD;
      therapeutic index to docetaxel. It was developed to reduce toxicities associated with&#xD;
      paclitaxel whilst maintaining or improving its chemotherapeutic effect. In vivo preclinical&#xD;
      experiments have shown greater volume of distribution of nab-paclitaxel than paclitaxel, with&#xD;
      similar half-life and clearance. The efficacy and optimal dose of Nab-PTX combined with DDP&#xD;
      as doublet has been explored in metastatic NPC patients and locoregionally advanced patients,&#xD;
      and it showed encouraging anti-tumor effects and manageable toxicities. However, what is the&#xD;
      optimal dose of Nab-PTX and the efficacy of it in three-drug triplet (Nab-PTX, DDP and&#xD;
      capecitabine) needs to be discovered. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of Nab-PTX plus cisplatin and capecitabine neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by&#xD;
      cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy in the patients with locoregionally advanced&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma, to provide new evidence for the use of Nab-PTX in NPC.&#xD;
