    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, cross-over, dietary intervention research design comprising a&#xD;
      5-day run-in period, two 3-day dietary interventions, and a 7-day washout period.&#xD;
      Participants (mother-offspring dyads) will be randomly assigned to order of interventions.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited as a convenience sample from mother-offspring dyads in the&#xD;
      greater Moscow, Idaho and Boise, Idaho areas. The purpose of this study is to to learn more&#xD;
      about the use of an allergen test strip to detect cow's milk and soy food allergen proteins&#xD;
      in human milk, to explore the impact of maternal bovine milk and soy milk consumption on&#xD;
      human milk and maternal/infant gastrointestinal microbiomes and to examine maternal stress&#xD;
      during periods of dietary elimination and re-introductions periods.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The current estimated prevalence of Immunoglobulin E-mediated childhood food allergy is ~8%&#xD;
      with up to 11% of caregivers reporting food allergy symptoms. Research also suggests that 40%&#xD;
      of children with food allergy report food allergy to multiple food allergens. Infant food&#xD;
      allergy can result in multiple physical symptoms including colic, vomiting, reflux, bloody&#xD;
      stool, failure to thrive, and eczema, and has been associated with a decreased quality of&#xD;
      life in infants and their caregivers. Treatment options for infant food allergies are&#xD;
      currently limited. In most situations, mothers must choose between continuing to breastfeed&#xD;
      while attempting to avoid potential food allergens or ending breastfeeding and providing&#xD;
      expensive hydrolyzed infant formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breastfeeding affects mortality in children under the age of 5 years old reducing episodes of&#xD;
      diarrhea and respiratory infections, and decreasing hospital admissions by up to 70%. The&#xD;
      Lancet series on breastfeeding quantified the global economic health impact of breastfeeding&#xD;
      on healthcare due to infant illness and mortality. Of the estimated 130 million live births&#xD;
      per year globally, 820,000 infant deaths, 87% of which are under 6 months old, could be&#xD;
      mitigated with improved breastfeeding practices. The Lancet report projects that a 10%&#xD;
      increase in exclusive breastfeeding up to 6 months would translate to an estimated $312&#xD;
      million in healthcare savings in the US alone. Long-term (up to 2 years), additional&#xD;
      breastfeeding benefits would impact treatment costs for infants and toddlers as much as $2.45&#xD;
      billion in the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many breastfeeding women are led to believe that they should not eat certain foods (e.g.,&#xD;
      dairy) because this might lead to food intolerance in their infants. Without a method to&#xD;
      directly test human milk, mothers will methodically cut out whole food groups (most of them&#xD;
      extremely healthy) without realizing that the true problem is going undetected. This often&#xD;
      starts with dairy and quickly spirals until her diet is very limited. A total elimination&#xD;
      diet is typical for this community. Many women reduce their intake down to as few as five&#xD;
      foods (i.e., chicken, mango, coconut oil, spinach, and potato). This extreme dietary&#xD;
      restriction puts mothers and infants at risk for nutritional deficiencies with potential&#xD;
      life-long effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no mechanism available for mothers to know what allergens are present in&#xD;
      their milk. Food diaries are inadequate as dietary protein only enters breastmilk a portion&#xD;
      of the time and is present in the milk for a variable amount of time depending on several&#xD;
      factors including metabolism, nursing schedule and unknown individual characteristics. A&#xD;
      simple at-home test strip would empower women to continue breastfeeding by removing the&#xD;
      mystery of the allergens present. Mothers and pediatricians could use this information to&#xD;
      determine what is causing reactions and then follow up to determine if informed dietary&#xD;
      elimination made mom's milk safe. Women could then enjoy their favorite foods and be&#xD;
      confident in feeding their infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Free to Feed has developed a first-in-class solution using patent-pending technology to&#xD;
      detect food allergen proteins in human milk. With this knowledge, mothers would be able to&#xD;
      identify the culprit and remove the food from their diets or wait for the allergen to clear&#xD;
      from their milk prior to feeding through repeated testing. This technology hopes to empower&#xD;
      mothers to breastfeed longer, giving both mom and baby lifelong benefits, while relieving the&#xD;
      stress of inducing unknown effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research has identified the presence of specific nonhuman proteins found in human&#xD;
      milk. While an abundance of information exists on bovine proteins in human milk, very limited&#xD;
      research exists examining the presence of soy proteins in human milk. Furthermore, there is&#xD;
      no notable existing research validating the use of strips or other tools to detect food&#xD;
      allergens in human milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim of this research is to validate the use of this patent-pending technology,&#xD;
      Freedom Strips, to detect bovine and soy-based food allergen proteins in human milk with the&#xD;
      goal that women will be able to test their milk for common antigens (e.g., dairy) and make&#xD;
      informed decisions as to whether the milk should be fed to their infants. This will benefit&#xD;
      mothers and babies on a global scale as it will enable women to quickly and easily determine&#xD;
      if their milk is safe to feed their infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hypothesis explaining the discomfort and increasingly distressed behavior of infants when&#xD;
      consuming human milk containing food allergens relates to potential changes in the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal microbiome. There is limited information on the relationship between&#xD;
      maternal cow's milk and soy consumption and the gastrointestinal microbiome of mothers and&#xD;
      their offspring. Therefore, the second aim of this study is to explore the impact of maternal&#xD;
      cow's milk and soy consumption on breastmilk and maternal/infant gastrointestinal&#xD;
      microbiomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, elimination diets, dietary challenges and food reintroduction can put a&#xD;
      significant amount of stress on mothers of children with infant food allergies. More research&#xD;
      is needed examining how maternal stress levels might change throughout this process. A third&#xD;
      aim of this study is to examine and compare maternal stress levels during dietary elimination&#xD;
      and food challenge periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research study will build upon previous literature by increasing our knowledge&#xD;
      related to the detection and identification of nonhuman proteins, specifically bovine and&#xD;
      soy, in human milk. This study is unique because it will include a dietary intervention with&#xD;
      increasing doses of soy or bovine milk examining how the amount of intake of a food allergen&#xD;
      may impact protein detection. It also unique because it includes the investigation of&#xD;
      maternal stress and maternal/infant GI microbiomes, both of which may provide more insight on&#xD;
      the mechanisms and outcomes of infant food allergies. While our research lab has experience&#xD;
      in investigating a variety of factors related to human milk and the microbiome, this study is&#xD;
      unique from all other studies currently being done at the University of Idaho.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist of a randomized, cross-over, dietary intervention research design&#xD;
      comprising a 5-day run-in period, two 3-day dietary interventions with a 7-day washout period&#xD;
      between them, and a final 2-day washout period after the 2nd intervention. 40&#xD;
      mother-offspring dyads will be recruited to participate. Participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to order of intervention. Demographic and health data will be collected at baseline&#xD;
      (d0) as will information related to typical infant crying patterns and maternal stress&#xD;
      (Perceived Stress Scale). Baseline data collection will also include collection of a human&#xD;
      milk sample (approximately 10 mL), a maternal stool sample, and an infant stool sample.&#xD;
      Participants will complete two 24-hour dietary recalls during baseline collection (day 0)&#xD;
      rather than one to obtain typical dairy and soy intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Run-in elimination period: After baseline collection, both groups will undergo a 5-day run-in&#xD;
      period during which time half the subjects will eliminate soy and the other half will&#xD;
      eliminate cow's milk. Participants will be provided with a list of foods and ingredients to&#xD;
      avoid during this time facilitated by a registered dietitian. During these 5 days,&#xD;
      participants will complete a daily compliance check and indicate any soy or bovine&#xD;
      products/foods that they may or may not have consumed. On d5 of this run-in period,&#xD;
      participants will again provide samples of milk and maternal and infant stool and will&#xD;
      complete the Perceived Stress Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary intervention period I: After completing the run-in period, the women will consume 200&#xD;
      mL, 300 mL, and 400 mL of bovine milk or soy milk during d1, d2, and d3 (respectively).&#xD;
      During each dietary intervention period, participants will provide 3 samples of milk&#xD;
      (approximately 10 mL each) each of the 3 days (12 samples total), 1 maternal stool sample,&#xD;
      and 1 infant stool sample. Daily logs will be kept to ascertain dairy and soy intake&#xD;
      compliance, infant crying and fussiness, and maternal/infant stooling patterns. On the third&#xD;
      day of the dietary intervention, mothers will again complete the Perceived Stress Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Washout period I: The first dietary intervention period will be followed by a 7-day washout&#xD;
      period during which time the product that was not eliminated the first time will be&#xD;
      eliminated from the diet. On the last day of this washout period, participants will provide&#xD;
      an optional maternal and/or infant stool sample; they will also complete the Perceived Stress&#xD;
      Scale. Infant crying and fussiness will also be monitored and recorded daily during the first&#xD;
      two days of the washout period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary intervention period II: After this, each subject will consume 200 mL, 300 mL, and 400&#xD;
      mL of bovine milk or soy milk (which ever they did not consumer in the first intervention&#xD;
      period) during d1, d2, and d3 (respectively). Data and samples collected during intervention&#xD;
      I will be collected during intervention II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Washout period II: The second dietary intervention period will be followed by a 2-day washout&#xD;
      period during which time they will continue to eliminate the food produce eliminated in&#xD;
      intervention period II. On the last day of this washout period, subjects will provide a milk&#xD;
      sample (approximately 10 mL), a maternal stool sample, and an infant stool sample. Infant&#xD;
      crying and fussiness will also be monitored and recorded daily.&#xD;
