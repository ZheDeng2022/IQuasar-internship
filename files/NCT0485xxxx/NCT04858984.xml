  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childbirth is associated with labour pain and can be regarded as one of the most serious&#xD;
      kinds of pain. Labour pain management methods include pharmacological and non-pharmacological&#xD;
      methods. There is increasing evidence that virtual reality (VR) is effective in the reduction&#xD;
      of labour pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this qualitative study is to explore the experience, preference, and satisfaction&#xD;
      of the use of two different VR scenario's during labour. The secondary outcome parameter is&#xD;
      the effect of VR on pain reduction and anxiety during labour, measured by NRS score.&#xD;

      Epidural Analgesia (EA) has been regarded as the most effective method of labour analgesia.&#xD;
      Pharmacological analgesia methods are known to have adverse side effects, such as nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting and drowsiness in parental opioids; pruritus, nausea, desaturation, respiratory&#xD;
      depression and apnea in patient-controlled remifentanil analgesia; and maternal fever,&#xD;
      maternal hypotension and urinary retention in EA. Furthermore, routine EA is likely resulting&#xD;
      in more operative deliveries. Considering these possible adverse effects, it is worth&#xD;
      exploring alternative methods for labour pain relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is increasing evidence that virtual reality (VR) is effective in the reduction of&#xD;
      labour pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This VIREL study aims to examine the experience, preference, and satisfaction of VR in women&#xD;
      during labour. The study is set up as a single centre, qualitative study in a non-university&#xD;
      teaching hospital in The Netherlands with 2800 deliveries annually. Participants will&#xD;
      experience an immersive guided relaxation VR (VR1) and an interactive game (VR2) during&#xD;
      labour. VR1 consists of a video of an exotic location guided by the sound of the waves and a&#xD;
      calm English-speaking voice. VR2 requires women to use the controller to throw snowballs in&#xD;
      order to catch presents and reach the next level. Patients are allowed to stop using the VR&#xD;
      at any moment during the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the participant is declared to be in labour, defined as having regular painful uterine&#xD;
      contractions, cervical effacement and at least 3cm dilatation, VR1 will be offered for ten&#xD;
      minutes. Before and immediately after VR1, the patient is asked to fill out a Numeric Rating&#xD;
      Scale (NRS) score for pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 30-minute intermission after VR1 the patient fills out the post-intervention&#xD;
      questionnaire regarding VR1. Subsequently, VR2 is offered for ten minutes. Before and&#xD;
      immediately after VR2 the patient filled in the NRS score for pain, and the patient completed&#xD;
      a post-intervention questionnaire regarding VR2. Additional use of VR is allowed by maternal&#xD;
      request. Five days post-partum all participants who completed both VR interventions will be&#xD;
      contacted by telephone for a semi-structured interview.&#xD;
