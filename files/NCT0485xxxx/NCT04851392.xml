  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The acute effects of cannabis may differ between adolescents and adults. Furthermore, these&#xD;
      effects may be tempered by the presence of cannabidiol. This double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, crossover experiment investigates the acute effects of cannabis (with and&#xD;
      without cannabidiol) on subjective effects, behavioural responses and neural functioning in&#xD;
      16-17 year-olds and 26-29 year-olds who regularly use cannabis (0.5-3 days per week).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover experiment with drug condition block randomised and stratified by age-group and gender, such that drug order is counterbalanced.&#xD;
There are two groups: adolescents (16-17 years old) and adults (26-29 years old). These groups are matched on current cannabis use frequency.&#xD;
There are three drug conditions: (1) cannabis with delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and without cannabidiol (CBD), (2) cannabis with THC but without CBD, and (3) placebo cannabis without THC and without CBD.</intervention_model_description>
