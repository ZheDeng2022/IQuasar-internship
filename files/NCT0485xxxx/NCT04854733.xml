  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, it is aimed to examine the dual-task performance of soccer referees. For this&#xD;
      purpose, it will be investigated whether the motor or cognitive performance of the referees&#xD;
      changes when dual-task is assigned and also whether there are differences in dual-task&#xD;
      performance between the referees and athletes with similar training program.&#xD;

      In this study, the motor and cognitive dual-task performances of referees will be evaluated.&#xD;
      It also will be investigated whether the referees prioritize one of the performances, motor&#xD;
      or cognitive, during the dual-task and whether their role in the competition makes a&#xD;
      difference compared to athletes. For this purpose, appropriate motor and cognitive tasks were&#xD;
      determined by considering the roles of the referees during the competition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the Demographic Information Form respectively; Edgren Side Step Agility Test&#xD;
      as motor performance assessment, Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) as cognitive performance&#xD;
      assessment, and finally Dual-Task evaluation using MOT and Edgren Side Step Agility Test will&#xD;
      be applied simultaneously. Dual-task costs will be calculated as a percentage of single-task&#xD;
      for both motor and cognitive tasks.&#xD;

    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Multiple object tracking (MOT) (4 targets), a computer-based cognitive test, is used. Before the test starts, four of the eight black dots on the white screen are randomly determined by flashing. The participant then follows these moving points and marks the correct points after the black dots stop. The selected correct points are noted and saved as P - Proper selection rate in the participant's file.&#xD;
After the MOT test is taught, the test is completed in two different speed parameters (240msec, 300msec) in 10sec x 5 repetitions for each speed.</description>

    <measure>Edgren Side Step Test</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>It is done to test the individual's agility, side speed, and body control. After 15 minutes of warm-up (dynamic stretching and low-pace forward / side running), the Edgren Side Step Test is explained and shown by the researcher.For testing, 5 cones are placed at 1-meter intervals on a 4-meter wide line on a flat non-slip floor. The participant is asked to wait in the middle line with her legs open. During the 10 seconds test, it is asked to step as quickly as possible to the right and left outer cones. It should be ensured that the face is facing forward and that the feet move sideways. After confirming that the test was performed correctly, the best score in the agility test (distance-meter covered in 10 sec) is recorded by applying 3 repetitions.</description>

    <measure>Dual Task Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>After performing the single tasks (Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) and Edgren Side Step Test) separately, participants are taken into double task evaluation. While standing in the starting position of the Edgren Side Stepping Test, the MOT test is opened on the screen placed directly opposite the viewing distance (2-meters). After the flashing of the points to be followed at the beginning of the MOT, the MOT and Edgren Side Step Test are started simultaneously with the movement of the points. At the end of 10 seconds, the distance traveled is recorded in meters and the points of the MOT test are followed by the mouse. Dual-Task Assessment is repeated 3 times for each 2 different MOT speeds and scores are recorded.</description>
