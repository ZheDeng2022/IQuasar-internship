      A Phase II, Multicenter, Double-blind, Double-dummy, Placebo controlled, Randomized Study to&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This will be a multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo controlled, randomized study&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AUR101 in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 128 patients with chronic moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (defined as&#xD;
      Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) ≥12 and Body Surface Area (BSA) involved ≥10%) will&#xD;
      be randomized to four groups (three dose groups of AUR101 and one placebo group) in the ratio&#xD;
      of 1:1:1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients in each arm will receive AUR101 of 200 mg twice daily, 400 mg twice daily, 400&#xD;
      mg once daily or matching placebo for 12 weeks in a double blind, double dummy fashion. All&#xD;
      patients will be followed up for 14 ± 2 days of their last dose for safety assessment.&#xD;
