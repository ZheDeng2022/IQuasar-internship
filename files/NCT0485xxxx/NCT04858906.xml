  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the advent and more widespread use of video-assisted laryngoscopy (VL), the incidence of&#xD;
      difficult intubation has decreased. However, the optimal position for endotracheal intubation&#xD;
      facilitated by VL is not yet determined. The objective of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of different patient positioning (neutral position versus sniffing position) on the&#xD;
      glottic view and intubation time during orotracheal intubation facilitated by two&#xD;
      video-assisted laryngoscopes (McGrath laryngoscope and C-MAC D-blade laryngoscope). A total&#xD;
      of 252 patients who required orotracheal intubation for elective surgery were included in the&#xD;
      study. Primary outcomes include airway difficulty score(ADS), intubation difficulty scale&#xD;
      (IDS), the percentage of glottic opening (POGO) and intubation time. By the indexes above and&#xD;
      crossover analysis, the study aimed to prove the ideal position for VL.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endotracheal tube general anesthesia (ETGA) is required for a variety of surgeries.&#xD;
      Traditionally, the patient is placed in a sniffing position to facilitate endotracheal&#xD;
      intubation with a direct laryngoscope. Increased attempts in intubation or intubation failed&#xD;
      may be encountered during direct laryngoscope, leading to hypoxemia or neurological sequelae.&#xD;
      Injure to the teeth, gingiva or lips is also sometimes unavoidable. With the advent and more&#xD;
      widespread use of video-assisted laryngoscopy (VL), the incidence of difficult intubation has&#xD;
      decreased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the optimal position for endotracheal intubation facilitated by VL is not yet&#xD;
      determined. A previous study suggested that better glottic view is achieved when placing the&#xD;
      patient in a neutral position than the sniffing position during orotracheal intubation by&#xD;
      fiberoptic bronchoscopy. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of different&#xD;
      patient positioning (neutral position versus sniffing position) on the glottic view and&#xD;
      intubation time during orotracheal intubation facilitated by two video-assisted laryngoscopes&#xD;
      (McGrath laryngoscope and C-MAC D-blade laryngoscope).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 252 American Society of Anesthesiologists I-II patients, in the age above 20&#xD;
      years, who required orotracheal intubation for elective surgery were included in the study.&#xD;
      Patients received nasotracheal intubation, awake tracheal intubation, emergency surgery,&#xD;
      required rapid-sequence intubation (RSI), those in pregnancy, with possible difficult&#xD;
      intubation(with oropharyngeal pathology, limited neck mobility, previous head and neck&#xD;
      surgical history), anticipated difficult intubation assessed by preoperative Airway Difficult&#xD;
      Score(ADS)(â‰¥ 7), with allergy history of common anesthetics agents or any underlying&#xD;
      comorbidities which refrain them from receiving common anesthetic agents were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The types of VL and the orders of position were randomly allocated by computer and the study&#xD;
      take place in the operation room. Primary outcomes include airway difficulty (evaluated by&#xD;
      ADS), ease of intubation (evaluated by intubation difficulty scale [IDS], the percentage of&#xD;
      glottic opening [POGO]) and intubation time. By the indexes above and crossover analysis, the&#xD;
      study aimed to prove the ideal position for VL, improve the efficiency of intubation and&#xD;
      decrease the rate of difficult intubation by VL in the future.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>airway difficult score (ADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Airway difficult score (ADS) is assessed before induction and it take about 3 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Airway difficult score (ADS) represents the airway difficulty and it includes thyro-mental distance, Mallampati score, mouth opening, neck mobility and upper incisions. Each element will be scored from 1 to 3 points accordingly. The higher the scores are, the more difficult the airway could be. The minimum value and the maximum value of the airway difficult score (ADS) are 5 and 15 respectively. The definition of possible difficult airway is when the airway difficult score (ADS) score is more than 7 points.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>intubation difficulty scale (IDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>intubation difficulty scale (IDS) is assessed during intubation and the time it take depend on the difficulty of the case.</time_frame>
    <description>Intubation difficulty scale (IDS) represents ease of intubation and it includes times of intubation attempts, numbers of operators, grade of Modified Cormack-Lehane classification, lifting force, laryngeal pressure and vocal cord mobility. Intubation attempts, operators and grade of Modified Cormack-Lehane classification more than one will be scored directly to the numbers accordingly. The other elements will be scored from 0 to 1 point. The higher the scores are, the more difficult the intubation could be. The minimum value of the IDS is 0 and there is no limit of the maximum value. The definition of difficult intubation is when the intubation difficulty scale (IDS) score is more than 6 points.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>percentage of glottic opening (POGO)</measure>
    <time_frame>Percentage of glottic opening (POGO) is evaluated by another anesthesiologist up to 24 hours after intubation ,and it take about 1 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Both the glottic views in first position and in second position are evaluated as percentage of glottic opening (POGO) score, ranging from 0 to 100%. The glottic views will be recorded as digital image and be evaluated by another anesthesiologist subsequently.</description>

    <measure>intubation time</measure>
    <time_frame>Intubation time is assessed during intubation and the time it take depend on the difficulty of the case.</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Tissue injury, sore throat and hoarseness are evaluated in the postoperative period (the day after the surgery). Desaturation or not is assessed during the procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>Complications include tissue injury (injury to the teeth, gingiva or lips), sore throat, hoarseness and desaturation (SpO2&lt;95%), which are recorded as &quot;happened&quot; or &quot;not happened&quot;.</description>
