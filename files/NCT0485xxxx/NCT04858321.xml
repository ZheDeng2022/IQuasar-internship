  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic condition characterized by chronic&#xD;
      hyperglycemia and progressive insulin resistance, which progressively lead to macro- and&#xD;
      microvascular damage and subsequent impairments in blood pressure (BP) control. Therapeutic&#xD;
      approaches to manage T2DM focus on improving glycaemic control and BP and include&#xD;
      pharmaceutical treatments (e.g. Metformin and insulin), physical activity and exercise, and&#xD;
      calorie restriction. However, pharmaceutical interventions can be expensive and are&#xD;
      associated with low adherence. Although exercise and diet programs have been shown to be&#xD;
      effective, like pharmaceutical interventions, they often have poor adherence in people with&#xD;
      T2DM. With the number of people with T2DM (464 million) continuing to rise and expected to&#xD;
      reach 700 million by 2045, the costs associated with the clinical management of this&#xD;
      condition are likely to become unsustainable. There is, therefore, a need to explore the&#xD;
      potential of alternative interventions. In particular, interventions which may be cheaper&#xD;
      than clinical management and have better adherence than exercise, and hypoglycemic agents, to&#xD;
      improve glycemic control and deleterious cardiovascular manifestations of this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Passive heating may be one such intervention with therapeutic potential.&#xD;

      Current estimates suggest 422 million people worldwide live with a form of diabetes, of which&#xD;
      ~ 90% have type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The total direct and indirect cost of care for&#xD;
      individuals with diabetes in the UK is £23.7 billion, equating to ~ 20% of the annual NHS&#xD;
      budget, this figure is expected to rise to ~£39.8 billion by the year 2035. Approximately&#xD;
      85-90% of cases of T2DM arise from a poor lifestyle and obesity, with the remaining 10-15%&#xD;
      resulting from genetic predispositions. Current interventions include pharmaceutical&#xD;
      treatments, exercise and calorie restrictive diets, which aim to improve glycaemic control.&#xD;
      However, pharmaceutical interventions carry a high financial cost, while exercise and diet&#xD;
      programmes have a low adherence rate in individuals with T2DM. With the prevalence of T2DM&#xD;
      continuing to increase, the costs associated with the clinical care of these individuals are&#xD;
      likely to become unsustainable. Simple, inexpensive interventions to improve the clinical&#xD;
      profile of this group are therefore needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One emerging potential therapy to improve glucose homoeostasis is passive heating.&#xD;
      Preliminary evidence suggests passive heating may have beneficial effects for metabolic&#xD;
      health in animal models and in humans. In 1999, the use of hot tubs (38-41°C , 30 mins / day&#xD;
      for 3 weeks) was shown to reduce fasting plasma glucose concentrations by ~14% (1.3 mmol.L-1)&#xD;
      and decrease HbA1c by ~10-11 mmol/mol in 8 individuals with T2DM. Given the rate of turnover&#xD;
      in haemoglobin this reduction is surprising as the treatment period was run over 3 weeks and&#xD;
      the total haemoglobin turnover takes ~115 days. While more recent work has been conducted&#xD;
      into the effects of a single bout of passive heating in healthy adults and individuals with&#xD;
      T2DM (including ourselves, under review), none have been done on chronic heating since&#xD;
      Hooper. Hooper postulated that an increase in skeletal muscle blood flow may be responsible&#xD;
      for this increased glucose clearance, citing evidence that this can modulate insulin mediated&#xD;
      glucose uptake. Other mechanisms have also been purported, but have yet to be elucidated,&#xD;
      including; increased insulin sensitivity, altered inflammatory response, activation of heat&#xD;
      shock proteins (HSP), altered gut microbiome and butyrate. Repeated passive heating results&#xD;
      in transient increases in deep body temperature and may improve glucose homeostasis via&#xD;
      similar mechanisms to exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular aerobic exercise also improves macro- and microvascular function, muscle oxygenation,&#xD;
      autonomic function, cardiorespiratory fitness, lung function and delays age related muscle&#xD;
      loss. Acute exercise studies show that insulin sensitivity after 1h of moderate exercise does&#xD;
      not change, however, insulin sensitivity appears to be improved following bouts longer than&#xD;
      an hour or performed at greater intensity. Increases in insulin sensitivity have a&#xD;
      curvilinear relationship with energy expenditure and could also be due to greater HSP&#xD;
      expression. However, it is unrealistic for people with T2DM to perform this level of&#xD;
      activity. Passive heating may be one supplemental exercise mimetic to augment improvements in&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity, cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength, and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators recently provided evidence that acute passive heating in poeple with T2DM&#xD;
      (currently under review for publication) is well tolerated and increases extracellualr&#xD;
      [HSP70], and energy expenditure, and reduce diabstolic blood pressure. There is a growing&#xD;
      body of evdience that suggests passive heating may improve many facets of human physiology,&#xD;
      however, the mechanisms that underpin these benefits have yet to be established and future&#xD;
      research needs to explore these further.&#xD;
