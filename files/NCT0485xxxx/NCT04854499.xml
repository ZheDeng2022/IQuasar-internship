  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of Safety Run-in and Phase 2 Cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of the safety run-in cohorts of this study are to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of magrolimab in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab + 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) + platinum chemotherapy, and docetaxel in combination&#xD;
      with magrolimab in participants with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 Cohorts 1: To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) with magrolimab in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab + 5-FU + platinum versus pembrolizumab + 5-FU + platinum as&#xD;
      assessed by independent central review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 Cohorts 2 and 3: To evaluate the efficacy of magrolimab in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab and magrolimab in combination with docetaxel as determined by the&#xD;
      investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline; up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire is a specific questionnaire for cancer, it is composed of 30 questions (items) resulting in 5 functional scales, 1 global health status scale, 3 symptom scales, and 6 single items. Scoring of the QLQ-C30 is performed according to QLQ-C30 Scoring manual. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. Higher score for the functioning scales and global health status denote a better level of functioning (i.e. a better state of the participant), while higher scores on the symptom and single-item scales indicate a higher level of symptoms (i.e. a worse state of the participant).</description>

    <description>The head &amp; neck cancer module is a 35-item questionnaire designed for use among a wide range of participants with head &amp; neck cancer, varying in disease stage and treatment modality. It includes 7 multi-item scales that assess pain (4 items), swallowing (4 items), senses (2 items), speech (3 items), social eating (4 items), social contact (5 items), and sexuality (2 items). There are also 11 single items. Using a 4-point Likert scale, participants indicate the degree to which they have experienced symptoms. For all items and scales, high scores indicate more problems.</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a standard measure of health-related quality of life. The tool consists of the EQ-5D-5L descriptive part and the EQ visual analogue scale (VAS). The descriptive part comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Each of these 5 dimensions has 5 levels (no problem, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems). Results for each of the 5 dimensions are combined into a 5-digit number to describe the participant's health state.&#xD;
The EQ-VAS records the participant's health on a 0-100 mm VAS scale, with 0 indicating &quot;the worst health you can imagine&quot; and 100 indicating &quot;the best health you can imagine.&quot; Higher scores of EQ VAS indicate better health.</description>
