  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smartphone movement health assessment introduces a new measure of health that helps users&#xD;
      analyze and improve their mobility, stability and posture through performance of movements&#xD;
      and physical exercises. To verify the accuracy of this measure, the goal is to provide&#xD;
      data-driven evidence regarding its accuracy in comparison to gold standard tests for&#xD;
      measuring movement health. To address this challenge, the assessment scores will be&#xD;
      benchmarked to a set of gold standard tests and sensor metrics for measuring movement health&#xD;
      recommended by professional associations such as the American Physical Therapy Association&#xD;
      (APTA) or American College of Sport Medicine (ACSM) and found valid in clinical studies , .&#xD;
