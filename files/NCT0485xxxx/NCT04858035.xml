  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to measure the effects of online perceptual training on&#xD;
      perception and production in children with RSE who exhibit atypical perception relative to&#xD;
      norms from our lab-based pilot data. In a multiple-baseline across-subjects design, 10&#xD;
      children with RSE will begin in a baseline phase probing perceptual acuity for /r/.&#xD;
      Perceptual training with multiple types of stimuli will be initiated in a staggered fashion.&#xD;
      Production probes elicited before and after treatment will assess the extent to which&#xD;
      perception gains transfer to /r/ production.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following the initial evaluation to determine eligibility, participants will be enrolled in a&#xD;
      baseline phase in which perception and production abilities will be probed but not treated.&#xD;
      In a multiple-baseline across-subjects design with randomization, the 10 participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to transition from the baseline to the treatment condition at one of 7&#xD;
      possible points, ranging from 4 to 10 baseline sessions. After baseline sessions, perceptual&#xD;
      training will be delivered in twelve 30-minute sessions occurring 3 times per week for 4&#xD;
      weeks. The training is fully computerized and can be self-administered, but a study clinician&#xD;
      will attend one session per participant per week to ensure attention to study tasks. Each&#xD;
      session will feature three listening tasks of approximately equal duration. Following&#xD;
      perceptual training, participants will receive 4 60-minute sessions of production training&#xD;
      completed over two weeks.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study follows a multiple-baseline across-subjects design with random assignment of participants to different baseline durations. Following the initial evaluation to determine eligibility, participants will be enrolled in a baseline phase in which perception and production abilities will be probed but not treated. Perception will be measured using the online identification and category goodness tasks and production will be measured from standard probes (20 syllables, 30 words, and 10 sentences containing /r/ in various phonetic contexts). Participants will be randomly assigned to transition from the baseline to the treatment condition at one of 7 possible points, ranging from 4 to 10 baseline sessions. All participants will receive 12 sessions of perceptual training over 4 weeks followed by 4 sessions of production training over 2 weeks.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Pre- and within-treatment (up to one month); pre and 1 week post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment tasks 2 (identification) and 3 (category goodness judgment) are identical to the tasks used to assess performance in the baseline phase, with the single exception that accuracy feedback is provided during the treatment phase.&#xD;
Participants' progress will be tracked continuously across baseline and treatment phases using percent accuracy on these two tasks. In Task 2, accuracy in classifying stimuli as /r/ or /w/ will be assessed relative to the mean across responses from typical participants in the research team's lab-based pilot data. In Task 3, accuracy in category goodness judgment will be assessed relative to the &quot;goldstandard&quot; ratings determined by consensus across at least four expert listeners.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre- and within-treatment (up to one month); pre- and 1 week post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Consistent with the primary analysis, participants' progress will be tracked continuously across baseline and treatment phases using percent accuracy; however, percent accuracy scores will be analyzed separately for comparison between tasks (category goodness judgment and identification tasks) using the same analyses as the primary outcome.</description>

    <measure>Perceptually rated accuracy of /r/ production</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre- and 1 week post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>To assess generalization of perceptual training to production, participants will be assessed with standard probes administered in the first three baseline sessions and in three post-treatment maintenance sessions. Probes will elicit 30 words [considered the primary target], 20 syllables, and 10 sentences containing /r/ in various phonetic contexts. Stimuli in each probe will be presented individually in randomized order. No auditory models will be provided; for children with reading difficulty, semantic cues will be provided to elicit the intended word. Individual words will be isolated from the audio record of each word probe and presented in randomized order for binary rating (1=correct; 0=incorrect) by 9 naive listeners who are blind to treatment condition and time point (but will see the written representation of each target word). The research team will use the proportion of &quot;correct&quot; ratings for each token as our measure of perceptually rated accuracy.</description>

    <description>Participants will be randomly assigned to transition from the baseline to the treatment condition at one of 7 possible points, ranging from 4 to 10 baseline sessions. All participants will receive 12 sessions of perceptual training over 4 weeks. Finally, participants will complete a 3-session maintenance phase in which perception and production are probed but not treated. Perception will be measured using the identification and category goodness judgment.&#xD;
Following completion of perception training all participants will complete two weeks of production training. The production training will consists of 4, 60-minute sessions. Each session will provide instruction and practice trials.</description>

    <description>Perceptual training involves self-paced presentation of auditory stimuli via a computerized software program.&#xD;
Stimuli are organized into three separate tasks:&#xD;
Tasks 1 and 3 will train category goodness judgment: Participants will hear 75 naturally produced speech tokens containing /r/ from various speakers, with a balance of correct and incorrect productions. They will classify each /r/ as correct or incorrect and receive feedback on the accuracy of their classification. Tasks 1 and 3 differ in that task 1 will feature a subset of items designed to provide focused practice on a specific context (e.g., initial /r/ as in red; /r/ as syllable nucleus as in sir), with increasing difficulty over time, whereas task 3 will feature randomly selected items representing all contexts and difficulty levels.&#xD;
Task 2: Participants will hear 75 items drawn from the synthetic rake-wake continuum used in the identification task administered at baseline.</description>

    <description>Instruction: Discuss tongue shapes for /r/. Pre-practice: relatively unstructured, highly interactive elicitation; provide models and placement cue and KP on every trial.&#xD;
Structured syllable practice: Practice will occur in blocks of 10 consecutive trials on the same syllable (e.g., 10 /ra/), after which a new syllable will be addressed (e.g., 10 /re/--but note that in the fully blocked condition, the same syllable should occur in two consecutive blocks of 10).</description>
