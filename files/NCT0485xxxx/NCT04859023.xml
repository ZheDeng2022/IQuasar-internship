  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The virological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is pivotal for the control of the outbreak&#xD;
      by large screening of a- or pauci-symptomatic subjects. Despite nasopharyngeal swabbing&#xD;
      tested by RT-PCR is considered as the gold standard, new strategies based on self-samples are&#xD;
      considered as valuable alternatives because of their non-invasiveness and ability to be&#xD;
      performed in the absence healthcare worker, especially when the subject is asymptomatic and&#xD;
      needs to be tested repetitively. The aim of the present project is to evaluate two strategies&#xD;
      both based on self-samples: (i) a saliva sample combined to an anterior nare self-swabbing&#xD;
      tested by antigenic test versus (ii) a saliva sample tested by RT-PCR. The comparison will be&#xD;
      performed during a mass screening of the population of the city of Saint-Etienne (170000&#xD;
      inhabitants), France. The sensitivity of the rapid antigenic test will be evaluated in&#xD;
      comparison to that of RT-PCR considered as gold standard.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The main objective is to evaluate the performance of a strategy for screening for CoV-2-SARS&#xD;
      infection that would combine 1) a salivary self-sample with an anterior nasal swab and 2) a&#xD;
      diagnostic antigenic test, in comparison with the reference salivary RT-PCR technique&#xD;
      recently validated by National Authority for Health (HAS).&#xD;
