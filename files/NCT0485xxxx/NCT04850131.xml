  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Lichtenstein technique for hernia repair is safe and simple, but the underlying mesh&#xD;
      prosthesis has its setbacks, as it acts as a mechanical barrier5. The mesh does not provide&#xD;
      mobile and the physiologically dynamic posterior wall. The most dangerous complication&#xD;
      associated with the mesh prosthesis is its migration from the abdominal cavity's primary&#xD;
      implantation site. The relatively knew technique developed by Dr. Desarda does not utilize&#xD;
      the synthetic mesh rather it uses a strip of external oblique aponeurosis to strengthen the&#xD;
      posterior wall. Our study has compared the two methods regarding various aspects.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A total of 82 patients with inguinal hernias were selected randomly to participate in this study. They were subjected to either Lichtenstein hernioplasty or Desarda herniorrhaphy. A follow-up was conducted to analyze the hospital stay, return to work, recurrence rate, chronic pain, postoperative complications, and cost-effectiveness.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Desarda is a new tissue-based technique developed from applying the externally oblique muscle aponeurosis in the form of an undetached strip making the posterior wall in the inguinal canal stiffer. This paper focuses on analyzing comparisons between mesh-free Desarda repair and the Lichtenstein technique for the treatment of hernia inguinalis</description>
