      Rationale A recent study into the patient perspective of patients with multiple chronic&#xD;
      conditions in the Netherlands underlines the strain multimorbidity can put on people. Most&#xD;
      patients would appreciate more coordination from and communication with their care providers.&#xD;
      This call for better coordination of needs and preferences ties into the concept of Advance&#xD;
      Care Planning (ACP). ACP is a structured process of communication in which patients and&#xD;
      physicians discuss and, if applicable, document health preferences and goals of patients&#xD;
      regarding their last phase in life. Most ACP studies have been performed amongst older,&#xD;
      terminally ill patients with the main aim of establishing patients' preferences before they&#xD;
      lose capacity. We want to investigate the potential of ACP to increase patient empowerment in&#xD;
      a population of competent patients with multimorbidity, who are not necessarily in their last&#xD;
      phase of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The distribution of healthcare expenditure among the population requiring care is skewed. In&#xD;
      the Netherlands the top-10% most cost incurring patients account for 68% of expenditure. Many&#xD;
      of these patients receive unnecessary or ineffective care, with a recent study estimating&#xD;
      preventable spending at 10%. High-Need High-Cost patients comprise a very heterogeneous&#xD;
      group, yet one common denominator explaining high cost is the high prevalence of multiple&#xD;
      chronic conditions. Both overtreatment and conflicting treatment are legitimate concerns&#xD;
      within this population. As multimorbidity and frailty increase with age, the older patient&#xD;
      with multimorbidity is especially at risk. Targeted care programmes have been developed under&#xD;
      the assumption that better coordination will lead to a reduction in healthcare utilization.&#xD;
      However, although care might be identified as preventable or inefficient from a medical point&#xD;
      of view, this is not necessarily the case from a patient perspective. We are interested how&#xD;
      patients experience such care and thereby if better coordination would indeed lead to a&#xD;
      reduction in utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because ACP supports patients in timely recognition and better expression of their needs and&#xD;
      preferences, we hypothesize that care will address those needs and preferences more&#xD;
      adequately, which will result in improved patient assessment of care. We further hypothesize&#xD;
      that patient empowerment will enable better planning of care and decision making, which can&#xD;
      result in less unwanted or preventable interventions. As a consequence healthcare utilization&#xD;
      might decrease. However, another possibility is that rather than leading to a decrease,&#xD;
      improved empowerment may lead to an increase in utilization because care which is deemed&#xD;
      superfluous from a medical perspective might not be perceived as such by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective The primary objective of our pilot study is to assess the feasibility of a formal&#xD;
      Randomized Controlled Trial. Our secondary pilot objectives are to collect data on patient&#xD;
      experience of healthcare, patient engagement, cost-effectiveness, and other data that might&#xD;
      inform the design of a full-scale RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Randomized pilot study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population Patients over 65 years of age with polypharmacy, multimorbidity and multiple&#xD;
      hospitalizations and/or ER admissions in the past year&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention One of the most well-researched ACP programmes is the Respecting Choices&#xD;
      Programme. In this programme, a trained facilitator encourages patients to reflect on their&#xD;
      goals, values and beliefs, to discuss and document their future choices, and to appoint a&#xD;
      surrogate decision maker. The programme was translated to the Dutch context in previous&#xD;
      studies in the nursing home setting and oncology care. Patients randomized to receive ACP&#xD;
      will have two meetings with a trained facilitator within two months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints Primary: trial-feasibility is defined as the successful&#xD;
      inclusion of 50 patients in total, timely administration of the intervention in 25 patients,&#xD;
      adherence to follow-up procedures and identification of problems or barriers during&#xD;
      recruitment, inclusion, intervention administration and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: main outcome for cost-effectiveness is total duration and number of hospital&#xD;
      admissions, as a proxy for both costs and effects (iMCQ). In order to inform a future&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), data on health-related quality of life (EQ5D-5L) will also&#xD;
      be collected. Our outcomes for patient assessment of care and patient empowerment are the&#xD;
      PACIC questionnaire, the ACP Engagement Survey and the appointment of a surrogate decision&#xD;
      maker and/or the documentation of advance directives.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A recent study into the patient perspective of patients with multiple chronic conditions in&#xD;
      the Netherlands underlines the strain multimorbidity can put on people. Conducting&#xD;
      semi-structured, in-depth interviews it was established that besides the burden of disease&#xD;
      itself, patients struggled with managing the logistics such as regular hospital visits.&#xD;
      Another conclusion was that most patients would appreciate more coordination from and&#xD;
      communication with their care providers. This call for better coordination of needs and&#xD;
      preferences ties into the concept of Advance Care Planning (ACP). ACP is a structured process&#xD;
      of communication in which patients and physicians discuss and, if applicable, document health&#xD;
      preferences and goals of patients regarding their last phase in life. Most ACP studies have&#xD;
      been performed amongst older, terminally ill patients with the main aim of establishing&#xD;
      patients' preferences before they lose capacity. We are interested in potential of ACP to&#xD;
      increase patient empowerment in a population of high-need competent patients with&#xD;
      multimorbidity, who are not necessarily in their last phase of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When taking a closer look at healthcare expenditure, the distribution among the population&#xD;
      requiring care is skewed. In the Netherlands, the top-1% most cost incurring patients are&#xD;
      responsible for 24% of healthcare expenditure and the top-10% accounts for 68%. These numbers&#xD;
      are in line with international data. Public healthcare expenditure has been rapidly&#xD;
      increasing over the last decades, compromising the economic sustainability of healthcare&#xD;
      systems around the world. In the Netherlands, healthcare expenditure was 40.3 billion euro&#xD;
      (10,35% GDP) in 1998 and has risen to 96.1 billion euro (13,79% GDP) in 2016. The patients&#xD;
      that account for this cost-concentration have become an increasing target for care&#xD;
      management. Studies have shown these High-Need High-Cost patients receive unnecessary or&#xD;
      ineffective care with a recent study estimating preventable spending at 10%. Reducing such&#xD;
      care would not only reduce cost but has the potential to improve quality of care, patient&#xD;
      assessment of care and their quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The High-Need High-Cost patient population is very heterogeneous, yet one common denominator&#xD;
      explaining high cost is the high prevalence of multiple chronic conditions. Both&#xD;
      overtreatment and conflicting treatment are legitimate concerns within this population. As&#xD;
      multimorbidity and frailty increase with age, the older patient with multimorbidity is&#xD;
      especially at risk. Targeted care programmes have been developed under the assumption that&#xD;
      better coordination will lead to a reduction in healthcare utilization. But although care&#xD;
      might be identified as preventable or inefficient from a medical point of view, this is not&#xD;
      necessarily the case from a patient perspective. We are interested how patients experience&#xD;
      such care and thereby if better coordination would indeed lead to a reduction in utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the United States, the Patient Self Determination Act (1991) embodied the use of advance&#xD;
      directives to promote adequate communication. An advance directive (increasingly being&#xD;
      replaced by the term advance decision) must relate to a refusal of specific medical treatment&#xD;
      and can specify circumstances. It will come into effect when the individual has lost capacity&#xD;
      to give or refuse consent to treatment. Careful assessment of the validity and applicability&#xD;
      of an advance decision is essential before it is used in clinical practice. Valid advance&#xD;
      decisions, which are refusals of treatment, are legally binding. However, studies&#xD;
      demonstrated important limitations of advance directives such as the limited use of advance&#xD;
      directives despite many promotional efforts and the absence of positive effects on the&#xD;
      quality of care, quality of life (QOL) or satisfaction of patients and relatives. From the&#xD;
      mid-nineties, advance directives evolved to ACP, a more comprehensive approach where filling&#xD;
      in an advance directive or decision is only one part of a process of wider communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACP is a formalized process of communication between patients, relatives and professional&#xD;
      caregivers. It has been defined as &quot;a voluntary process of discussion and review enabling&#xD;
      individuals to express, and, if they wish, record views, values and specific treatment&#xD;
      choices to inform their future care&quot;. ACP promotes the documentation of patients' preferences&#xD;
      in their medical file, the communication of these preferences to family and friends, the&#xD;
      periodic review of preferences as circumstances change and the nomination of a health care&#xD;
      proxy. Modern ACP programmes aim at informing and empowering patients to express their&#xD;
      preferences about their current and future treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies addressing the effects of ACP programmes on end of life care are still rather scarce&#xD;
      which is probably due to their challenging nature. The few studies that have been performed&#xD;
      were mainly small scale with an observational design, often North American and predominantly&#xD;
      performed in a geriatric context. A review of the literature shows that ACP programmes have&#xD;
      the potential to improve communication between patients and healthcare professionals,&#xD;
      increase the quality of life and well-being of patients and their relatives, reduce futile&#xD;
      treatments and unnecessary hospitalizations, enhance provision of care consistent with&#xD;
      patient goals and increase satisfaction with care. Other studies also show ACP has reduced&#xD;
      costs. There are no studies to date that look at ACP in the wider context of multimorbidity&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process of ACP can be formalized through a complex ACP intervention such as the Let Me&#xD;
      Decide advance directive programme, the Respecting Choices Programme and the Making Advance&#xD;
      Care Planning a Priority (MAPP) Programme. In considering these programmes we looked at&#xD;
      (international) experience with the programme and their evidence-based effects. Let Me Decide&#xD;
      had potential as this decreased emergency calls to the ambulance service and both&#xD;
      hospitalisation and length of stay. However there was no difference in effect on patient&#xD;
      satisfaction. MAPP showed favourable effects on in-hospital death and hospitalisation but no&#xD;
      effect on hospital length of stay, hospice referral and days of hospice or palliative care.&#xD;
      The Respecting Choices Programme has recently been studied in a large international trial and&#xD;
      has been shown to increase compliance with end-of-life wishes, satisfaction with quality of&#xD;
      death and patients' satisfaction while decreasing depression, anxiety and death in the ICU. A&#xD;
      recent systematic review on interventions guiding ACP found that the main body of evidence&#xD;
      regarding interventions that were evaluated in a controlled trial concerned Respecting&#xD;
      Choices with six trials described in seven papers. This large body of evidence with&#xD;
      demonstrated effects on both healthcare use and patient satisfaction combined with local&#xD;
      experience with the programme led us to select the Respecting Choices Programme for this&#xD;
      pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The programme was developed in the US and successfully trialled in a geriatric setting in&#xD;
      Australia, showing that end of life care wishes were much more likely to be known and&#xD;
      followed in the intervention group (86%) compared to the control group (30%). In this&#xD;
      programme, a trained facilitator in collaboration with attending physicians encourages&#xD;
      patients to reflect on their goals, values and beliefs, to discuss and document their future&#xD;
      choices, and to appoint a surrogate decision maker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most ACP studies have been performed amongst older patients with the main aim of establishing&#xD;
      patients' preferences before they lose capacity. We believe that ACP can also increase&#xD;
      patient empowerment in a population of competent patients with multimorbidity, who are not&#xD;
      necessarily in their last phase of life. Because ACP supports patients in timely recognition&#xD;
      and better expression of their needs and preferences it will enable strategic and effective&#xD;
      planning of care and decision making. Our hypothesis is that as a result care will more&#xD;
      adequately address patients' needs and preferences resulting both in improved patient&#xD;
      assessment of care and receiving less unwanted or preventable interventions. We hypothesize&#xD;
      the latter is due to improved patient empowerment. However, another possible outcome is that&#xD;
      improved empowerment will not lead to a decrease of healthcare utilization (and might even&#xD;
      lead to an increase), as care which is deemed superfluous from a medical perspective might&#xD;
      not be perceived as such by patients. The choice for the Respecting Choices Programme was&#xD;
      made because it is one of the most evidence-based interventions available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because there is still some uncertainty about the feasibility of a formal RCT we have opted&#xD;
      to conduct a randomized pilot study. In this pilot we will conduct the intended formal RCT on&#xD;
      a smaller scale to draw lessons on the willingness to participate, response rates to&#xD;
      questionnaires and follow-up rates as well as potential differences in these matters between&#xD;
      the intervention and the control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this pilot is to assess whether it is feasible to conduct a full-scale&#xD;
      Randomized Controlled Trial studying the cost-effectiveness of ACP within the older&#xD;
      population with multimorbidity. The primary research question of such a trial would be&#xD;
      whether formalised ACP is cost-effective in achieving patient empowerment and improved&#xD;
      patient assessment of care.&#xD;
