      Prospective observational study to evaluate the clinical and radiological predictors for&#xD;
      outcome in hallux valgus (HV) corrective surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hallux valgus (HV) is the most common deformity in the adult forefoot. Characterizing and&#xD;
      classifying HV primarily has been based on weightbearing radiographic imaging. Understanding&#xD;
      of this pathologic process has mainly been confined to two planes, where the dominating&#xD;
      modality of choice has been assessment by antero-posterior (AP) and lateral radiographs. From&#xD;
      these two projections, imaging parameters have developed to define the severity of HV. With&#xD;
      this understanding as the basis for describing the deformity, more than 140 operative&#xD;
      techniques have been described. Although many of these techniques are of historical interest&#xD;
      only, consistently favourable outcomes remain elusive even among more popular current&#xD;
      techniques. HV corrective surgery is known to have mediocre results, with recurrence rate as&#xD;
      high as 30-70%. Unsuccessful treatment of the condition is amongst the most common in the&#xD;
      Norwegian patient injury compensation scheme (Norsk pasienterstatning, NPE). The variation in&#xD;
      corrective techniques and the associated persistent and clinically significant rates of poor&#xD;
      outcomes may indicate an incomplete treatment of the pathoanatomy of HV. Numerous recent&#xD;
      publications have proved that the hallux valgus deformity should be viewed as a&#xD;
      three-dimensional deformity. These recent studies have also pointed out new radiological&#xD;
      parameters in AP and axial view, focusing on the multiplanar understanding of the deformity.&#xD;
      The key challenge of the hallux valgus foot is the lack of clear guidelines for choosing the&#xD;
      best treatment to these large group of patients. There is of today no guidelines nor&#xD;
      consensus considering the indication for surgical treatment of the hallux valgus deformity.&#xD;
      It is not known how much nuisance the patient should present before surgery could be&#xD;
      worthwhile. Many studies have been made in the field of HV, but literature with the focus on&#xD;
      comparing the surgical correction and the patient related clinical outcome is sparse and&#xD;
      insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project the investigators primary aim is to investigate radiological and clinical&#xD;
      factors that predict outcome in participants operated for hallux valgus deformity.&#xD;

    <measure>Comparing the pre and postoperative Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire (MOXFQ) index score in participants operated for hallux valgus deformity</measure>
    <time_frame>Participant enrollement is expected to be completed within 3-4 years time, they will be evaluated preoperatively, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 52 weeks postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>The MOXFQ (Dawson et al., 2006) was developed to measure perceived foot-spesific functioning and health-related quality of life. The MOXFQ is supported as the current most valid, reliable and responsive foot &amp; ankle instrument (Jia, Huang &amp; Gagnier, 2017). It is aviable in Norwegian, but has not been validated in its translated form. The score compromises a total of 16 items. They are distributed within 3 dimensions; foot pain (5 items), walking/standing (7 items) and social interaction (4 items) where all items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale, score 0 (best) to 4 (worst). The MOXFQ index score (Morely et al., 2013) will be used as the main outcome and we define an increase of at least 15 points as a successful outcome. We plan to run multiple regression analysis with baseline parameters as well as radiological and PROM data as predictors. To accont for loss to follow-up we will include 250 patients in this study.</description>
