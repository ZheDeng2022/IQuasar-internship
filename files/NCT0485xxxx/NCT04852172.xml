  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The applicant is developing intravenous L-citrulline (Turnobi™) for treatment of sickle cell&#xD;
      disease (SCD). The current development program targets treatment of sickle cell-associated&#xD;
      vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) specifically. The aim of Part 1 is to identify the optimum dose&#xD;
      regimens for the Part 2 of the trial which is a double-blind, placebo controlled adaptive&#xD;
      'pick-the-winner' design. This study will allow assignment of more subjects to the better&#xD;
      treatment arm/s based on emerging data. The study, initially, will evaluate efficacy and&#xD;
      tolerability of incremental doses of intravenous (IV) L-citrulline (Turnobi™) in patients&#xD;
      with SCD while receiving standard of care therapy for VOC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Overall Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a study in children, adolescents, and young adults (6 to 21 years) with SCD&#xD;
      presenting to an emergency department (ED) with VOC. Children below age 6 are likely to be&#xD;
      recruited in a subsequent phase, once proof of concept is established on optimized dose&#xD;
      regimen. Eligible subjects will have documented SCD. Intravenous L citrulline (Turnobi™) or&#xD;
      placebo will be administered in addition to standard of care VOC therapy to children,&#xD;
      adolescents, and young adults presenting with SCD VOC - defined as painful episode without&#xD;
      other apparent causes of pain and without significant organ dysfunction or signs of systemic&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center study, conducted in 2 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: This is an open-label, ascending dose part of the study. After obtaining the informed&#xD;
      consent/assent, the enrolled subjects will be in the ED for up to 7 hours where L-citrulline&#xD;
      will be administered as depicted in the dosing panel below. Each dose will be administered&#xD;
      sequentially until 5 subjects per dose cohort are accrued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing panels in Part 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      25 mg/kg bolus + 9 mg/kg/hr infusion; 50 mg/kg bolus + 9 mg/kg/hr infusion; 100 mg/kg bolus +&#xD;
      9 mg/kg/hr infusion; 100 mg/kg bolus + 11 mg/kg/hr infusion;&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each panel of 5 have been dosed, response to a dose is determined by the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator (PI) with the internal review committee based primarily on analgesic effects&#xD;
      assessed by review of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score, opioid dosing, and tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the dose panel is assessed safe and 3 of 5 subjects in a cohort respond to the treatment,&#xD;
      the current dose arm will continue to accrue a total of 10 subjects. If the dose panel is&#xD;
      assessed as safe; however, fewer than 3 of the 5 subjects respond, the current dose arm will&#xD;
      be stopped, and the subjects will be recruited to the next dosing panel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two additional panels of 5 to 10 subjects receiving doses outside these ranges may be accrued&#xD;
      at the request of the internal review committee if determined necessary to achieve the&#xD;
      study's objectives. As long as supported by emerging data, the subjects in these additional&#xD;
      panels may receive a lower or higher bolus injection but no greater than 150 mg/kg bolus&#xD;
      and/or a lower or higher infusion dose but no greater than 15 mg/kg/hour. Up to 60 subjects&#xD;
      may be enrolled in Part 1 of the study with a likely sample size of approximately 40&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 of the study is intended to select up to 2 effective and tolerated dose regimens for&#xD;
      Part 2 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: The optimal dose regimens (at least1 but probably 2) selected from Part 1 will be&#xD;
      analyzed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled adaptive pick-the-winner design.&#xD;
      This will allow assignment of more subjects to the better treatment arm/s based on emerging&#xD;
      data. Efficacy will be based primarily on analgesic effect assessed by VAS/opioid dose&#xD;
      composite, admission or not, and tolerability based on adverse drug reactions by the internal&#xD;
      review committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 subjects will take part in Part 2. Subjects will be randomized to 2 of the&#xD;
      doses selected from Part 1 and placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. After 30 subjects (10 per treatment&#xD;
      arm) have been randomized, an interim analysis will be performed. If the higher dose is&#xD;
      providing markedly more pain relief than the lower dose - with no safety issues - then the&#xD;
      lower dose will be dropped. Otherwise, if efficacy and safety look similar, the lower dose&#xD;
      will be retained, and the higher dose will be dropped. In other words, the most successful&#xD;
      active treatment arm will be chosen for further study versus placebo. The internal review&#xD;
      committee will be responsible for making this decision. Subsequently, 30 more patients will&#xD;
      be randomized in a 1:1 fashion in the remaining 2 study arms (15 patients each). In the&#xD;
      unlikely case that the placebo arm demonstrates superior response to both active treatment&#xD;
      arms, the interval review committee will recommend discontinuing the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If after 30 subjects, it is determined by the internal review committee that 1 of the 2 doses&#xD;
      is significantly more effective in subjects with particular characteristics, the less&#xD;
      effective L-citrulline dose regimen can be dropped for those subjects, eg, if those with more&#xD;
      severe VOC only respond to the higher dose but those with less severe VOC respond equally&#xD;
      well to either dose, subjects with severe VOC will be adaptively allocated into a separate&#xD;
      stratum and randomized only to the higher dose or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects in both Part 1 and Part 2 will receive standard of care for analgesia per SCD&#xD;
      pain management protocol consistent with the Children's national ED guidance guided&#xD;
      individualized care plan irrespective of treatment with study treatment or placebo. The end&#xD;
      of the study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last subject in the study or&#xD;
      last scheduled procedure the last subject in the study.&#xD;
