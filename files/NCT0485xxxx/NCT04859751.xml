  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because of the high risk for development of muscle invasive disease, cystectomy is&#xD;
      recommended for CIS, high-grade Ta and T1 patients who experience disease recurrence&#xD;
      following intravesical therapy. VB4-845 injection is an experimental agent that may provide&#xD;
      an alternative to cystectomy&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer is the 6th most common cancer in the United States, affecting more men than&#xD;
      women. The usual first treatment for NMIBC (Ta, T1,and CIS) is transurethral resection of the&#xD;
      bladder tumors followed by intravesical immunotherapy, most commonly with bacillus&#xD;
      Calmette-Guérin (BCG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the high risk for development of muscle invasive disease, cystectomy is&#xD;
      recommended for CIS and high-grade Ta and T1 patients who experience disease recurrence&#xD;
      following intravesical therapy. For patients unable or unwilling to undergo cystectomy,&#xD;
      treatment options are limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VB4-845 injection is a recombinant fusion protein produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli) that&#xD;
      expresses a humanized single-chain antibody fragment specific for the epithelial cell&#xD;
      adhesion molecule (EpCAM) antigen linked to exotoxin A (ETA[252-608]). Once bound to the&#xD;
      EpCAM antigen on the surface of carcinoma cells, Vicinium is internalized through an&#xD;
      endocytic pathway. The ETA(252-608) is cleaved off and induces cell death by irreversibly&#xD;
      blocking protein synthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter bridging study in Chinese patients with&#xD;
      NMIBC, specifically CIS (with or without papillary disease), high-grade Ta or any grade T1&#xD;
      papillary disease, who have previously failed BCG treatment (i.e., not those who are&#xD;
      intolerant) with or without interferon. The study consists of a Screening period, a 12-week&#xD;
      Induction Phase, and a Maintenance Phase of up to 21 monthly cycles for a total treatment&#xD;
      period of up to104 weeks.&#xD;
