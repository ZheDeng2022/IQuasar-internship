  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab (MK-3745) in&#xD;
      combination with chemotherapy (Cisplatin combined with 5-Fluorouracil [FP regimen] or&#xD;
      oxaliplatin combined with capecitabine [CAPOX regimen]) versus placebo in combination with&#xD;
      chemotherapy (FP or CAPOX regimens) in the treatment of human epidermal growth factor&#xD;
      receptor 2 (HER2) negative advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma in adult Chinese&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypotheses of this study are that pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy is superior to&#xD;
      placebo plus chemotherapy in terms of overall survival (OS).&#xD;
