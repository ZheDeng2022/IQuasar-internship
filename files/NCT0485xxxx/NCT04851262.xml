  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the proposed project is to improve muscle strength in older adults with&#xD;
      possible sarcopenia by promoting home-based progressive resistance exercise. The target&#xD;
      population for health talks is community-dwelling older adults. A Three monthly home-visits&#xD;
      and weekly phone calls will be made. A waitlist randomised controlled trial will be conducted&#xD;
      to evaluate effectiveness, and qualitative feedback will be collected from participants. A&#xD;
      pilot study will be conducted first.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention is a 12-week home-based resistance training programme with phased progression. The intervention will have three phases: (i) an initial phase focused on training the target muscle(s)/movements with minimal or no external weight; (ii) an intermediate phase targeting muscle strength with increased practice resistance; and (iii) an advanced phase targeting the further enhancement of muscle strength by challenging multiple muscle groups. Each phase will involve exercises targeting the trunk, back, hip, upper-limb and lower-limb muscles.</description>

    <description>The intervention is to be taught by fitness trainer at the participants' home at the start of each phase. The exercise progression model for older adults recommended by the American College of Sports Medicine, which emphasise gradual increments in training load and systematically alter one or more programme components, will be adopted.</description>
