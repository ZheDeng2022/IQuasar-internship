  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a life long illness, the management of its early stage is the key in its&#xD;
      long term outcomes. The early stage of schizophrenia includes the prodromal and first&#xD;
      episode, during which the patients present psychotic symptoms (positive symptoms, negative&#xD;
      symptoms) and cognition deficits. Antipsychotics are often prescribed to treat these&#xD;
      symptoms, but more than one third patients do not respond well. Regarding cognition deficits,&#xD;
      for example, while the visual spatial learning evaluated using Brief Visuospatial Memory&#xD;
      Test-Revised (BVMT-R) of The Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in&#xD;
      Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) may play an important role in the&#xD;
      conversion of psychosis in the prodromal phase, there is still no corresponding intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a new non-invasive brain stimulation.&#xD;
      In previous studies, its applications mainly focus on negative symptoms and demonstrate&#xD;
      promising findings. However, its efficacy has much needing improvement, urgently needing&#xD;
      target optimizing and precision, especially according to the prominent complaints of&#xD;
      patients. To solve this issue, the present project proposed to make efforts in 3 aspects: to&#xD;
      recruit patients in early phase of illness, to administer rTMS of different protocols&#xD;
      according to the symptoms and cognition, and to associate the biotypes of functional&#xD;
      connectivity with rTMS's efficacy. All subjects will receive MRI scan before rTMS&#xD;
      intervention in the present study. The clinical efficacy of rTMS of the present protocol will&#xD;
      be applied to validate the biotypes of functional connectivity in early psychosis. The&#xD;
      biotypes will be determined using an existing independent dataset, which include 650&#xD;
      available cases of resting MRI (including 400 patients in prodromal phase, 100 patients with&#xD;
      first episode and 150 controls).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual rTMS target will be optimized basing individual neuroimaging navigation. In the&#xD;
      present protocol, we will recruit 300 new cases and perform a multicenter and randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial to test the efficacy of our optimized rTMS protocols. All patients will be&#xD;
      stratified according to their negative symptoms, positive symptom and cognition, and this&#xD;
      will be determined by a panel of psychiatrists and rTMS therapists. It is estimated that&#xD;
      about 100 cases in each of three subgroups. Subgroup 1 is characterized by prominent negative&#xD;
      symptoms and will receives rTMS over cerebellum and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.&#xD;
      Subgroup 2 is characterized by prominent cognition deficits and will receive rTMS over left&#xD;
      inferior parietal lobule, navigated by individual MRI and functional connectivity map with&#xD;
      left hippocampus. Subgroup 3 is characterized by positive symptoms and will receive deep rTMS&#xD;
      over ACC using H7 coil. The present project, if being performed successfully, will promote&#xD;
      the non-invasive physical therapy in psychiatry to a significantly higher level.&#xD;
