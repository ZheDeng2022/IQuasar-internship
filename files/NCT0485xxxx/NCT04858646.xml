      The aim of this research is to find the effects of aerobic exercise on gross motor function&#xD;
      in cerebral palsy patients. Quasai experimental study done at Noor Zainab Rehabilitation&#xD;
      center, Lahore. The sample size was 34. The subjects were divided in two groups, 17 subjects&#xD;
      with aerobic exercise 17 children with conventional treatment. Sampling technique applied was&#xD;
      purposive non probability sampling. Only 7-12 years individuals with GMFCS level I- III were&#xD;
      included. Tools used in the study were Gross motor function measure (GMFM-66 and 88) .Data&#xD;
      was be analyzed through SPSS 21.&#xD;

      Cerebral palsy&quot; an umbrella term for a group of irreversible and non-progressive&#xD;
      abnormalities of the fetal or neonatal brain, this can lead to disorders of movement and&#xD;
      posture. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) states that, it is the most&#xD;
      common cause of physical disability in children and young people in the developing world. CP&#xD;
      is condition with multiple causes; multiple clinical types; multiple associated developmental&#xD;
      pathologies, such as intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy, and visual impairment; and&#xD;
      more recently multiple rare pathogenic genetic variations Motor disability in cerebral palsy&#xD;
      is related with sitting, standing, walking and running appears as the main symptom in&#xD;
      children with CP, the assessment and management of CP have focused on gross motor function.&#xD;
      The Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) is designed by Russell et al. in 1993 is used to&#xD;
      measure the level of motor development and changes of gross motor function in a standardized&#xD;
      environment in children with CP. GMFM-66 is comprised of a subset of the 88 items identified&#xD;
      as contributing to the measure of gross motor function in children with CP, ranging from 0&#xD;
      (lowest motor function) to 100 (highest motor function). Cardiorespiratory endurance is an&#xD;
      integral component of physical fitness and has been identified as the most important fitness&#xD;
      component associated with health and mortality. In clinical practice, rebound is usually&#xD;
      offered as a 20 minute session, once per week for 6 weeks. Typical rebound therapy programs&#xD;
      target gross motor skill development, such as balance while sitting, kneeling, standing and&#xD;
      walking; functional transfers such as rolling and sit to stand; aerobic activity such as&#xD;
      jumping. It is theorized that using a trampoline improves muscle tone, posture, balance,&#xD;
      kinesthetic awareness, movement, body awareness, and communication. Aerobic exercise may&#xD;
      improve activity as indicated by motor function but does not appear to improve gait speed,&#xD;
      walking endurance, participation or aerobic fitness among children with CP in the short or&#xD;
      intermediate term. Researcher to conduct a study on effects of robot assisted gait training&#xD;
      in CP children, collect data from 14 consecutive children affected by CP, each session of 60&#xD;
      minutes, 20 daily sessions for 5 days per week. Saeid Fatorehchy et al. in 2019 conducted an&#xD;
      RCT, this study was to evaluate the effects of aquatic therapy in cerebral palsy patients.&#xD;
      Six children with average age of 7 years 4 months are included. Each sessions lasted for 50&#xD;
      minutes, comprising 10 minutes of warm up and stretching and 40 minutes of walking in pool at&#xD;
      different at different water depths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maria A. Fragala-Pinkham et al. stated that participation in routine physical activity is&#xD;
      important for health promotion and prevention of chronic health condition. Participating in&#xD;
      sports and active recreation can be beneficial on several levels for children and adults with&#xD;
      CP. At the body function and structure level of the ICF, improvement in fitness and endurance&#xD;
      have been documented for children and young with CP. Sports equipment that can be use are&#xD;
      cycling, swimming, sketching and outdoor active recreation.&#xD;

    <description>The Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) is an observational clinical tool designed to evaluate change in gross motor function in children with cerebral palsy. There are two versions of the GMFM - the original 88-item measure (GMFM-88) and the more recent 66-item GMFM (GMFM-66) The scoring system of the GMFM is a four-point scale divided into five categories (lying and rolling; sitting; crawling and kneeling; standing; walking, running).</description>
