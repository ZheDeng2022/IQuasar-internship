      A cluster-randomised controlled Phase IV trial (cRCT) assessing the impact of a&#xD;
      Vi-Polysaccharide conjugate vaccine in preventing typhoid infection in Asante Akim, Ghana&#xD;
      (TyVEGHA) with a primary endpoint of determining the total protection conferred by&#xD;
      single-dose vaccination with Vi-TT against blood culture-confirmed symptomatic S. Typhi&#xD;
      infection in the intervention vaccine clusters, compared with the control vaccine clusters.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Typhoid fever remains a significant health problem in sub-Saharan Africa, with incidence&#xD;
      rates &gt;100 cases per 100,000 person-years of observation. Despite the prequalification of&#xD;
      safe and effective typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCV), the uptake of these vaccines in African&#xD;
      countries has remained low. Real-life effectiveness data, which inform public health programs&#xD;
      on the impact of TCVs in reducing typhoid-related mortality and morbidity, are critical to&#xD;
      enhancing the introduction of TCVs in high-burden settings. Here we describe a&#xD;
      cluster-randomized trial to investigate population-level protection of TCV against blood&#xD;
      culture-confirmed typhoid fever. A total of 80 geographically distinct clusters have been&#xD;
      delineated within the Agogo district of the Asante Akim region in Ghana. Clusters will be&#xD;
      randomized to the intervention arm receiving TCV or a control arm receiving the meningococcal&#xD;
      A conjugate vaccine. The primary study endpoint is the overall protection of TCV against&#xD;
      blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever. Total, direct, and indirect protection will be&#xD;
      measured as secondary outcomes. Blood culture-based enhanced surveillance will enable the&#xD;
      estimation of incidence rates in the intervention and control clusters. Evaluation of the&#xD;
      real-world impact of TCVs will improve uptake of prequalified/licensed safe and effective&#xD;
      typhoid vaccines in public health programs of high burden settings.&#xD;
