  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has two components, an observational and a trial component. The observational part&#xD;
      is being done to screen for postpartum posttraumatic stress disorder by collecting mental&#xD;
      health assessments in women who are immediately postpartum for up to 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the project has a small number of subjects that will participate in a clinical&#xD;
      trial in which they would self-select to receive one dose of hydrocortisone intravenously&#xD;
      while they are in the hospital. This pilot of up to 20 participants in the trial arm is&#xD;
      designed to create a first indication of whether this could become an effective early&#xD;
      intervention to prevent PTSD if given while trauma memories are first being formed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This registration will list the observational part (number of participants =100) as well as&#xD;
      the clinical trial (number of participants =20).&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>PTSD assessed by the City Birth Trauma Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 29 question scale that can range from 0 to 60 (a higher score indicates greater severity of symptoms of PTSD). The response scale for symptoms asks for frequency of symptoms over the last week and is scored on a scale ranging from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 3 (&quot;5 or more times&quot;).&#xD;
The distribution of PTSD scores will be compared between the hydrocortisone group and matched controls using appropriate statistical techniques.</description>

    <measure>Mean depression scores assessed by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale19 (EPDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 10 question scale and scores can range from 0 to 30. Probable postpartum depression will be defined as a score ≥ 10 and reported as Yes or No. The scores will be compared across the two groups.</description>
