  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microvascular inflammation, the hallmark histological criteria of antibody-mediated rejection&#xD;
      in kidney transplantation, remains an issue in routine practice, due to a lack of&#xD;
      reproducibility in its recognition by pathologists and an incomplete comprehension of its&#xD;
      pathophysiology, leading to a poor treatment efficacy. The main objective of this study is to&#xD;
      assess the performances of tissue proteic signatures designed for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      microvascular inflammation in kidney transplantation, from formalin-fixed and&#xD;
      paraffin-embedded (FFPE) allograft biopsies analyzed by mass spectrometry-based proteomics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) is due to pathogenic antibodies produced by the donor&#xD;
      (donor-specific antibodies, DSA) that are directed against Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) or&#xD;
      other antigens (non HLA) of the graft. ABMR is currently the leading cause of long-term&#xD;
      kidney allograft failure. Histological lesions of microvascular inflammation (MVI) are the&#xD;
      hallmark criteria of ABMR according to the 2019 Banff classification. Lack of reproducibility&#xD;
      in the scoring of MVI by pathologists is still an issue of the diagnosis of ABMR in routine&#xD;
      practice, while the understood pathophysiological mechanisms of MVI (anti-HLA DSA, DSA&#xD;
      against non HLA antigens and/or NK cell-mediated) are poorly assessed in practice, possibly&#xD;
      explaining the wide variability of treatment efficacy. In a prior study, the investigators&#xD;
      confirmed the value of mass spectrometry for the analysis of the glomerular proteome during&#xD;
      ABMR, compared to the one of stable grafts, from FFPE biopsies. The investigators identified&#xD;
      82 proteins, particularly involved in leukocyte activation and the interferons pathways, in&#xD;
      accordance with transcriptomic approaches. Five proteins were validated by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators now propose to analyze kidney allograft FFPE biopsies of 92 patients by&#xD;
      mass spectrometry, including 32 with MVI (with and without anti-HLA DSA) and 60 with relevant&#xD;
      differential diagnoses. The main objective is to assess the diagnostic performances of tissue&#xD;
      proteic signatures designed by machine-learning methods for the diagnosis of microvascular&#xD;
      inflammation, the reference standard being the 2019 Banff classification. One of the&#xD;
      secondary objectives includes the comparison of the protein profile of MVI with and without&#xD;
      anti-HLA DSA, but also the proteomic analysis of 60 urine samples from the same population,&#xD;
      in order to assess the performances of mass spectrometry in the non-invasive diagnosis of MVI&#xD;
      in kidney transplantation.&#xD;
