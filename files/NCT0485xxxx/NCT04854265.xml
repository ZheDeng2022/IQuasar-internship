  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension (HTN) is a common cardiovascular disorder present globally. In spite of various&#xD;
      treatment approaches utilized in treating HTN, there is a surge in popularity of mindfulness&#xD;
      meditation (MM) in recent years. Although multiple techniques of MM are advocated to be&#xD;
      efficient in the treatment of HTN among hypertensive adults, the level of supportive evidence&#xD;
      is variable and limited. Therefore authors aim to conduct a systematic review to investigate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation on blood pressure (BP) among young adults.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hypertension (HTN) is one of the major culprit of cardiovascular disease and is potentially&#xD;
      leading to premature death and disability globally, exerting tremendous burden to public&#xD;
      health. A study in 2019 reported that globally, HTN affects 26% of world's population (972&#xD;
      million people), and the prevalence is expected to increase to approximately 29% by 2025,&#xD;
      which is driven largely by increase in economically developing nations. World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) in year 2015 stated that there is 1 in every 4 men and 1 in every 5 women&#xD;
      who had hypertension. A high prevalence of HTN highly cognate with diverse risk factors such&#xD;
      as age, gender, ethnicity as well as other modifiable factors like unhealthy diet and&#xD;
      physical inactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of hypertension ranges from pharmacological approach to lifestyle changes.&#xD;
      Antihypertensive medicines like Beta blockers, Calcium channel blocker, Alpha blockers,&#xD;
      diuretics and angiotensin receptor blocker are casually used in controlling and lowering the&#xD;
      blood pressure (BP). The cost of these ,medications is huge and are accompanied by many side&#xD;
      effects. Due to this, HTN centered lifestyle modifications has now become a cornerstone as&#xD;
      primary non-pharmacological first line therapy in the treatment of hypertension. Lifestyle&#xD;
      modifications on HTN emphasize on smoking cessation, a healthy diet with more fruits and&#xD;
      vegetables consumption, regular exercise of 10-20 minutes daily and so on. One of the&#xD;
      lifestyle modification found to be effective and potentially able to reduce the high BP as&#xD;
      potent as an antihypertensive drug is mindfulness meditation (MM). It is reported to reduce&#xD;
      the diastolic BP by 2 mmHg which can significantly reduce the pervasiveness of HTN of about&#xD;
      17%, risk of befalling stroke by 15% and coronary heart disease by 6%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no extensive peer-reviewed studies available to fortify the evidence of MM on HTN,&#xD;
      as BP is affected by a combination of genetic, behavioral and environmental factors which&#xD;
      cannot be easily controlled by meditation alone. In addition to that, to our knowledge no&#xD;
      systematic reviews have been published on topic of MT effect on BP among hypertensive adults.&#xD;
      Due to this, it is indispensable this study to be conducted to investigate the effect of MT&#xD;
      in controlling BP among hypertensive adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This systematic review will adherence to Cochrane guidelines. We will conduct an extensive&#xD;
      search of electronic databases such as the National Library of Medicine, Hindawi, Cochrane&#xD;
      library, Cochrane library Central Register of Control Trial, MEDLINE, Pub Med and PEDro for&#xD;
      eligible studies between 2000 to 2020. We will ensure that at least two bibliographic&#xD;
      databases are involved for systematic review to avoid publication bias and promote&#xD;
      generalizability of the results. To Attain optimal sensitivity and identify, all possible&#xD;
      trials of MM on HTN, cluster of search terms will be created for the types of intervention&#xD;
      (mindfulness or mindfulness meditations or Yoga or Tai Chi or QiGong) and another for&#xD;
      population (Hypertension or high blood pressure). The clusters will be combined with AND and&#xD;
      OR terms within the cluster.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this systematic review, criteria for inclusion will be studies which are of randomized&#xD;
      control trial design irrespective of type of MM used, any relevant studies published between&#xD;
      year 2000 and 2020. In the aspect of sample population, adults whose age is between 18-60&#xD;
      years or mean age below 60 years will be selected. According to America Heart Association,&#xD;
      only adults with stage 1 HTN (130-139/80-89 mmHg), stage 2 HTN (&gt;140/90 mmHg) or HTN crisis&#xD;
      (&gt;180/120) will be chosen in this review regardless of the severity or type of HTN (primary&#xD;
      or secondary). In addition, hypertensive patients with any other underlying health conditions&#xD;
      (heart disease, chronic kidney disease) will be included in this study. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be studies published before 2000, studies which are not reported in English, studies&#xD;
      which did not report BP as outcome measure, as well as BP measurement not implemented in a&#xD;
      pre-test and post-test basis, studies which only report as abstract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative analysis of the included studies will be used to establish narrative synthesis.&#xD;
      Besides, we will also incorporate tabulation with narrative synthesis to allow comparison of&#xD;
      findings to be made more easily. Post intervention differences in SBP and DBP between control&#xD;
      and experimental group will be scrutinized descriptively by using measures of treatment&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;
