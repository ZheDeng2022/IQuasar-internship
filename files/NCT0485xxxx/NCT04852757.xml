  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, infection with a new coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome&#xD;
      Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China and has since spread throughout the world. Forms&#xD;
      of varying severity of COVID-19, a disease induced by this emerging virus, have been&#xD;
      described in pregnant women. In addition to the direct effects of the virus on the pregnant&#xD;
      woman and the fetus, the pandemic context itself is likely to act as a psychological risk&#xD;
      factor and to alter the protective factors for mental disorders. This pandemic context is in&#xD;
      itself anxiety-provoking, even traumatogenic, particularly because of the potentially lethal&#xD;
      infectious risk that it conveys, all the more so in psychologically vulnerable populations.&#xD;
      In addition to the fear of viral contamination, the fear of childbirth and the postpartum&#xD;
      period, which includes a more or less important part of anxiety-provoking uncertainty, is&#xD;
      added to the fear of viral contamination in the perinatal period. This addition of stress&#xD;
      factors is likely to increase the prevalence of perinatal depressive disorders and anxiety&#xD;
      disorders, particularly the psychotraumatic experience of childbirth. Sanitary and social&#xD;
      measures, such as quarantine, restriction of access of accompanying persons to maternity&#xD;
      unit, or contagious isolation of mothers suspected of being infected or infected, which may&#xD;
      furthermore impose a separation of mother and child, are also likely to have&#xD;
      psychopathological consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, three maternity wards of the PREMA University Hospital Federation (UHF&#xD;
      PREMA) : Groupe hospitalier Paris Saint-Joseph (GHPSJ), Louis Mourier Hospital (APHP) and&#xD;
      Port-Royal Hospital (APHP), in partnership with the &quot;Centre de Psychopathologie du Boulevard&#xD;
      Brune (CPBB)&quot; and the psychiatry department of the Louis Mourier Hospital have set up a care&#xD;
      protocol consisting of a systematic screening offered to women following childbirth on the&#xD;
      first day of their pregnancy, aimed at identifying those with perinatal anxiety and&#xD;
      depressive symptoms. Women presenting symptoms are then treated according to the modalities&#xD;
      adapted to the organization of each of these three centers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Screening in these three centers is based on the use of a self-administered questionnaire for&#xD;
      the detection of depressive disorders, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), which&#xD;
      allows the calculation of a score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the EPDS, three other tools are used at the GHPSJ maternity : a questionnaire&#xD;
      to screen for anxiety, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S), and two for trauma&#xD;
      symptoms, the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire (PDEQ) and the&#xD;
      Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI). In this center, the screening includes a second phase&#xD;
      with a home mailing between 6 and 8 weeks after delivery: the EPDS, the STAI-S and the Impact&#xD;
      Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), another test screening for post-traumatic stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the protocol implemented in these three maternity hospitals, the present research&#xD;
      project aims to estimate the prevalence of postpartum depressive disorders at different times&#xD;
      during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. It will also aim to identify the factors associated&#xD;
      with the occurrence of these disorders, primarily to determine the association between&#xD;
      elements of the pandemic context and the risk of postpartum depressive and anxiety disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project, which is based on an epidemiological approach, thus aims to assess the mental&#xD;
      health risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Postpartum women are a particularly&#xD;
      vulnerable group, especially in terms of mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, 1 to 5% develop post-traumatic stress disorder during this period and 10 to 20%&#xD;
      develop post-partum depression. Furthermore, the National Confidential Survey on Maternal&#xD;
      Deaths (NCSMD) shows that suicide is now the leading cause of maternal death in France (i.e.,&#xD;
      death occurring between conception and the first year following birth), before postpartum&#xD;
      hemorrhage and before preeclampsia (data not yet published). From pooled English, Dutch, and&#xD;
      French data, we observe that 36% of maternal deaths occurring between conception and the&#xD;
      first year postpartum are deaths by suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated measures that went as far as confining the&#xD;
      population were very likely to increase the factors favouring the occurrence of mental health&#xD;
      impairment in the general population, but perhaps even more so in certain at-risk groups such&#xD;
      as postpartum women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pandemic context, whether through the fears associated with the viral infection for&#xD;
      oneself or one's family, or through the consequences of the exceptional measures put in place&#xD;
      in many countries to limit viral circulation, has had an effect on the general population and&#xD;
      on the population of women in pregnancy, in different contexts. To date and to our knowledge,&#xD;
      there is no data that would allow us to know the impact that this context may have had on the&#xD;
      mental health of pregnant women in France. Moreover, there are no studies, either in France&#xD;
      or elsewhere, on the impact of this pandemic context on the prevalence of psychological&#xD;
      disorders in the postpartum period. However, this period is already a time of particular&#xD;
      psychological vulnerability, a time when the risk of maternal suicide is at its highest. It&#xD;
      is moreover reasonable to think that the pandemic impact and the general and local measures&#xD;
      that accompany it may have an even greater impact during this postpartum period. The measures&#xD;
      taken to prevent and protect against viral dissemination have had the effect of completely&#xD;
      closing most maternity services to fathers and thus depriving mothers, totally or partially,&#xD;
      of social and marital support and, in some situations, of physical proximity to their&#xD;
      children, all of which are risk factors for postpartum depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the perinatal context, it has also been documented that post-traumatic stress disorder is&#xD;
      strongly associated with the risk of perinatal depression.&#xD;
