  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to initially evaluate the optimal dose, efficacy, and safety of&#xD;
      vitamin D3 for reducing recurrence of recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a multiple disease that ranks second only to respiratory&#xD;
      infections in infectious diseases and is one of the most common infectious diseases among&#xD;
      adults. After the first urinary tract infection, the probability of recurrence within half a&#xD;
      year and within one year was as high as 24% and 70%, respectively. Urinary tract infection&#xD;
      itself has the characteristics of easy recurrence, which is closely related to the abuse of&#xD;
      antibiotics, the generation of bacterial resistance, and the decline of local immune function&#xD;
      of mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the urinary tract, the antibacterial peptide Cathelicidin is mainly located in the&#xD;
      proximal tubules of the kidney and the epithelial cells of the renal pelvis and ureter. LL37&#xD;
      is the only antibacterial peptide present in the human body of the Cathelicidin family, which&#xD;
      can be regarded as a natural antibiotic produced by the body. Antibacterial peptides have a&#xD;
      broad-spectrum antibacterial effect and can exert antibacterial effects against both&#xD;
      Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Vitamin D intake increases the activity of&#xD;
      endogenous antimicrobial peptides. Preclinical cell test of Zensun Sci. &amp; Tech. Co., Ltd.&#xD;
      confirmed the induction of LL37 in urethral epithelial cells by vitamin D and its&#xD;
      broad-spectrum antibacterial effect. Animal experiments also showed the therapeutic effect of&#xD;
      LL37 on UTI.&#xD;
