      Investigation of Natural Cycle In vitro Fertilisation (NC-IVF) treatment with ovulation&#xD;
      induction with a nasal GnRH agonist instead of regular NC-IVF treatment with subcutaneous&#xD;
      application of hCG with the objective of increasing treatment tolerability and reducing&#xD;
      discomfort while being equally successful in terms of embryo transfer rates.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In vitro Fertilisation (IVF) treatments can be performed without gonadotropins to reduce side&#xD;
      effects. These kinds of IVF treatments are called Natural Cycle IVF (NC-IVF). As NC-IVFs are&#xD;
      almost equally effective as classical IVF with gonadotropins but less stressful, they are&#xD;
      preferred by many women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, a relevant burden in NC-IVF still is the ovulation induction by self-injection of&#xD;
      human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Replacing hCG injection by a nasally applicable Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone agonist&#xD;
      (GnRHa) might reduce this discomfort. GnRHa are already used to induce ovulation in classical&#xD;
      IVF treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of our study ist to answer the question whether NC-IVF treatment with a nasal&#xD;
      GnRH agonist can increase treatment tolerability and reduce discomfort while being equally&#xD;
      successful in terms of embryo transfer rates than NC-IVF treatment with subcutaneous&#xD;
      application of hCG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a randomized controlled proof-of-concept trial. It will be performed in two&#xD;
      steps whereas the power analysis only relates to the first step which is&#xD;
      prospective-randomized and will be performed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the start of the first NC-IVF treatment cycle the patients will be randomized in&#xD;
      equal parts by electronic randomisation to receive either the standard therapy with hCG&#xD;
      injection (Intervention A) or the study therapy with nasal GnRHa (Intervention B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Intervention A: As soon as the expected follicle size is &gt;15 mm, ovulation will be induced&#xD;
      by injecting 5.000 IU hCG. The follicle aspiration, including flushing of the follicle will&#xD;
      be performed 36 hours later. The transfer of the embryo will be performed 2-5 days after the&#xD;
      aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to determine estradiol- and progesterone concentrations blood will be taken 10±1&#xD;
      days after the hCG application. Pregnancy will be confirmed or excluded by hCG testing in&#xD;
      serum or urine 14-21 days after the follicle aspiration. In case of positive hCG testing,&#xD;
      clinical pregnancy will be confirmed by vaginal ultrasound 4-6 weeks after follicle&#xD;
      aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Intervention B: The study therapy (Intervention B) will be performed identically as&#xD;
      Intervention A with the following exception: Instead of injecting subcutaneous hCG the&#xD;
      patients will apply 1 hub of a GnRHa nasal spray (200 microg Nafarelin) to induce ovulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is no pregnancy achieved in the first treatment cycle, the patients will switch to&#xD;
      the respective other intervention (cross-over design). This procedure allows for an&#xD;
      intraindividual comparison of the main outcomes (treatment tolerability and discomfort).&#xD;
      Again, the two interventions will be performed as described in step 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the study, all participants will fill in the Fertility Quality of Life&#xD;
      (FertiQoL) Core questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each treatment cycle, they will additionally fill in the FertiQoL Treatment questionnaire&#xD;
      and a set of visual analog scale (VAS) questions concerning the level of discomfort&#xD;
      encountered in the treatment.&#xD;
