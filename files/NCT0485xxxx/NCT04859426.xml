    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of&#xD;
      DBPR108 in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (HI) compared to the matched&#xD;
      control subjects with normal hepatic function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DBPR108 is a potent dipeptidylpeptidase-4 inhibitor. The aim of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and safety of DBPR108 in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment&#xD;
      (HI) compared to the matched control subjects with normal hepatic function. This study&#xD;
      consists of a screening period (Day -14 to Day -1), a baseline period (Day -1), a treatment&#xD;
      period (Day 1 to Day 3), and a follow-up call on Day 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be enrolled in the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (A) mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A, 5-6 points); (B) moderate hepatic impairment&#xD;
      (Child-Pugh class B, 7-9 points); (C) control subjects with normal hepatic function will be&#xD;
      matched with subjects with HI by weight, age, and sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 8 subjects will be enrolled in each group.&#xD;
