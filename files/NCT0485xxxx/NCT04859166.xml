      Organoids are generated from tumor biopsies, taken during a standard procedure. and are a&#xD;
      collection of organ-specific cell types that are able to self-organize in-vitro in a manner&#xD;
      similar to the in-vivo situation (3D). They have the capability to facilitate in-depth&#xD;
      analysis of patient's own tumor material at point of diagnosis and during&#xD;
      progressive/recurrent disease. There is currently no published protocol to establish&#xD;
      long-term lung cancer organoids from lung cancer patients. Such a methodology would enable&#xD;
      the prospective identification of 'patient tailored optimal treatments&quot; as well as the&#xD;
      derivation of predictive biomarkers for response and relapse. Apart from organoids, xenograft&#xD;
      models also still have their merits. To generate PDX, tumor material will be retrieved from&#xD;
      surgical specimens, cut in small pieces, transplanted in the recipient immune deficient&#xD;
      animals either subcutaneously or implanted directly into the lung. A tumor with the median&#xD;
      growth rate will be serially transplanted in vivo for further therapeutic experiments.&#xD;
      Dedicated small animal irradiaton in our facility enables precise local irradiation of lung&#xD;
      tumors with minimal radiation exposure of the surrounding normal tissues. Integrated cone&#xD;
      beam computed tomography imaging system allows longitudinal monitoring of tumor response to&#xD;
      novel treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the most important barriers to achieve durable responses in advanced lung cancer is&#xD;
      intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity, a common feature of human solid cancers. Tumor&#xD;
      heterogeneity is thought to be driven by a subpopulation of tumor cells termed lung cancer&#xD;
      initiating cells or lung cancer stem cells that reflect the 'cell or origin&quot; and maintain&#xD;
      self-renewaland multipotent properties of these cells but that are transformed. Organoid&#xD;
      technology has enabled the culturing of normal and transformed 'stem cells&quot; directly from&#xD;
      patients without any genetic manipulation (i.e.IPS). Such normal and cancer organoids&#xD;
      maintain many of the properties of the tumors and are thought to be an excellent in vitro 3D&#xD;
      model system. In a lab, investigators have successfully established primary 2D and 3D cell&#xD;
      culture systems including organoids from the proximal bronchus coming from lobectomies. They&#xD;
      are using these systems to predict normal tissue complication to combination treatments. It&#xD;
      has been demonstrated that lung stem cell pathways such as the NOTCH signaling pathway are&#xD;
      frequently deregulated in lung cancers and is associated with a worse outcome. In vitro and&#xD;
      in preclinical models deregulation of the NOTCH pathway is associated with resistance to&#xD;
      radiotherapy and first-line chemotherapy. Thus blocking the NOTCH pathway may improve&#xD;
      treatment response. Checkpoint inhibitors have changed the outcome of patients with&#xD;
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in first and in second line, with improved&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and quality of life. Radiotherapy has&#xD;
      consistently been shown to activate key elements of the immune system that are responsible&#xD;
      for resistance for immune therapy. Radiation upregulates MHC-class I molecules that many&#xD;
      cancer cells lack or only poorly express, tumor-associated antigens, provokes immunogenic&#xD;
      cell death, activates dendritic cells, decreases regulatory T-cells (Tregs) in the tumor,&#xD;
      broadens the T-cell repertoire and increases T-cell trafficking, amongst many other effects.&#xD;
      Radiation may convert a completely or partly poorly or non-immunogenic tumor immunogenic.&#xD;
      Radiotherapy in combination with different forms of immune therapy such as anti-PD-(L)1,&#xD;
      anti-CTLA4, immunocytokines, dendritic cell vaccination and Toll-like receptor agonists&#xD;
      improved consistently local tumor control and very interestingly, lead to better systemic&#xD;
      tumor control (the &quot;abscopal&quot; effect) and the induction of specific anti-cancer immunity with&#xD;
      a memory effect. Moreover, as PD1/PD-L1 is upregulated by radiation and radiation can&#xD;
      overcome resistance for PD-(L)1 blockage, their combination is logical. The best timing,&#xD;
      sequencing and dosing of all modalities is a matter of intense research. Radiotherapy may&#xD;
      well become an integral part of immune therapy against cancer. Nevertheless, as with all&#xD;
      treatments, optimal biomarkers for response are lacking. They would not only allow patient&#xD;
      selection, but would also give insight in resistance mechanisms and the identification of new&#xD;
      targets or the optimal use of current medications and radiation, such as dosing and&#xD;
      sequencing. Moreover, not only biomarkers for tumor response, but also for side effects are&#xD;
      needed, for the latter may be dose-limiting and result in the omission of therapy in the more&#xD;
      frail and older patient population. Putative biomarkers for immune response are those&#xD;
      associated with immunogenic cell death (ICD). Organoids are generated from tissue biopsies,&#xD;
      and are a collection of organ-specific cell types that are able to self-organize in-vitro in&#xD;
      a manner similar to the in-vivo situation (3D). They have the capability to facilitate&#xD;
      in-depth analysis of patient's own tumor material at point of diagnosis and during&#xD;
      progressive/recurrent disease. There is currently no published protocol to establish&#xD;
      long-term lung cancer organoids from lung cancer patients. Such a methodology would enable&#xD;
      the prospective identification of 'patient tailored optimal treatments&quot; as well as the&#xD;
      derivation of predictive biomarkers for response and relapse. Apart from organoids, xenograft&#xD;
      models also still have their merits. In xenografts, human tumor cells or pieces are injected&#xD;
      in immunocompromised mice. Especially xenografts derived from fresh human cancer specimen&#xD;
      have gained much attention for the same tumor as in an individual patient can be grown in a&#xD;
      mice allowing to study the response to therapy and the mechanisms of resistance.&#xD;
      Patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) models are more reflective of patient population in&#xD;
      terms of the parental tumors' histomorphological characteristics, the effect of clonal&#xD;
      selection and evolution on maintaining genomic integrity in low-passage PDXs compared to the&#xD;
      donor tissue. While organoids can give many insights into molecular biology of the response&#xD;
      to various anti-cancer therapies, in vivo models allow testing novel anti-cancer therapeutic&#xD;
      approaches taking complex tumor microenvironment into account reflecting at least in part&#xD;
      clinical situation. As a clinically representative tool that best recapitulates the&#xD;
      biological properties of their respective tumor type, PDX models could serve as an important&#xD;
      aid in personalized medicine studies as well. The tumor can be transplanted subcutaneously,&#xD;
      but more recently also orthotopically (e.g. a breast cancer is transplanted in the breast of&#xD;
      a mouse) to investigate the interaction between the tumor and the environment. In Maastro&#xD;
      lab, we have experience with a variety of these models including orthotopic lung tumor&#xD;
      models. To generate PDX, tumor material will be retrieved from surgical specimens, cut in&#xD;
      small pieces, transplanted in the recipient immune deficient animals either subcutaneously or&#xD;
      implanted directly into the lung. A tumor with the median growth rate will be serially&#xD;
      transplanted in vivo for further therapeutic experiments. Dedicated small animal irradiator&#xD;
      in the investigators facility enables precise local irradiation of lung tumors with minimal&#xD;
      radiation exposure of the surrounding normal tissues. Integrated cone beam computed&#xD;
      tomography imaging system allows longitudinal monitoring of tumor response to novel&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
