      The proposed pilot study will assess the feasibility of transcranial alternating current&#xD;
      stimulation (tACS) to enhance aspects of attention in people with psychotic disorders.&#xD;
      Patients and controls will each undergo two sessions of tACS while completing a visual task.&#xD;
      One session will be set to 2 Hz above the participant's individual alpha peak frequency&#xD;
      (IAPF) and the other session will be set to 2 Hz below the participant's IAPF. The tACS will&#xD;
      be applied with a current of 1-2 mA (milliamperes) via two saline soaked electrode sponges&#xD;
      (25 cm²) applied to the back of the head. The investigator's hypothesis is that participant's&#xD;
      will perform better on the visual task while tACS is set to 2 Hz above their IAPF, relative&#xD;
      to tACS set to 2 Hz below their IAPF.&#xD;

      The proposed pilot study will assess the feasibility of transcranial alternating current&#xD;
      stimulation (tACS) to enhance aspects of attention in people with psychotic disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant agrees to participate in this research, they will be asked to visit the&#xD;
      study site to complete the activities listed below. These study activities will take about&#xD;
      5.5 hours to complete. The activities can be divided into up to 3 separate sessions as&#xD;
      needed, but all activities should be completed within approximately one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent (30 minutes): The study team will review this consent form with the participant. If&#xD;
      they agree to participate in this research, they will sign and date the consent form. They&#xD;
      will receive a copy of the signed consent form for your records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline clinical assessments (60-90 minutes): Participants will be asked to complete&#xD;
      interviews and assessments to test their cognition and to confirm any diagnoses of psychosis&#xD;
      or mood disorders. They will also be asked to complete a demographics questionnaire. The&#xD;
      psychosis group will be asked to complete an additional clinical assessment and will receive&#xD;
      additional compensation accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroencephalogram (EEG, 120 minutes): After study staff set up the gel-filled EEG cap on&#xD;
      the participant's head, they will be asked to complete a few tasks on the computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      tACS with Double-Flash Fusion Illusion task (90 minutes): The participant will undergo 2 runs&#xD;
      of a computerized task while simultaneously undergoing tACS stimulation. The tACS setup&#xD;
      involves a neoprene cap (like a swim cap) with two electrodes covered by saline-soaked&#xD;
      sponges. The stimulation system will deliver a small amount of electrical current through the&#xD;
      saline-soaked sponges. Each task run is expected to last about 15-20 minutes, with a&#xD;
      40-minute break between sessions. During this break, you will be asked to perform two&#xD;
      computerized BrainHQ tasks that look at your auditory and visual perception. After both&#xD;
      sessions are complete, you will complete a questionnaire about the stimulation procedure and&#xD;
      whether you experienced any adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One tACS session will be set to 2 Hz above the participant's individual alpha peak frequency&#xD;
      (IAPF) and the other session will be set to 2 Hz below the participant's IAPF. The tACS will&#xD;
      be applied with a current of 1-2 mA (milliamperes) via two saline soaked electrode sponges&#xD;
      (25 cm²) applied to the back of the head. The investigator's hypothesis is that participant's&#xD;
      will perform better on the visual task while tACS is set to 2 Hz above their IAPF, relative&#xD;
      to tACS set to 2 Hz below their IAPF.&#xD;

    <description>Participants are instructed to fixate their gaze on a central fixation cross. When the cue appears, a low-luminance disc stimulus flashes on either side (left or right) of the fixation cross. The disc can flash one or two times. After the stimulus ends, participants are cued to make a response regarding the number of disc flashes (1 or 2). Participants will undergo 300 trials. Participants will be scored on response accuracy (i.e., number of correct responses out of 300 possible responses).</description>
