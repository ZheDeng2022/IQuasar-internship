    <textblock>
      The prescribing information provides information on medicines. This study will check the&#xD;
      number of patients starting febuxostat and the number of febuxostat users with cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease after changes to the prescribing information.&#xD;

      This is a descriptive, cross-sectional, non-interventional study of participants with gout.&#xD;
      The study will evaluate the impact of the 2019 labeling changes (boxed warning and modified&#xD;
      indication), based upon results of the cardiovascular safety of febuxostat and allopurinol in&#xD;
      participants with gout and cardiovascular morbidities (CARES) trial, on febuxostat&#xD;
      utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate data from approximately 24046 participants. The data will be&#xD;
      collected from optum clinformatics dataMart (CDM) including the medicare advantage&#xD;
      administrative US claims database and the IQVIA pharmetrics plus claims database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be enrolled in a single observational cohort. This trial will be&#xD;
      conducted in the United States. The overall duration of this study is approximately 14&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants Newly Initiating Febuxostat Therapy Versus Prevalent New Users</measure>

    <description>Participants will be categorized into new users and prevalent new users. New users are participants who were na√Øve to allopurinol, defined as no record of allopurinol use in all historic pharmacy or medical claims at any time prior to initiation of febuxostat. Prevalent new users are participants who had used allopurinol and switched, defined as at least one record of allopurinol use in all historic pharmacy or medical claims at any time prior to initiation of febuxostat.</description>
