      This phase I trial studies the effects of ONC201 in combination with standard of care&#xD;
      radiation therapy in treating patients with glioblastoma that has come back (recurrent).&#xD;
      ONC201 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth. Radiation therapy uses high energy photons to kill tumors cells and shrink tumors.&#xD;
      Giving ONC201 in combination with radiation therapy may help treat patients with recurrent&#xD;
      glioblastoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of Akt/ERK Inhibitor ONC201 (ONC201) in&#xD;
      combination with radiotherapy before a tumor resection in recurrent glioblastoma (GBM)&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the ability of ONC201 to decrease glioblastoma-initiating cells as&#xD;
      determined by percentage of neurosphere formation of treated brain tumor tissues compared to&#xD;
      non-treated brain tumor tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the ability of ONC201 to decrease glioblastoma-initiating cells as determined&#xD;
      by expression of glioma stem cells using ribonucleic acid-sequencing (RNA-Seq) of treated&#xD;
      brain tumor tissues compared to non-treated brain tumor tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the ability of ONC201 to inhibit Akt by evaluating progressive disease (PD)&#xD;
      markers by immunohistochemistry such as Sox2, Oct3/4, Nanog, Akt and p-Akt, GSK3 and&#xD;
      pGSK3alpha.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). II. To determine&#xD;
      the immunogenicity of the combination of ONC201 + radiation therapy (RT) via immune cell&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine if the combination of ONC201 + RT leads to increase cholesterol synthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine molecular markers of response to ONC201 in correlation to survival such as&#xD;
      DRD5 expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients undergo radiation therapy for 10 fractions over 2 weeks, and receive ONC201&#xD;
      orally (PO) daily on days 1, 2, 8, and 9. Beginning 24 hours after completion of radiation&#xD;
      therapy, patients undergo surgical resection. Beginning 7 days from last pre-surgery dose of&#xD;
      ONC201, patients receive ONC201 PO daily on two consecutive days weekly (2 days on/5 days&#xD;
      off) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients undergo radiation therapy for 10 fractions over 2 weeks. Beginning 24 hours&#xD;
      after completion of radiation therapy, patients undergo surgical resection. After recovery&#xD;
      from surgery, patients receive ONC201 PO daily on two consecutive days weekly (2 days on/5&#xD;
      days off) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
