      The Cessation of Smoking Trial in the Emergency Department (CoSTED) is an National Institute&#xD;
      for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) funded randomised controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT). The research question is &quot;in people attending the Emergency Department who&#xD;
      smoke, does a brief intervention (including the provision of an electronic cigarette&#xD;
      (e-cigarette) and referral to stop smoking services) increase smoking cessation in comparison&#xD;
      with usual care and is it cost effective?&quot; The trial includes an internal pilot, health&#xD;
      economic evaluation and process evaluation. The primary outcome is smoking cessation,&#xD;
      self-reported as continuous smoking abstinence, biochemically validated by carbon monoxide&#xD;
      monitoring with cut off of ≥8ppm. The sample size is 972 (486 in intervention and control)&#xD;
      across 6 sites.&#xD;

      Research question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In people attending the Emergency Department who smoke, does a brief intervention (including&#xD;
      the provision of an e-cigarette and referral to stop smoking services) increase smoking&#xD;
      cessation in comparison with usual care and is it cost effective?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tobacco smoking is the leading cause of years of life lost in the United Kingdom (UK), and&#xD;
      negatively impacts significantly on physical health conditions and recovery outcomes from&#xD;
      injury or surgery. Currently, smoking prevalence is recorded at approximately 15% of the&#xD;
      population, but this masks substantial variation between different population groups. Patient&#xD;
      and Public Involvement (PPI) development work demonstrates that prevalence of smoking for&#xD;
      people attending the emergency department is approximately 24%. Most current smokers will, if&#xD;
      asked, state that they want to quit, but need support. The National Health Service (NHS) long&#xD;
      term plan and the Tobacco control plan for England recommend smokers are supported to quit at&#xD;
      every contact with the health service by 2023/4. To date there have been no RCTs of smoking&#xD;
      cessation support in the Emergency Department (ED) setting in the UK, which potentially&#xD;
      provides a highly motivating opportunistic route to intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To undertake an RCT, with internal pilot, comparing a brief intervention (including provision&#xD;
      of an e-cigarette and referral to local smoking cessation services), assessing long term&#xD;
      smoking abstinence, in people attending Emergency Departments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To run an internal pilot study, with clear stop/go criteria, primarily to test&#xD;
           recruitment systems&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To definitively test real-world effectiveness of an ED based smoking cessation&#xD;
           intervention in comparison with usual care, by comparing smoking abstinence at 6 month&#xD;
           follow-up between trial groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To undertake a cost effectiveness analysis of the intervention in comparison with usual&#xD;
           care, from an NHS and personal social services (PSS) perspective&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To undertake an embedded mixed-methods process evaluation to assess delivery,&#xD;
           implementation, fidelity and contamination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomised Controlled Trial of people who smoke attending an Emergency Department, with an&#xD;
      internal pilot, health economic evaluation and process evaluation. The primary outcome is&#xD;
      smoking cessation, self-reported as continuous smoking abstinence, biochemically validated by&#xD;
      carbon monoxide monitoring with cut off of ≥8ppm. The sample size is 972 (with a power of 90%&#xD;
      and a difference in quit rates between the groups of 6%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated impact and dissemination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will definitively test an ED based smoking cessation intervention and make&#xD;
      recommendations for future implementation if effective. The intervention has the potential to&#xD;
      reduce smoking prevalence by at least 6% based on existing evidence, impacting on improved&#xD;
      long term health outcomes for approximately 334,000 members of the UK population if adopted&#xD;
      across the NHS. Results will be disseminated at international conferences and published in&#xD;
      leading journals to reach academic experts, through NHS networks and the Royal College of&#xD;
      Emergency Medicine to reach commissioners, managers and members of the public.&#xD;
