  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation aims to apply and test the feasibility of a structured Program for young&#xD;
      athletes. PLAYwithHEART is a program for promoting acceptance and cooperation skills in&#xD;
      adolescent athletes. This group application program comprises eight weekly sessions and aims&#xD;
      to decrease levels of sport anxiety, and increase the psychological quality of life of young&#xD;
      athletes, by promoting skills inherent to an affiliation mentality (mindfulness, acceptance,&#xD;
      compassion, and social safeness), as an alternative to a social ranking mentality (based on&#xD;
      maladaptive processes, such as shame and self-criticism), to deal with the challenges and&#xD;
      demands of the sport context.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sample will include young athletes of different sports with ages ranged 12 to 18 years&#xD;
      old. The principal investigator will recruit participants through contact with different&#xD;
      sports clubs in Portugal. Athletes who demonstrate interest will go through a Screening&#xD;
      interview (previously authorized by your legal guardian) by a licensed psychologist that aims&#xD;
      explain the structure and arms of the investigation, to collect demographic data, and whether&#xD;
      the athlete meets the inclusion criteria for the study. Athletes who meet the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and demonstrate interest in participating in the study, will sign an informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All ethical requirements for research with humans are guaranteed. Afterwards, participants&#xD;
      will be allocated in two groups (experimental and control group). Additionally, the&#xD;
      experimental group will enroll in the PLAYwithHEART programme, also provided by a licensed&#xD;
      psychologist and a co-therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will concurrently complete a protocol of self-report measures (to measure: a)&#xD;
      psychological processes; b) quality of life and sports anxiety. These assessments will occur&#xD;
      in three different times: before the start of the PLAYwithHEART programme (M0), after the&#xD;
      final session of the programme (M1), and 6 months after that (M3).&#xD;
