      Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) is a sensory-motor problem characterized by an uncomfortable and&#xD;
      unpleasant feeling that causes a strong and overwhelming desire to move the legs, usually&#xD;
      during periods of inactivity during sleep.It is reported that pregnancy is an important risk&#xD;
      factor in the onset and worsening of RLS.Individuals with RLS avoid social activities, often&#xD;
      experience psychiatric problems such as depression, anxiety disorders, and chronic sleep&#xD;
      disorders. Therefore, restless leg syndrome significantly affects daily life and coping with&#xD;
      these problems. Individuals with RLS initially undertake a variety of non-pharmacological&#xD;
      practices to relieve symptoms.Progressive muscle relaxation exercises, reducing the level of&#xD;
      epinephrine and norepinephrine in the blood and heart rate, reducing oxygen consumption,&#xD;
      regulating metabolic rate, lowering blood pressure, reducing muscle tension, preventing&#xD;
      fatigue and restlessness, decreasing pain by increasing endorphin levels, increasing coping&#xD;
      with pain and stress, It has many benefits such as improving sleep and quality of life.This&#xD;
      study will be conducted to evaluate the effect of progressive muscle relaxation exercise&#xD;
      training and follow-up given to pregnant women with restless leg syndrome on the severity of&#xD;
      restless leg syndrome, quality of life associated with restless legs syndrome, and sleep&#xD;
      quality.&#xD;

      Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) is a sensory-motor problem characterized by an uncomfortable and&#xD;
      unpleasant feeling that causes a strong and irresistible desire to move in the legs, usually&#xD;
      during periods of inactivity during sleep. Depending on cultural, environmental and genetic&#xD;
      differences, the prevalence of RLS is reported to be the highest in North America and Europe,&#xD;
      ranging from 5.5% to 11.6%, and this prevalence is reported to be between 1.0 and 7.5% in&#xD;
      Asia. Turkey made society based on two studies in RLS prevalence of respectively 3.19% and 7%&#xD;
      were found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HBS 's with age, e increases from and in women has been reported from two times higher than&#xD;
      that seen in man. The reason for its higher incidence in women has not been clearly&#xD;
      explained, but it has been thought to be related to hormonal changes during pregnancy,&#xD;
      menstruation and menopause. In a systematic review and meta-analysis study, it was reported&#xD;
      that the prevalence of RLS in pregnant women worldwide is 21% and the symptoms are more&#xD;
      common in the third trimester. In our country, g is reported to vary between midwives in HBS&#xD;
      19-26% incidence. In the study conducted by Neyal et al. (2015) in our country, it was found&#xD;
      that 15.6% in the first trimester of pregnancy; 32.8 % in the second trimester ; It is&#xD;
      reported that RLS symptoms are observed with a rate of 38.8% in the third trimester and the&#xD;
      symptoms continue at a rate of 34.8% after birth. In the study conducted by Akbaş and Yaman&#xD;
      Sözbir (2019), approximately half of the pregnant women (46.4%) had RLS symptoms and the RLS&#xD;
      severity mean score of pregnant women with RLS was found to be 20.82 ± 6.61 . In the same&#xD;
      study, the HBS of 49.1% of women with severe and very Siddiqui has been determined that there&#xD;
      is live meat that fell to the severity of RLS increases quality of life reported and un.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy is reported to be an important risk factor in the onset and worsening of RLS. It&#xD;
      has been proven that the dopaminergic system plays an important role in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      RLS . Iron acts as a cofactor in the synthesis and formation of dopamine and normal dopamine&#xD;
      production is impaired in iron deficiency. It is reported that increased iron need and anemia&#xD;
      during pregnancy triggers RLS and the problem gets worse in the third trimester of pregnancy.&#xD;
      In addition, vitamin D and folate increase dopamine synthesis and are reported to be&#xD;
      protective of dopaminargic neurons and the brain against metabolite toxins. Studies have&#xD;
      shown that iron , folate, and vitamin D deficiency cause restless leg syndrome. In addition,&#xD;
      increasing estrogen, progesterone and prolactin levels during pregnancy accelerate the&#xD;
      appearance of symptoms, especially in the third trimester. It has been reported that estrogen&#xD;
      inhibits the synthesis and release of dopamine during pregnancy and progesterone increases&#xD;
      neuronal excitability, leading to frequent hyper- reflexes and periodic leg movements and RLS&#xD;
      during pregnancy. After birth, with the rapid increase of prolactin hormone, symptoms begin&#xD;
      to improve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals with RLS avoid social activities, often experience psychiatric problems such as&#xD;
      depression, anxiety disorders, and chronic sleep disorders. Therefore, restless leg syndrome&#xD;
      significantly affects daily life and coping with these problems . HBS to relieve symptoms of&#xD;
      various individuals who initially non-pharmacological located in the application s . However,&#xD;
      it may be necessary to benefit from pharmacological treatment in cases with severe RLS.&#xD;
      However, the use of drugs in pregnant women may be inconvenient. A standard drug therapy has&#xD;
      not been determined for the treatment of RLS in pregnant women and the number of drugs that&#xD;
      can be used is limited. Because most drugs have been used according to the evidence of&#xD;
      non-pregnant patients and controlled studies in the treatment of RLS during pregnancy are&#xD;
      insufficient. Therefore, GeBa steel during treatment of RLS in terms of drug therapy with the&#xD;
      benefits of fetal compromise between the advantages/disadvantages of evaluation and decision&#xD;
      making in this regard is necessary . However, during the treatment of RLS in pregnancy, the&#xD;
      effect of drugs on the fetus , especially putting njenital me lformasyo considering the&#xD;
      possibility should be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of progressive relaxation exercises; It is to learn to feel the difference&#xD;
      between tension and looseness in our body and to relax by ourselves in our daily life. For&#xD;
      this purpose, the most widely used muscle groups, hands, arms, neck, shoulders, face, chest,&#xD;
      abdomen, hips, feet and fingers were run . This method, which is applied in the form of&#xD;
      stretching and relaxing the muscles , enables people to learn where their muscles are, what&#xD;
      they have become during tension, and the difference when this tension disappears.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progressive muscle relaxation exercises, reducing the level of epinephrine and norepinephrine&#xD;
      in the blood and heart rate, reducing oxygen consumption, regulating metabolic rate, lowering&#xD;
      blood pressure, reducing muscle tension, preventing fatigue and restlessness, reducing pain&#xD;
      by increasing endorphin levels, increasing coping with pain and stress, It has many benefits&#xD;
      such as increasing the quality of sleep and life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RLS, which increases in frequency during pregnancy, disrupts sleep quality and affects the&#xD;
      quality of life as it increases fatigue in pregnant women. During the follow-up, care and&#xD;
      counseling process performed by nurses during pregnancy, pregnant women should be evaluated&#xD;
      for sleep disturbance, fatigue, anxiety and stress that may be caused by RLS and attempts&#xD;
      should be made to increase the quality of life by solving problems in cases . At this point,&#xD;
      it is especially important to teach how to deal with RLS or how to relieve symptoms . In this&#xD;
      context, progressive muscle relaxation exercises, which have many benefits and can be applied&#xD;
      by nurses, should be taught to pregnant women during the routine follow-up and care process,&#xD;
      and the use of relaxation exercises should be provided both at home and in clinics.&#xD;

Exercise will be demonstrated in training. Later, pregnant women will be asked to explain and practice the exercise. Women will be repeated until they do the exercise completely correctly (Check-list 1). After the training, pregnant women will be asked to do progressive relaxation exercises at least 3 times a week (every other day). With the progressive muscle relaxation exercise daily follow-up schedule prepared by the researcher, the pregnant women will be followed for 8 weeks and weekly reminders will be made (via whatsapp® or text message). The final test application (31-32 weeks) will be done online at the end of 8 weeks to the pregnant women. In pre-test and post-test applications, RLS Severity Rating Scale form, Johns Hopkins Restless Leg Syndrome Quality of Life Scale and Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index will be used.</description>
