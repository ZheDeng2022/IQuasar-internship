  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled study aimed to determine the effect of education on disease&#xD;
      management on the quality of life, and anxiety and depression levels of women with Rheumatoid&#xD;
      Arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses of the current study are as below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: Education on disease management in women with Rheumatoid Arthritis does not affect the&#xD;
      quality of life and anxiety and depression levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Education on disease management in women with Rheumatoid Arthritis affects the quality of&#xD;
      life and anxiety and depression levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods: The study was conducted with 66 women with Rheumatoid Arthritis (32&#xD;
      intervention, 34 control groups) at the rheumatology clinic and polyclinic of a university&#xD;
      hospital between February and October 2019, in the city of Edirne, Turkey. Data were&#xD;
      collected with &quot;Patient Information Form&quot;, &quot;Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality of Life Scale&quot;,&#xD;
      &quot;Health Assessment Questionnaire&quot; and &quot;Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale&quot;.&#xD;

      Study design and participants This pretest and posttest prospective study was conducted as&#xD;
      randomized controlled between February 2019 and October 2019 in the outpatient and inpatient&#xD;
      clinics of the Department of Rheumatology of a university hospital in Edirne, Turkey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two study groups, control (n = 40) and intervention (n = 40) were randomized controlled&#xD;
      groups with 80% power analysis and 95% confidence interval. A single-blind technique was used&#xD;
      to eliminate any bias. The patients were not informed of the group to which they belonged.&#xD;
      The patients were selected using a simple random sampling method and divided into&#xD;
      intervention and control groups using the Research Randomizer program. In the intervention&#xD;
      group, 40 women with RA were interviewed at baseline (first interview). In the 3rd month&#xD;
      (last interview), eight patients were excluded for the following reasons: four did not wish&#xD;
      to continue the study, three could not be reached, and one patient did not complete the&#xD;
      forms. Therefore, 32 women with RA were finally included in the intervention group. In the&#xD;
      control group, 40 patients were interviewed at baseline. In the 3rd month (last interview),&#xD;
      seven patients were excluded for the following reasons: four patients did not wish to&#xD;
      continue the study and three patients could not be reached. Therefore, 34 women with RA were&#xD;
      finally included in the control group. The study included a total of 66 women with RA,&#xD;
      including intervention (n= 32) and control (n= 34) groups. Flow chart of data collection for&#xD;
      women with RA is presented Figure 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection tools Data were collected by The Patient Information Form, Rheumatoid&#xD;
      Arthritis Quality of Life Scale, the Health Assessment Questionnaire, and the Hospital&#xD;
      Anxiety Depression Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Information Form: Our study was developed by researchers in line with a literature&#xD;
      review on the subject. (Bozbas &amp; Gurer, 2018; Fall et al., 2013; Moghadam et al., 2018; Neto&#xD;
      et al., 2009). The form consisted of eight questions about sociodemographic characteristics&#xD;
      (age, marital status, education, etc.), clinical diagnosis, treatment of RA, concomitant&#xD;
      chronic disease, and deformity affected by arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rheumatoid Arthritis Patient Education Booklet: The content of the booklet was prepared by&#xD;
      researchers in line with the literature. (arthritis.org; Moghadam et al., 2018; nras.org.uk;&#xD;
      Rahim &amp; Cheng, 2018). The education topics included description, symptoms, and signs of RA,&#xD;
      diagnostic methods, treatment choices, information on medications, RA in pregnancy, disease&#xD;
      management information, nutritional recommendations, emotional health, and support in daily&#xD;
      living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Patients were interviewed twice, at baseline and at the 3rd month. All forms&#xD;
      were applied to the patients in the intervention and control groups at baseline. The patients&#xD;
      were assigned to the intervention group at random and participated in a one-to-one training&#xD;
      program consisting of a 30-min onset session. The Rheumatoid Arthritis Patient Education&#xD;
      Booklet prepared by the researchers was administered to patients in the intervention group&#xD;
      during education. The inpatients were given one-to-one training in the patient's room during&#xD;
      quiet periods. The outpatients were trained in the outpatient clinic, as tis was considered a&#xD;
      suitable venue. In the 3rd month, all forms were applied again to the patients in the&#xD;
      intervention group, and the same forms were applied to the untrained patients in the control&#xD;
      group. The application of the forms took approximately 15 min, and the interviews were&#xD;
      conducted face-to-face with the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS 20.0 program. Socio-demographic data were&#xD;
      analyzed using the mean, standard deviation, and frequency. The Mann-Whitney U paired-group&#xD;
      test was used to compare results that did not show a normal distribution. The Fisher's exact&#xD;
      test, Pearson chi-square test, and continuity correction test were used. The Wilcoxon&#xD;
      signed-rank test was used for the paired comparisons in the comparison of qualitative data.&#xD;
      The significance level was set at p &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations A University Research Ethics Committee was confirmed the study&#xD;
      protocol, which adhered to the Helsinki Declaration (Approval number: 2018/344). Before&#xD;
      taking part in the study, all of the patients signed consent forms. Participants were&#xD;
      informed that their personal information and privacy would be protected. Patients who did not&#xD;
      want to continue to participate in the study were free to leave the study at any stage.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality of Life Questionnaire in the third month</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients' quality of life assess at baseline and in the third month.</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire consists of 30 questions, each with a score of &quot;yes&quot; = 1 or &quot;no&quot; = 0. The scores ranged from 0 to 30, with high scores showing poor quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) in the third month</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients' HADS scores assess at baseline and in the third month.</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS includes both anxiety and depression subscales, and consists of 14 items, 7 of which examine depression and 7 of which examine anxiety. Answers are assessed on a four-point likert scale and graded between 0 and 3. The purpose of the scale is not to diagnose but to assess the risk group by checking for anxiety and depression over a short period</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) in the third month</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients' HAQ score assess at baseline and the third month.</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ is composed of 20 questions that are divided into eight categories: waking up, moving, feeding, dressing and grooming, hygiene, grip, reach, and tasks. Every question has four possible answers: no challenge (0), some difficulty (1), a lot of difficulty (2), and unable to do (3). the score is computed as an average of eight domains with scores varying from 0 to 3, with a higher score displayed significant impairment.</description>
