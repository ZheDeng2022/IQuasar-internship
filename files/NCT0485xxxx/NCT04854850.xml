  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about the effect of Apollo (a vibrating wearable about&#xD;
      the side of an Apple Watch) on fatigue, Raynaud symptoms, depression, quality of life, and&#xD;
      disease symptoms in patients with systemic sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SSc patients frequently have fatigue as a characteristic feature of their disease and fatigue&#xD;
      negatively impacts quality of life (Haythornthwaite 2003, Richards 2003, Suarez-Almazor 2007,&#xD;
      Basta 2017). The prevalence of fatigue among SSc patients is 75%, with 61% ranking fatigue&#xD;
      among their top three most distressing complaints. Fatigue is also associated with poor sleep&#xD;
      quality, greater pain and depressive symptoms (Sandusky 2009). We hypothesize that treatment&#xD;
      with Apollo over 1 month will improve fatigue. If successful, the Apollo technology will be&#xD;
      the first treatment option for fatigue and Raynaud's in this population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of the commercially available Apollo Neuro Wellness Device, which is not&#xD;
      currently a medical device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device offers a convenient novel non-invasive, non-habit-forming solution to improve&#xD;
      performance and recovery under stress in children and adults by delivering gentle wave-like&#xD;
      vibrations to the body that improve autonomic nervous system balance in real time (Siegle &amp;&#xD;
      Rabin et al., under review). Apollo vibrations activate touch receptors in the skin and are&#xD;
      perceived as safety signals by the brain resulting in decreased stress, improved recovery,&#xD;
      focus, and energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 30-40 patients will be enrolled and followed for 1 month, with baseline data&#xD;
      collected before using Apollo and follow-up data collected after using the device. This&#xD;
      clinical trial is open-label, meaning that all participants will receive Apollos and no&#xD;
      placebos will be used. All participants will be allowed to continue underlying&#xD;
      immunosuppressive and Raynaud therapy at stable doses during the trial. Since this is a pilot&#xD;
      study, future larger controlled trials will be necessary to clearly demonstrate drug&#xD;
      effectiveness.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in PROMIS® Item Bank v1.0 - Fatigue - Short Form 13a (FACIT-Fatigue) at 4 Weeks (End-of-Study) Compared to Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in FACIT-Fatigue from baseline to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The FACIT-Fatigue is a patient reported outcome of fatigue symptoms, with a score range of 13-65. Low scores indicate low levels of fatigue and high scores indicate high levels of fatigue.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI/SHAQ) at 4 Weeks (End-of-Study) Compared to Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in HAQ-D1/SHAQ from baseline to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ-D1/SHAQ is a patient-reported outcome of functional ability. It is a continuous scale with a results range of 0-3, with 0 meaning no disability and 3 meaning very severe disability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Median Change in the Raynaud Phenomenon Visual Analog Scale (RP-VAS) Score at 4 Weeks (End-of-study) Compared to Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in RP-VAS from baseline to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The RP-VAS scale measure ranges from 0-100, with 0 being no symptoms and 100 severe symptoms. Reported is the median and interquartile range of change between baseline and week 4 (end-of-study).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Raynaud Condition Score (RCS) at 4 Weeks (End-of-study) From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 4-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Raynaud Consition Score is a patient-reported outcome of a single question regarding Raynaud severity. It is a visual analog scale with a results range of 0-100. A score of 0 is no symptoms, and 100 is severe symptoms. It is recommended by OMERACT for assessment of Raynaud phenomenon.</description>

    <description>The Apollo System offers a convenient novel non-invasive, non-habit-forming solution to improve performance and recovery under stress in children and adults by delivering gentle wave-like vibrations to the body that improve autonomic nervous system balance in real time (Siegle &amp; Rabin et al., under review). The gentle vibrations delivered by the Apollo System are extremely low intensity in that they are typically just barely noticeable or perceptible by the user. Additionally, the range of frequencies and intensities of the Apollo System have been safely used in numerous commercial products without adverse events reported, including sexual vibrators and massagers. Apollo vibrations activate touch receptors in the skin and are perceived as safety signals by the brain resulting in decreased stress, improved recovery, focus, and energy.</description>
