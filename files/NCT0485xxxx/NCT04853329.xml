      This first-in-human Phase 1 study will be a multicenter, dose-escalating, single-agent study&#xD;
      conducted in patients with advanced CD20-associated hematological cancers for which the&#xD;
      investigator determines there to be no other higher priority therapies available. All&#xD;
      patients must have failed at least two prior lines of conventional systemic therapy that must&#xD;
      also include an approved CD20 based treatment. All patients will need to have CD20-positve&#xD;
      disease, as determined by the expression of CD20 on tumor cells assayed within 6 months prior&#xD;
      to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of 2 parts, Part A and Part B. In Part A of the study, dose escalation&#xD;
      will proceed according to the guidelines in the Treatment and Dosing section below, following&#xD;
      a rule-based design methodology. Two different schedules will be explored to establish the PK&#xD;
      profile and thus better inform the selection of the final dosing schedule to be developed.&#xD;
      Arm A will explore a continuous weekly dosing schedule and will commence first. Arm B will&#xD;
      explore a 3 weekly schedule in which a single dose is administered every 3 weeks. Part B dose&#xD;
      expansion of the study will commence, in which a single dosing schedule will be explored in&#xD;
      CD20-positive patients. The schedule will be selected based on PK and safety determinants&#xD;
      from Study Part A.&#xD;
