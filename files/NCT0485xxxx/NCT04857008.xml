  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm phase II trial focused on cancer patients and cancer survivors in the&#xD;
      Veterans Health Administration will gather data on feasibility, acceptability, ease of&#xD;
      clinical implementation, and preliminary efficacy of BNT001, a prescription digital software&#xD;
      application. BNT001 delivers a 10-session digitally administered version of a published&#xD;
      manualized therapy for stress management in adult cancer patients that has established&#xD;
      efficacy in improving quality of life and mood.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot will study specific implementation barriers and facilitators, procedures that are&#xD;
      necessary to ensure adherence to utilization of the digital program, as well as any potential&#xD;
      safety issues associated with recruiting and offering an intervention to cancer patients with&#xD;
      moderate anxiety or mild depressive symptoms. Data relating to patient experience, adherence,&#xD;
      satisfaction and pre-post intervention outcomes will also be tracked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will run in two distinct phases to first assess the process of clinical&#xD;
      implementation by prescribing oncology clinicians, and in a second more expanded phase,&#xD;
      further assess the clinical implementation and impact on enrolled patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Phase 1: We aim to identify promoters and barriers to the clinical implementation of&#xD;
      BNT001, a software application that delivers a 10-session digitally administered version of a&#xD;
      published manualized therapy for stress management in adult cancer patients that has&#xD;
      established efficacy in improving quality of life and mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Phase 2: We aim to further identify promoters and barriers to provider clinical&#xD;
      implementation of BNT001, assess patient acceptability and feasibility including patient&#xD;
      adherence to BNT's 10-sessions, and obtain preliminary data on BNT001's impact on&#xD;
      cancer-related distress.&#xD;
