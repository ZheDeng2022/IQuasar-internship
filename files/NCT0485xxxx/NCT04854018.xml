  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Indo-cyanine green (ICG) is a dye that has been used for a variety of adult and paediatric&#xD;
      uses since 1956. Over the past few years, near infrared (NIRF) technology has been developed&#xD;
      which allow is use as a fluorescence agent during surgery. It has been used increasingly in&#xD;
      the field of adult oncology surgery and has been shown to increase the efficacy of this&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of NIRF and ICG during specific minimally&#xD;
      invasive surgery (MIS) procedures within paediatric oncology surgery. Their use will&#xD;
      complement existing surgical techniques rather than replace them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the published advantages in adults this study aims to provide evidence of feasibility&#xD;
      in the paediatric patients with cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to show the feasibility of using ICG in combination with NIRF&#xD;
      and MIS in paediatric oncology surgery. It has been used increasingly over the past few years&#xD;
      for a range of adult oncology surgical indications including tumour margin identification,&#xD;
      lymph node identification and pulmonary metastectomy. It will be investigated in three groups&#xD;
      of patients in our study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Tumour margin identification-Identifying the margins of a tumour intra-operatively is&#xD;
           crucial for many paediatric cancers. Incomplete resections or resections with involved&#xD;
           margins often require upstaging of treatment with more intensive chemotherapy or&#xD;
           radiotherapy. ICG will be injected intravenously and then NIRF will be used&#xD;
           intermittently until fluorescence is achieved and an evaluation of the tumour and its&#xD;
           margins will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Lymph node identification - It is standard of care for most oncology resections to&#xD;
           remove lymph nodes that are suspected to be involved with tumour. Both SIOP and COG&#xD;
           recommend the removal of 7 or more lymph nodes during a nephrectomy for Wilm's tumour&#xD;
           although this is often not achieved. IGC will be injected directly into the tumour (or&#xD;
           the adjacent tissue in 2-4 places) and then NIRF will be used intermittently until&#xD;
           fluorescence is achieved. An evaluation of the tumour and any fluorescent lymph nodes&#xD;
           will then take place and any fluorescent lymph nodes will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pulmonary metastectomy - Many paediatric cancers including Wilm's tumour have a&#xD;
           propensity to metastasise to the lungs. Removal of all lung metastases is important as&#xD;
           it has the potential to down-stage tumours, obviating the need for pulmonary&#xD;
           radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modern radiology techniques can identify lesions as small as 1mm which are often not palpable&#xD;
      at the time of surgery. Relying on finger palpation requires patients to have a thoracotomy&#xD;
      with all of the associated complications. ICG will be injected intravenously and then NIRF&#xD;
      will be combined with MIS to identify any fluorescent lesions. The location of any lesions&#xD;
      will be compared with those seen on pre-surgical imaging (current standard practice).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all three groups of patients, the use of ICG and NIRF will complement rather than replace&#xD;
      existing surgical technique in patients who require surgery already. Data will be collected&#xD;
      on the number of lesions which do/do not fluoresce as well as the histology of lesions&#xD;
      removed. They will be separated into lesions which do not fluoresce, lesions which were&#xD;
      removed before fluorescence (they will be checked for ex-vivo fluorescence) and fluorescing&#xD;
      lesions so that the histological characteristics of each group can be compared.&#xD;
