  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioid Use Disorders (OUD) cause significant burden to individuals, families, and the&#xD;
      society. Our product - Computerized Chemosensory-Based Orbitofrontal Cortex Training (CBOT) -&#xD;
      offers a cost-saving, home-based, user-friendly brain stimulation system that increased&#xD;
      6-month treatment retention of OUDs in a pilot study; and also, acutely reduced opioid&#xD;
      withdrawal severity and negative affect during induction into opioid maintenance therapy.&#xD;
      This study will establish its effectiveness in a broad category of OUD subjects at different&#xD;
      stages of OUD care continuum.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evon Medics proposes to evaluate the effectiveness of Computerized Chemosensory-Based&#xD;
      Orbitofrontal Cortex Training (CBOT), as an alternative strategy for relapse prevention in&#xD;
      patients with Opioid Use (OUD) and other substance use disorders (SUD). This treatment&#xD;
      leverages the overlap in brain regions that process smell and mediate decision making. The&#xD;
      CBOT is portable and can be used at home. This clinical trial is being conducted to&#xD;
      demonstrate its utility for home application by nontreatment seeking and treatment-seeking&#xD;
      OUD populations, to engage in long-term, successful opioid recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key objectives of this project are to: (1) establish the effectiveness of CBOT for improved&#xD;
      retention and relapse prevention in a large sample of OUD subjects; (2) establish its&#xD;
      effectiveness for acute reduction of withdrawal severity and negative affect early in&#xD;
      recovery; and (3) evaluate its safety, user-friendliness and acceptability. Accomplishment of&#xD;
      these goals would lead to larger clinical trials for OUD and wider applications of CBOT in&#xD;
      other addictive disorders.&#xD;
