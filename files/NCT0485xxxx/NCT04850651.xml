  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of fluconazole on&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of pyrotinib tablet for oral administration in healthy Chinese adult&#xD;
      subjects. The secondary objective of the study is to compare the safety of pyrotinib alone&#xD;
      and co-administered with fluconazole.&#xD;
