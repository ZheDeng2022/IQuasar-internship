  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is among the most common malignant tumors nationwide with high morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Attributing to its insidious onset and rapid progress, 70% of patients with&#xD;
      gastric cancer were initially diagnosed at an advanced stage. In advanced gastric cancer,&#xD;
      systemic treatment based on chemotherapy drugs, targeted drugs, and immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitors remains the main regimens. Among current standard treatment regimens, though&#xD;
      HER2-positive and MSI-H/dMMR statuses indicate the treatment efficacy of trastuzumab and&#xD;
      immune checkpoint inhibitors, there is still lack of robust biomarkers for predicting&#xD;
      treatment efficacy. Tumor microenvironment as pivotal components of solid tumor,&#xD;
      significantly influences therapeutic response and clinical outcome. The study is a&#xD;
      single-center, observational study to evaluate the relationship between standard treatment&#xD;
      efficacy and the tumor microenvironment in advanced gastric cancer. In addition, the study&#xD;
      comprehensively evaluated the landscape of the tumor microenvironment characteristics of&#xD;
      gastric cancer, and aimed at establishing robust biomarkers for predicting prognosis and&#xD;
      treatment efficacy to finetune treatment strategies.&#xD;

      according to the inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria. After successful screening, the&#xD;
      patients were treated following the clinical guidelines and the actual conditions. The&#xD;
      residual tissue samples of the primary tumor or metastatic foci were collected to conduct the&#xD;
      tumor microenvironment detection analysis.&#xD;
