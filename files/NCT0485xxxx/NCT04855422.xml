    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, non-interventional, prospective pilot cohort study to monitor SPK&#xD;
      patients post-transplant to determine if non-invasive measures using dd-cfDNA (Allosure) and&#xD;
      AlloMap can assess an array of immune panels to predict and confirm the development of&#xD;
      allograft injury and rejection in either organ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop and validate AlloSure and AlloMap in SPK transplant recipients with stable&#xD;
           allograft function and in diagnosis of acute TCMR and ABMR in either organ&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the ability of AlloSure and AlloMap to determine early discordant rejection in&#xD;
           SPK recipients&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate AlloSure and AlloMap in SPK transplant recipients with diagnosis of BKV&#xD;
           viremia&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Currently, one the challenges of durable glucose management after pancreas transplantation is&#xD;
      the ability to accurately and expediently diagnose early rejection to prevent unnecessary&#xD;
      damage to the graft. This assessment is further complicated in combined organ&#xD;
      transplantation. Simultaneous pancreas and kidney (SPK) transplantation accounts for most of&#xD;
      the utilized pancreas grafts. However, both grafted systems (kidney and pancreas) are not&#xD;
      subject to equal immunologic pressures even though they are theoretically presented with&#xD;
      similar environments. Historically, the diagnosis of pancreatic rejection was assumed to be&#xD;
      tethered to the presence of concomitant kidney rejection. The two organs were believed to&#xD;
      reject in tandem. As such, many centers use sentinel biopsy of the kidney to determine&#xD;
      rejection in the one or both organs. More recently, many studies have called into question&#xD;
      this management strategy as there appears to be increasing evidence that both organs can&#xD;
      reject independently of one another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of two organs allows for many combinations of rejection: both organs may undergo&#xD;
      acute rejection known as concordant rejection or one organ may undergo acute rejection&#xD;
      independently of the other organ known as discordant rejection. Kidney or pancreas rejection&#xD;
      may occur in any time frame after SPK and can greatly affect graft survival. In order to&#xD;
      clinically determine rejection in SPK recipients we monitor serum amylase, lipase, glucose,&#xD;
      creatinine and proteinuria. Abnormalities in these labs in conjunction with clinical changes&#xD;
      often are the indication for biopsy to determine the presence of rejection. More importantly,&#xD;
      histology dictates treatment regimen and course. Invariably, SPK recipients sometimes present&#xD;
      with normal creatinine and renal function, but with abnormal pancreatic enzymes. In most&#xD;
      cases, the kidney biopsy would precede any discussion of pancreas biopsy due to the&#xD;
      aforementioned notion of concordant rejection between organs. Certainly, biopsy proven&#xD;
      rejection in the kidney with pancreatic enzymatic leak would necessitate aggressive&#xD;
      anti-rejection therapy given the high likelihood of pancreatic involvement. However, many&#xD;
      times these renal biopsies would be normal and lead to a quandary of how vigorously to pursue&#xD;
      further evaluation of the pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pancreas graft biopsy is not a common practice, but has been reported to be performed&#xD;
      percutaneously, transcystoscopically if the pancreas was anastomosed to bladder,&#xD;
      endoscopically, and laparoscopically in a few small series. Most centers use Interventional&#xD;
      Radiology for CT guided pancreas biopsy. More importantly, there have been reported cases of&#xD;
      complications for pancreas biopsies, mainly stemming from intraabdominal bleeding requiring&#xD;
      surgical intervention [1]. In an effort to reduce potential patient morbidity from pancreatic&#xD;
      biopsy, non-invasive tools like AlloSure that assesses donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA)&#xD;
      and AlloMap; a gene expression-profiling test may provide an attractive alternative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently dd-cfDNA analysis (AlloSure, CareDx®) in the kidney has shown promise. While the&#xD;
      gold standard at present remains histologic assessment of kidney tissue, this may be changing&#xD;
      as acceptance of dd-cfDNA grows. Dd-cfDNA analysis is advantageous as it is a noninvasive,&#xD;
      less costly, and a potentially safer way to assess allograft rejection. Additionally, the&#xD;
      easier accessibility of testing dd-cfDNA can enable more frequent testing, which can&#xD;
      elucidate a more accurate progression of rejection rather than a biopsy which is only a&#xD;
      snapshot in time. For renal analysis the recommended dd-cfDNA cutoff value is 1.0% to&#xD;
      diagnose active rejection (positive and negative predictive values are 61% and 84%). While it&#xD;
      seems reasonable that discordant rejection may apply to similar levels of dd-cfDNA seen in&#xD;
      kidney alone rejection, concordant rejection levels of dd-cfDNA are unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Notably, the technology behind Allosure has provided several insights into cellular injury&#xD;
      from a variety of milieu. In the study by Shen et al., the dd-cfDNA level in deceased donors&#xD;
      (44.99%) was significantly higher than that in the living donors (10.24%) at initial time, P&#xD;
      &lt; 0.01. Dd-cfDNA level in delayed graft function (DGF) recipients was lower (23.96%) than&#xD;
      that in non-DGF (47.74%) at the initial time, P = 0.89 (19.34% in DGF and 4.46% in non-DGF on&#xD;
      the first day, P = 0.17). There was a significant correlation between dd-cfDNA level at&#xD;
      initial time and serum creatinine (r2 = 0.219, P = 0.032) and warm ischemia time (r2 = 0.204,&#xD;
      P = 0.040). DGF patients experienced a slower decline than non-DGF patients, but both groups&#xD;
      had a rapid decline in dd-cfDNA post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, most importantly it appears that a recurrence of dd-cfDNA level may be indicative of&#xD;
      active rejection [5]. In the case report by Hurkmans et al., it was shown that dd-cfDNA was a&#xD;
      sensitive biomarker to detect rejection in solid organ transplantation in a renal transplant&#xD;
      patient diagnosed with melanoma and taking nivolumab as treatment. Additionally, the utility&#xD;
      of Dd-cfDNA has been studied in the pediatric renal transplant population. In the study by&#xD;
      Puliyanda et al., biopsies were completed when dd-cfDNA &gt; 1.0% or when there was high&#xD;
      clinical suspicion. 19 of 67 patients had dd-cfDNA testing as part of routine monitoring with&#xD;
      a median dd-cfDNA score of 0.37 (IQR: 0.19-1.10). 48 of 67 patients who had clinical&#xD;
      suspicion of rejection had median dd-cfDNA score of 0.47 (0.24-2.15). DSA-positive recipients&#xD;
      had higher dd-cfDNA scores than those who were negative or had AT1R positivity alone (P =&#xD;
      .003). There was no association between dd-cfDNA score and strength of DSA positivity. 7 of&#xD;
      48 recipients had a biopsy with a dd-cfDNA score &lt;1%; two showed evidence of rejection.&#xD;
      Neither DSA nor AT1R positivity was statistically associated with biopsy-proven rejection.&#xD;
      However, dd-cfDNA &gt;1% was diagnostic of rejection with sensitivity of 86% and specificity of&#xD;
      100% (AUC: 0.996, 0.98-1.00; P = .002). In the study by Sigdal et al., urinary dd-cfDNA after&#xD;
      kidney transplantation correlates to the apoptotic injury load of the donor organ. Serial&#xD;
      monitoring of urinary dd-cfDNA has been shown to be a sensitive proxy and biomarker of acute&#xD;
      injury in the donor organ, but fails to have specificity to differentiate between acute&#xD;
      rejection and BK virus nephropathy. Therefore, dd-cfDNA is an appropriate and accurate method&#xD;
      in lieu of a biopsy to assess allograft rejection and injury. However, one of the limitations&#xD;
      of dd-cfDNA is its ability to be detected is inhibited by methylprednisolone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to dd-cDNA, the quantification of select genes in circulating leukocytes&#xD;
      (AlloMap, CareDx®) has potential to determine rejection. AlloMap has been shown to determine&#xD;
      the risk for rejection in Cardiac Allograft Rejection Gene Expression Observational Trial&#xD;
      (CARGO) and in the subsequent trial known as CARGO II. The current research of AlloMap in&#xD;
      multi-organ recipients reflects a national cohort of 18 heart-kidney, 8 heart-liver, 1&#xD;
      heart-lung matched to 54 heart only recipients. AlloMap Heart® is a panel assay of 20 genes,&#xD;
      11 informative and 9 used for normalization and/or quality control, which produces gene&#xD;
      expression data used in the calculation of an AlloMap Heart test score - an integer ranging&#xD;
      from 0 to 40. Compared with patients in the same post-transplant period, the lower the score,&#xD;
      the lower the probability of acute cellular rejection at the time of testing. Recently a&#xD;
      multivariable gene-expression signature targeting T-cell-mediated rejection in peripheral&#xD;
      blood of kidney transplant recipients was developed. This frugal TCMR-signature was made of&#xD;
      (IFNG, IP-10, ITGA4, MARCH8, RORc, SEMA7A, WDR40A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gene expression profiles in renal transplant recipients with BKV viremia have been&#xD;
      investigated by microarrays. This research analyzed entire blood gene expression profiles of&#xD;
      19 BKV viremia patients matched to 14 patients without BKV viremia and showed a significant&#xD;
      higher expression of GRIT, CAT, and NK cell associated transcript. The study results&#xD;
      indicated increased activity of cytotoxic T cells and NK cells in both BKV viremia and&#xD;
      nephropathy that resembled acute rejection and showed potential involvement of both the&#xD;
      innate and adaptive immune system. This study documents to the importance of studying BKV&#xD;
      viremia to exclude the diagnosis due to similar gene expression pattern in blood compared to&#xD;
      rejection. In other study, gene expression profiles of DSA+ renal transplant recipients were&#xD;
      analyzed with and without tissue findings of ABMR and found that DSA+ patients with ABMR has&#xD;
      increased expression of activation, regulation, and differentiation of immune cells (T cells,&#xD;
      NK cells, leukocytes, and interleukins).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allosure and Allomap tests were not studied in SPK recipients in detail. Cutoff values for&#xD;
      Allosure test could be different in stable SPK recipients compared to kidney transplant&#xD;
      recipients due to additional donor tissue (pancreas and duodenum). It is also unknown, what&#xD;
      would be the Allosure values in pancreas and/or kidney rejection in SPK recipients. It is&#xD;
      also unknow the circulating gene transcripts in SPK recipients with rejection. Using the&#xD;
      similar concept of peripheral blood gene expression by Allomap testing, AlloMap&#xD;
      Kidney/Pancreas could be created.&#xD;
