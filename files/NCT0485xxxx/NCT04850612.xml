  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed at improving reporting in Chronic Subdural Haematoma (CSDH) research&#xD;
      studies, through development of a standardised Core Outcome Set (COS), a unified CSDH&#xD;
      Definition and set of Data Elements (DE) for reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design includes a Delphi survey process from two main stakeholder groups:&#xD;
      Health-Care Professionals or Researchers (HCPR) and Patients or carers. HCPR, patients and&#xD;
      carers will all be invited to complete the survey on the COS, only the HCPR survey will&#xD;
      include questions on definition and DE. Results of the Delphi Survey will be discussed at a&#xD;
      final consensus meeting before results are confirmed and published.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic subdural haematoma (CSDH) is a collection of blood and fluid surrounded by membranes&#xD;
      that accumulates on the brain surface over weeks to months. It predominately affects older&#xD;
      people and often has a delayed association with a preceding head trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been significant growth in the number of CSDH publications in recent years&#xD;
      mirroring progress in potential management options but there is wide variation in how and&#xD;
      when patient outcome is measured amongst studies. Much could be gained by agreeing a minimum&#xD;
      set of standardized outcomes that should be measured and reported in all CSDH studies, known&#xD;
      as a Core Outcome Set (COS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall study design includes a Delphi survey process.This is a process whereby all&#xD;
      outcomes and data elements from the CSDH literature and expert opinion are presented to a&#xD;
      large group of patients, carers and HCPR via a survey. Each survey participant has the&#xD;
      opportunity to rank the elements and outcomes in levels of importance to them, and the survey&#xD;
      is then repeated including presentation of the results from the first round, in order to&#xD;
      attempt to gain agreement between participants on what is important. All elements are then&#xD;
      reviewed at a final &quot;consensus&quot; meeting&#xD;
