  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating a new way to monitor patients who are recovering at home after&#xD;
      surgery. This study uses text messages to ask patients to review their own symptoms and then&#xD;
      reply with the level of severity of specific symptoms. Based on each patient's specific&#xD;
      response to the text message survey, a pre-programmed, automated response will be sent from&#xD;
      the study prompting the patient to take specific actions (or no action if no symptoms).&#xD;
      Investigators will assess whether this method improves patients' well-being as compared to&#xD;
      the current standard of care for patients. Currently, after surgery, patients are provided&#xD;
      counseling and written instructions when they leave the hospital on how to care for&#xD;
      themselves at home. If the patient has questions or concerns, they contact their care team.&#xD;
      The optimal way to help patients assess their own symptoms at home remains unknown.&#xD;
      Investigators are also assessing if using the symptom survey reduces readmissions to the&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;

    <time_frame>30-32 days post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>The mean total score on the FACT-G will be compared between the two arms. The FACT-G is a 27-item questionnaire that covers four HR-QOL sub-domains: physical, social, emotional, and functional well-being. Each of the questions will be scored on a scale from 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much) using a manual scoring template in which some items are reverse scored. The minimally important difference (MID) is 5 points for the FACT-G questionnaire. In other words, five points is the most minimal difference between the control group and treatment group scores that would indicate a clinically meaningful change. A positive change in points indicates better QOL.</description>
