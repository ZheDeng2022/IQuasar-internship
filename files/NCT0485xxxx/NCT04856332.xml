  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intensive treatments of certain cancers and haemopathies require the implementation of a&#xD;
      protective isolation from external micro-organisms for a period of several weeks. This&#xD;
      isolation implies a limitation of visitors and sometimes prohibits access to young children.&#xD;
      This raises questions concerning the maintenance of family links, and in particular the&#xD;
      parent-child relationship as well as the psychological and emotional isolation of&#xD;
      hospitalised patients and the resulting psychological effects.&#xD;
    </textblock>

    <textblock>
      Telepresence robots are increasingly used as a means of remote communications, especially for&#xD;
      teleconsultations and/or access to various public services (cultural events, education,&#xD;
      etc.). In the context of long-term hospitalisation, they can be used for various purposes,&#xD;
      such as access to cultural events, university activities, contact with patient's home and&#xD;
      maintenance of family links. Some studies have analyzed the use of these robots and their&#xD;
      effects in academic settings or the suitability of their use with elderly populations for&#xD;
      continuing care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, no study has evaluated the interest for the parent-child relationship of&#xD;
      the use of a telepresence robot during the hospitalisation in protective isolation for a long&#xD;
      period of a patient with young child(ren).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to conduct this observational, multi-center prospective study aiming at evaluating&#xD;
      the parent-child relationship following the setting up of a mobile telepresence robot for&#xD;
      patients with children aged 15 years or less and hospitalised in long-term protective&#xD;
      isolation.&#xD;
