  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pharmacological approaches in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) have advanced&#xD;
      radically during the last decades. However, focus on long-term management of body weight,&#xD;
      which is an essential part of treatment success, is often lacking. Excluding surgery, there&#xD;
      are only a few effective treatment methods for obesity. Management of obesity is also greatly&#xD;
      challenged by weight regain, which is common after a successful lifestyle intervention.&#xD;
      Weight regain typically results in the deterioration of glucose homeostasis in T2DM. However,&#xD;
      understanding the pathomechanisms of weight regain and subsequent worsening of glucose&#xD;
      homeostasis is still insufficient. Therefore, T2DM treatment programs that target long-term&#xD;
      weight management have been scarce. This study aims to fill the gaps in the current knowledge&#xD;
      by advancing the development of treatment programs for T2DM that simultaneously head for&#xD;
      improved glucose metabolism and improved long-term body weight control.&#xD;

      In this randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled trial we compare the effects&#xD;
      of semaglutide 1.34 mg/ml vs. normal dieting by randomizing the patients with both T2DM and&#xD;
      overweight/obesity (BMI ≥27) (n=50, aged ≥18 to &lt; 65 years) to two groups: both groups&#xD;
      participate in a similar lifestyle treatment to induce weight loss, but one group gets an&#xD;
      add-on of semaglutide 1.34mg/ml while the other is treated with placebo. Additionally, a&#xD;
      reference group of healthy normal weight non-diabetic individuals (BMI ≤ 25 kg/m2, n=25, aged&#xD;
      ≥18 to &lt; 65 years) are included as controls at the initiation of the study.&#xD;
