    <textblock>
      Pulse diagnosis is an important method to judge the status of patients in the process of&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of traditional Chinese medicine. At present, the commonly used site&#xD;
      of pulse diagnosis is the radial artery, which is divided into &quot;cun&quot;&quot;guan&quot; and &quot;chi&quot;.During&#xD;
      menstruation, the secretion of estrogen and progesterone drops to the lowest level. On the&#xD;
      7th day of menstruation in the proliferative period, the secretion of estrogen increases&#xD;
      rapidly and rises to the first peak before ovulation. In the mid-secretory period, the&#xD;
      secretion of estrogen rises to another peak, and the secretion of progesterone also reaches&#xD;
      the highest peak. The state of the endometrium during non-menstrual period can be&#xD;
      significantly different from the state of exfoliation and necrosis during menstruation. There&#xD;
      are obvious differences in hormone levels and endometrial state and thickness in menstrual&#xD;
      period and secretory period, especially in the middle and late secretion period, which&#xD;
      affects the blood laminar flow of the uterine wall and is reflected in the acoustic&#xD;
      information of the radial artery. Therefore, exploring the pulse manifestation of&#xD;
      physiological menstruation can be expected to lay the foundation for assisting the diagnosis&#xD;
      of pathological menstruation and endometrial diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our team found that there are low-frequency sound waves in the radial artery, which carry the&#xD;
      physiological and pathological information of the organs in the body, and developed a &quot;Pulse&#xD;
      Detection System of Sound Waves &quot;. Previous projects have explored the abnormal sound waves&#xD;
      of radial artery in patients with sequelae of cerebral infarction, stable coronary heart&#xD;
      disease, chronic gastritis, neck-shoulder syndrome, liver cirrhosis and other diseases and&#xD;
      achieved certain results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in this study, the &quot;Pulse Detection System of Sound Waves &quot; will be used to&#xD;
      collect the sound waves in the radial artery of 62 healthy female college students during&#xD;
      menstruation and non-menstrual period within the same menstrual cycle , and researchers will&#xD;
      carry on the frequency spectrum analysis and wavelet analysis to extract the pulse features.&#xD;
      A diagnostic test was carried out by researchers to calculate the sensitivity and specificity&#xD;
      of the &quot;Sonic Pulse Detection System&quot; in menstrual diagnosis. This study will verify the&#xD;
      efficacy of pulse diagnosis of traditional Chinese medicine in the diagnosis of menstruation&#xD;
      and lay a foundation for the diagnosis of pathological menstruation and endometrial diseases&#xD;
      .&#xD;
