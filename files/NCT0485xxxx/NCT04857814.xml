  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung diseases are one of the most common causes of emergency room visits. There are very few&#xD;
      tools that are able to predict which patients will have a worsening or increasing severity of&#xD;
      their condition. There are also limited ways to check the health of patients with respiratory&#xD;
      conditions at home and during the time between medical appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ADAMM-RSMTM device records heart rate, breathing rate, temperature, cough and activity&#xD;
      while wearing it. This study will test participants willingness to wear the device and&#xD;
      perform ongoing monitoring to assess the possibility to predict the onset and increases in&#xD;
      severity of their lung conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The project will aim to create the infrastructure to collect clinical data and participants&#xD;
      reported biometric measures (ePReBMs) from wearable devices in a database, and to run a pilot&#xD;
      phase with a limited number of participants. During this phase, the feasibility of a&#xD;
      long-term (6 months) home monitoring of respiratory parameters with the wearable device&#xD;
      ADAMM-RSM (Health Care Originals, Rochester, NY, USA) will be tested, in parallel with the&#xD;
      standard of care, in a limited number of participants with progressive fibrosing interstitial&#xD;
      disease (PF-ILD) including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), lung transplant, cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis (CF) and bronchiectasis, and tuberculosis (TB). The study design will test the&#xD;
      possibility to collect data from ADAMM-RSM: ideally, the participants should wear the&#xD;
      ADAMM-RSM every day, for at least 8 hours. For the purpose of this study, the investigators&#xD;
      will aim to collect data from the device for every participant at least 3 days per week, at&#xD;
      least 8 hours per day, for a period of 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of this study is estimated in 2 years, including the data analysis. The&#xD;
      participants will be provided the due information about the study and they will sign a&#xD;
      written consent before enrolment (a copy is attached to the application to the Research&#xD;
      Ethics Office of the University of Alberta).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every participant enrolled in the study will be asked to wear the ADAMM-RSM (Health Care&#xD;
      Originals, Rochester, NY, USA) device every day for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The wearable device includes a non-invasive biosensor and processor that is attached to the&#xD;
      surface of the skin using an adhesive sticker. It is designed to measure physical activity,&#xD;
      heart rate, respiration, skin temperature, and cough metrics using embedded audio&#xD;
      transducers, thermistor, accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer. It can be applied&#xD;
      anywhere on the chest, with a single-use, changeable sticker. As such, the device is able to&#xD;
      collect heart and respiratory rate, temperature and cough, and to correlate these parameters&#xD;
      to rest, activity and intensity of activity for the duration of the battery (18 hours). After&#xD;
      signing the informed consent, the participants will be instructed on how to apply and to&#xD;
      remove the device on/from the chest, to use the device during the day, and to recharge it at&#xD;
      night using its dedicated charger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every device is supplied with a unique anonymous identifier, and will transmit the data via&#xD;
      Wi-Fi to a cloud secured database provided by Health Care Originals (Health Care Originals,&#xD;
      Rochester, NY, USA). This database will be physically located in a server within the Canadian&#xD;
      borders. The database will be moved to a secured server at the University of Alberta at the&#xD;
      end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential registrations of speech during cough episodes are prevented by an integrated&#xD;
      algorithm in the device, cleaning automatically any sound other than cough before&#xD;
      transferring the data to the cloud server.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local research coordinators will use a web-based portal to check the usage of the devices and&#xD;
      that the devices are working properly. This portal does not include personal data of the&#xD;
      participants but only the device identifier so matching back of actual patient to data stream&#xD;
      will not occur on any of Healthcare Originals infrastructure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A unique progressive study ID will be assigned to every participant entering the study. This&#xD;
      ID will be coupled to the ADAMM-RSM identifier and it will be used in a separate database to&#xD;
      collect clinical and follow-up data. The ID will be coupled to participants identifiers only&#xD;
      in a third excel file, encrypted and protected with a password that will be accessible only&#xD;
      to the study investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be requested to fill 3 quality of life questionnaires (the King's Brief&#xD;
      Interstitial Lung Disease questionnaire for PF-ILD or Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire&#xD;
      for the other diagnoses, the Leicester Cough Questionnaire and the MRC dyspnea questionnaire&#xD;
      for all the enrolled patients) at the time of enrolment, and after 3 and 6 months. The&#xD;
      questionnaires will be used to compare responses at 3 and 6 months to the data generated from&#xD;
      the device. Participants will be asked to return the device to the study site at the 6-month&#xD;
      timepoint. Clinical data will be collected from the participant's chart if available at the&#xD;
      baseline, 3, and 6 month timepoints as per the CRF's.&#xD;
