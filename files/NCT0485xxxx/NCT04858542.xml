  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to understand how viewing educational health modules&#xD;
      impacts vocal health behaviors in mask-wearing healthcare workers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Results of the investigators' previous work showed that mask-wearing healthcare workers have&#xD;
      difficulty with voice and communication. Healthcare workers reported significant increases in&#xD;
      vocal effort and dyspnea while wearing masks, and showed greater effort and poorer vocal&#xD;
      quality at the end of the workday compared to the beginning of the day. Despite these&#xD;
      negative changes, very few healthcare workers reported using any type of communication&#xD;
      strategy (e.g., taking breaks, using gestures). Therefore, the investigators developed&#xD;
      educational modules to address the voice and communication problems facing this population.&#xD;
      This clinical trial plans to evaluate how these educational modules impact&#xD;
      subjective/objective voice and communication measures in mask-wearing healthcare workers.&#xD;

    <description>A self-perceptual rating of voice exertion and how hard it is to make a voice. The vocal effort scale will be rated on a 100-mm visual analog scale in which the left side (score of 0) indicates &quot;no effort&quot; to produce a voice, and the right side (score of 100) indicates &quot;the most effort&quot; to create a voice.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Relative fundamental frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed prior to viewing modules, and then 1-week later</time_frame>
    <description>An acoustic measure that characterizes change in fundamental frequency during voicing transitions. Participants will complete vowel-voiceless consonant-vowel combinations (e.g., /ifi/) and relative fundamental frequency will be determined.</description>

    <description>We have developed four educational health modules (total duration of approximately 30 minutes). First, these modules explain how masks impact communication and voice, then they describe health strategies to improve communication and voice, and finally, they give real-life examples of how the strategies can be implemented into the work setting.</description>
