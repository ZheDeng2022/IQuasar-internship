  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Quality of Life in Neurologic Disorders (NeuroQoL) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4, Week 22</time_frame>
    <description>The NeuroQoL short form will be used for this study, which consists of 5 statements on how much difficulty one currently has during certain activities. Each statement is answered on a scale of 1 (cannot do) to 5 (none); the total range of score is 1-25. The higher the score, the less difficulty one has.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in SymptoMScreen (SyMS) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4, Week 22</time_frame>
    <description>SyMS consists of 12 questions. Participants are asked to choose a response that best describes how each MS symptom has affected everyday life activities. Each questions is answered on a scale of 0 (not affected at all) to 6 (total limitation/I'm unable to do most daily activities); the total range of score is 0-72. The higher the score, the higher the limitation from MS symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: MS (WPAI:MS) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4, Week 22</time_frame>
    <description>There are 2 questions that are quantifiable - they pertain to how much MS has affected one's productivity while working or ability to do regular daily activities. The questions are answered on a scale of 0 (no effect) to 10 (complete prevention); the total range of score is 0-20. The higher the score, the higher the level of prevention.</description>
