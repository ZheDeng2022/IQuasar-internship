      Chagas disease is considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of the most&#xD;
      neglected tropical diseases in the world, having relevance in many Latin America countries.&#xD;
      In addition, it already affects North America, Europe, Asia and Oceania. Some studies suggest&#xD;
      that chagasic heart failure has a worse prognosis, with up to 50% shorter survival than other&#xD;
      etiologies. The PARADIGM-HF (Prospective Comparison of Angiotensin Receptor&#xD;
      Blocker-Neprilysin Inhibitor With Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor to Determine Impact&#xD;
      on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure) study showed 20% reduction in mortality&#xD;
      comparing sacubitril/valsartan with the standard treatment with ACE (angiotensin converting&#xD;
      enzyme) inhibitors. In the scenario of chagasic cardiomyopathy, a post hoc analysis of&#xD;
      PARADGIM-HF was reported on 113 patients. Reduced risk of cardiovascular death or&#xD;
      hospitalization for HF was noted in the group treated with sacubitril/valsartan. Attention&#xD;
      was drawn the study's limitations that included the small number of patients and reduced&#xD;
      statistical power. Therefore, the benefit of this new class remains uncertain in heart&#xD;
      failure due to Chagas cardiomyopathy. The ANSWER-HF Trial will be a clinical, randomized,&#xD;
      single-center, prospective, double-blind, controlled study. It will include 200 consecutive&#xD;
      participants with Chagas cardiomyopathy and left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40%&#xD;
      randomized independently. The objective of this study is to evaluate the benefit of&#xD;
      sacubitril/valsartan compared with enalapril in patients with heart failure due to Chagas&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy, with reduced ejection fraction. The primary endpoint of the study is the&#xD;
      change of left ventricular ejection fraction determined by transthoracic echocardiography.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include: assessment of ventricular arrhythmias; evaluation of functional&#xD;
      class; assessment of functional capacity; assessment of ventricular remodeling; and&#xD;
      evaluation of biomarkers. The patients will be followed for 6 months after treatment start.&#xD;
      All patients will be undergone to Doppler Echocardiography, 24-hour Holter, 6-minute walk&#xD;
      test, Biochemical and hematological exams and Biomarkers at the baseline and after 6 months.&#xD;

      Introduction: Chagas disease (CD) is an infectious parasitic disease caused by the protozoan&#xD;
      Trypanosoma cruzi. It is considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of the most&#xD;
      neglected tropical diseases in the world, having relevance in many Latin America countries.&#xD;
      In addition, it already affects North America, Europe, Asia and Oceania due to current&#xD;
      migration patterns. In the chronic phase, about 70% of individuals have no symptoms and&#xD;
      routine complementary examinations related to the heart and digestive system do not show any&#xD;
      changes. The other 30% of patients can develop the cardiac and/or digestive form of which&#xD;
      about 10% may progress to severe heart disease. Chagasic cardiomyopathy is associated with&#xD;
      major heart failure, sudden death, often due to severe arrhythmias and thromboembolic&#xD;
      phenomena. This cardiomyopathy has a higher degree of myocardial fibrosis compared with any&#xD;
      other etiology. Furthermore, some studies suggest that chagasic heart failure has a worse&#xD;
      prognosis, with up to 50% shorter survival than survival with other etiologies, such as&#xD;
      ischemic disease and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. The pharmacological treatment of&#xD;
      heart failure in Chagas disease comprises neurohormone blockers as is the case for&#xD;
      angiotensin II converting enzime (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II (AII) receptor blocker&#xD;
      (ARBs), beta-blockers and mineralocorticoid antagonists. In 2014 with the publication of the&#xD;
      PARADIGM-HF study, a new drug class (ARNI: angiotensin receptor-neprilisin inhibitor) was&#xD;
      proposed showing a 20% reduction in mortality compared with the standard treatment with ACE&#xD;
      inhibitors. Sacubitril/valsartan is the first molecule of this class. This new molecule acts&#xD;
      by blocking AII AT1 (angiotensin type 1) receptors, and therefore, attenuating the harmful&#xD;
      effects of this peptide. It also promotes the blocking of the degradation of natriuretic&#xD;
      peptides, increasing the protective effects of this family of proteins. In the scenario of&#xD;
      chagasic cardiomyopathy, a post hoc analysis of PARADGIM-HF was conducted by Ramires and&#xD;
      colleagues who reported on 113 patients treated with sacubitril/valsartan or enalapril.&#xD;
      Reduced risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for HF was noted in the group treated&#xD;
      with sacubitril/valsartan. Attention was drawn the study's limitations that included the&#xD;
      small number of patients and reduced statistical power. Therefore, the benefit of this new&#xD;
      class remains uncertain in heart failure due to Chagas cardiomyopathy. Knowing that chagasic&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy is characterized by intense myocardial fibrosis, inflammation and oxidative&#xD;
      stress, and with sacubitril/valsartan being the molecule that has a protective effect in&#xD;
      exactly these same mechanisms, our hypothesis is that this drug may improve myocardial&#xD;
      remodeling, and therefore it may modulate ventricular function, arrhythmias and functional&#xD;
      capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The ANSWER-HF Trial will be a clinical, randomized, single-center, prospective,&#xD;
      double-blind, controlled study. It will include 200 consecutive participants randomized&#xD;
      independently. The objective of this study is to evaluate the benefit of sacubitril/valsartan&#xD;
      compared with enalapril in patients with heart failure due to Chagas cardiomyopathy, with&#xD;
      reduced ejection fraction. Endpoints: The primary endpoint of the study is the change of left&#xD;
      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) determined by transthoracic echocardiography. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints include: assessment of ventricular arrhythmias; evaluation of functional class;&#xD;
      assessment of functional capacity; assessment of ventricular remodeling; and evaluation of&#xD;
      biomarkers. Security outcomes include systolic blood pressure (SBP) less than 95 mmHg; renal&#xD;
      function assessed by GFR (glomerular filtration rate) less than 30 mL/min; serum potassium &gt;&#xD;
      5.2 mmol/L; and angioedema; whereas, exploratory outcomes are hospitalization for heart&#xD;
      failure and mortality from all causes. Randomization: Randomization will be carried out using&#xD;
      a RedCap platform blinded randomization being performed 1:1 for each arm of the study.&#xD;
      Treatment Procedure and Strategies: The selected patients will go through the first visit&#xD;
      (selection - V0), when the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be evaluated. If these&#xD;
      criteria are met, the informed consent form (ICF) will then be presented and clarified. After&#xD;
      all doubts are resolved, the patient or his or her legal representative must sign it. In this&#xD;
      selection visit, the baseline tests that make up the inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
      (biochemical profile and echocardiogram) will be requested. Two weeks later, on visit 1&#xD;
      (randomization - V1), the tests performed will be analyzed and, if the patients' eligibility&#xD;
      is confirmed, the patients will be randomized for each arm of the study. At this visit,&#xD;
      baseline exams for the study (Holter, 6-minute walk test and pre-defined biomarkers) will be&#xD;
      required. After two weeks, on visit 2 (V2) a new clinical evaluation will be carried out, and&#xD;
      with no clinical exclusion criteria (pre-defined blood pressure levels and creatinine&#xD;
      clearance), patients will receive the study medication. After two weeks, on visit 3 (V3), a&#xD;
      new clinical evaluation will be carried out and the medication will be titrated according to&#xD;
      that clinical evaluation. After 2 weeks, on visit 4 (V4), a new clinical evaluation and&#xD;
      titration, if possible, will be conducted. After 4 weeks, on visit 5 (V5), a new clinical and&#xD;
      biochemical assessment will be carried out, in addition to titration of the medication&#xD;
      according to blood pressure levels. After 8 weeks on visit 6 (V6), clinical evaluation and&#xD;
      medication titration will be performed according to blood pressure levels. Finally, after&#xD;
      another 8 weeks, on visit 7 (V7), a new clinical and biochemical evaluation will be&#xD;
      performed, in addition to a 6-minute walk test, transthoracic echocardiography, Holter and&#xD;
      biomarker collection. Therefore, the study will be followed up for 6 months. Withdrawal and&#xD;
      discontinuation: Despite the limited duration of the study, participants have the right to&#xD;
      withdraw from the clinical investigation at any time and for any reason, without prejudice to&#xD;
      their care. Doppler Echocardiography: All patients will undergo two-dimensional&#xD;
      echocardiography with tissue Doppler, at the beginning and at the end of the protocol, under&#xD;
      the guidelines of the cut and image plans published by the American Society of&#xD;
      Echocardiography. Based on this guideline, the measurements of the left ventricular (LV)&#xD;
      systolic and diastolic diameters will be quantified, as well as their respective volumes. The&#xD;
      thickness of the LV interventricular septum and posterior wall will also be assessed and the&#xD;
      LV ejection fraction will be quantified by the Simpsons method. The diastolic function will&#xD;
      be measured using the transmitral Doppler obtaining the E (initial) and A (late) waves, E / A&#xD;
      ratio and the E wave deceleration time (DT). The investigators will also obtain the tissue&#xD;
      Doppler traces in the basal region of the septum and in the mitral lateral ring, to analyze&#xD;
      the velocities of the s', e' and a' waves. 24-hour Holter: All patients in the study will&#xD;
      undergo a 24-hour Holter monitoring, at the beginning and end of the protocol. The minimum,&#xD;
      average and maximum heart rates will be analyzed, as well as the number, frequency and&#xD;
      density of ventricular extrasystoles; episodes, duration and frequency of sustained or not&#xD;
      sustained ventricular tachycardia; and finally the number and size of breaks. 6-minute walk&#xD;
      test: The test will be applied according to the 2002 American Thoracic Society Guidelines.&#xD;
      Before performing the test, patients will have a rest period of at least 10 minutes. During&#xD;
      this period, data on blood pressure, pulse oximetry, dyspnea level (Borg scale), heart and&#xD;
      respiratory rate should be evaluated, so that the test can begin. Biochemical and&#xD;
      hematological exams: The laboratory tests evaluated in the study will be urea, creatinine,&#xD;
      sodium, potassium, ionized calcium, magnesium, glycemia and C-reactive protein. These exams&#xD;
      will be collected at V0, V5 and V7. Biomarkers: The NT-proBNP (N terminal-pro brain&#xD;
      natriuretic peptide) will be evaluated. The concentrations of IL-6 (interleukin-6), TNFα&#xD;
      (tumor necrosis factor alfa), Galectin-3 present in the patients' serum or plasma will be&#xD;
      measured at the beginning and at the end of the protocol, through enzymatic immunoassays&#xD;
      (ELISA) using specific company kits R &amp;amp; D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). For the analysis of&#xD;
      microRNAs linked to inflammation and fibrosis, in the circulation, the investigators will&#xD;
      follow the established protocol. The microRNAs selected for the study (mir-19a-3p;&#xD;
      mir-30;mir-133 and housekeeping) synthesized by Applied Biosystems (Thermo Fisher Scientific&#xD;
      Inc, USA) and their respective oligonucleotide sequences. Statistical Analysis: For the&#xD;
      calculation of the sample size a few randomized studies have been conducted specifically in&#xD;
      patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy. Most studies on heart failure do not distinguish the&#xD;
      etiology of the disease, and therefore, all estimates assumed here consider that the expected&#xD;
      effect based on the current literature is reflected in a similar way for chagasic patients.&#xD;
      The PROVE-HF study (Januzzi et al., 2019) suggests that the improvement in EF in patients who&#xD;
      receive sacubitril-valsartan is 5.2% with 95% CI (confidence interval) [4.8-5.6] at 6 months,&#xD;
      which indicates a standard deviation of approximately 5.5% for this difference. The SOLVD&#xD;
      (Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction) study (Kornstam et al., 1993) compared enalapril&#xD;
      with placebo and showed an average improvement in EF of 3.0% in 1 year for patients in the&#xD;
      enalapril group, with standard deviations at baseline and in 1 year similar to 5.5% from the&#xD;
      previous study, which indicates that a standard deviation for the difference of 5.5% is also&#xD;
      reasonable for the enalapril group. In addition, it is reasonable to assume that the effect&#xD;
      in 6 months for the enalapril group is about half (1.5% or 2.0%), because PROVE-HF in one&#xD;
      year had almost twice the effect (average improvement of 9.2%). In view of this, the&#xD;
      investigators considers sample sizes for different scenarios, considering study powers of 80%&#xD;
      and 90%, expected average differences between the improvements of the enalapril and&#xD;
      sacubitril-valsartan groups varying from 2% to 5%, significance level of 5% for two-tailed&#xD;
      hypotheses for a hypothesis test of comparison of proportions and 1:1 allocation (Chow et&#xD;
      al., 2008). Because loss of follow-up (including death) is still possible, follow-up of these&#xD;
      patients is a challenge. Including a 20% loss rate at the end of the estimate is suggested.&#xD;
      Thus, the investigators could justify the study sample size of 182 (152 + ~ 20%) to identify&#xD;
      an average difference of 2.5% of the improvement in EF with a standard deviation of 5.5%,&#xD;
      considering a significance level of 5%, allocation 1:1, loss of follow-up of 20% and power of&#xD;
      80%. Statistical analysis: The normality of the quantitative variables will be assessed with&#xD;
      the Shapiro-Wilks test. Parametric variables will be described as mean and standard deviation&#xD;
      and compared using the Student t test. Nonparametric variables will be described with median&#xD;
      and interquartile range and compared using the Mann-Whitney test. Categorical variables will&#xD;
      be assessed using the chi-square test or Fisher exact test or likelihood ratio.Compliance&#xD;
      Rules and Regulations: The protocol, the informed consent form and other documents related to&#xD;
      the study was submitted to the Ethics Committee (CEP)/Institutional Review Board (CRI). The&#xD;
      study will be carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice (GCP). Data storage and Quality Assurance and Management: It is expected that all&#xD;
      data entered in REDCAP will have source documentation available. Data collection will be&#xD;
      performed through an electronic case report form (eCRF).&#xD;
