      The primary objective of this study is quantify the transmission risk posted by SARS-CoV-2 in&#xD;
      pre/asymptomatic infected children in order to inform the public health response to the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;

      1. Background &amp; Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Background: Transmission from individuals with pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic&#xD;
           (hereafter abbreviated as pre/asymptomatic) SARS-CoV-2 infections is the Achilles' heel&#xD;
           of COVID-19 pandemic control1. While pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection is yet to be fully&#xD;
           characterized, and generally children are more likely to experience asymptomatic&#xD;
           infection or mild disease compared with adults, severe outcomes are possible. Although&#xD;
           person-to-person spread is well described in children, as schools have been closed, the&#xD;
           transmission risk in that environment remains unknown. More importantly, the&#xD;
           contribution of pre/asymptomatic children to overall transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is&#xD;
           unclear with most pediatric cases linked to a symptomatic household member. According to&#xD;
           China's National Health Commission, 130 (78%) of 166 new infections identified on April&#xD;
           1, 2020 were asymptomatic. In addition, data from an adult long-term care facility in&#xD;
           Washington indicates that symptom-based screening failed to identify a significant&#xD;
           proportion of COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, based on RT-PCR cycle threshold values, large&#xD;
           quantities of viral RNA were detected in pre/asymptomatic residents, suggesting the&#xD;
           potential for transmission regardless of symptoms. Asymptomatic pediatric colonization,&#xD;
           while reported, is poorly described.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Rationale: SARS-CoV-2 shedding has been noted to occur in minimally symptomatic and&#xD;
           asymptomatic infected persons. Children therefore, who appear to more commonly&#xD;
           experience mild and asymptomatic infection, may represent a significant risk of&#xD;
           household and community transmission. Recommendations for school closures are currently&#xD;
           based on assumptions as well as evidence gathered from influenza outbreaks where these&#xD;
           measures are known to reduce social contacts and interrupt transmission. School&#xD;
           closures, however, disrupt the lives of students and their families and may have&#xD;
           negative consequences on child health16. Moreover, COVID-19 transmission modelling&#xD;
           studies predict that school closures alone prevent only 2 - 4% of COVID-19-related&#xD;
           deaths in the general population, much less than other physical distancing&#xD;
           interventions. It should be noted that as school closures were in place before&#xD;
           observational studies could begin, the secondary clinical attack rate of&#xD;
           pre/asymptomatic children is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Research Questions &amp; Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary objective of this study is quantify the transmission risk posted by&#xD;
           SARS-CoV-2 in pre/asymptomatic infected children in order to inform the public health&#xD;
           response to the COVID-19 pandemic by determining the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
           If the proportion of household members who develop symptomatic illness over the&#xD;
           subsequent 12 days is greater among households of pre/asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive&#xD;
           children relative to negative children. Mathematical models will be developed to&#xD;
           understand the risks associated with other community transmission settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In SARS-CoV-2 positive children, if quantitative viral loads differ between those who&#xD;
           become symptomatic relative to those who remain asymptomatic and have secondary&#xD;
           household cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary aims of this study include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Determining risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 pre/asymptomatic infection in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective cohort study, taking place at multiple institutions throughout the United&#xD;
      States and Canada, of children brought to the Emergency Department for care due to a&#xD;
      condition or illness unrelated to SARS-CoV-2 infection who are tested as part of ongoing&#xD;
      local asymptomatic surveillance programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For every SARS-CoV-2-positive asymptomatic child enrolled, three asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-test&#xD;
      negative children will also be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any child that is tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 who is asymptomatic as part of&#xD;
      clinical care, will be potentially eligible for the study. Locally, any child who is tested&#xD;
      for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and who is not displaying any known COVID-19 symptoms will be&#xD;
      asked by an Alberta Health Services ED staff member for consent to provide their information&#xD;
      to the research team to be contacted about potential participation in the study (consent to&#xD;
      contact). Due to testing result timelines and to minimize possible exposure, informed&#xD;
      consent/assent will be obtained via telephone and a copy of the consent documentation will be&#xD;
      sent via email to the consenting individual, if required. Eligibility for the study based on&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be determined over the telephone. Data will be obtained&#xD;
      from the participant, their caregiver, and their medical chart, as appropriate. To obtain&#xD;
      data related to symptomology, additional medical care, additional testing, and household&#xD;
      transmission, a follow up questionnaire will be performed 14 days after the baseline ED&#xD;
      visit. If a member of the household is waiting on SARS-CoV-2 testing results at the 14 day&#xD;
      follow up time point, an additional call will be made 21 days after the baseline ED visit to&#xD;
      obtain SARS-CoV-2 test results. A follow-up call will be performed at 90 days to identify any&#xD;
      chronic symptoms that may have developed.&#xD;
