      This randomized clinical trial was conducted in the department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology&#xD;
      at the Saudi German Hospital, Madinah-KSA, during the period from February 2019 to August&#xD;
      2020. The study included 207 patients who fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: age of&#xD;
      18 to 35 years, overweight and obese PCOS patients (overweight defined as body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI) 25-29.9 kg/m2 and obesity defined as BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) attending the outpatient clinic,&#xD;
      complaining of amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea with or without hirsutism. Amenorrhea was defined&#xD;
      as absence of menstruation for six or more months. Oligomenorrhea was defined as cycle&#xD;
      interval of more than 35 days but less than 6 months. PCOS was diagnosed according to the&#xD;
      2004 Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM Consensus workshop, with presence of at least 2 out of 3 criteria:&#xD;
      oligo- and/or anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, and polycystic&#xD;
      ovarian morphology identified by ultrasound with more than 12 small antral follicles in an&#xD;
      ovary, with exclusion of other related aetiologies like androgen-secreting tumours,&#xD;
      congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and hyperprolactinemia. Prediabetes patients who are at&#xD;
      increased risk of developing diabetes, as defined by the American Diabetes Association 2014,&#xD;
      were included. Those patients had; impaired fasting glucose (IFG) defined as fasting plasma&#xD;
      glucose (FPG) levels of 100 to 125 mg/dL (Fasting was described as no caloric intake for at&#xD;
      least 8 hours), or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) defined as 2-hour readings of 140 to 199&#xD;
      mg/dL in the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Patients who were considered at very high&#xD;
      risk of developing diabetes according to the International Expert Committee 2009 were also&#xD;
      included. Those patients had their Glycosylated Hemoglobin A1C levels between 5.7% and 6.4%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria were: lean or average weight PCOS with BMI &lt; 25 kg/m2, morbidly obese&#xD;
      patients with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2, patients suffering from any other metabolic disorders, history&#xD;
      of receiving any hormonal treatment or any drug affecting carbohydrate metabolism 3 months&#xD;
      prior to the beginning of the study, and inability to attend the regular follow up visits.&#xD;
      Already known and recently diagnosed diabetic patients were excluded from the study.&#xD;
      According to the American Diabetes Association 2014, diabetes mellitus was defined as&#xD;
      Glycosylated Hemoglobin A1C levels ≥ 6.5% or FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL or 2-hour plasma glucose&#xD;
      readings ≥ 200 mg/dL during 75 g OGTT, or presence of classic symptoms of hyperglycemia with&#xD;
      random plasma glucose levels ≥ 200 mg/dL. Thyroid diseases and hyperprolactinemia were&#xD;
      treated before participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study was in accordance with the Helsinki declaration 1964 and its later amendments. The&#xD;
      study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee. All patients signed an informed&#xD;
      consent before participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first booking visit, initial assessment was carried out with detailed history&#xD;
      taking, including personal, medical, surgical, obstetric and menstrual history. General&#xD;
      examination was done with measurement of BMI, waist circumference (WC), hip circumference&#xD;
      (HC) and waist: hip ratio (WHR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      BMI had the disadvantage of not truly representing the body fat distribution and hence the&#xD;
      nature of obesity as concluded by many studies. So, the waist circumference, hip&#xD;
      circumference and waist: hip ratio were selected as more convenient measures of abdominal&#xD;
      visceral fat and hence important clinical markers to predict patients at risk of developing&#xD;
      DM and cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements were carried out according to the World Health Organization (WHO) STEPS protocol&#xD;
      2008. Waist circumference was measured at the midpoint between the lower margin of the last&#xD;
      palpable rib and the top of the iliac crest. Hip circumference was measured around the widest&#xD;
      portion of the buttocks. For both measurements, the tape was adjusted parallel to the floor&#xD;
      at the level at which the measurement was made. The tape was held snugly around the body, but&#xD;
      not pulled so tight. The patient was standing with feet close together, arms at the sides and&#xD;
      body weight evenly distributed across the feet. The waist circumference was measured at the&#xD;
      end of a normal expiration, when the lungs are at their functional residual capacity. Because&#xD;
      many individuals unconsciously react to waist measurements by sucking their abdominal wall,&#xD;
      the patients were advised to relax and take a few natural breaths before the actual&#xD;
      measurement was made. Each measurement was repeated twice; if the measurements were within 1&#xD;
      cm of one another, the average was calculated. If the difference between the two measurements&#xD;
      exceeded 1 cm, the two measurements were repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the booking visit; a basal pelvic ultrasound was done for virgin participants and&#xD;
      transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) for non-virgin patients. Blood samples were also collected for&#xD;
      OGTT, Glycosylated Hemoglobin A1C levels, estimation of SOD activity and MDA concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed in the morning after an overnight&#xD;
      fasting of at least 8 hours, utilizing a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75 grams&#xD;
      of anhydrous glucose dissolved in water. Glycosylated Hemoglobin A1C levels were also&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For estimation of SOD activity, centrifugation of the blood samples was done at 1000 g for 10&#xD;
      minutes, the serum was frozen and stored at -80 °C until the time of analysis. SOD activity&#xD;
      was based on the ability of the enzyme to inhibit the reduction of nitro blue tetrazolium dye&#xD;
      mediated by phenazine methosulphate. The purified SOD inhibits the initial rate of reduction&#xD;
      of (O2 to O2-) mediated by the activated phenazine methosulphate which then reduces the nitro&#xD;
      blue tetrazolium. The percentage of inhibition was then calculated and compared to the&#xD;
      standard of 0.5 μg of the enzyme that produced inhibition of 80 % (activity = 3.000 units/mg&#xD;
      protein). The SOD activity was finally expressed as units of enzymatic activity per mg of&#xD;
      protein contained in the samples (U/mg protein).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations were measured in µmol/liter using the derivatization MDA&#xD;
      with thiobarbituric acid (TBA) based on spectrophotometric determination of pink fluorescent&#xD;
      MDA-TBA complex produced after reaction with 2-thiobarbituric acid at high temperature and&#xD;
      low pH. The assay kits for MDA and SOD were products of (Cell Biolabs Inc, San Diego, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were divided into two groups (A and B) using a computer-based software Open Epi&#xD;
      version 3.21. Patients in Group A, received Metformin 500 mg three times daily (5) with meals&#xD;
      for 6 months (Metfor® 500 mg, Metformin hydrochloride tablets. TABUK Pharmaceutical. KSA).&#xD;
      Patients in Group B, received a combination of Metformin 500 mg three times daily with meals&#xD;
      (Metfor® 500 mg, Metformin hydrochloride tablets. TABUK Pharmaceutical. KSA) and Thymoquinone&#xD;
      (TQ) in the form of Black Cumin oil (Cumin Mar® Black cumin oil 500 mg soft gel capsules,&#xD;
      MARNYS. Spain) three times daily before meals for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were instructed not to receive any non-study drug during the study period, to&#xD;
      increase their physical activity by performing aerobic physical exercise (moderate level for&#xD;
      two hours and thirty minutes weekly or vigorous level for one hour and fifteen minutes&#xD;
      weekly) divided over at least three days of the week, and to consume a low caloric diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were advised to attend for follow up after 3 and 6 months from the beginning of&#xD;
      the study for evaluation of their BMI, waist circumference, hip circumference, and waist /&#xD;
      hip ratio and to withdraw a blood sample for OGTT, A1C, SOD activity and MDA concentration.&#xD;
      Patients were also asked about their menstrual cycle pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study outcomes were; the resumption of regular menstrual cycles, weight reduction&#xD;
      as detected by decreased BMI, change of body fat distribution as proved by reduced Waist/Hip&#xD;
      ratio, improvement of the glycemic control as documented by normalization of OGTT and A1C and&#xD;
      regaining the normal oxidative balance as evidenced by decreased MDA concentration and&#xD;
      increased SOD activity.&#xD;
