    <textblock>
      This study evaluates post-operative pain between different insufflation pressures during&#xD;
      robotic-assisted sacrocolpopexy. Subjective pain and narcotic usage after surgery will be&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective single-blind randomized controlled trial of adult women undergoing&#xD;
      robotic-assisted sacrocolpopexy for pelvic organ prolapse. Each surgery will be performed by&#xD;
      a board-certified Female Pelvic Medicine &amp; Reconstructive Surgery (FPMRS) surgeon with a&#xD;
      standard technique other than pneumoperitoneum level. A sacrocolpopexy for apical prolapse&#xD;
      may be performed at the same time as a hysterectomy and other clinically indicated procedures&#xD;
      if desired by the patient and as part of the standard of care. Patients will be stratified by&#xD;
      hysterectomy prior to randomization. Postoperatively, patients will be evaluated with a&#xD;
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) as well as prescribed narcotic analgesic use and followed up to 2&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
