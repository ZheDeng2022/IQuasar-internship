    <textblock>
      The aim of this study will be to compare the effects of morphine versus ketamine when they&#xD;
      are used as adjuvants to the local anesthetic in paravertebral nerve blocks performed with&#xD;
      the aid of ultrasound. Furthermore, a group of local anesthetic without an adjuvant, will&#xD;
      also be compared to the two groups&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elective thoracotomies are usually performed for removal of pathological masses in the&#xD;
      mediastinum, lung parenchyma and upper gastrointestinal system. They are considered to be&#xD;
      painful operations, related to both acute and chronic pain (post- thoracotomy pain syndrome),&#xD;
      the latter lasting for a minimum period of 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative thoracic pain is associated often with diaphragmatic dysfunction, which can&#xD;
      also lead to atelectasis and pneumonia and post-operative pulmonary complications in general.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several techniques have been tried in order to minimize such events. Thoracic epidural&#xD;
      analgesia, intravenous analgesia, intercostal blocks, local infiltration of local anesthetics&#xD;
      by the surgeon are some of them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paravertebral thoracic blocks have become increasingly popular in recent years since they are&#xD;
      less likely to cause neurologic complications than thoracic epidural analgesia. Moreover,&#xD;
      bleeding disorders, and use of anti-coagulant and anti- thrombotic medications, which are&#xD;
      considered as contraindications to an epidural procedure, are not strict contraindications in&#xD;
      the performance of paravertebral blocks, especially when they are performed under&#xD;
      ultrasonographic guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ropivacaine and Levobupivacaine are the most popular local anesthetics that have been used.&#xD;
      Moreover, several adjuvants have been added to them in order to enhance the effects of those&#xD;
      blocks. Dexamethasone, Morphine, Dexmedetomidine, Clonidine, Ketamine, Magnesium Sulphate are&#xD;
      some of them. Results are variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale behind adjuvants used to enhance effects of local anesthetics is the fact that&#xD;
      some seem to act directly in the spinal cord receptors and the central nervous system. The&#xD;
      effect of morphine on the dorsal horns of the spinal cord has been extensively studied in the&#xD;
      past. Due to its limited lipophilicity, it is assumed that administering the specific drug to&#xD;
      the paravertebral space could lead to its transfer and action on the dorsal horns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, the action of ketamine seems to be by blocking N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA)&#xD;
      receptors in the spinal cord. It is also considered to have an effect on voltage sensitive&#xD;
      Ca2+ channels, opioid receptors, and monoaminergic receptors. Therefore, it is considered&#xD;
      overall to affect nociception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, it is assumed that morphine might have an effect on the dorsal horns of the spinal&#xD;
      cord, and ketamine on NMDA receptors at &quot;higher pain centers&quot;. It is also assumed that there&#xD;
      will be some degree of systemic absorption due to the rich vascular supply of the specific&#xD;
      area. The investigators aim to compare the effects of those two when they are used as&#xD;
      adjuvants to the local anesthetic in paravertebral nerve blocks performed with the aid of&#xD;
      ultrasound. Furthermore, a group of local anesthetic without an adjuvant, will also be&#xD;
      compared.&#xD;
