  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the continuing SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, several studies have reported a&#xD;
      significant difference in the rate of severe cases between adult females and adult males (42%&#xD;
      vs 58%).Among children under the age of 14, the rate of severe cases was reported to be&#xD;
      extremely low. To explain this difference, several theories have been proposed including&#xD;
      cigarette smoking and lifestyle habits. However, no theory fits both the gender difference in&#xD;
      severe cases as well as reduced risk in pre-pubescent children. Our past research on male&#xD;
      androgenetic alopecia (AGA) has led us to investigate an association between androgens and&#xD;
      COVID-19 pathogenesis. In normal subjects, androgen expression demonstrates significant&#xD;
      variation between men and women as well as between adults and pre-pubescent children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects type II pneumocytes in the human lung. SARS-CoV-2 enters&#xD;
      pneumocytes, by anchoring to the ACE2 cell surface receptor. Prior to receptor binding, viral&#xD;
      spike proteins undergo proteolytic priming by the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2).&#xD;
      TMPRSS2 inhibition or knock down reduces ability of SARS-CoV-1 (a related virus to&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2) to infect cells in vitro. Additionally, TMPRSS2 also facilitates entry of&#xD;
      influenza A and influenza B into primary human airway cells and type II pneumocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human TMPRSS2 gene has a 15 bp androgen response element and in humans, androgens are the&#xD;
      only known transcription promoters for the TMPRSS2 gene. In a study of androgen-stimulated&#xD;
      prostate cancer cells (LNCaP), TMPRSS2 mRNA expression increase was mediated by the androgen&#xD;
      receptor. Further, the ACE2 receptor, also critical for SARS-CoV-2 viral infectivity, is&#xD;
      affected by male sex hormones with higher activity found in males.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Androgenetic alopecia (AGA), often referred to as male pattern hair loss, is the most common&#xD;
      form of hair loss among men. The development of androgenetic alopecia is androgen mediated&#xD;
      and is dependent on genetic variants found in the androgen receptor gene located on the X&#xD;
      chromosome; thus, it is hypothesized that men with AGA would be more prone to severe COVID-19&#xD;
      disease. The investigators conducted a preliminary observational study of hospitalized&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients at two Spanish tertiary hospitals between March 23-April 6, 2020 to test&#xD;
      this theory. In total, 41 Caucasian males admitted to the hospitals with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      bilateral SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were analyzed. The mean age of patients was 58 years (range&#xD;
      23-79). Among them, 29 (71%) were diagnosed with AGA (16 (39%) were classified as severe AGA&#xD;
      (Hamilton IV or above)) and 12 (29%) did not present clinical signs of AGA. The diagnosis of&#xD;
      AGA was performed clinically by a dermatologist. The precise prevalence of AGA among&#xD;
      otherwise healthy Spanish Caucasian males is unknown; however, based on published literature,&#xD;
      the expected prevalence of a similar age-matched Caucasian population is approximately&#xD;
      31-53%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the scientific rationale combined with this preliminary observation, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to test an anti-androgen as a treatment for patients recently diagnosed&#xD;
      with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have chosen the use of the novel second generation androgen receptor (AR) antagonist&#xD;
      proxalutamide as a means for rapid reduction in AR activity. Proxalutamide (GT0918)&#xD;
      demonstrates a dual mechanism of action. It is highly effective in inhibiting AR as well as&#xD;
      exhibiting pharmacological effects of inducing the down-regulation of AR expression; the&#xD;
      mechanism that is not present in bicalutamide and enzalutamide. Additionally, it has been&#xD;
      reported that Proxalutamide lowers the expression of ACE2. Both would be beneficial for&#xD;
      preventing SARS-CoV-2 entry into lung cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is intended to explore the possible protective role of anti-androgens in&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. Provided anti-androgens are effective in reducing the rate of COVID-19&#xD;
      hospitalization, subjects enrolled in this study may experience a lower rate of&#xD;
      hospitalization.&#xD;
