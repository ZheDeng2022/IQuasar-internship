  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) occurs secondary to carbohydrate intolerance in&#xD;
      pregnancy. Screening of GDM occurs between 24 to 28 weeks gestation by a screening 1-hour 50g&#xD;
      glucose challenge test and confirmed with a 100g 3-hour fasting glucose tolerance test. Once&#xD;
      patients are diagnosed with GDM, they are instructed to check their fingerstick blood glucose&#xD;
      four times daily, every day. There is insufficient evidence to determine the ideal frequency&#xD;
      and timing of glucose monitoring in patients diagnosed with GDM and no absolute guidelines&#xD;
      put in place by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). The study&#xD;
      team aims to confirm non inferiority on the patient population on the effects of daily (4x&#xD;
      daily) versus every other day (4x daily) glucose monitoring in all patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      GDM.&#xD;

      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) occurs secondary to carbohydrate intolerance in&#xD;
      pregnancy. Screening of GDM occurs between 24 to 28 weeks gestation by a screening 1-hour 50g&#xD;
      glucose challenge test and confirmed with a 100g 3-hour fasting glucose tolerance test. In&#xD;
      the study team's practice, once a patient is diagnosed with GDM, they are enrolled in the&#xD;
      Diabetes in Pregnancy program, undergo nutritional education, diabetes education and have&#xD;
      their care overseen by a Maternal-Fetal Medicine specialist. They are instructed to check&#xD;
      their fingerstick blood glucose four times daily, every day. There is insufficient evidence&#xD;
      to determine the ideal frequency and timing of glucose monitoring in patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      GDM and no absolute guidelines put in place by the American College of Obstetricians and&#xD;
      Gynecologists. In 2017, a randomized control trial was performed by Menedez-Figeroa et al,&#xD;
      showing non inferiority in patients diagnosed with GDM who were instructed to perform every&#xD;
      other day (4 time daily) glucose monitoring versus daily (4 times daily) glucose monitoring&#xD;
      with their primary outcome being a 5% change in birthweight between groups at delivery. The&#xD;
      study team aims to confirm non inferiority on the patient population on the effects of daily&#xD;
      (4x daily) versus every other day (4x daily) glucose monitoring in all patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with GDM with the primary outcome being a 0% difference in birth weight. The study team will&#xD;
      be enrolling approximately 300 patients. If a patient is enrolled in the study, there will be&#xD;
      no excursion from normally scheduled visits (including follow ups), medications regimens, or&#xD;
      procedure (including ultrasounds). They will remain in the Diabetes in Pregnancy program&#xD;
      throughout their pregnancy. Participants will be enrolled at the first visit with the high&#xD;
      risk doctor, and they will be asked to perform standard (4x daily) fingerstick monitoring, or&#xD;
      every other day fingerstick monitoring (4x daily, every other day). Data collected from the&#xD;
      patient (including labs, and fingerstick glucose values) will not be exclusively for research&#xD;
      purposes, and will be collected as a routine part of the patients care&#xD;
