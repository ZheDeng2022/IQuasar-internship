      The prevelance of Allergic Respiratory Diseases has been increased worldwide and affect 1of 5&#xD;
      persons of general population . ARDs are triggered by exposure to allergen and includes&#xD;
      allergic rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis and bronchial asthma. ARDs are associated&#xD;
      with decreased quality of life and increased economic burden .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allergen-specific immunotherapy is the only disease modifying therapy preventing the&#xD;
      evolution of AR to asthma, and its efficacy has long been known since observations by Leonard&#xD;
      Noon in 1911. Allergen immunotherapy for AR is currently considered when showing strongly&#xD;
      suggestive symptoms of AR which interfere with daily activities or sleep, and having evidence&#xD;
      of IgE sensitization to â‰¥1 clinically relevant allergen .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) recommends treatmentof&#xD;
      children with moderate to severe AR with Allergen Immunotherapy. It includes sublingual&#xD;
      immunotherapy (SLIT) and subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT).Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT)&#xD;
      has been the gold standard, whereas sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) has emerged as an&#xD;
      effective and safe alternative .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) is the only treatment that regulates the immunological&#xD;
      process during development of allergic rhinitis (AR), rather than simply treating symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet activation occurs during antigen-induced airway reactions in allergic and asthmatic&#xD;
      subjects. Raised levels of platelet-derived mediators, such as the Platelet Factor-4 (PF4),&#xD;
      it is observed in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of atopic individuals, and has the&#xD;
      ability to activate eosinophils, increase expression of Fc-IgG and Fc-IgE receptors, and&#xD;
      stimulate basophils to release histamine.&#xD;
