  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To analyze in vivo occlusal accuracy and occlusal adjustment requirement, a cross-over&#xD;
      clinical trial was designed. Two 3-unit tooth-supported posterior FDPs were planned to be&#xD;
      made for each patient's single missing tooth gap, one with complete analog workflow (control&#xD;
      group) and the other complete digital workflow (test group). The analog workflow aims for a&#xD;
      porcelain fused to metal (PFM) FDP whereas the digital workflow aims for 3-unit monolithic Zr&#xD;
      FDP. PFor half of the restorations, digital impression was planned to be taken first and to&#xD;
      be followed by analog impression. As for the occlusal adjustment, in half of the study sites&#xD;
      monolithic Zr FDPs were planned to be tried-in first, followed by metal-ceramic FDP and vice&#xD;
      versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One investigator (DK) was assigned to prepare the restoration sites and deliver the FDPs. All&#xD;
      monolithic Zr and all metal-ceramic FDPs were designed and fabricated by the same experienced&#xD;
      dental technician. One investigator (HL), that was not involved in the treatment intervention&#xD;
      was assigned to make the 3D analysis of the volumetric occlusal adjustment amount.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All teeth preparations will be carried out ensuring the minimum material thickness for&#xD;
      monolithic FDPs (0.8-1 mm margin thickness, 1 mm occlusal thickness) by one experienced&#xD;
      investigator (DK). To prevent any possible carry-over effect, the impression acquisition&#xD;
      order will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group FDPs (metal-ceramic) will be fabricated with a complete analog workflow.&#xD;
      Accordingly, a polyether dual-phase impression (Impregum Penta Soft Quick and Soft Quick, 3M)&#xD;
      will be taken from the restoration arch and a Polyvinylsiloxane (PVS) impression material&#xD;
      will be used for the impression of the antagonist arch. Face bow transfer (Whip Mix Face bow0&#xD;
      will be done. Following the stone master model (Type IV dental rock, Fuji) obtention, the&#xD;
      maxillary models will be mounted to a semi-adjustable articulator based on the face bow&#xD;
      record and mandibular models will be then mounted with the aid of laterotrusive and MI&#xD;
      records. The MI and laterotrusive records will be taken with a PVS bite registration&#xD;
      material. The Cr-Ni frameworks will be fabricated with lost-wax technique (Brand?), manually&#xD;
      layered with feldspathic veneering porcelain (Vita), and glazed by one experienced dental&#xD;
      technician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test group FDPs (high translucent monolithic Zr) (Aidite Multilayer 3D) will be&#xD;
      fabricated by a complete/model-free digital workflow. The digital quadrant impressions of the&#xD;
      preparation, antagonist as well as bite registration will be obtained by the use of an IOS&#xD;
      (Trios 3, 3Shape). The files will be sent to a CAD software (Dental System, 3Shape) directly&#xD;
      via the communication tool (3 Shape Communicate, 3Shape). Following CAD, the high translucent&#xD;
      monolithic Zr 3-unit FDPs will be computer-aided manufactured (CORITEC 350i Loader,&#xD;
      imes-icore GmbH). FDPs will be high-gloss polished, glazed, and sent to the dental clinic for&#xD;
      the try-in session. Monolithic Zr design and manufacturing process will be completed by one&#xD;
      dental technician that is highly experienced in CAD/CAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical occlusal adjustment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standardized occlusal adjustment strategy will be adopted and executed by one investigator&#xD;
      for both control and test group FDPs. In half of the restoration sites, monolithic Zr&#xD;
      restorations will be the ones to have been tried first whereas in the other half&#xD;
      metal-ceramic FDPs were the first. Initially, distal and mesial approximal contact areas,&#xD;
      then the internal fit will be checked and adjusted to eliminate any interferences in order to&#xD;
      ensure the optimal fitting of the restorations. For the occlusal adjustment amount&#xD;
      calculation, the FDPs will be fixed on the prepared teeth provisionally and scanned by an IOS&#xD;
      (Trios 3, 3Shape) to record the pre-adjustment FDP volume. The occlusal contacts and&#xD;
      adjustment needs were assessed while still the restorations are fixed. The occlusal&#xD;
      adjustment strategy will be as follows: Under normal occlusal forces, 40-micron articulation&#xD;
      paper (Arti-Check micro-thin, Bausch, Cologne, Germany) will be used and followed by&#xD;
      12-micron articulation foil (Shimstock-foil, Bausch, Cologne, Germany) under strong occlusal&#xD;
      force. The FDPs' occlusal contact design will be ensured to hold the articulation foil under&#xD;
      strong occlusal force. Thereafter, once ensuring the FDPs to remain fixed, intraoral digital&#xD;
      quadrant impressions (Trios 3, 3 Shape) will be taken by the same investigator in order to&#xD;
      record the post-adjustment volume of the FDPs. After chairside finishing and polishing of the&#xD;
      adjustment areas, Monolithiz Zr FDPs will be adhesively luted by a composite cement as the&#xD;
      definitive restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4. Quantitative analysis Both .stl files (pre-and-post adjustment) will be exported in&#xD;
      order to process in an inspection software (Gom Inspect 2019, GOM GmbH, Braunschweig,&#xD;
      Germany). The pre-and post-adjustment .stl files will be superimposed with the surface of&#xD;
      restorations excluding occlusal adjusted area. After that, they will be sectioned from the&#xD;
      same planes, mesial, distal, and 3mm apical to occlusal plane. The total volume of the&#xD;
      sections that will be analyzed will be measured and the quantitative volume difference of the&#xD;
      sectioned parts then was Calculated three-dimensionally (3Matic, Materialise NV, Leuven,&#xD;
      Belgium). The total volumetric difference in mm3 between pre-and post-adjustment .stl files&#xD;
      will be calculated for each 3-unit FDP&#xD;
