  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to fill this essential knowledge gap by assessing the impact of oral&#xD;
      cholera vaccine mass campaigns in 2 sites (urban and rural) in DRC, described in this&#xD;
      protocol. The evidence generated from this project will be key to develop future strategies&#xD;
      regarding cholera vaccine use in endemic settings, including places with higher burden in&#xD;
      terms of cholera mortality.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project will comprise three different components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical cholera surveillance to measure cholera diseases incidence in selected African&#xD;
           hotspots targeted by vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Serial serological surveys to measure the prevalence of recent cholera infection (within&#xD;
           the last 12 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identification and follow up of individuals with positive V. cholerae shedding&#xD;
           (symptomatic or asymptomatic) among sero-survey participants and among household members&#xD;
           of cholera confirmed cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present protocol relates to the setup of clinical surveillance and the follow up of&#xD;
      individuals with positive V. cholerae shedding identified through clinical surveillance, in&#xD;
      DRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will allow us to assess if a large vaccination campaign reaching high coverage&#xD;
      in cholera hotspot in Africa can allow sustained control of cholera for at least two years,&#xD;
      by fulfilling the following specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure cholera incidence rates following the mass vaccination campaign in two&#xD;
           cholera hotspots in Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the duration of shedding among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals and the&#xD;
           duration of viable V. cholerae in the peri-household environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the secondary cholera attack rates (symptomatic and asymptomatic) at&#xD;
           household level among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals following the&#xD;
           identification of an index case in a given household.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the global genetic diversity of V. cholerae strains in the study areas and&#xD;
           within households affected by cholera.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop sustainable surveillance methods that could be applied in other hotspots in&#xD;
           Africa and elsewhere aiming to monitor the impact of the cholera control program.&#xD;

      Fresh stool sample for patients presenting at the Cholera Treatment Center (CTC) and&#xD;
      fulfilling the cholera case definition will first be tested with rapid test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of testing positive to Rapid Detection Test (RDT), additional samples on humid filter&#xD;
      paper will be made from fresh sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A fresh stool sample will be collected from all household members upon household visits .&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 90 and 180, fresh stool samples will only be collected from household member having&#xD;
      tested positive for active cholera shedding during the course of the previous visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples from peri-household environment including drinking water, left-over food and&#xD;
      latrines, will be taken during each household visit and sent to laboratory for testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dry filter paper samples will systematically be made from fresh stool sample. In case of&#xD;
      testing positive to RDT test, additional samples on humid filter paper will be made from&#xD;

        This activity will take place in the community at included patient's households. Patients&#xD;
