  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare changes in neurocognitive function across a&#xD;
      12-month period between three groups: (1) men treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)&#xD;
      for prostate cancer (PCa); (2) men under active surveillance for PCa; and (3) men without a&#xD;
      history of cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1: This study will examine differences in neurocognitive function (cognitive performance,&#xD;
      brain structural integrity) from baseline (within 30 days of ADT initiation or 90 days of&#xD;
      diagnosis) to 6- and 12-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Examine group differences in components of frailty (e.g., lean mass, muscle strength,&#xD;
      physical function, fatigue, physical activity) from baseline to 6- and 12-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men will be recruited for this study if they are (1) recently diagnosed with PCa and&#xD;
      scheduled to receive 6-months or more of ADT (ADT+ group, n=20), (2) recently diagnosed with&#xD;
      PCa and under active surveillance (ADT- group, n=20), or (3) healthy men without a history of&#xD;
      cancer (PCa- group, n=20). Eligible men (N=60) will be scheduled for two or three testing&#xD;
      appointments at each testing timepoint. To assess Aim 1, participants will complete measures&#xD;
      at baseline (M0), 6-month follow-up (M6), and 12-month follow-up (M12). Aim 1 measures&#xD;
      include: neurocognitive tasks, functional magnetic resonance imaging (optional; n=10 ADT+ and&#xD;
      n=10 ADT- only), and questionnaires. To assess Aim 2, outcomes indicated as components of&#xD;
      frailty syndrome will be measured, including: dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (e.g.,&#xD;
      appendicular lean mass), upper and lower body dynamometry, physical function and functional&#xD;
      capacity, questionnaires (i.e., fatigue surveys), and physical activity monitoring (i.e.,&#xD;
      accelerometry). Findings from this study will build upon the scientific framework for the&#xD;
      potential frailty pathway of cancer-associated cognitive decline in PCa patients in order to&#xD;
      develop future evidence-based interventions to manage cognitive impairment in men diagnosed&#xD;
      with PCa.&#xD;
