  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections after vaccination, to monitor the&#xD;
      development of SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels after vaccination and to compare this in relation&#xD;
      to both previous health &amp; disease, previous antibody responses and in relation to future&#xD;
      disease occurring after vaccination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to analyze the effect of and possible side effects of SARS-CoV2&#xD;
      vaccinations in the cohort study where data on sick leave, SARS-Cov2 infections and SARS-CoV2&#xD;
      antibody levels are well documented even before vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome measures are the presence of SARS-CoV-2 (ongoing infection) and the presence&#xD;
      of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the vaccination effect, the factors that are primarily associated with protection against&#xD;
      infection are analyzed, such as age, sex, workplace, antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 and&#xD;
      vaccination date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analyzes are planned to be performed with multivariate logistic regression with Relative&#xD;
      Risk as the outcome measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the analysis of virus antibodies are planned to be performed divided into whether&#xD;
      low, medium or high levels of antibodies occur, with the same analysis for possible&#xD;
      association with the factors listed above.&#xD;
