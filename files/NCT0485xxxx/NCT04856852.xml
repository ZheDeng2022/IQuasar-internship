  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicentric open-label trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      Iodine-125 brachytherapy together with chemotherapy compared with surgical resection followed&#xD;
      by concomitant radiochemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy outcome was evaluated with progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;

    <description>The Quality of life is measured with EORTC QLQ-C30 (The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life questionnaire). The EORTC QLQ-C30 is designed to measure cancer patients' physical, psychological and social functions. The questionnaire is composed of multi-item scales and single items.</description>

    <measure>ECOG Performance Status</measure>
    <time_frame>2.5 year after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>ECOG PS (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, performance status) is to assess how a patient's disease is progressing, and how the disease affects the daily living abilities of the patient, and determine appropriate treatment and prognosis. The scale is from 0 to 5. Higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>
