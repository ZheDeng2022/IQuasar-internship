      The purpose of this study is to measure the immune response to the COVID-19 vaccine in cancer&#xD;
      patients and compare to the general population. This information can help optimize the timing&#xD;
      of the mRNA-1273 vaccine relative to starting treatment for cancer, adding booster&#xD;
      immunizations or incorporation of medications that to enhance the immune response.&#xD;
