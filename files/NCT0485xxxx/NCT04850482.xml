    <textblock>
      A bilingual online self-help app - MyJourney - has been developed for individuals faced with&#xD;
      an unfulfilled wish for children. The specific aim of this trial is to evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility, defined here as determining whether the intervention itself and the study&#xD;
      procedures are appropriate for further evaluation, and how users react to the intervention,&#xD;
      which will inform the implementation of a future full scale RCT to evaluate MyJourney's&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This RCT will be a two arm, parallel-group, non-blind feasibility trial with 1:1 allocation&#xD;
      to the intervention group (immediate access to MyJourney) or waitlist control group (receives&#xD;
      access to MyJourney after 10 weeks). A minimum number of 152 individuals will be enrolled in&#xD;
      this study. Once participants have met the eligibility criteria and completed the baseline&#xD;
      assessment, they will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the intervention group or&#xD;
      the waitlist control group. The sample will be recruited online.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last 10 weeks for the waitlist group and 6 months for the&#xD;
      intervention group. Participants in both groups will be invited to complete a baseline&#xD;
      assessment (online survey) and a follow-up assessment (online survey) at 10-weeks post&#xD;
      baseline. The intervention group will also be invited to complete another follow-up&#xD;
      assessment at 6-months post baseline. Assessments will include self-report questionnaires to&#xD;
      cover socio-demographic information (baseline only), psychological mediators (mechanisms of&#xD;
      change) (baseline and 10-week follow-up), psychological outcome questionnaires (baseline,&#xD;
      10-week and 6-month follow up), and questions about acceptability and feasibility (10-week&#xD;
      and 6-month follow up).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, a bilingual self-help web-app, MyJourney, developed to support individuals&#xD;
      with an unfulfilled wish for children, will be evaluated for feasibility. This trial forms&#xD;
      part of the exploratory trial phase of development of complex interventions, based on&#xD;
      guidance from the Medical Research Council.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although research has demonstrated that those faced with an unfulfilled wish for children&#xD;
      (i.e., the inability to have all the children desired) can experience intense grief and worse&#xD;
      mental health for a prolonged period, at present there is limited evidence for a theory led&#xD;
      intervention that would provide support for this group and to date there is no widely used&#xD;
      evidence-based interventions for individuals facing an unfulfilled wish for children. An&#xD;
      in-depth systematic review of how people adjust to an unfulfilled wish for children informed&#xD;
      the Three Task Model (3TM). This proposes three psychological mechanisms that facilitate&#xD;
      adjustment to an unfulfilled wish for children: acceptance, meaning making and pursuit of new&#xD;
      life goals, leading to better mental-health and well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, a bilingual online self-help web app - MyJourney - was developed. The 3TM informed&#xD;
      the hypothesised mechanisms of the change targeted by the intervention. Contextual Cognitive&#xD;
      Behavioural Therapy (CCBT) was chosen as the therapeutic framework for each of the steps&#xD;
      within the intervention, focussing on a person's relationships with their thoughts, emotions&#xD;
      and behaviours. The intervention consists of 10 ordered Steps. Each Step is a structured&#xD;
      therapeutic activity designed to activate a specific technique which is linked to the&#xD;
      theorized mechanism of change. Each Step has up to three optional therapeutic resources&#xD;
      designed to encourage participants to engage with and practice the therapeutic skill they are&#xD;
      developing. Users are invited to engage with one Step per week over 10 weeks, however they&#xD;
      are able to engage at their own pace.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aim of this trial is to evaluate feasibility, defined here as determining&#xD;
      whether the intervention itself and the study procedures are appropriate for further&#xD;
      evaluation, and how users react to the intervention, which will inform the implementation of&#xD;
      a future full scale RCT to evaluate MyJourney's efficacy. Several feasibility outcomes will&#xD;
      be focussed on, including acceptability, demand, implementation, practicality, adaption, and&#xD;
      limited efficacy testing. In addition, the targeted mechanisms of change will also be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This RCT will be a two arm, parallel-group, non-blind feasibility trial with 1:1 allocation&#xD;
      to the intervention group (immediate access to MyJourney) or waitlist control group (receives&#xD;
      access to MyJourney after 10 weeks). There will be three assessment moments: one at baseline&#xD;
      (pre-exposure to intervention); 10 weeks after baseline (post exposure to intervention); and&#xD;
      6 months after baseline (intervention group only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited via appropriate websites, social media, blogs, via direct&#xD;
      contact with appropriate support groups and Prolific. A minimum of 50 participants will be&#xD;
      required, and accounting for participation and attrition rates, a minimum of 152 individuals&#xD;
      need to be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be directed to https://myjourney.pt from the trial advertisements and upon&#xD;
      clicking 'Get Started' will be informed of the trial goals, structure and participant roles.&#xD;
      Individuals who decided to take part in the trial will be provided with an information sheet&#xD;
      and they will then give their informed consent. One they have indicated their eligibility and&#xD;
      completed the baseline assessment (socio-demographic details, psychological mediators and&#xD;
      outcomes), they will be randomly assigned to the intervention group or the waitlist control&#xD;
      group. The participants assigned to the waitlist control will be informed that they are on a&#xD;
      waiting-list and that they will receive access to the MyJourney in 10 weeks. The participants&#xD;
      in the intervention group will be provided with a link to register to MyJourney.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten weeks after completion of the baseline assessment, participants in the intervention and&#xD;
      waitlist control groups will be invited to complete a follow up assessment. The ten-week&#xD;
      follow-up assessment will ask participants to report on psychological mediators and outcomes&#xD;
      and the intervention group will complete a section on acceptability of MyJourney. At the end&#xD;
      of completing this assessment, participants in the waitlist control group will be provided&#xD;
      with a debrief form and given access to MyJourney. Six months after baseline, participants in&#xD;
      the intervention group (only) will be invited to complete another follow up assessment&#xD;
      covering only psychological outcomes, at the end of which they will be provided with a&#xD;
      debrief form. Some participants will also take part in an interview as part of the study's&#xD;
      process evaluation.&#xD;
