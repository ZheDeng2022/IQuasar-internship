  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence and mortality of esophageal cancer are at the forefront in China, among which&#xD;
      the elderly patients account for a large proportion. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the&#xD;
      standard treatment for inoperable locally advanced esophageal cancer. Most elderly patients&#xD;
      with esophageal cancer cannot tolerate concurrent chemotherapy because of complications and&#xD;
      other reasons. Immunotherapy has definite efficacy and low toxicity in advanced esophageal&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma, and the results combined with radiotherapy have also been&#xD;
      preliminarily reported. Therefore, it is necessary to further explore the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of radiotherapy combined with immunotherapy in elderly patients with esophageal cancer.&#xD;
