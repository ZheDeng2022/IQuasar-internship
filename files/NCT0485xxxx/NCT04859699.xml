      The study has three aims and involves a clustered randomized controlled trial (RCT) where K-8&#xD;
      schools will be the unit of randomization. Aim 1 involves a qualitative assessment of rural&#xD;
      Latino community's social, ethical, behavioral needs and resources for students to return to&#xD;
      school and maintain onsite learning. Aim 2 includes a clustered RCT in schools. Aim 3&#xD;
      involves qualitative assessment of implementation outcomes of the testing program with school&#xD;
      stakeholders, parents, and children. Nasal swabs will be collected for the initial pilot&#xD;
      study between the months of April-June 2021, with further, separate study goals and&#xD;
      procedures occurring after the pilot study ends to align with 2021-2022 school year. After&#xD;
      the completion of the pilot study, the study protocol and tools will be optimized to be&#xD;
      implemented in the larger cluster RCT in 2021-2022 school year) that will also involve risk&#xD;
      communication comic books and videos.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Identify the rural Latino community's social, ethical, behavioral needs and resources&#xD;
      for students to return to school and maintain onsite learning using qualitative assessments&#xD;
      with school stakeholders, parents, and students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Evaluate the effectiveness of a school-based COVID-19 testing program and risk&#xD;
      communication on student attendance using a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) with&#xD;
      two intervention arms: current learning model (comparison) and risk communication. Prior to&#xD;
      launching Aim 2, a pilot study will be conducted in April - June 2021 with one school to&#xD;
      understand the implementation steps and workflow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Assess implementation outcomes of the testing program with school stakeholders,&#xD;
      parents, and children guided by the REAIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation,&#xD;
      and Maintenance) framework. Aim 3 will occur after Aim 1 and 2 were completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OVERVIEW:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study incorporates three aims that are meant to help students and school employees to&#xD;
      return to school safely by providing health education to families and school staff. The&#xD;
      research team aims to understand how to successfully implement a testing program and health&#xD;
      education in schools and learn if the testing program and health education can help improve&#xD;
      children's attendance, along with families' and school employees' physical and mental&#xD;
      well-being. Aim 1 will involve conducting qualitative assessments with school stakeholders,&#xD;
      parents and students. Aim 2 will involve a clustered randomized control trial RCT where that&#xD;
      evaluates the role of risk communication and novel coronavirus testing in children attending&#xD;
      and staff working in public schools in the region. Schools will be randomized to receive the&#xD;
      intervention (risk communication) or serve as a comparison or control group (continue the&#xD;
      current practice). To prepare for this large trial, the study will institute a pilot study&#xD;
      conducting weekly novel coronavirus surveillance testing in one school during April - June&#xD;
      2021 to understand the implementation steps and the workflow of working with schools. The&#xD;
      larger RCT trial will be implemented in 15-20 K-8 schools in Fall 2021 - Spring 2022 school&#xD;
      year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the pilot study, one school will be recruited into the study starting in late April 2021&#xD;
      for an initial period of at least 2 months. Student participants will be recruited through&#xD;
      the school and once enrolled, contacted once per week by SMS text message and/or email with a&#xD;
      reminder to collect a swab and to report the presence or absence of symptoms, as well as&#xD;
      report any exposures or close contacts with someone confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2. The symptom&#xD;
      report will prompt the participant or their parent to collect a nasal swab and return the kit&#xD;
      to a designated drop-off location within a specific time frame, or to have the self-collected&#xD;
      swab kit picked up from their home and delivered to the laboratory if they are home sick.&#xD;
      Parents who choose to have their child swabbed by trained research staff at school will&#xD;
      receive a notification once their child has been swabbed, with the information they will need&#xD;
      to access their child's test results in the online portal. If participants report symptoms&#xD;
      during the weekly check-in, this information will be collected in a brief questionnaire to&#xD;
      record those symptoms. Participants between 13 and 15 years of age may collect their own swab&#xD;
      with supervision from an adult. For participants 7-13 years old, a parent or legal guardian&#xD;
      will assist in completion of the questionnaire, nasal swab collection and drop-off.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will additionally receive risk mitigation communications as part of this&#xD;
      intervention. This involves books and videos, (comic books for children) that are provided to&#xD;
      educate enrolled parents and their children about COVID-19 and health and safety measures&#xD;
      that can help reduce transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION: Students and staff members at participating schools in an agricultural&#xD;
      region of Washington state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY TIME PERIOD: A pilot study will be conducted between April-June 2021, with the larger&#xD;
      study continuing in August 2021-June 2022. Aim 3 will occur after June 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSES: The primary analysis will be based on the average number of onsite&#xD;
      learning hours per week over the study period for each student. The data will be analyzed&#xD;
      using a linear mixed effects model with district and randomization arm as fixed effects, and&#xD;
      school and classroom within school as random effects. Analyses will test for any difference&#xD;
      between the randomization arms using Î± = 0.05 and report the comparisons between arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OUTCOMES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome for children will be absenteeism (hours per week missing onsite&#xD;
      learning).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome will be assessed in parent dyads. Parents will share their child's&#xD;
      physical activity and emotional regulation; and will be assessed for perceived stress,&#xD;
      COVID-related stress, and depressive symptomatology for parents. The secondary outcome will&#xD;
      also be assessed among teachers for perceived stress, COVID-19 related stress and depressive&#xD;
      symptomatology.&#xD;
