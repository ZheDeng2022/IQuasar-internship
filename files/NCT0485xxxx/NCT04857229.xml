  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical device trial to assess the accuracy of margin assessment for a confocal&#xD;
      scanning device (Histolog Scanner) at assessing the margins of breast tissue following wide&#xD;
      local excision surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently a 15-20% of breast cancer patients have cancer cells seen at the edge of the tissue&#xD;
      removed following. These patient will need to undergo a second operation to ensure all the&#xD;
      cancer cells are removed, which has psychological, cosmetic and cost implications. Several&#xD;
      technologies have been designed to allow the edges of tissue to be tested during surgery,&#xD;
      with the most accurate being those that involve assessing the tissue edge at a cellular&#xD;
      level. However, these techniques are time consuming which makes their use in routine work&#xD;
      impractical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Histolog system uses pinhole (confocal) microscopy to capture cellular level images of&#xD;
      the edge of tissue intra-operatively. The first generation of the device has been shown to be&#xD;
      accurate for assessing breast tissue biopsies and skin cancer. The second generation of the&#xD;
      device has an 8cm plate for scanning tissue and is CE marked for the assessment of tissue&#xD;
      margins. This project is to show that the device is accurate for the assessment of margins,&#xD;
      with further assessment in relation to the time for images to be captured and ease of&#xD;
      interpretation to assess overall feasibility. The study would recruit at a single high volume&#xD;
      breast cancer centre. The study will recruit patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer who&#xD;
      are due to undergo breast conservation surgery (lumpectomy) with inclusion criteria of female&#xD;
      patients over the age of 18 who are able to give informed consent. The study would involve&#xD;
      the edges of removed tissue being imaged following surgery. These images would be reported by&#xD;
      a consultant histopathologist and compared to the routine gold standard histology. There is&#xD;
      no change to patient care and the device will not be used to change the surgery performed.&#xD;
      There are no questionnaires or additional demands placed on the participants.&#xD;
