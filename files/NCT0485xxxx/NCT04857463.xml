  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Past studies have pointed out that adequate intake of calories and protein in the elderly can&#xD;
      deferred sarcopenia and debilitating conditions. Therefore, this study intends to use oral&#xD;
      nutrition as a way of nutritional supplements, without affecting the subjects' normal meal&#xD;
      intake, and supplements with snacks It is expected that there will be benefits in protein and&#xD;
      muscle synthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the palatability of oral nutritional products will affect the effectiveness of&#xD;
      nutritional supplements. Therefore, this test provides nutrients that are easy for the&#xD;
      subjects to ingest with a variety of flavors, in order to achieve the test calories and&#xD;
      protein needs.&#xD;

      In this study, subjects were randomly assigned. Through a multi-center research method, a&#xD;
      total of 100 eligible subjects were recruited, and their consent was obtained and a subject&#xD;
      consent form was signed. The subjects were divided into two groups according to the way of&#xD;
      nutritional intervention, including nutritional education (NE) and nutritional supplement&#xD;
      drink (NSD), with 50 people in each group. The NE group is given regular nutrition education&#xD;
      by qualified clinical nutritionists to ensure the effectiveness of nutrition education. In&#xD;
      the NSD group, in addition to nutrition and health education, daily oral supplements (Meiji&#xD;
      Mei Balance, Meiji Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) are provided daily, and snacks are supplemented&#xD;
      between lunch and dinner and before bedtime, 2 per day. bottle. The two groups were divided&#xD;
      into groups by lottery, and the intervention period was 12 weeks. During the intervention&#xD;
      period, blood will be drawn at the beginning, 6th, and 12th week of the case, and blood&#xD;
      pressure, body position, body composition and muscle strength will be measured, and dietary&#xD;
      intake will be assessed. At the same time, a quality of life survey will also be conducted.&#xD;
      survey, QoL survey.&#xD;
