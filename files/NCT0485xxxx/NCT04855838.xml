      The purpose of this research project is to investigate the incidence of impaired swallowing&#xD;
      (dysphagia) after anterior cervical spine surgery (ACSS) and to study the long-term effect of&#xD;
      dysphagia on nutritional status 12 ± 3 months later. Furthermore, to investigate the effect&#xD;
      of a new rehabilitation method for dysphagia among individuals with swallowing dysfunction&#xD;
      after ACSS.&#xD;

      Study design: This study contains of two parts. The first part of this study is a prospective&#xD;
      observational cohort study with consecutive observations on the characterization of incidence&#xD;
      of and factors related to dysphagia after ACSS (within 14 days of surgery and 2-3 weeks&#xD;
      later), and investigation the long-term effect of dysphagia on nutritional status 12 ± 3&#xD;
      months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part of this study is a prospective randomized open-label trial with blinded&#xD;
      evaluators (PROBE-design) that compare conventional care to neuromuscular training in the&#xD;
      treatment of dysphagia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and procedure: Part 1: All patients enrolled at the University Hospital of Umeå who&#xD;
      have undergone ACSS between C2 and Th1 level due to trauma are eligible participants in the&#xD;
      first part of the study (the observational cohort study). All participants will have their&#xD;
      swallowing function assessed with a flexible video endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (i.e.&#xD;
      FESS) within 14 days after surgery and have their nutritional status examined with the&#xD;
      clinical test Nutrition Risk Screening-2002 (NRS-2002) and blood sample for biomarkers of&#xD;
      malnutrition (i.e., levels of Albumin, levels of Leptin, Ghrelin and Adiponektin and also&#xD;
      metabolites as ketone bodies (3 hydoxibutyrat and acetoacetate). The swallowing assessment&#xD;
      and nutritional screening with NRS-2002 will be performed by a speech- language pathologist&#xD;
      or physician in otolaryngology. Blood sample will be collected by a nurse at the unit where&#xD;
      the participant is staying, who have extended knowledge in the procedure. If a swallowing&#xD;
      dysfunction is present the patient will be followed-up within 2-3 weeks later (i.e., 4±1-&#xD;
      week post-operation) to assess the spontaneous recovery. During the period from the first&#xD;
      assessment to the follow-up all patients will be given conventional care (e.g., postural&#xD;
      adjustments, swallowing maneuvers, modified consistency of solid and/or liquid food). If the&#xD;
      patient has a remaining swallowing dysfunction at the reassessment 4±1-week post-operation&#xD;
      the patient will be asked to participate in part 2 of the study (the interventional study).&#xD;
      All patients participating in part 1, will have another examination of nutritional status at&#xD;
      12 ± 3 months after ACSS. In order to study the long-term effect of dysphagia on nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Participants with presenting swallowing dysfunction at the reassessment 4±1 week&#xD;
      post- operation will after given their oral or written consent be randomly assigned to 8&#xD;
      weeks of either conventional care (control group) or oral neuromuscular training with an oral&#xD;
      device (intervention group). Randomization will be performed web-based using the program&#xD;
      MINIM with minimization/ stratification for aspiration (yes/no) on FEES leading to an equal&#xD;
      balance of prognostic important variable at baseline. In each group, swallowing function,&#xD;
      swallowing-related quality of life measured by the Swallowing Quality of life Questionnaire&#xD;
      (SWAL-QOL) and an examination of nutritional status with the clinical screening NRS-2002 and&#xD;
      blood samples will be assessed at baseline (i.e. 4±1 week post-surgery assessment), eight&#xD;
      weeks after baseline (end-of treatment), and 12 ± 3 months post-treatment. A swallowing&#xD;
      assessment will also be performed four weeks into the treatment period. If oral neuromuscular&#xD;
      training with an oral device is found to be effective in the intervention group, it will be&#xD;
      also offered to the control group after the study is finished. All assessments will be&#xD;
      carried out at the University Hospital of Umeå. All the assessments of the participants'&#xD;
      swallowing function will be recorded, and the evaluators will be blinded to treatment at the&#xD;
      assessment of the FEES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data will be obtained from the participants' journal part 1 and 2 regarding sex,&#xD;
      age, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), presence of a tracheostomy and if presence what&#xD;
      type of tube used, length of intubation, presence of pneumonia, length stay at the hospital&#xD;
      or ICU, medical diagnoses, the severity of the spinal cord injury according to the American&#xD;
      Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale, level of spinal cord injury and whether&#xD;
      left or right approach was used during the ACSS will be recorded. Prior to the first&#xD;
      assessment of the participant's swallowing function, written or oral (if tetraplegia) consent&#xD;
      will be collected from each patient.&#xD;
