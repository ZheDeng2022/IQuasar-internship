  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the usefulness of a wearable robotic&#xD;
      exoskeleton device (Ekso-GT), to improve learning and memory, and gait therapy in persons&#xD;
      with walking disability due to Multiple Sclerosis. The study will evaluate the mobility,&#xD;
      learning and memory, and walking abilities of individuals with multiple sclerosis who went&#xD;
      through the traditional as compared to others who used the robotic exoskeleton as part of&#xD;
      their therapy.&#xD;

    <description>The distance walked (meters) in 6 minutes is measured. This is following the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) procedure to measure walking endurance. The 6MWT is is a valid and reliable test of endurance walking performance in persons with MS.&#xD;
Participants are instructed to walk as fast and as far as possible for 6 minutes within a single corridor and performing 180Â° turns.</description>

    <description>Processing speed and cognition outcomes, including: The Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) represents the primary CPS outcome in the current proposal. This test involves the conversion of a set of simple geometric designs into an oral response. It has been demonstrated to be sensitive to the presence of brain damage in numerous studies. The SDMT requires the examinee to substitute a number for a randomized presentation of a geometric figure. The appropriate number is shown in a key containing the Arabic numbers 1 through 9, each paired with a different geometric figure. The total number of correct responses in 90 seconds is the primary outcome of the SDMT.</description>

    <description>Participants will undergo neuroimaging scans of the brain to acquire structural imaging of the brain using Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
The MRI instrument that will be used is an FDA-approved Siemens Skyra 3T clinical imager housed in the Rocco Ortenzio Neuroimaging Center at Kessler Foundation.</description>
