    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial evaluates the highest safe dose, side effects, and possible benefits of&#xD;
      tegavivint in treating patients with solid tumors that has come back (recurrent) or does not&#xD;
      respond to treatment (refractory). Tegavivint interferes with the binding of beta-catenin to&#xD;
      TBL1, which may help stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the signals passed from one&#xD;
      molecule to another inside a cell that tell a cell to grow.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      tegavivint administered as an IV infusion over 4 hours, once weekly for 3 weeks, followed by&#xD;
      a 1 week rest, in a 28-day cycle to pediatric patients with recurrent/refractory solid&#xD;
      tumors, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma and desmoid tumors. (Phase 1 Dose Escalation) II. To&#xD;
      preliminarily define antitumor activity of tegavivint in pediatric patients with recurrent or&#xD;
      refractory Ewing sarcoma, liver tumors (hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC] and hepatoblastoma),&#xD;
      osteosarcoma, Wilms tumor, desmoid tumors, and tumors with Wnt pathway aberrations. (Phase 2)&#xD;
      III. To define and describe the toxicities of tegavivint administered on this schedule.&#xD;
      (Phase I) IV. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of tegavivint in pediatric patients with&#xD;
      recurrent or refractory cancer. (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of tegavivint for pediatric patients with&#xD;
      recurrent/refractory solid tumors, including lymphoma and desmoid tumors within the confines&#xD;
      of a Phase 1 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To test whether baseline activity of the WNT/beta catenin pathway correlates with clinical&#xD;
      response using archived tumor tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize pharmacodynamic changes in tumor tissue to examine target engagement by&#xD;
      tegavivint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive tegavivint intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 28 days for up to 26 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up every 3 months for 12&#xD;
      months, every 6 months for 24 months, and then annually for 60 months.&#xD;

    <description>Tegavivint will be administered IV over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle. Administer D5W flush after completion of each tegavivint infusion. A cycle of therapy is considered to be 28 days. A cycle may be repeated for a total of 26 cycles, up to a total duration of therapy of approximately 24 months. Drug doses should be adjusted based on the weight (height and BSA will also be captured) measured within 7 days prior to the beginning of each cycle. The starting dose will be 5 mg/kg with dose levels for subsequent cohorts increasing to 6.5 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg if excessive toxicity does not occur. If the MTD has been exceeded at the first dose level, then the subsequent cohort of patients will be treated at a dose of 4 mg/kg.</description>
