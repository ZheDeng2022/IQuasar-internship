  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial of an advance&#xD;
      care planning (ACP) educator-led intervention among hospitalized patients aged 65 and over,&#xD;
      or any patient with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and their proxy&#xD;
      decision-makers in the ward and ICU settings of two major hospitals: Boston Medical Center&#xD;
      and North Shore University Hospital in New York. Patient outcomes will be abstracted from&#xD;
      electronic health records with Natural Language Processing. The effectiveness of the&#xD;
      intervention will be evaluated by comparing the following outcomes among 9,000 hospitalized&#xD;
      patients (Aim 1): ACP documentation; preferences for resuscitation; palliative care consults;&#xD;
      and, hospice use. The investigators will characterize caregiver-centered outcomes of patients&#xD;
      with ADRD, including (Aim 2): (1) knowledge, (2) confidence in future care, (3) communication&#xD;
      satisfaction, and (4) decisional certainty in 600 caregivers of patients with ADRD admitted&#xD;
      to the hospital. COVID-19 poses a unique dilemma for older Americans and patients with ADRD&#xD;
      and their caregivers, who must balance their desire to live against the risk of a lonely and&#xD;
      potentially traumatic hospital death. Video decision support is a practical, evidence-based,&#xD;
      and innovative approach to assist patients facing such choices. If proven effective, this&#xD;
      innovative care model can be immediately deployed across the country to improve the quality&#xD;
      of care for millions of Americans.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of patients aged 65 or over, and patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Related&#xD;
      Dementias (ADRD), have never communicated their preferences to clinicians or completed&#xD;
      advance care planning (ACP) documents. Palliative care has the potential to improve ADRD&#xD;
      care, improve patient-clinician communication and patient-centered outcomes, while decreasing&#xD;
      unwanted burdensome treatments and improving care at the end of life. The novel Coronavirus&#xD;
      Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has acutely escalated the importance of integrating ACP and&#xD;
      palliative care services into medical care. The default response to critical illness for&#xD;
      patients with ADRD (and all others) is intubation, mechanical ventilation, and aggressive&#xD;
      care despite having no change in mortality outcome. ADRD patients and their caregivers may&#xD;
      prefer to avoid these interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these gaps, the investigators have developed a COVID-19 ACP Educator-led,&#xD;
      video-assisted palliative care intervention to improve patient-clinician communication,&#xD;
      increase ACP documentation, and lead to more patient-centered care at the end of life. The&#xD;
      investigators will identify all hospitalized patients aged 65 and older, and any patient with&#xD;
      ADRD, and then an ACP Educator will proactively proceed with primary palliative care services&#xD;
      of ACP, leveraging certified video decision aids developed by the research team. This will be&#xD;
      considered the standard of care for all patients meeting eligibility criteria. The ACP&#xD;
      Educator to be tested in this proposal represents a new role and proactive function for the&#xD;
      palliative care team. The ACP Educator will work with older patients or patients with ADRD&#xD;
      and proxy decision-makers to learn about and document patients' wishes.&#xD;
