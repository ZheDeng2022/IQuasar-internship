  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm infants are at risk for feeding problems which can persist through early childhood.&#xD;
      These feeding problems may include oral motor, sensory, digestive, nutritional, respiratory,&#xD;
      and/or behavioral components. In North Carolina's early intervention program, speech&#xD;
      pathologists or occupational therapists are responsible for completing feeding evaluations,&#xD;
      and may not know when to refer infants out to medical specialists to address these other&#xD;
      domains. This study will test a decision support tool in hypothetical feeding evaluation&#xD;
      scenarios. The hypothetical scenarios will consist of real feeding videos of preterm infants&#xD;
      who recently participated in a multidisciplinary feeding evaluation. Parent-reported outcomes&#xD;
      of the infant's real evaluation will be compared to those of the speech pathologists and&#xD;
      occupational therapists in our study who do, and do not, use the decision support tool. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that therapists with the tool will make recommendations that are&#xD;
      closer to those of the multidisciplinary team, and that they will find the tool useful and&#xD;
      easy to use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to recruitment limitations with families, the study was adapted in October, 2021 prior to&#xD;
      enrollment of subjects to use case studies, rather than infant videos, as the hypothetical&#xD;
      situation from which to test the tool. Therapists will then answer clinical questions without&#xD;
      using the tool when viewing the first case study, and will use the tool to answer questions&#xD;
      when viewing the second case study. Order of case study presentation will be randomized among&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

    <measure>Decision Support Tool Acceptability Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after using tool</time_frame>
    <description>The Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM) will be used to measure acceptability of the decision support tool. This tool includes four items, rated on a five-point Likert scale from completely disagree to completely agree, and will be quantified with a score of 0 for completely disagree, 1 for disagree, 2 for neither agree nor disagree, 3 for agree, and 4 for completely agree. The average score across the four items will be calculated, with higher scores indicating higher acceptability of the decision making tool. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 20. Items on this measure include: (Intervention) meets my approval; (Intervention) is appealing to me; I like (Intervention) and I welcome (Intervention).</description>
