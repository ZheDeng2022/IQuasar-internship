      The investigators propose to test the hypothesis, that is, the effectiveness of the ivAED to&#xD;
      eliminate air-in-line, comparing two commercially available, standard IV infusion pumps: the&#xD;
      Braun Infusomat® Space P and the Becton-Dickenson Alaris™ model 8100 pump (the latter is&#xD;
      currently in use as the standard IV infusion pump at Keck Hospital of USC). Testing of an IV&#xD;
      infusion pump other the Keck Hospital of USC standard is indicated, as the independent&#xD;
      laboratory testing of the Alaris™ 8100 pump found that this model pump is prone to developing&#xD;
      air bubbles as the infusion passes through the pump mechanism. These air bubbles can be&#xD;
      sufficient to trigger the air-in-line alarm. The Braun Infusomat® Space P IV infusion pump is&#xD;
      a market leader like the Alaris™ 8100 pump, was evaluated in independent testing with and&#xD;
      without the ivAED™ device, and was NOT found to create bubbles.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are very few controlled human studies in the literature that assess various existing&#xD;
      preventative measures for air embolism. After extensive, independent pre-clinical laboratory&#xD;
      testing of the ivAED™ device demonstrating efficacy in removing air-in-line from IV infusions&#xD;
      (see Appendix 1), this is the first-in-humans, clinical application of the ivAED™ device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing of the ivAED™ device in patients is justified as that is the only means to determine&#xD;
      the impact of the device on clinical IV infusion and nursing workflow disruptions (the&#xD;
      primary outcomes of the study). Testing of the device in animals, or in healthy volunteers,&#xD;
      or in computer simulations cannot provide this real-world information. In addition, the FDA&#xD;
      typically requires that laboratory pre-clinical testing be coupled with clinical testing when&#xD;
      applying for approval of new, investigational devices.&#xD;
