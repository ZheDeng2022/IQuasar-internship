    <textblock>
      The effectiveness study for Culturally Adapted Cognitive Behavioral Intervention will be&#xD;
      conducted with university students to measure if this intervention if effective for&#xD;
      decreasing the university students' psychological distress and increase their well-being&#xD;
      during the COVID-19 pandemic. Potential participants will be given an informed consent and&#xD;
      included in a screening procedure to decide their eligibility. 100 participants (50 in&#xD;
      experimental and 50 in control group-randomly assigned) who pass the screening procedure will&#xD;
      be invited to the effectiveness study. The experimental group will receive an 8-session&#xD;
      intervention while the control group will receive information about the freely available&#xD;
      psychological support options. The measurements will be conducted three times; one week&#xD;
      before, one week after and five weeks after the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rapid increase in the COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths were followed by several&#xD;
      precautions including the daily usage of masks, social distancing, temporary closure of work&#xD;
      places, government departments, schools and universities. Due to these adversities and&#xD;
      necessary precautions, people experience psychological distress and symptoms of depression&#xD;
      and anxiety during the pandemic. Research shows that university students are at risk for&#xD;
      developing psychological distress and common mental health disorder symptoms, and providing&#xD;
      psychological interventions for university students may decrease the mental health problems&#xD;
      of the students. However, considering the social distancing, these interventions must be&#xD;
      delivered online. There are some studies indicate that online interventions may be effective&#xD;
      as face-to-face interventions. Considering the mental health support need that the university&#xD;
      students have during COVID-19, addressing this need may be beneficial for the mental health&#xD;
      of university students in these uncertain times. There are various studies that showed the&#xD;
      effectiveness of various form of interventions and one of them is Culturally Adapted&#xD;
      Cognitive Behavioral (CA-CB) intervention developed by Hinton. CA-CB interventions were&#xD;
      tested with adolescents and women in Turkey and found to decrease the psychological symptoms&#xD;
      of these people. CA-CB interventions are based on the cognitive behavioral approach's&#xD;
      principles but also include emotion regulation techniques, mindfulness and stretching&#xD;
      exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial in which they aim to apply&#xD;
      a preventive culturally adapted cognitive behavioral intervention (CA-CBI) which is adapted&#xD;
      to university students and COVID-19 related stressors. After the adaptation process is&#xD;
      completed, the investigators will distribute an online survey to university students for the&#xD;
      recruitment. The university students who would like to participate in the intervention study&#xD;
      and are eligible to participate will be included. The investigators will randomly assign them&#xD;
      into two arms (control and CA-CBI) and then deliver CA-CBI in a group format to the&#xD;
      intervention arm. The investigators will examine whether the psychological distress levels&#xD;
      and common mental health problems of the students in the intervention arm is decreased&#xD;
      compared to the control arm. The investigators will examine the study outcomes of the both&#xD;
      arms at three times: Pre-assessment (1 week before the intervention), post-assessment (1 week&#xD;
      after the intervention) and follow-up assessment (1 month after the post-assessment). A&#xD;
      process evaluation according to the WHO will be completed with 5 study completers, 5&#xD;
      drop-outs and 2 facilitators to evaluate the feasibility of delivering CA-CBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the CA-CBI was delivered in Turkey to different populations before, it was not&#xD;
      tested with university students yet. In addition, there are scarce publications on the online&#xD;
      delivered group interventions and to our knowledge, there is neither such research conducted&#xD;
      during the pandemic nor research about the efficacy of online synchronous interventions in&#xD;
      Turkey. The investigators will contribute to the literature by adapting CA-CBI to the&#xD;
      university students who are affected from COVID-19. In addition, they will also add to the&#xD;
      literature on online interventions by delivering CA-CBI online in a group format.&#xD;
