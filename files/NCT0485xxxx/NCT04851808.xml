  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Respiratory Disease (CRD), particularly asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disorders (COPD) are leading causes of mortality and reduced quality of life due to its&#xD;
      wide-reported association with other multi-morbidities.There is limited knowledge on the&#xD;
      burden of CRD in the rural communities in Bangladesh due to poor awareness on the impact of&#xD;
      CRD on quality of life and unavailability of diagnostic facilities due to weaker primary&#xD;
      healthcare settings. The study aims to estimate the CRD burden in Bangladesh in a large&#xD;
      representative population to draw the attention of policy makers to the creation of social&#xD;
      awareness and improvement of primary healthcare infrastructure for respiratory disease in&#xD;
      Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective observational one in nature. The study will be implemented in&#xD;
      Mirzapur, a rural sub-district of Tangail district in Bangladesh within the period of&#xD;
      February to May 2021. A total of 981 participants will be enrolled from the study. Verbal&#xD;
      consent will be taken initially. Participants who are assessed to be COVID-19 negative will&#xD;
      be invited for a visit to the mobile clinic following national health guidelines to perform&#xD;
      the spirometry. The study team will provide an information sheet (written in local language)&#xD;
      that describes the study aim and objectives with potential risk benefits to the participants.&#xD;
      All participants will be enrolled through written consent and satisfactory response to the&#xD;
      patient information sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Research Assistant (RA) will collect the relevant metadata such as demographics,&#xD;
      information on risk factors, screening questionnaires relevant to asthma and COPD, reported&#xD;
      health status and symptoms related to CRD etc. from the participant after obtaining the&#xD;
      written consent. Data quality will be ensured by the Field Research Supervisor through&#xD;
      checking all the collected information. The enrolled participants will undergo spirometry for&#xD;
      the evaluation of their lung function. Spirometry will be collected by trained personnel and&#xD;
      will be quality checked by an expert panel at CHRF. Repeated collection will take place in&#xD;
      the event if the test results do not pass quality checking. Participant will also be invited&#xD;
      to the study clinic within the next 10 days after assessment for any further clinical&#xD;
      assessment that is deemed necessary by the study physician. The collected data and spirometry&#xD;
      reports will be reviewed to evaluate the CRD patient in terms of their disease. The study&#xD;
      will analyse the rate of CRD burden stratified by age, sex, and income group. The&#xD;
      productivity loss will be measured in terms of work hours lost due to CRDs.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Chronic respiratory diseases (CRD), particularly asthma and chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease (COPD) are leading causes of mortality and associated with multi-morbidity,&#xD;
      leading to reduced productivity worldwide[1, 2]. We have limited data on the prevalence of&#xD;
      CRD in Bangladesh, especially from the rural communities, where poor awareness and&#xD;
      care-seeking behaviour, is compounded by the unavailability of diagnostic facilities and&#xD;
      presence of weak primary health infrastructures. Determining the burden of CRD in these&#xD;
      settings is thus challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RESPIRE 4-Country Chronic Respiratory Disease (4CCORD) pilot study, revealed a high&#xD;
      prevalence of asthma (7%) and COPD (8%) in Bangladesh including many who were unaware of&#xD;
      having mild airway obstruction and thus susceptible to CRD in future (unpublished data).&#xD;
      Early diagnosis of these diseases could facilitate better primary prevention (abstaining from&#xD;
      the exposure to harmful risk factors) and management to prevent deterioration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 4CCORD study aimed to validate the research tools and methodologies to detect the CRD&#xD;
      cases at the community level. This study collected information from only 100 participants,&#xD;
      thus lacked power drawing inference on the burden of CRD in the Bangladeshi population. With&#xD;
      the support of RESPIRE and utilising the Child Health Research Foundation (CHRF) existing&#xD;
      infrastructure, we want to survey an adequate sample to estimate the CRD burden in Bangladesh&#xD;
      confidently. These data will help to draw the attention of the policymakers to these&#xD;
      important diseases and create social awareness of CRD in Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY AIM and OBJECTIVES To reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with CRD in&#xD;
      Bangladesh by providing data on the health and economic burden of these diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES PRIMARY OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To estimate the prevalence of CRD at the community level in Bangladesh using the&#xD;
           screening questionnaire and objective measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the risk factors for CRD in the community settings in Bangladesh SECONDARY&#xD;
           OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. To determine the burden of early-stage asthma and COPD in the community settings in&#xD;
      Bangladesh b. To assess the loss of productivity and impact on the quality of life due to CRD&#xD;
      in Bangladesh c. To determine the healthcare-associated costs with CRD in community settings&#xD;
      in Bangladesh&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN This is a prospective observational study. This study protocol will be&#xD;
      implemented from January 2021 to April 2021. The participants will be recruited from&#xD;
      Mirzapur, a rural Upazila (sub-district) of Tangail district in Bangladesh; located 65 km&#xD;
      north of Dhaka. A list of eligible study participants (currently residing in the study area&#xD;
      and are above 18 years of age) will be generated from the existing demographic surveillance&#xD;
      system (DSS) database. The eligible participants will be reached over telephone by a research&#xD;
      assistant to inform the study objectives and procedures. Those who provides verbal consent&#xD;
      will be asked i) whether the participants or any household member been diagnosed with&#xD;
      COVID-19/coronavirus disease in the past 14 days, ii) currently any of the household member&#xD;
      have COVID-19 sign/symptoms (dry cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fever or&#xD;
      chills, sore throat, loss of taste or smell, vomiting or diarrhoea), and iii) Whether any&#xD;
      household member currently under quarantine or in self-isolation due to contact with a case&#xD;
      of COVID-19/coronavirus disease or because of an order by a physician or public health&#xD;
      authority?. Participants who provide negative answer of all three questions mentioned above&#xD;
      will be asked to attend a mobile clinic to perform the spirometry. Only three participants&#xD;
      will be asked to attend a session to minimise the risk of COVID-19 infection. The&#xD;
      participants will be seated in a waiting room maintaining social distance and askinvited for&#xD;
      the interview in an isolatedprivate room one by one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mobile team, consist a research assistant, a field supervisor and a medical&#xD;
      technologist/nurses will perform the spirometry at an open place following the national&#xD;
      health guidelines. Research assistants (RA) will provide the patient information sheet of the&#xD;
      study to the participants and will give satisfactorily answers to the questions raised by the&#xD;
      participants. Only participants who provide written consent for their participation in the&#xD;
      study will be enrolled in the study. Once the participants provide the consent, RA will&#xD;
      collect all the metadata such as demographics, risk factor information, reported heath status&#xD;
      etc. from the study participant. A Field Research Supervisor (FRS) will check all information&#xD;
      collected by the RA to ensure the data quality..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study participant will undergo spirometry to check their lung functions. A nurse/medical&#xD;
      technologist will conduct the spirometry tests after receiving appropriate training. All&#xD;
      spirometry data will be reviewed by an expert panel at CHRF to ensure the quality of the&#xD;
      spirometry. All spirometry data which do not pass the quality will be repeated. Collected&#xD;
      data and spirometry reports will be reviewed by a respiratory physician to level the CRD&#xD;
      patients and their type of illness. The enrolled participants may be invited to Mirzapur&#xD;
      hospital for further clinical examination within the next 10 days of the assessment based on&#xD;
      the physician's review and the collected information. The spirometry may be repeated and any&#xD;
      other test to be suggested by the physician if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION A total number of 981 participants aged more than 18 years will be enrolled&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES: ASSESSMENTS Screening data collection: After obtaining informed consent&#xD;
      from the eligible participants for enrolment, RA will collect the metadata using screening&#xD;
      questionnaires (described below) including demographics, risk factors, reported health status&#xD;
      from the study participants. Disease burden assessment shall be conducted using COPD&#xD;
      Assessment Tool (CAT), GINA Ashtma Control test etc. This will be followed by conducting&#xD;
      spirometry using NDD Easyone Air spirometer by trained technologist. The primary spirometry&#xD;
      indices will be FEV1, FVC and FEV1/FVC. Spirometry will be performed before and after&#xD;
      bronchodilation via two puffs of salbutamol via MDI+spacer. Quality check of the spirometry&#xD;
      data generated will be reviewed by the experts on a regular basis and any failure of meeting&#xD;
      the quality standards will render repeated collection. Each participant's data will be&#xD;
      reviewed by the physicians on a regular basis for assessing CRD based on screening&#xD;
      questionnaire and spirometry data. All study team members will be tested periodically (in&#xD;
      every 14 days) to ensure that they do not have COVID-19. During the clinical session, they&#xD;
      will year protective equipment such as mask, gloves and gown to reduce the exposure risk. All&#xD;
      participants will ask to wear mask while not perform the spirometry test. All participants&#xD;
      will be ask to seat maintaining social distance. We will provide each participant a sterile&#xD;
      flow tube while performing the spirometry. The outside of the spirometer will be cleaned&#xD;
      after each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires: The questionnaires will be comprised of the following section as anticipated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic meta-data (age, gender, marital status, occupation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronic respiratory symptoms (wheeze, cough, chest tightness, shortness of breath)&#xD;
           identification, existing respiratory diagnosis, co-morbidities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific screening questionnaire relevant to asthma and/or COPD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Information on risk factors (smoking habits, fuels used for cooking, types of mosquito&#xD;
           repellent used etc)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individual burden of disease (e.g. Asthma Control Questionanire, COPD Questionnaire)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Societal impact (e.g. lost productivity, under-performance)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Usage of healthcare resources (primary care, secondary care, medication history) A&#xD;
           pragmatic balance will be drawn between collecting sufficient detail for as accurate&#xD;
           costing as possible while minimising participant burden. The study questionnaires which&#xD;
           already used in the 4ccord study will be available both in English and translated into&#xD;
           Bengali (local language).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physician clinical assessment of a random sample: Subsequent clinical examination (see&#xD;
      details below) of people diagnosed with CRD and a random sample of screened participants as&#xD;
      'normal' will further confirm the diagnosis achieved by screening. These participants shall&#xD;
      be invited to the study clinic/ hospital for further clinical examination within the next 10&#xD;
      days. During the visit, the physician will check the clinical history and perform clinical&#xD;
      assessment as necessary. Repeated spirometry and other tests (e.g. Chest X-ray) may be&#xD;
      performed at the discretion of the study physician. The physician will confirm participants&#xD;
      as asthma and/or COPD and (where possible) the nature of other CRD based on their clinical&#xD;
      judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants identified with asthma, COPD or other 'CRD' will be advised to seek further&#xD;
      advice from their usual clinical services where further investigation can be arranged as per&#xD;
      clinical needs. We will request permission to contact their usual clinical advisor for the&#xD;
      outcome of any additional test and final conclusion about the diagnosis.&#xD;
