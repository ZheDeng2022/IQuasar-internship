  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly patients are often considered as a high-risk population for major abdominal surgery&#xD;
      due to reduced functional reserve and increased comorbidities. Previous study reported that&#xD;
      about 40 and 10% of elderly (60 yr and older) patients suffered from postoperative cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction (POCD) 7 days and 3 months, respectively, after noncardiac surgery. POCD is a&#xD;
      central nervous system complication after anesthesia and an operation, whose risk factors&#xD;
      include age, education level, the operation (time, type, and mode), anesthesia (methods,&#xD;
      drugs, and time) and postoperative analgesia. In the study of Su X et al, elderly patients&#xD;
      are also more prone to develop postoperative sleep disturbances after surgery with prolonged&#xD;
      sleep latencies, fragmented sleep, decreased sleep efficiency and abnormally sleep stages.&#xD;
      Increasing evidence showed that sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances after surgery could&#xD;
      promote β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) accumulation by simultaneously upregulating Aβ synthesis and&#xD;
      interfering with Aβ clearance. This insoluble Aβ aggregates to form brain extracellular&#xD;
      senile plaques, which are one of the neuropathological hallmarks of numerous postoperative&#xD;
      cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease(AD), and can be measured by amyloid positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET) imaging through injecting 18F-florbetapir, a novel imaging agent&#xD;
      that binds with high affinity (Kd 3.1 nM+0.7) to β-amyloid peptide fibrils in brain amyloid&#xD;
      plaques, to the patients.Transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) is a new&#xD;
      acupuncture therapy developed by combining transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)&#xD;
      in European and American countries and traditional Chinese acupuncture. TEAS treat disease&#xD;
      through inputting a pulse current of different frequencies, intensities, and waveforms via&#xD;
      electrode paste adhering to the skin. Previous studies proved that TEAS has been successfully&#xD;
      applied in many different procedures through stimulating different acupoints such as reducing&#xD;
      postoperative pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and improving postoperative&#xD;
      sleep quality. However, whether TEAS could affect Aβ deposition by improving postoperative&#xD;
      sleep quality and thus affect the development of long-term cognitive impairment is still&#xD;
      unclear. The aim of our study is to conduct the TEAS intervention to elderly patients who&#xD;
      received laparoscopic abdominal surgery, and then to examine its effect on postoperative&#xD;
      sleep quality, postoperative cognition and complications. In this study, we utilized&#xD;
      18F-florbetapir imaging to assess the relationships between postoperative sleep disturbances&#xD;
      and POCD and brain Aβ burden through measuring by PET imaging.&#xD;
