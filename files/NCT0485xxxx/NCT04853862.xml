      Introduction: The treatment of head and neck neoplasms, as well as the evolution of the&#xD;
      disease, can affect a variety of body functions, including breathing, swallowing and speech,&#xD;
      with great potential to cause various physical, emotional, and social problems to the&#xD;
      patient, leading to considerable impairment of their quality of life. Several instruments&#xD;
      were developed to measure this variable. Such evaluation is currently considered fundamental&#xD;
      to report therapeutic results, but there is no consensus regarding the instrument to be&#xD;
      employed. The University of Washington questionnaire has been the most widely used so far.&#xD;
      EORTC (European Organization for Cancer Research and Treatment) recently published a new&#xD;
      questionnaire specifically for patients treated for head and neck cancer (EORTC QLQ-H &amp; N43),&#xD;
      already validated in Portuguese for Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The aim of this prospective and multi-institutional study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      quality of life of patients with metastatic head and neck cancer undergoing immunotherapy in&#xD;
      different regions of Brazil. Other endpoints will also be evaluated such as disease-free&#xD;
      survival and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: EORTC QLQ-30 and EORTC QLQ-H &amp; N43 questionnaires, validated in Portuguese for&#xD;
      Brazil, will be applied to all patients with metastatic head and neck neoplasms undergoing&#xD;
      immunotherapy at participating institutions. These will be evaluated before the beginning of&#xD;
      the treatment and then every 2 months, for an estimated period of 2 years or until death or&#xD;
      on demand, in case of symptomatology that justifies it.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a diagnosis of recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head&#xD;
        and neck region, whose planned treatment is immunotherapy, will be included. We will&#xD;
        consider, separately, patients that had been treated with platinum before&#xD;
        (platinum-refractory) and patients that were not submitted to this treatment (platinum&#xD;
        na√Øve).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Primary site: patients with primary pharyngeal tumors (oro or hypopharynx), oral cavity and&#xD;
        larynx will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with cognitive impairment that prevents the proper application of&#xD;
             questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Brain metastasis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Autoimmune disease&#xD;
