  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy&#xD;
      of an online expressive storytelling intervention for adolescents and young adults (AYA) with&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific Aim 1. To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a 5-week online&#xD;
           expressive storytelling intervention. We will (a) conduct a 1-group pre- and post-test&#xD;
           study with 20 AYA with cancer and (b) examine feasibility and acceptability through&#xD;
           study enrollment rates, retention rates, usability score, adherence and data collection&#xD;
           rates, satisfaction score, perceived benefits score, and intervention fidelity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           *Hypothesis 1: We will reach following feasibility and acceptability benchmarks: (a)&#xD;
           &gt;70% enrollment of eligible participants, (b) &gt;70% retention, (c) &gt;75% adherence and&#xD;
           data collection, (d) &gt;70 out of 100 usability score, (e) &gt;5 out of 7 satisfaction score,&#xD;
           (f) &gt;average 5 on the perceived benefits score, and (g) &gt;3 out of 4 fidelity score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific Aim 2. To assess preliminary efficacy of a 5-week online expressive&#xD;
           storytelling intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hypothesis 2: AYA participants will report lower psychosocial distress, higher&#xD;
                health-related quality of life, and higher well-being scores postintervention.&#xD;

      -  Rationale/Significance of Study: Cancer is one of life's most stressful and serious&#xD;
           illnesses for adolescents and young adults (AYA). In 2021, approximately 15,000 AYA ages&#xD;
           15 to 25 years are expected to be newly diagnosed with cancer in the United States.&#xD;
           Despite high survival rates exceeding 85%, the burden of cancer and its' treatment for&#xD;
           AYA is substantial and prolonged due to their unique developmental characteristics. AYA&#xD;
           with cancer often deal with the difficulties of transition from pre-cancer to treatment&#xD;
           trajectory while also transitioning from adolescence to young adulthood. While they&#xD;
           suffer from physical, emotional, psychosocial, and financial burdens as a result of&#xD;
           cancer, establishing resources for future development and well-being, such as identity&#xD;
           and goal development, education, and social relationships, often becomes secondary&#xD;
           during treatment because of concerns about survival. As a result, AYA with cancer have&#xD;
           less opportunities to be prepared for their lifelong challenges and build abilities to&#xD;
           deal with such complex suffering, which lead to maladjustment, hinder social&#xD;
           reintegration, and limit their ongoing well-being. Thus, there is a critical need to&#xD;
           deliver developmentally appropriate supportive care for AYA with cancer to reduce the&#xD;
           potential risk of negative consequences and improve capacities to thrive throughout&#xD;
           their life trajectories. The proposed study aims to test the feasibility, acceptability,&#xD;
           and preliminary efficacy of an expressive storytelling intervention for AYA with cancer,&#xD;
           helping them create and share their stories.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Theoretical Framework: The theoretical framework of our study and the intervention&#xD;
           contents are designed following the Story Theory in nursing practice and the&#xD;
           Self-transcendence Theory. Our intervention development process follows the&#xD;
           Obesity-Related Behavioral Intervention Trials (ORBIT) model to develop and evaluate&#xD;
           complex interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Design and Procedures: A single-group pre- and post-test clinical trial design will be&#xD;
           applied. A total of 20 dyads of AYA with cancer will be recruited. Each AYA will be&#xD;
           asked to think of three to five of their primary nurses as audiences of their stories&#xD;
           created during the 5-week online storytelling intervention. The AYA participant will&#xD;
           create digital stories about themselves following the guiding questions. The dyad will&#xD;
           then participate in weekly online meetings with nursing research staff, during which&#xD;
           they will introduce their stories and discuss their reflections. Participants will&#xD;
           complete pre- (T1) and post-intervention (T2) measures and share their qualitative&#xD;
           feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implications for Practice: Results will serve as the foundational knowledge to conduct a&#xD;
           large-scale, randomized clinical trial. Ultimately, this study will promote well-being&#xD;
           and improve palliative and psychosocial nursing care to individuals with serious&#xD;
           illness, including AYA with cancer.&#xD;

    <description>During the 5-week online intervention, adolescents/young adults with cancer will create their stories following the guiding questions and online meetings with nursing research staff.

This online dyadic storytelling intervention is designed to promote in-depth self-reflection and meaningful and therapeutic relationships within bedside nurses. The intervention is designed following the Story Theory and Pennebaker's Expressive Writing paradigm.</description>

The proposed research will produce data with 20 adolescent/young adult with cancer. The final data set will contain (a) demographic information, (b) feasibility and acceptability information, and (c) preliminary efficacy of the online expressive storytelling intervention on the well-being in adolescents and young adults with cancer.</ipd_description>
