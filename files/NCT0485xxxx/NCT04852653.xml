  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Routine clinical and radiological assessment of response of patients with rectum cancer to&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy does not allow accurate identification of complete pathological&#xD;
      response, and leads to frequent false positive and negative results. Molecular markers&#xD;
      reflecting the initial and post-nCRT status of the tumor would be ideal to select patients&#xD;
      eligible for organ preservation. This project will test the detection of tumor extracellular&#xD;
      vesicles (EVs) in liquid biopsy as a reliable marker for the identification of poor versus&#xD;
      good responders to nCRT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant treatment (NT) followed by total mesorectum excision (TME) constitues the gold&#xD;
      standard for locally advanced carcinoma of the low and middle rectum. When good clinical&#xD;
      response to NT is obtain, strategies with organ preservation, including close surveillance&#xD;
      without immediate surgery or transanal local excision, can spare patients with the highly&#xD;
      morbid and functional cost of TME. Current assessment of good responders relies on the&#xD;
      downstaging and/or downsizing of the tumor as evaluated by MRI imaging and clinical exam.&#xD;
      This strategy is prone to errors in more than 1/3 cases. Better assessment of tumor response&#xD;
      to NT would better select patients eligible for organ preservation strategies. This study&#xD;
      will use the detection of tumor extracellular vesicles (EVs) in liquid biopsy to identify&#xD;
      good response of rectum cancer to neoadjuvant treatment. Tumor EVs will be detected in the&#xD;
      blood of the patients at different times of their regular management (before, during and&#xD;
      after NT). Protein content or tumor DNA in EVs will be detected after tumor DNA sequencing in&#xD;
      the primary biopsies. Response will be assessed according to tumor EV presence or absence in&#xD;
      the blood. As EV quantification is possible, kinetics of their detection will help response&#xD;
      assessment and patient follow-up.&#xD;
