    <textblock>
      A new wearable patch-type device, ATP-C120 (ATsens, Seongnam, Korea) is a novel, single-lead&#xD;
      ECG monitoring device and can continuously monitor the ECG signal for upto 11 days. This&#xD;
      study is designed to experiment its diagnostic capability of new-onset atrial fibrillation in&#xD;
      high risk patients. Several studies reported that validated CHA2DS2-VASc score has high&#xD;
      performance in predicting new-onset atrial fibrillation and there are over 10 percent of&#xD;
      new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients whose calculated CHA2DS2-VASc scores are ≥ 2. Thus,&#xD;
      through this study, the investigators sought to evaluate the validation of early detection of&#xD;
      new-onset atrial fibrillation by ATP-C120.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevention of stroke associated with atrial fibrillation is a leading global health&#xD;
      concern. This devastating event is largely preventable with anticoagulant therapy. Therefore,&#xD;
      the early detection and accurate diagnosis of arrhythmia are crucial for prevention of&#xD;
      adverse outcome. However, because atrial fibrillation is often intermittent and mostly&#xD;
      asymptomatic, it is difficult to capture an excise event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring devices including multi-lead portable ECG&#xD;
      monitoring device, event-detection monitoring device, and implantable ECG monitoring device&#xD;
      are useful for early detection of atrial fibrillation, but these devices have various&#xD;
      drawbacks such as requirement of multiple out-patient visits and need of invasive&#xD;
      implantation of devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new wearable patch-type device, ATP-C120 (ATsens, Seongnam, Korea) is a novel, single-lead&#xD;
      ECG monitoring device and can continuously monitor the ECG signal for upto 11 days. It has&#xD;
      recently demonstrated its diagnostic capability and safety compared to the conventional ECG&#xD;
      monitoring systems . Yet, it has not widely used in real-world. So, this study is designed to&#xD;
      experiment its diagnostic capability of new-onset atrial fibrillation in high risk patients.&#xD;
      Several studies reported that validated CHA2DS2-VASc score has high performance in predicting&#xD;
      new-onset atrial fibrillation and there are over 10 percent of new-onset atrial fibrillation&#xD;
      in patients whose calculated CHA2DS2-VASc scores are ≥ 2. Thus, through this study, the&#xD;
      investigators sought to evaluate the validation of early detection of new-onset atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation by ATP-C120.&#xD;

    <description>ATP-C120 is a novel, single-lead ECG monitoring device which can continuously monitor the ECG signal as long as 14 days (11 days if the device is connected to the smartphone via Bluetooth) when attached to skin adjacent to the heart of patients. It weighs about 8.3 g, with a size of 84 × 39 × 8.3 mm.&#xD;
When the device is attached to the patient, several predefined methods were utilized to prevent the occurrence of noise or signal loss. First, the skin was cleansed and disinfected using a 70% ethanol solution. Skin hair was removed if needed. Then the protection film was removed from the patient-side surface of the device. The device is placed at the left 3rd intercostal space 45 degrees tilted toward the inside.</description>
