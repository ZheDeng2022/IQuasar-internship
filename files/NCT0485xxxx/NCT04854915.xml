  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to undertake a feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) to&#xD;
      investigate whether mHealth technology, allowing biometric informed feedback and coaching on&#xD;
      exercise and PA, can be incorporated into the existing Liverpool Overweight and Obesity&#xD;
      Programme (LOOP) at Alder Hey Children's Hospital. The overall objective is to have an&#xD;
      evidence-based exercise and PA intervention ready to evaluate in a future RCT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will recruit patients from the Liverpool Overweight and Obesity Programme at Alder&#xD;
      Hey Children's Hospital (LOOP@ Alder Hey). 40 participants will be recruited and randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of two groups (Control n=20, Intervention n=20). Patients in the control&#xD;
      group will continue to follow the LOOP@ Alder Hey programme but physical activity sessions&#xD;
      will be monitored during the 12-week intervention using a heart rate monitor. Importantly,&#xD;
      the heart rate monitor will not provide any feedback to the patient. The intervention group&#xD;
      will be provided with exercise counselling and to support this they will also be provide with&#xD;
      a wristwatch that can monitor everyday activity and their heart rate, a smartphone app and&#xD;
      access to a website. The intervention group will also participate in 5 consultations with an&#xD;
      exercise specialist to plan their exercise programme and be updated on their progress towards&#xD;
      physical activity targets. Weekly text message updates will also provide feedback to the&#xD;
      intervention group with participants able to respond to these updates. Before and after the&#xD;
      3-month supported interventions, volunteers will participate in testing to assess changes in&#xD;
      physical activity, blood pressure, glycaemia control, body composition and health related&#xD;
      quality of life. Interviews with participants, parents and the LOOP Clinic multidisciplinary&#xD;
      team will form the basis for a review of the pilot randomised control trial. Participants&#xD;
      will also fill out 6 validated questionnaires about motivations, the impact of their&#xD;
      condition on daily life and their typical exercise levels.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will continue to work with the LOOP MDT. However, exercise and physical activity advise will be taken over by an exercise specialist. Participants will co-develop a 3-month structured exercise and PA programme, with support from an exercise specialist. All participants will have 5 exercise consultations with their exercise specialist. The intervention will be supported by 3 mHealth elements; 1) a wrist worn fitness watch, 2) a smartphone app for patients, and 3) a coaching website for the exercise specialist. The 3 elements will be synced, allowing data to be transferred between platforms.</description>
