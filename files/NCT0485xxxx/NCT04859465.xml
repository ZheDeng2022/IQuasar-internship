      The purpose is to explore the efficacy and safety of the combination of albumin-bound&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is a relatively rare malignant tumor. In recent years, the disease&#xD;
      has been increasing gradually. As an important biological feature of soft tissue sarcoma is&#xD;
      local recurrence and distant metastasis, most patients die of distant metastasis. Despite the&#xD;
      improvement of local control rate, more than 50% of patients died of unresectable or distant&#xD;
      metastasis due to tumor progression. Doxorubicin and ifosfamide based chemotherapy is the&#xD;
      standard first-line treatment for patients with relapsed / distant metastasis / unresectable&#xD;
      advanced soft tissue sarcoma. For patients who fail or cannot tolerate first-line treatment,&#xD;
      the choice of treatment is still limited. At present, some clinical patients who failed to&#xD;
      receive standard treatment have tried to use the albumin-bound paclitaxel and liposomal&#xD;
      doxorubicin regimen, with the ORR of 33% and PFS of about 8 months. As a new combination of&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs, more targeted phase II clinical studies are needed to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of the new chemotherapy drugs in a variety of cancer species. In view of&#xD;
      the above problems, this study aims to observe and explore the efficacy and safety of the&#xD;
      combination of albumin-bound paclitaxel (keaili) and liposomal doxorubicin (duomeisu) in the&#xD;
      treatment of advanced angiogenic sarcoma patients, and to provide better treatment options&#xD;
      for patients with advanced sarcoma.&#xD;

&#xD;
        15) According to the researchers' judgment, the subjects are not suitable for entering the&#xD;
        group or other factors may lead to the termination in the middle of the course. For&#xD;
        example, other serious diseases (including mental diseases) need to be treated together,&#xD;
        there are serious laboratory abnormalities, and family or social factors, which will affect&#xD;
        the safety of the subjects, or the collection of test data and samples;&#xD;
&#xD;
