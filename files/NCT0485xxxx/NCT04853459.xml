    <textblock>
      Since the teeth loss leads to disability &amp; impairment, and teeth restoration lead to&#xD;
      improvement in the life quality throughout the oral health improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The acceptable function of a complete denture on great extent depends on impression technique&#xD;
      which includes the maximum coverage of denture supporting areas and making a combination of&#xD;
      managing movable soft tissues along with different kinds of impression materials and&#xD;
      techniques for accurate reproduction of oral foundation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Border molding considered to be as an important step in the in complete denture fabrication,&#xD;
      since the retention of complete dentures depend on several factors, as the biological,&#xD;
      physical and mechanical, these factors could be achieved by mean of an accurate border&#xD;
      molding followed by an accurate final impression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The border molding technique is the shaping of the border areas of a custom impression tray&#xD;
      by manual or functional manipulation of the tissue adjacent to the borders in order to&#xD;
      duplicate the size and contour of the vestibule resulting in maintains of the peripheral seal&#xD;
      during function. This property causes the border molding process to require twenty-four&#xD;
      insertions, namely eight in the maxilla and sixteen in the mandible causing long working time&#xD;
      and discomfort in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, the material used for this technique should provide optimum working time, have&#xD;
      adequate body, and permit the correction of border moulding by additions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However additions if made to a single step border moulded material would again introduce all&#xD;
      the disadvantages that are associated with sectional moulding Single-step border molding is&#xD;
      considerably more straightforward than sectional border molding owing to the reduced number&#xD;
      of tray insertions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This technique is usually used with elastomeric impression materials, which may not provide&#xD;
      sufficient time to mold and record the peripheral tissues of the denture bearing area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present technique uses light polymerizing tray material for molding tray borders,&#xD;
      offering extended working time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is advantageous for operators with less experience, such as dental school students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, correction of border molding is possible with the addition of new material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique uses materials that are readily available,and no special armamentarium is&#xD;
      required.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the primary impression are to record all the areas to be covered by the&#xD;
      intaglio surface of the dentures and the adjacent landmarks with an impression material which&#xD;
      is accurate and incorporates the minimum tissue dis-placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally impression using custom trays with spacers of different materials and designs, But in&#xD;
      cases of highly resorbed ridges, spacer is not used as a solid tray is easier to manage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The border molding process is carried out before final impression. The purpose of the border&#xD;
      molding in the manufacture of full dentures is to obtain peripheral seals, namely tight&#xD;
      contact between the full denture base and the mucosa around the periphery of the full denture&#xD;
      boundary to prevent the entry of air between the base and the mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The border molding material that is currently still frequently used is the green stick&#xD;
      modeling compound. This material has thermoplastic properties which have a low conductivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of border molding procedure is to get peripheral seal to achieve a retentive&#xD;
      denture. An exact border molding record is influenced by the material and technique. Green&#xD;
      stick compound is usually the material of choice now days, it has thermoplastic mechanical&#xD;
      properties that makes some problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the aim of this study is to compare between two different techniques of border molding for&#xD;
      complete denture patients. in terms of retention resulted from borders of the custom trays&#xD;
      and measuring the depth and width of the vestibular and lingual gut.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is conducting in the Department of Prosthodontics of the Dental institution&#xD;
      in Hama University The sample consisted of aged (45-75) years, the patients were involved in&#xD;
      this study that they should have these criteria: The patients should be healthy, have not&#xD;
      systemic diseases and not subject to radiotherapy or chemotherapy, the mucous membrane&#xD;
      covering the alveolar ridges should be healthy and the alveolar ridges should have no&#xD;
      undercuts. Primary impressions will be recorded by using irreversible hydrocolloid material&#xD;
      with plastic stock trays, then will poured by dental stone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Custom trays will be fabricated using Traditional self-cure acrylic. Two Custom trays will be&#xD;
      fabricated for maxillary alveolar ridges and two Custom trays for Mandibular alveolar ridges&#xD;
      This step should be completed 24 hours in advance to allow polymerization shrinkage of the&#xD;
      tray before impression making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the custom trays intraorally for proper extension. Position the first tray A in the&#xD;
      mouth and border mold with KERR IMPRESSION COMPOUND STICK GREEN The Second tray B border mold&#xD;
      with light-polymerized tray resin from Bdm swiss gmbh company.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Partially polymerize the resin border with an intraoral light-polymerizing unit and remove&#xD;
      the tray.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Make adequately extended maxillary and mandibular preliminary impressions by using stock&#xD;
           edentulous trays and irreversible hydrocolloid impression&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adjust the borders of the custom impression trays 2 mm short of limiting structures on&#xD;
           the casts, except in the posterior palatal seal and retromolar pad areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Prepare 3-mm-wide strips of shade -acrylic tray material and adapt them to the borders&#xD;
           of the maxillary custom tray. The soft and pliable nature of the material facilitates&#xD;
           adaptation and shaping on the borders of the custom tray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adapt the material to the posterior palatal seal area outlined by the anterior and posterior&#xD;
      vibrating lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Place the custom tray on the maxillary edentulous ridge and carry out the single-step&#xD;
      border molding procedure by following established clinical guide-lines Remove the tray from&#xD;
      the mouth and inspect the tray borders. Add or remove material if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Reinsert the custom tray intraorally on the denture foundation and polymerize the border&#xD;
      molding material with a visible light-polymerization unit with a fiber optic tip for 3&#xD;
      minutes .&#xD;
&#xD;
      After polymerization of the border molding material, verify the retention and adequate&#xD;
      peripheral seal in the custom tray. If required, additional material may be adapted to the&#xD;
      borders and polymerized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Repeat the procedure for the mandibular arch. After completing the border molding, relieve&#xD;
      0.5 mm from the borders of the maxillary and mandibular border molded trays by using an&#xD;
      acrylic bur in a straight handpiece. This will enable the Zinc-Oxacid paste to flow over the&#xD;
      borders and record tissue details during the final impression procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Make the maxillary and mandibular definitive impressions with the Zinc-Oxacid paste&#xD;
      material (SS White) Continuously mold the borders during the maxillary and mandibular wash&#xD;
      impression procedure until the initial polymerization of the the Zinc-Oxacid paste material.&#xD;
      resin on edentulous custom trays of the same material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique is straightforward and cost effective, can be performed with routinely&#xD;
      available equipment and materials, and is easy to master. Thoroughly polymerize the resin&#xD;
      border in a light-polymerizing chamber Thoroughly polymerize the resin border in a&#xD;
      light-polymerizing chamber when border molding is complete .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the tray for overextended areas, identified by the color of the tray acrylic&#xD;
      appearing through the washed away periphery material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In situations where overextension is present, correct the tray extension and recorder mold&#xD;
      with new light-polymerized resin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retention of upper and lower acrylic Custom trays will be evaluated using an special tensile&#xD;
      force meter.&#xD;
