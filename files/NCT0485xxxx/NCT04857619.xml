  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicountry, multicenter, retrospective, non-interventional study involving patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with HER2-positive unresectable or metastatic breast cancer mBC will be conducted&#xD;
      to understand the demographic and clinico-pathological profile of the patients, diagnostic&#xD;
      practices for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, current treatment&#xD;
      landscape and sequencing of therapies, associated burden of toxicities with all lines of&#xD;
      treatment (LOTs), and survival outcomes in the real-world setting.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will involve patients diagnosed with HER2-positive unresectable or mBC since 01&#xD;
      January 2017 and who received at least 2 LOTs. The data will be collected retrospectively&#xD;
      from the date of diagnosis of unresectable or mBC (index date) to the end of follow-up (ie,&#xD;
      until death, the last medical record entry, or date of data extraction, whichever is&#xD;
      earlier). The study will not have any study-specific patient visits or a longitudinal&#xD;
      follow-up. All available data will be extracted from patients' medical records after&#xD;
      obtaining an informed consent at one time. The informed consent may be obtained at the time&#xD;
      of patients routine clinical care visit to the oncology centre. The data on different types&#xD;
      of treatment received by the patients, socio-demographics, and clinico-pathological&#xD;
      characteristics will be extracted from patients medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be implemented at approximately 80 to 100 oncology centres spanning across 7&#xD;
      countries in the AstraZeneca (AZ) International Region (ie, non-US, non-European countries).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two cohorts are planned to account for different study timelines. Cohort 1 will include all&#xD;
      patients recruited outside China, including Australia, Brazil, Singapore, Taiwan, Korea, and&#xD;
      Hong Kong special administrative region (SAR) (approximately 780 patients), and Cohort 2 will&#xD;
      include patients from all countries including China (approximately 1280 patients).&#xD;

    <description>Assessment of treatment patterns in patients diagnosed with HER2-positive unresectable or mBC. Line of treatment (LOT) is defined as one regimen, possibly a combination of several drugs, given from either the index diagnosis or disease progression until the treatment fails to control the disease, is not tolerated by the patient, the disease relapses/progresses, or death occurs.</description>

    <description>Real-world PFS is defined as the time from date of initiation of LOT to documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. Occurrence and date of disease progression in rwPFS will be determined from documentation within the patient record, such as pathology reports, imaging report notes, and statements about disease progression in the oncologist progress notes.

    <description>Length of time from the date of diagnosis of unresectable or mBC or date of initiation of LOT to death due to any cause. If patient is not dead until the last record available or date of data extraction, then time-to-event will be calculated for that date.
