  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ketamine's efficacy as an antidepressant is now well established yet the mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying its antidepressant effect are yet to be fully described. Work in the animal&#xD;
      literature and research in humans is suggestive of specific effects on anhedonia and memory&#xD;
      reconsolidation. In this study the investigators will further explore the effects of ketamine&#xD;
      on learning and memory as well as measuring the associated changes at neural level in a&#xD;
      sample of healthy volunteers. Participants will be assigned to receive ketamine or placebo&#xD;
      and complete a set of tasks which will allow the investigators to quantify the effect of&#xD;
      ketamine on learning about reward and punishment and memory for learned reward associations&#xD;
      24 hours after ketamine infusion. This study will help the investigators to understand the&#xD;
      basis of ketamine's antidepressant effects and aid the development of new treatments for&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
