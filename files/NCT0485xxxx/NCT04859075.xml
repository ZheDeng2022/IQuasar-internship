      This Post-Market Clinical-Follow Up (PMCF) study gains data on the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      &quot;Alflorex bei Reizdarm&quot;, a probiotic based on Bifidobacterium longum 35624, in the daily use&#xD;
      by irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. The aim of this study is the observation of the&#xD;
      influence of &quot;Alflorex bei Reizdarm&quot; on typical symptoms, severity score and quality of life&#xD;
      of IBS patients in medical practice and everyday use.&#xD;

      This Post-Market Clinical-Follow Up (PMCF) study observes adult patients with irritable bowel&#xD;
      syndrome (IBS) which receive &quot;Alflorex bei Reizdarm&quot;, a probiotic based on Bifidobacterium&#xD;
      longum 35624, for 8 weeks by recommendation of their physician. IBS symptoms are recorded on&#xD;
      a weekly basis by the participants. IBS severity score, interference with general life and&#xD;
      safety parameters are also recorded. Primary objective is the assessment of the change in&#xD;
      overall IBS symptoms (sum of abdominal pain, bloating, gas, difficulty in&#xD;
      defecating/constipation and urgency/diarrhoea).&#xD;
