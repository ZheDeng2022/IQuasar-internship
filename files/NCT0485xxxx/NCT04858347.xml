  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, observational study with a planned follow-up period of 10&#xD;
      years to confirm the safety and performance of the GEMINI SL Fixed Bearing PS knee prosthesis&#xD;
      in longterm follow-up under routine conditions. Primary outcome of the study is the 10-year&#xD;
      survival rate of the GEMINI SL Fixed Bearing PS knee prosthesis with revision for any reason&#xD;
      as the endpoint.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The GEMINI SL Fixed Bearing PS knee prosthesis combines clinical proven design features with&#xD;
      state-of-the-art-technology in order to achieve a high standard clinical performance,&#xD;
      surgical efficiency and safety. Currently, no mid- and longterm clinical data are available&#xD;
      for the GEMINI SL Fixed Bearing PS knee prosthesis. Therefore, the study is designed to&#xD;
      generate clinical data of the GEMINI SL Fixed Bearing PS knee prosthesis in the 10-year&#xD;
      follow-up under routine condition.&#xD;

    <description>Primary outcome of the study is the 10-year survival rate of the Gemini SL Fixed Bearing PS knee prosthesis with revision for any reason as the endpoint. Revisions are defined as removal, exchange or adding of any implant components. The definition does not include subsequent implantations or exchange of the patella component or the polyethylene plateau. Survival rate will be calculated according to the method of Kaplan-Meier.</description>

    <description>Evaluation of the change in functional and clinical outcome from preoperative to 6 months, 1, 3, 5 and 10 years postoperative, measured by the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). The KOOS is a reliable and validated knee-specific patient-administered outcome instrument. The previous week is taken into consideration when answering the questions. Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question gets a score from 0 (best result) to 4 (worst result). The KOOS consists of 5 sub-scales: Pain, Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in sport and recreation (Sport/Rec) and Hip/Knee related Quality of life (QoL). A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale.</description>

    <description>Evaluation of the change in functional and clinical outcome from preoperative to 6 months, 1, 3, 5 and 10 years postoperative, measured by the Knee Society Score (KSS). The KSS is a frequently used, reliable and validated score in the assessment of a subject's knee pain and functional knee capacity. It comprises two arms, the functional ability and the clinical examination score, each ranging from 0 points (worst result) to 100 points (best result).</description>
