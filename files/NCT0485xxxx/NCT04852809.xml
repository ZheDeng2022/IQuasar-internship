    <textblock>
      This is a 2 part qualitative study involving a questionnaire (part 1) and focus group&#xD;
      discussions (part 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate how patients' attitudes to technology in the oncology&#xD;
      clinical trials setting since the start of the Coronavirus pandemic in 2020, and to assess&#xD;
      how their use of technology has changed during this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 of the study will be conducted via a self-report questionnaire to 100 cancer patients&#xD;
      involved in clinical trials at The Christie NHS Foundation Trust over a 2 month period.&#xD;
      Following this, three focus groups with a maximum of 8 participants in each group will take&#xD;
      place to further assess patients' experiences with technology during the pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may take part in part 1 or part 2 only, or in both.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical trial involvement is more resource-intensive than receiving standard of care&#xD;
      treatment and often results in more frequent hospital visits for patients. To reduce the risk&#xD;
      of patients to COVID-19, there has been a shift towards reducing on-site visits with&#xD;
      increased use of technology e.g. virtual visits. Patients may have also been using devices at&#xD;
      home to aid in their care, including digital devices, mobile applications, smart watches and,&#xD;
      rarely, trial-specific devices, to monitor aspects of their own health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our project will explore the impact that the coronavirus pandemic has had on clinical trial&#xD;
      patients and how they feel technology could help or create barriers in their future care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to quantify how clinical trial visits have changed and to evaluate patient's&#xD;
      attitudes to the increasing use of technology in clinical trials, we will be disseminating&#xD;
      questionnaires to 100 patients currently on clinical trials over a 2 month period. We will&#xD;
      follow these up with three virtual focus group discussions with 8 participants in each to&#xD;
      delve further into patients' experiences.&#xD;
