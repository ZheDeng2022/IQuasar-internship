  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to investigate the implementation of the Rome criteria in daily&#xD;
      primary care clinical practice and adherence of general practitioners (GPs) to recommended&#xD;
      diagnostic approaches for IBS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder. To diagnose&#xD;
      IBS, the so-called Rome Criteria combined with limited laboratory tests should be used.&#xD;
      However, within the primary care, too much unnecessary diagnostics, for example radiology and&#xD;
      endoscopy, are used. This is meaningless, stressful for the patient and they also cost a lot&#xD;
      of money.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Örebro Region there are 29 public general health centers. Approximately 300.000&#xD;
      inhabitants are listed within these health centers. Approximately 150 doctors are currently&#xD;
      working within the primary health care of Örebro Region. The software program Medrave and the&#xD;
      electronic patient register in Örebro Region allows to search for the International&#xD;
      Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) for IBS (K58.9 and K58.0) This allows&#xD;
      retrospective research regarding diagnosing IBS, the used diagnostic tools, comorbidities, as&#xD;
      well as the different treatments that were used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed with IBS will be identified by ICD-code K.58. By evaluating their patient&#xD;
      register it will be determined how the GP has made the IBS diagnosis. Patients will fall into&#xD;
      three categories: those who received a positive IBS diagnosis using the Rome criteria, those&#xD;
      who received a negative IBS diagnosis and those whose patient record is lacking sufficient&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will also include demographics, number of GP contacts and referrals to specialists,&#xD;
      diagnostic procedures, treatments, and relevant somatic, psychological and psychiatric&#xD;
      comorbidities. Data regarding substance abuse will be collected as well.&#xD;
