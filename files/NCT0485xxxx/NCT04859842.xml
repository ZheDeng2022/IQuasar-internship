  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is; to compare the effects of interferential current therapy (IF)&#xD;
      applied in addition to conventional physical therapy on pain, functional status and quality&#xD;
      of life compared to pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (PEMF) in patients with chronic low&#xD;
      back pain.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The low back is the most common region for musculoskeletal pain. Many factors play a role in&#xD;
      the etiology of low back pain. A certain etiological factor or pathophysiological mechanism&#xD;
      cannot be found in 85-90% of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 80% of those living in industrialized countries experience low back pain in&#xD;
      some part of their lives. 10% of low back pain becomes chronic. It is believed that 1% of&#xD;
      workforce losses are due to low back pain. This type of pain often occurs when the back&#xD;
      muscles, tendons and ligaments are exposed to stress or strain. Mechanical back pains are&#xD;
      chronic pain that often affects the lower part of the spine and radiates to the gluteal&#xD;
      region. Since daily activities such as leaning, turning, lifting, standing and sitting for a&#xD;
      long time increase the pain, the intensity of the pain increases during the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interferential current (IF) therapy is obtained from two medium frequency currents and is&#xD;
      applied by delivering a low frequency current (for example 20 to 100 Hz) to the tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulsed ElectroMagnetic Field (PEMF) therapy, which is among physical therapy methods, is&#xD;
      frequently used in the treatment of knee, hip and spine osteoarthritis symptoms. It is&#xD;
      thought that magnetic field therapy improves the oxygen utilization of the cells and the&#xD;
      erythrocytes release more oxygen under the influence of the magnetic field, thus having a&#xD;
      positive effect on the circulatory system&#xD;

    <measure>The Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It contains 11 digits that should be assigned according to the perceived pain intensity on a numerical scale. The participant chooses the number that best reflects his or her pain. In our study, the patients were informed that the '0' point was not pain at all, and the '10' point expressed unbearable pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is a questionnaire developed to evaluate functional disabilities in patients with low back pain. Turkish validity and reliability study was conducted in 2001 (20). In the 24-sentence questionnaire about functional impairments, patients are asked to answer each sentence as yes if it fits their situation, and no if it does not. Yes responses are calculated as &quot;1&quot; and no answers are calculated as &quot;0&quot; points. In this questionnaire with a total score between 0-24, the higher score means more disability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Euroqol Quality Of Life Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is a self-report scale developed by the EuroQoL group, the Western European quality of life research community, and evaluates five dimensions with 1 question each. These five dimensions consist of subtitles of mobility, self-care, usual daily activities, pain / discomfort and anxiety / depression. The answers given to each dimension have 3 options: no problem, some problem and major problem. As a result, 243 possible different health outcomes are defined with the scale. An index score ranging from -0.59 to 1 is calculated from the 5 dimensions of the scale. In the score function, a value of 0 indicates death, a value of 1 indicates perfect health, while negative values indicate unconsciousness, living dependent on bed, etc. show situations. Also included in the scale is a VAS (EQ-VAS) that includes answers between 0 and 100, ie &quot;0 = the worst health condition imaginable&quot; and &quot;100 = the best health condition imaginable&quot;.</description>
