  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will assess the impact of a novel breastfeeding support intervention&#xD;
      (&quot;telelactation&quot;), delivered via video calls on personal devices including mobile phones and&#xD;
      tablets. The goal of this intervention is to increase access to International Board Certified&#xD;
      Lactation Consultants to improve, and reduce disparities in, breastfeeding rates. By&#xD;
      implementing a digital randomized controlled trial that recruits participants through a&#xD;
      popular pregnancy tracker mobile phone application, this mixed methods study will recruit a&#xD;
      national sample of 2400 individuals during their third trimester of pregnancy to 1) provide&#xD;
      evidence on the effectiveness of a widely available, yet understudied, service and 2)&#xD;
      leverage technology to promote one of the most widely recommended health behaviors to improve&#xD;
      children's health and to reduce disparities in key maternal and child health outcomes.&#xD;

      This study is a pragmatic, parallel design randomized controlled trial that will generate&#xD;
      evidence on the impact of telelactation on breastfeeding duration and exclusivity and explore&#xD;
      differences in effectiveness by race/ethnicity. The study is mixed methods, and uses a&#xD;
      sequential explanatory design in which qualitative interviews are used to explain and&#xD;
      contextualize findings from the quantitative outcomes analysis. We will recruit 2400&#xD;
      primiparous, pregnant individuals age &gt; 18 who intend to breastfeed and live in states most&#xD;
      underserved by IBCLCs. Recruitment will occur via Ovia, a pregnancy tracker mobile phone&#xD;
      application (app) used by one million pregnant individuals in the U.S. annually. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomized to: 1) on-demand telelactation video calls on personal devices or 2) ebook&#xD;
      on infant care/usual care. Breastfeeding outcomes will be captured via surveys and interviews&#xD;
      and compared across racial and ethnic groups. This study will track participants for eight&#xD;
      months (including six months postpartum), generating 1) quantitative data on the impact of&#xD;
      telelactation and differences in effectiveness across racial and ethnic minority groups; and&#xD;
      2) rich qualitative data on the experiences of different subgroups of parents with the&#xD;
      intervention, including barriers to use, satisfaction, and strengths and limitations of this&#xD;
      delivery model.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Data resulting from the proposed research will be shared with external researchers who request access beginning one year after the project ends. Results will be available to other researchers, public health workers, healthcare professionals, and community leaders who are interested in exploring approaches to improving breastfeeding rates following a brief application process. Constraints imposed by human research subjects protection regulations (e.g., HIPAA Protected Health Information) and RAND's IRB will be recognized as allowed by NIH. External researchers interested in investigator data, survey instruments, and other research methodology and procedures will obtain this information through collaborative agreements (e.g., data use agreements) with the principal investigator and co-investigators, as required by NIH's data sharing policy.</ipd_description>
