      Objective: To establish whether the pilot online hypnosis design was well received by women&#xD;
      with persistent pelvic pain and worthy of a full randomised control trial To establish&#xD;
      whether hypnosis improves mental health outcomes, including anxiety, depression, life impact&#xD;
      and catastrophizing, in women with chronic pelvic pain conditions.&#xD;

      Design: Pilot Randomised Control Trial Methods: Twenty women with persistent pelvic pain&#xD;
      completed assessment questionnaires and were recruited from a variety of social media sites&#xD;
      related to persistent pelvic pain and randomly allocated to either control or hypnotic&#xD;
      intervention groups. The intervention group completed a seven week online hypnotic&#xD;
      intervention. The control group received no intervention. Both groups completed assessment&#xD;
      and concluding questionnaires related to demographic information and the outcomes of&#xD;
      interest. This included measures for anxiety, depression, pain, coping styles, pain related&#xD;
      disability, pain catastrophizing and suggestibility. The results of the intervention and&#xD;
      waitlist control groups were compared using linear mixed-effects modelling. Suggestibility&#xD;
      was screened for at baseline using the Short Suggestibility Scale, and included in a&#xD;
      secondary set of linear effects modelling.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of hypnotic intervention according to qualitative responses from women with persistent pelvic pain.</measure>
    <time_frame>7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Whether hypnosis was received well by women with persistent pelvic pain in the intervention group according to their qualitative responses during and after the study. Qualitative responses were collected in open text box format and analysed for themes using the thematic analysis software contained in the SurveyMonkey online software. There are no minimum, maximum or total scores as this was a free text response format.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impact on pain severity as indicated on a visual analogue scale (10 point).</measure>
    <time_frame>7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Whether hypnotic intervention lead to significant differences in pain severity intervention group in comparison to controls. Pain severity was measured on a 10-point visual analogue scale. In terms of scores, 0 indicated no pain and 10 indicated the most severe pain possible. Higher scores indicated more pain severity. Minimum score is 0 and maximum potential score is 10.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impact on depression scores on the Patient Health Questionnaire nine-item scale</measure>
    <time_frame>7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Whether hypnotic intervention lead to significant differences in depression scores on the Patient Health Questionnaire nine-item scale in intervention group in comparison to controls.The scale has nine questions about depression symptoms, that are each scored on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). The minimum score was 0 and the maximum score is 27, with higher scores meaning more depression symptoms present.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impact on anxiety scores on the Generalised Anxiety Disorder scale seven-item</measure>
    <time_frame>7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Whether hypnotic intervention lead to significant differences in anxiety score on the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale for the intervention group in comparison to controls. The Generalised Anxiety Disorder seven-item has seven questions about anxiety symptoms scored from 0 (not at all) to 4 (every day). The minimum score in 0 and maximum score is 28, with higher scores indicating more anxiety.</description>
