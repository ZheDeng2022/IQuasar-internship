  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to investigate the effects of stress and glucose intake at&#xD;
      the molecular level including gene expression, protein and functional analysis of immune&#xD;
      cells in real time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1- Characterizing the immune response after acute stress and glucose consumption Aim 2-&#xD;
      Temporal mapping of the modulation of immune cell function via meditation Aim 3-Influence of&#xD;
      meditative practice on lupus patients Aim 4-Influence of meditative practice on healthy&#xD;
      subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current Clinicaltrials.gov record, will be focused on Aim-3 only. Aim-3 will test whether&#xD;
      meditation alters neutrophil function and inflammation in patients with lupus. Study team&#xD;
      will investigate whether patient neutrophils have altered NET formation, phagocytosis, ROS&#xD;
      signaling and migration after ABMP. Innate immune function via analysis of monocytes by flow&#xD;
      cytometry will also be analyzed. Other immune cell responses including CD8 T cells will also&#xD;
      be investigated.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS self-report measures are intended to be completed by the respondent without help from anyone else.&#xD;
The PROMIS GH is comprised of 10 global items. Each item represents a different domain of health. Mental health and physical health summary scores are computed and standardized to the general population. Both these component scores and individual global items can be used to assess patients' perceptions of their health.&#xD;
PROMIS global health can be converted to raw scores between 4-20 that can be converted to a t-score of 16.2-67.7. A higher score reflects better functioning.</description>
