  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective: This research was conducted as a randomized controlled, double-blind experimental&#xD;
      study to determine the effect of topical lidocaine and benzocaine on patient's pain and&#xD;
      injection satisfaction before peripheral intravenous catheter application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: The study was completed with 120 individuals who were treated in the green area&#xD;
      of a University Hospital Emergency Service and met the inclusion criteria of the study. In&#xD;
      collecting research data; Case Report Form (ORF), Baseline Algometer (66 Lb / 30 Kg) and&#xD;
      Informed Consent Form were used. Lidocaine Spray, Benzocaine Spray and Alcohol were used in&#xD;
      research groups.&#xD;

      Study Design: The study was completed with 120 individuals who were treated in the green area&#xD;
      of a University Hospital Emergency Service and met the inclusion criteria of the study.&#xD;
      Ethics committee approval, Turkey Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency clinical&#xD;
      research permission, institutional permission and written informed consent from individuals&#xD;
      were obtained in the study. In collecting research data; Case Report Form (ORF), Baseline&#xD;
      Algometer (66 Lb / 30 Kg) and Informed Consent Form were used. Lidocaine Spray, Benzocaine&#xD;
      Spray and Alcohol were used in research groups. Private health insurance was provided for all&#xD;
      patients included in the study for complications arising from the procedure. The data&#xD;
      obtained from the research were evaluated in computer environment using IBM SPSS Statistics&#xD;
      23.0 statistics package program.&#xD;

    <description>Visual Analog Scale is a scale used to measure the severity of pain. It is used to numerically convert the pain value that cannot be measured numerically. The two end definitions of the pain parameter are written on both ends of a 100 mm line and the patient is asked to indicate where his condition is appropriate by drawing a line, placing a dot or marking on this line. It is a 100 mm (10 cm) ruler that can be used horizontally and vertically, with painlessness on one end and the most severe pain on the other. &quot;0 mm&quot; means painlessness, &quot;100 mm&quot; means the most severe pain. The individual indicates the severity of the pain he feels on this scale. In line with these data, horizontally prepared Visual Analog Scale was used in this study to determine the severity of pain felt by patients during peripheral IV catheter injection. Pain severity score measurements were evaluated in mm.</description>

    <measure>Injection Satisfaction Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluation was made immediately after application.</time_frame>
    <description>It is a scale created to determine the satisfaction status of patients due to injection after peripheral IV catheter injection. The two tip definitions of the injection satisfaction parameter are written on both ends of a 100 mm line and the patient is asked to indicate where his condition is appropriate by drawing a line, point or mark on this line. It is a 100 mm (10 cm) ruler that can be used horizontally and vertically, with one end saying &quot;I'm not satisfied at all, but very satisfied&quot; on the other. &quot;0mm&quot; means not satisfied at all, &quot;100mm&quot; means very satisfied. The individual determines the degree of satisfaction with the injection felt on this scale. In line with the above findings, horizontally prepared Injection Satisfaction Scale was used in this study to determine the injection satisfaction levels of patients due to peripheral intravenous catheter injection application. Injection satisfaction levels score measurements were evaluated in mm.</description>
