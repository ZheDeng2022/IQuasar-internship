    <textblock>
      This observational study is designed to evaluate the integration of a model-informed,&#xD;
      clinically individualized pharmacokinetics (PK) profile (precision dosing dashboard) into&#xD;
      prescribing clinicians' existing workflows to improve safety and efficacy of morphine dosing&#xD;
      for neonates. We will use user-centered participatory design methods and real-time analysis&#xD;
      to inform the refinement of our recently developed Electronic Health Record (EHR) model-based&#xD;
      decision support tool and test it during the pre-and post-implementation stages.&#xD;

      Aim 1: To successfully implement a morphine PK and individualized precision dosing decision&#xD;
      aid into workflows of neonatal prescribing clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the steps required to successfully implement a population&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) model-informed real-time decision support interface for the prescribing&#xD;
      of neonatal pain and sedation medications. Currently, most opiate and benzodiazepine&#xD;
      treatment is done by empirical dosing without any knowledge of drug concentrations, which can&#xD;
      easily lead to under or over-dosing of medications. Our background data show that over 65% of&#xD;
      infants who are placed on morphine experience blood concentrations well above the currently&#xD;
      suggested target ranges. This project will incorporate PK model-informed dosing and&#xD;
      eventually include real-time drug concentration information feedback directly into&#xD;
      prescribers' workflows so that they can make a data-informed decision, thus allowing maximal&#xD;
      therapeutic efficacy while minimizing the likelihood of adverse events. The expected outcomes&#xD;
      are better clinical efficacy and safety with fewer side effects in the neonatal population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Open label, prospective, quasi-experimental study that will use data collected&#xD;
      during patients' Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) hospitalization at Cincinnati Children's&#xD;
      Medical Center (CCHMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use user-centered participatory design methods to establish the optimal means&#xD;
      of incorporating this decision support into already existing workflows. These findings will&#xD;
      allow us to implement the clinical decision support directly into clinical practice during&#xD;
      the study period. During and following implementation, we will use a mixed methods approach&#xD;
      through continually evaluating the effectiveness of the precision dosing application through&#xD;
      technical analytics, real-time user feedback, and clinical data feedback. Technical process&#xD;
      outcomes will consist of usage analysis statistics such as application access logs, time&#xD;
      spent viewing the application, and technical error rates (e.g., failure of the application to&#xD;
      launch or load data). Users will have the option to provide direct in-app feedback. Such&#xD;
      feedback is necessary for successful agile software development and will be incorporated into&#xD;
      regular revisions of the tool. In addition, we will use clinical data including subjective&#xD;
      bedside pain and sedation assessments as well as objective morphine concentration data to&#xD;
      help further refine the PK/PD models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective evaluation of the decision support tool We will start using the tool to provide&#xD;
      dosing guidance based on patient information and the morphine PK model predictions but&#xD;
      without using morphine concentrations as feedback for 3-6 months. This is anticipated to be&#xD;
      the time required to prospectively test the tool while putting in place the logistics for&#xD;
      timed sampling and morphine concentration measurements in real-time. Only members of the&#xD;
      study team will have access to the tool at this time. When the clinical team is discussing&#xD;
      the morphine usage over the last 24 hours and before the pain/sedation plan is developed, the&#xD;
      member of the study team that is reviewing the tool will introduce this information on&#xD;
      rounds. Currently the NICU clinical pharmacist on the study team reviews NeoRelief during&#xD;
      rounds to assess morphine doses being used and the estimated concentrations based on the&#xD;
      model. The tool will be made available to the other members of the study team as part of the&#xD;
      roll out. The model-based dosing suggestions are not meant to take the place of clinical&#xD;
      judgement. It is impossible to take into account all of the unique variables that go in to&#xD;
      developing a pain management plan for a patient. If the clinical team choses to deviate from&#xD;
      the recommendations, the clinical pharmacists will make a note as to why the decision was&#xD;
      made to deviate from the recommendation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the logistics of morphine concentration measurement and reporting by the mass&#xD;
      spectrometry laboratory have been worked out, we will continue with the prospective&#xD;
      evaluation of the decision support tool by now also taking into account morphine&#xD;
      concentration measurement(s) as 'feedback' using remnant samples. This will allow for&#xD;
      Bayesian estimation and prediction of a patient's individual PK profile. Again, since the&#xD;
      goal is the incorporation of the tool into the workflow, only members of the study team will&#xD;
      have access to the tool information. When the team is discussing the morphine usage over the&#xD;
      last 24 hours and before the pain/sedation plan is developed this information will be&#xD;
      introduced on rounds. This will provide us with an objective way to determine if it is being&#xD;
      effectively incorporated into the workflow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population and inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be preterm and term neonates who receive intravenously (IV) administered&#xD;
      morphine for 24 hours or more in the CCHMC NICU as part of standard clinical pain care&#xD;
      management. Our target is a minimum of 200 evaluable research participants. All infants in&#xD;
      the CCHMC NICU regardless of gender, race, or age are potential subjects. We anticipate that&#xD;
      enrolled participants will be of mixed demographics. There will be no exclusions based on&#xD;
      gender or ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A central electronic database will be constructed for storing all study-related data. REDCap&#xD;
      will be used as the database software and will be password protected. REDCap is a secure,&#xD;
      web-based application for building and managing online surveys and databases and a resource&#xD;
      of the Center for Clinical and Translational Science and Training provided to researchers&#xD;
      affiliated with the University of Cincinnati Academic Health Center. Access will be&#xD;
      restricted to the primary investigator and designated study personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and Clinical Data: Patient demographic data and clinical data will be collected&#xD;
      from the electronic medical record EPIC. Data to be collected will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient ID&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Birth measurements - weight, length, head circumference&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age - estimated gestational, chronological, corrected gestational, postmenstrual&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-operative complications, as applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date and time of morphine initiation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Morphine dose and infusion rates&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Times and changes to morphine infusion rates&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time and dose of any morphine boluses given&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior history of opiate and benzodiazepine exposure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concomitant medications and any other medication levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical conditions and diagnoses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory values - Creatinine and transaminases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs - heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NPASS scores: Along with physiologic indicators of pain (i.e., vital signs), behavioral&#xD;
           indicators of pain will be collected using the Neonatal Pain Agitation and Sedation&#xD;
           Scale. The NPASS is a validated pain scoring system that incorporates crying and&#xD;
           irritability, behavioral state, facial expression, extremity tone, and vital signs (HR,&#xD;
           RR, BP, SaO2) to assess neonatal pain and sedation that is consistently used in the&#xD;
           CCHMC NICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Withdrawal Assessment Tool - Version 1 (WAT-1) scoring for signs of withdrawal (if&#xD;
           available); otherwise by collecting data on patients subjectively withdrawing, and/or&#xD;
           requiring a taper as per the clinical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include the collection of discarded blood samples (remnant samples) from&#xD;
      neonates who are already receiving morphine as part of their standard of care. This approach&#xD;
      is successfully utilized in several 'POPS' studies (Pediatric Opportunistic Pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      Studies as part of Pharmacokinetics of Understudied Drugs Administered to Children per&#xD;
      Standard of Care program) conducted by the Pediatric Trials Network (http://pediatric&#xD;
      trials.org/).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Plan and Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary clinical outcomes will be a comparison of pre-implementation compared with&#xD;
      post-implementation amounts of morphine given, as measured by number of PRN medications&#xD;
      given, area under the morphine concentration time curve, and cumulative amount of morphine&#xD;
      exposure above target concentration. Secondary outcomes will include an evaluation of&#xD;
      usability of the application using the System Usability Scale, indicating the extent to which&#xD;
      the tool is being used by those who have access and the extent to which it is effectively&#xD;
      incorporated into rounds to provide effective and safe analgesia for neonates with&#xD;
      effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. After the initial development period, we will&#xD;
      collect data obtained from 200 neonates for a minimum of 18 months for analysis of both the&#xD;
      process and clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Characterize the morphine exposure-response relationship by prospective evaluation of&#xD;
      dose requirements, morphine concentration, and pain parameters using PK and PD modeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use validated approaches that have been supported by the U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration and European Medicines Agency to develop a population PK/PD model using&#xD;
      nonlinear mixed effect analysis based on plasma concentrations of morphine and pain and&#xD;
      sedation assessment scores and vital sign trends (PD data) in relation to the clinical&#xD;
      procedure of study data enriched with retrospectively collected data. This methodology not&#xD;
      only allows one to estimate the &quot;typical&quot; pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile for the&#xD;
      population but also will characterize between and within PK variability for each patient over&#xD;
      time. Through a hierarchical modeling process, clinical characteristics can be identified to&#xD;
      help account for some of the observed variabilities and ultimately result in improved patient&#xD;
      specific dosing. This approach is particularly useful in identifying age related effects and&#xD;
      given the general sparseness of blood samples, the population approach is well suited for&#xD;
      studying pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in pediatric populations. The model will&#xD;
      include a description of the maturation of morphine metabolism and clearance based on&#xD;
      postmenstrual age and time after birth as described in the literature. Model development and&#xD;
      validation will be performed according to good modeling practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Evaluate generalizability of the precision dosing platform by extending the platform&#xD;
      to include a synergistic medication, midazolam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of midazolam module:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NeoRelief decision support application is a modular platform developed to be extended to&#xD;
      other frequently used medications in the NICU such as midazolam. Published midazolam PK&#xD;
      models will will be coded in and serve as the starting point for a fully functional decision&#xD;
      support tool for precision dosing of midazolam. This process will be supported by the CCHMC&#xD;
      IS team who integrated systems specifications and interphase requirements for secure data&#xD;
      exchange between Epic and the morphine decision support platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Plan and Sample Size The evaluation plan and measures will be the same as those&#xD;
      enumerated for Specific Aim 1; (a) technical analytics including usage rates, time spent in&#xD;
      the application, accessibility; (b) user feedback and usability testing; (c) clinical&#xD;
      outcomes including doses of medication given, PRN doses administered, and cumulative dosing&#xD;
      measurements. After the initial development period, we will collect data obtained from 50&#xD;
      neonates for a minimum of 18 months for analysis of both the process and clinical outcomes.&#xD;
