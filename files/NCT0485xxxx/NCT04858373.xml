  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to 1. describe the technological characteristics of emmer seeds, flours, and&#xD;
      breads, 2. determine the glycemic index and glycemic load of two emmer breads, and 3. to&#xD;
      investigate the effects of these breads on postprandial glycemic response in healthy subjects&#xD;

    <description>Fourteen healthy, normal weight subjects (male: 6, female: 8) after 12hr fast, consumed 50g available carbohydrates from D-glucose, three times, in different visits as reference food along with 300ml water; and 50g available carbohydrates from emmer bread from Greek emmer seeds, emmer bread from Italian emmer seeds, and whole wheat commercial soft bread, tested once, in different visits. there was a washout period of 2 days between visits. Fingertip capillary blood glucose samples were taken at baseline, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120min after food consumption. The first glucose sample was taken exactly 15min after the first bite of food or drink.</description>
