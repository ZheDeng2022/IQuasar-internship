  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anesthetic agents, including opioids can modulate the altered immune function in patients&#xD;
      with obesity through mechanisms that involve the expression and release of cytokines. For&#xD;
      this reason, anesthetic care in patients with obesity remains controversial. Therefore, the&#xD;
      aim of the study was to compare the effect of opioid-containing anesthesia vs opioid-free&#xD;
      anesthesia using the Cortínez-Sepúlveda model on serum levels of IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α before&#xD;
      and after surgery in obese patients undergoing bypass surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A randomized cross-sectional study of 40 unrelated obese adults was performed in the&#xD;
      Anesthesiology and Bariatric Surgery Service at the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara &quot;Dr. Juan&#xD;
      I. Menchaca&quot;. Before undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, patients were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to two anesthesia groups: opiod-containing (n=20) or opioid-free (n=20). The opioid&#xD;
      used in the opioid-containing anesthesia group was fentanyl. To characterize the disposition&#xD;
      of intravenous propofol for the target-controlled infusion technique in obese patients, the&#xD;
      Cortínez-Sepúlveda pharmacokinetic model was used. Body mass was determined to the nearest&#xD;
      0.05kg using a balance scale (Seca 703; Seca, Hamburg, Germany). Blood samples were taken&#xD;
      before and immediately after surgery and cytokine serum levels were determined with ELISA&#xD;
      kits. Statistical analyses were performed using the IBM Statistical Package for the Social&#xD;
      Sciences software package version 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).&#xD;
