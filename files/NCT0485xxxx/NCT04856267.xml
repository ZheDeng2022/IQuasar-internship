  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to improve our understanding of the effects of the build-up&#xD;
      of amyloid deposits in the heart, in particular, our understanding of the risk of abnormal&#xD;
      heart beats, or rhythms, associated with people with cardiac (heart) amyloidosis. Symptoms&#xD;
      such as palpitations (fast, strong or irregular heart beat) and blackouts are common in&#xD;
      people with cardiac amyloidosis, but there is not enough information on what causes this. At&#xD;
      present, there is also not enough information on when they occur, how often they happen, and&#xD;
      which patients are at risk of having serious, life-threatening types of abnormal heart&#xD;
      rhythms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of these abnormal heart rhythms can be treated with medicine; others need electronic&#xD;
      devices (e.g. pacemakers) implanted or inserted in the heart to prevent serious harm. The&#xD;
      information on when is the best time to implant these life-saving devices remains limited. In&#xD;
      this study, a small device known as an implantable loop recorder (ILR) will be implanted&#xD;
      under the skin on the chest wall to continuously monitor participants' heart rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will help us answer some of the questions about what causes the abnormal heart rhythms,&#xD;
      when they happen, and which patients are particularly likely to have them. Furthermore, it&#xD;
      may help us to identify earlier, rather than later, those who are at risk of developing&#xD;
      abnormal heart rhythms. This may lead to improvements in the care of people with cardiac&#xD;
      amyloidosis in the future. Participants may not directly benefit from taking part in this&#xD;
      study; however, there is a chance that the ILR may reveal heart rhythm abnormalities in some&#xD;
      participants which might not be picked up otherwise, and so may lead to a change in their&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sudden cardiac death (SCD) occurs in up to 1/3 of patients with AL amyloidosis within the&#xD;
      first 90 days but conflicting findings have been reported on the mechanism. Electromechanical&#xD;
      dissociation (EMD) is thought to account for some 6-7 cases, underscoring doubts about a role&#xD;
      for implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). However, there are studies that have&#xD;
      described appropriate and effective ICD therapies in 27% to 32% of cases, similar to primary&#xD;
      prevention in other disorders. The strength of evidence in all these studies is fairly weak&#xD;
      (small, single-centre, retrospective, not linked to mechanism), but this potentially makes&#xD;
      ICD implantation more important than in other conditions. It has also been shown in a study&#xD;
      with small patient numbers that the pre-terminal event is often bradycardia, which may be&#xD;
      amenable to pacemaker therapy. At present, the available information regarding arrhythmia&#xD;
      burden in cardiac amyloidosis is limited, and further data are crucial to better guide&#xD;
      patient selection for device therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst the burden of arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death appear considerable, there is&#xD;
      limited characterisation of the incidence and predictive factors for arrhythmia requiring&#xD;
      treatment. Cardiac involvement is the main driver of outcome in cardiac amyloidosis.&#xD;
      Amyloidosis is a continuum from small focal amyloid deposits to extensive diffuse myocardial&#xD;
      infiltration. The dynamic and progressive nature of amyloid deposition is likely to create an&#xD;
      arrhythmogenic substrate that alters over time. For example, patchy amyloid deposits&#xD;
      occurring in earlier disease might potentially provide an anatomical substrate enabling&#xD;
      re-entry and underlie ventricular tachyarrhythmias, whilst diffuse transmural amyloid&#xD;
      deposition may increase risk of AV block and bradyarrythmias. The investigators believe that&#xD;
      amyloid deposition will be associated with increased risk of fatal arrhythmias, including AV&#xD;
      block, bradyarrhythmias and ventricular arrhythmias. There are no current criteria or&#xD;
      arrhythmia risk stratification available to guide device implantation in patients with&#xD;
      cardiac amyloidosis. There are also limited data available on predictive disease&#xD;
      characteristics that promote arrhythmia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current monitoring for arrhythmia involves routine 12-lead ECG checks at annual or&#xD;
      six-monthly clinic visits. Longer durations of monitoring (24- or 72-hour Holter monitoring&#xD;
      or implantable loop recorders, ILR) are undertaken only when clinically indicated. Other&#xD;
      cardiac investigations that are routinely performed in cardiac amyloidosis include&#xD;
      echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current management of arrhythmia is limited to anticoagulation as per the CHADS2VASC score&#xD;
      for atrial fibrillation, and permanent pacemaker insertion for standard indications including&#xD;
      high degree atrioventricular blocks. There are limited data available to inform insertion of&#xD;
      defibrillators, and this is currently assessed on a case by case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac biomarkers may be helpful in raising clinical suspicion of cardiac amyloidosis&#xD;
      patients with known plasma cell dyscrasia and should prompt further investigation with&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography. The combination of cardiac biomarkers serum&#xD;
      N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and troponin is useful to&#xD;
      stratify prognosis and guide treatment strategies in AL amyloidosis. In these patients, ECG&#xD;
      tends to show low voltage complexes with common observations including repolarisation&#xD;
      abnormalities, pseudo-infarction patterns, left anterior hemiblock, ischaemic or non-specific&#xD;
      T wave abnormalities, and rhythm disturbances such as atrial fibrillation. Echocardiography&#xD;
      shows the cardiac amyloid phenotype is a thick-walled ventricle, small left ventricular&#xD;
      chamber volume, valve thickening, atrial enlargement and signs of elevated filling pressures&#xD;
      with a restrictive diastolic filling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMR is at the forefront of diagnosis and monitoring of cardiac amyloidosis. CMR uses its&#xD;
      intrinsic capacity to characterise cardiac tissue on the basis of fundamental MR properties&#xD;
      (T1 and T2), and these intrinsic properties can be strengthened by administration of&#xD;
      gadolinium-based contrast agents. CMR can visually depict, with late gadolinium enhancement&#xD;
      (LGE), and quantify, with T1 mapping, the continuum of cardiac amyloid deposition allowing&#xD;
      for noninvasive measurement of cardiac amyloid burden. Transmurality of LGE, elevation in&#xD;
      native T1 and extracellular volume fraction (ECV) all correlate with amyloid burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a study from the UK National Amyloidosis Centre (NAC) published in 2015, ILRs were&#xD;
      inserted into 20 consecutive patients with severe cardiac AL amyloidosis. The most important&#xD;
      finding was that the terminal syncopal phase prior to death revealed initial cardiac&#xD;
      decompensation to be associated with marked bradycardia usually caused by complete heart&#xD;
      block, subsequently followed by pulseless electrical activity. But this study was done in&#xD;
      patients with end stage AL amyloidosis, and rhythm disturbances in the wide spectrum of&#xD;
      amyloid infiltration has never been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, arrhythmia risk prediction is limited despite existing structural and functional&#xD;
      assessment tools. ILR data would provide invaluable information on arrhythmia burden, which&#xD;
      may be correlated with information obtained from the existing standard-of-care (SOC)&#xD;
      structural, biochemical and functional assessments such as, but not limited to, T1 mapping&#xD;
      and ECV from CMR, serum biomarkers, and the six-minute walk test (6MWT). These data together&#xD;
      would provide a global picture of the arrhythmia burden and contributing risk factors; this&#xD;
      has the potential to transform our understanding of arrhythmia in cardiac amyloidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, improvements in ILR technology have made these devices more patient-friendly.&#xD;
      New ILRs no longer require surgical implantation but can be subcutaneously injected in the&#xD;
      outpatient setting. They are simple to use, with automatic recording and uploading of data&#xD;
      over each 24-hour period for up to 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ILR is a small injectable electronic device (approximate size 45 x 7 x 4 mm, about&#xD;
      one-third the size of a AAA battery), which is inserted under the skin within the&#xD;
      subcutaneous tissue in the chest. It is routinely used for continuous cardiac monitoring for&#xD;
      a range of symptoms (syncope, pre-syncope or palpitations of suspected cardiac origin,&#xD;
      arrhythmia) in the wider National Health Service (NHS), and at the Royal Free Hospital (RFH).&#xD;
      The required incision for device insertion is less than 1 cm, and it can safely be inserted&#xD;
      by a trained healthcare professional (HCP) in the outpatient setting. It is safe and&#xD;
      well-tolerated once inserted. One suture is required to close the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As with any such procedure there is a small risk of bleeding and/or infection, both of which&#xD;
      are rare. The risk of infection may be minimised by the maintenance of aseptic technique and&#xD;
      sterile environment throughout the procedure. Patients will remain in the department under&#xD;
      observation for 1 hour after the procedure, and the insertion site will be checked for&#xD;
      bleeding and any other abnormalities before the patient is allowed to leave.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will attend their GP surgery (or return to the RFH, whichever is their preference)&#xD;
      within 7 to 10 days for removal of the suture and for examination of the insertion site. The&#xD;
      device may be removed (as per SOC) when the battery runs out or 3 years after insertion,&#xD;
      whichever happened first. The device may be removed earlier if indicated by, for example,&#xD;
      adverse event. The ILR may also be left in situ once the patient has completed participation&#xD;
      or when the battery runs out, according to patient preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ILRs are used in routine practice where indicated for continuous cardiac monitoring in&#xD;
      patients with later-stage cardiac amyloidosis but are not currently routinely implanted in&#xD;
      patients with early stage disease. Although this study will involve implanting ILRs earlier&#xD;
      on in the disease process than usual, this is not anticipated to present any additional risk&#xD;
      to patients. Therefore the risk categorisation for this trial would be Type A: Comparable to&#xD;
      the risk of standard medical care for this particular patient group. Furthermore, there is&#xD;
      the potential benefit of early intervention to treat arrhythmias, which could be&#xD;
      life-changing and possibly even life-saving for some patients.&#xD;
