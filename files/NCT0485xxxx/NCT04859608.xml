  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eculizumab is an anti-C5 monoclonal antibody approved for rare diseases including atypical&#xD;
      haemolytic-uraemic syndrome. The maintenance phase dosing regimen is identical for all adult&#xD;
      patients but several studies have shown a high interindividual kinetics variability. A&#xD;
      tailored administration of eculizumab based on therapeutic drug monitoring will be compared&#xD;
      with real-life administration in adults suffering from an atypical haemolytic uraemic&#xD;
      syndrome. The objective is to improve efficiency of eculizumab administration.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eculizumab is a very expensive drug (450 000 euros per year per patient). According to the&#xD;
      usual administration scheme, the eculizumab is administrated by intravenous infusion, every&#xD;
      14 or 21 days in hospital. Studies have shown the possibility of extending the administration&#xD;
      intervals in patients with a high concentration of eculizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A personalized spacing of eculizumab infusions, based on a therapeutic drug monitoring, is&#xD;
      expected to improve the patient's quality of life and lead to substantial savings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these reasons, the objective of this study is to explore the efficiency of a personalized&#xD;
      spacing of eculizumab infusions compared to the usual administration scheme (without&#xD;
      personalization) from the French health Insurance perspective. The efficiency will be&#xD;
      assessed by estimating the incremental cost per QALY (Quality-Adjusted Life Year) gained at&#xD;
      18 months (duration of follow-up in the clinical trial) and at 5 years thanks to a Markov&#xD;
      model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the study is 24 months (6 months of enrolment and 18 months of&#xD;
      follow-up).&#xD;

    <measure>Incremental Cost-Utility Ratio (ICUR) at 18 months of a personalized spacing of eculizumab infusions compared to the usual administration scheme without personalization, from the French health insurance perspective.</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ICUR will express the incremental cost per QALY (Quality-adjusted Life Years) gained over a 18-month time horizon. QALYs will be estimated from patient responses to the EQ-5D-5L instrument (EuroQol group - 5 Dimensions - 5 levels). Costs related to hospital care resources (medicalized information system program), transports (patient diary), eculizumab concentration dosing (cost estimation) will be estimated from the French Health Insurance perspective. Cost and QALY estimates will be used to estimate the within-trial ICUR.</description>

    <measure>Incremental Cost-Utility Ratio at 5 years (incremental cost per QALY gained) of a personalized spacing of the eculizumab infusions compared to the usual administration scheme without personalization, estimated from a Markov model.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>A Markov model will represent the patient's clinical progression across different health states over a 5-year period. Markov modelling will use the within-trial data to estimate the transition probabilities, the state cost and utility values.</description>

    <description>The financial impact of spreading the strategy of personalized spacing of eculizumab infusions, in patients in remission with atypical hemolytic uraemic syndrome requiring long-term treatment, will be estimated per year and over a 5-year period, from the French Health Insurance (using a budget impact model).</description>

    <measure>Quality of life measured over a 18-month period using different specific scales (KDQoL-SF, ReTransQoL-Version 2) dedicated to patients with renal disease</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months.</time_frame>
    <description>KDQoL-SF (Kidney Disease and Quality of Lifeâ„¢ Short Form) survey is a kidney-disease-specific quality of life instrument that assesses four domains : health, kidney disease, effects of kidney disease on daily life, satisfaction with care. Scores for each dimension are reported within the range 0-100, higher scores indicating better health- related quality of life.&#xD;
RTQ-V2 (ReTransQoL-Version 2) survey is a specific quality of life instrument for renal transplant recipients. It comprises of 32 items describing five domains: Physical Health, Social Functioning, Medical Care, Treatment and Fear of Losing Graft. Scores for each dimension are reported within the range 0-100, higher scores indicating better health- related quality of life.&#xD;
KDQoL-SF survey will be used for all patients, and RTQ-V2 survey for kidney transplant patients only. The quality of life will be measured every three months.</description>
