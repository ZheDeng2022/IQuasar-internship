  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of HVAD Smart 1.0 study is to collect HVAD device data (i.e., waveform + logfile&#xD;
      + pump parameter) in various clinical conditions (e.g., routine follow-up visits,&#xD;
      experiencing adverse events) to support development of predictive and actionable algorithms.&#xD;
      The collected data will be used to characterize HVAD flow waveform and logfile pattern&#xD;
      changes that precede a qualifying adverse event, as well as characterize &quot;normal&quot; HVAD flow&#xD;
      waveform and logfile patterns (subjects free from any qualifying adverse event, any hospital&#xD;
      readmissions related to a SAE, or any parenteral medical therapy for heart failure management&#xD;
      (e.g., inotropes, diuretics, etc.) or ultrafiltration in last 30 days). In addition, the&#xD;
      study will collect data to evaluate the utility of CareLink in HVAD patients. The study will&#xD;
      not involve any investigational testing and the market-released devices will used as per the&#xD;
      approved labelling.&#xD;
