      A Prospective Randomized, Multi-center, International, Single-blind, Clinical trial compared&#xD;
      the Selution DEB strategy versus DES strategy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, multi-center, international, single-blind, clinical trial. Patients meeting&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be randomized 1:1 to treatment of all lesions of the identified&#xD;
      trial target vessel(s) with either the SELUTION SLR DEB or DES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the SELUTION SLR DEB arm will receive lesion preparation according to&#xD;
      the 3rd DCB consensus (optimal balloon angioplasty with adjunct treatment using high-pressure&#xD;
      balloon, shockwave, rotational atherectomy or cutting or scoring balloon at the discretion of&#xD;
      the operator when necessary to maximize lumen diameter). Patients with lesions that are then&#xD;
      best treated by provisional stenting (flow-limiting dissection, residual stenosis &gt; 30% or&#xD;
      FFR &lt; 0.8) before or after use of DEB will receive a DES but remain in the SELUTION DEB group&#xD;
      (intention to treat analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the DES arm will receive treatment using any CE-marked DES, as per&#xD;
      standard institutional practice. Patients with failure to deliver DES will be first treated&#xD;
      by provisional DEB using the SELUTION DEB, and failing that, with any other device deemed&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staged procedures are allowed if they are planned less than 45 days after the index procedure&#xD;
      and are done according to the initial treatment allocation for all trial target vessels (DEB&#xD;
      if DEB arm, DES if DES arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will test:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. for non-inferiority of a DEB plus provisional DES treatment strategy versus a systematic&#xD;
           DES strategy with respect to the primary endpoint of TVF at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. for long-term superiority at 5 years of the DEB strategy with TVF as an endpoint All&#xD;
           Patients will be followed for clinical outcomes at 30 days, 6 months, 1 2, 3, 4 and 5&#xD;
           years.&#xD;
