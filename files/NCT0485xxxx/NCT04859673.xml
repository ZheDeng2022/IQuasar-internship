  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to examine sonographic structural changes pre and post the&#xD;
      radial extracorporeal shock wave intervention in hemiplegic shoulder pain, and to assess the&#xD;
      relationships between sonographic structural changes and hemiplegic shoulder pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Painful shoulder is a common complication following hemiplegic stroke. This pain may&#xD;
      interfere with functional improvement, the patient's quality of life, and it may impede the&#xD;
      process of rehabilitation. Further understanding of rotator cuff tendon impairment and other&#xD;
      shoulder soft tissue structural abnormalities in stroke patients may help clinicians in&#xD;
      assigning more complete therapeutic plans to hemiplegic patients. The radial extracorporeal&#xD;
      shock wave therapy has promising results in patients with musculoskeletal problems and in&#xD;
      those with various causes of HSP, including spasticity, rotator cuff problems, adhesive&#xD;
      capsulitis, and complex regional pain syndrome .The purposes of this study are to examine&#xD;
      sonographic structural changes pre and post the radial extracorporeal shock wave intervention&#xD;
      in hemiplegic shoulder pain, as well as to explore the relationships between sonographic&#xD;
      structural changes and hemiplegic shoulder pain. This study will be a benefit in the physical&#xD;
      therapy field and may guide rehabilitation programs of physical therapy towards better&#xD;
      results through decreasing time needed to perform activity of daily living, decreasing&#xD;
      dependency and making patient an active member in society.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The selected patients will be randomly assigned to two equal groups (study group (GI), and control group (GII).The study group (GI) will be treated by the radial extracorporeal shock wave in addition to design physical therapy program.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of hemiplegic shoulder structural changes by ultrasonography</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Ultrasonography evaluation includes long head of biceps tendon ,subscapularis tendon, supraspinatus tendon, infraspinatus tendon. Each abnormal ultrasound (US) finding will be assigned a score of one (1) if present or zero (0) if absent. Long head of biceps effusion, sub acromial sub deltoid bursa effusion, subluxation, and adhesive capsulitis scored. Tendon tear, tendinosis, and tendon degeneration will be similarly scored for each of the four examined tendons per shoulder. The sum of these scores yielded a raw ultrasound (US) score; such that the minimum score was zero (normal examination) while the maximum score amounted to sixteen .The raw US scores will be further grouped into graded US scores, such that scores of 0, 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, and more than 6 abnormal sonographic findings represented normal shoulder, mild damage, moderate damage, severe damage, and intense damage, respectively</description>

    <measure>Pain assessment by using shoulder pain and disability index (SPADI).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Shoulder pain and disability index is a shoulder specific self-reported questionnaire measuring pain and disability in patients with shoulder pain. It contains 5 items assessing pain and 8 items assessing shoulder function. Each item is scored on visual analogue scale with (Right end) defined as &quot;worst pain imaginable/ so difficult required help&quot;, (Left end)&quot;no pain/no difficulty&quot;. Scores will be calculated as follow, in part one pain scores in all questions will be added, and the mean value will be chosen. In part two functional scores of all questions will add and the mean value will be chosen for the purpose of data analysis. Final score for each part will be statistically analyzed separately</description>
