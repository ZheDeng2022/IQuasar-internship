      This paper describes the rationale and design of a Phase 3 RCT comparing Transcendental&#xD;
      Meditation to Present Centered Therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), suicidal&#xD;
      ideation, alcohol use, and depressive symptoms in Veterans. In this multisite trial, 450&#xD;
      Veterans meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 (DSM-5) criteria for PTSD will be&#xD;
      recruited from nine VA and academic medical center sites across the U.S. Study outcomes&#xD;
      include changes in PTSD diagnosis and symptom severity (primary), suicidal ideation, alcohol&#xD;
      use, and depressive symptoms. Participation includes baseline testing and post-treatment&#xD;
      assessments at 12, 24, and 36-weeks. During each assessment visit, Veterans will complete&#xD;
      diagnostic interviews, including the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 and the&#xD;
      Alcohol Timeline Followback, as well as validated self-report measures. Cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      the treatments will be measured using intervention and healthcare costs, the proportion with&#xD;
      PTSD diagnosis removed, and Quality-Adjusted Life Years. Finally, single-site substudies will&#xD;
      examine pre-to-post-treatment changes in PTSD biomarkers and on magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI).&#xD;

      Background: The evidence supporting the Transcendental Meditation (TM) technique as a&#xD;
      treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has advanced considerably in the past&#xD;
      decade. With a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) suggesting statistical superiority to&#xD;
      active control treatments for PTSD (e.g., Present Centered Therapy [PCT]) and noninferiority&#xD;
      to first-line PTSD psychotherapies, additional research evaluating the benefits and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of TM for PTSD among Veterans is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and design: This paper describes the rationale and design of a Phase 3 RCT comparing&#xD;
      TM to PCT for PTSD in Veterans. In this multisite trial, 450 Veterans meeting DSM-5 criteria&#xD;
      for PTSD will be recruited from nine VA and academic medical center sites across the U.S.&#xD;
      Study outcomes include changes in PTSD diagnosis and symptom severity (primary), suicidal&#xD;
      ideation, alcohol use, and depressive symptoms. Participation includes baseline testing and&#xD;
      post-treatment assessments at 12, 24, and 36-weeks. During each assessment visit, Veterans&#xD;
      will complete diagnostic interviews, including the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for&#xD;
      DSM-5 and the Alcohol Timeline Followback, as well as validated self-report measures.&#xD;
      Cost-effectiveness of the treatments will be measured using intervention and healthcare&#xD;
      costs, the proportion with PTSD diagnosis removed, and Quality-Adjusted Life Years. Finally,&#xD;
      single-site substudies will examine pre-to-post-treatment changes in PTSD biomarkers and on&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: Despite progress in PTSD treatments, new evidence-based treatments are still&#xD;
      needed for Veterans who drop-out of or respond poorly to existing trauma-focused&#xD;
      psychotherapies and that may assist Veterans with common PTSD-comorbidities such as&#xD;
      depression, suicidal ideation, and substance use. This multisite trial seeks to advance the&#xD;
      science and potential application of TM as a treatment for PTSD in Veterans.&#xD;
