  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic, incurable condition associated with inflammation in the&#xD;
      gut lining. It causes diarrhoea, severe abdominal pain, poor nutrition and adversely affects&#xD;
      the quality of life of sufferers. Two of the best treatments currently used in people with CD&#xD;
      are drug injections and/or infusions (biologics), and a liquid-only diet using specialised&#xD;
      milkshakes. However, treatment with biologics is only successful in approximately 40% of the&#xD;
      patients, and although treatment with the liquid-only diet has a better safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness profile, it is difficult for patients to stick to this as their sole source of&#xD;
      nutrition for 6-8 weeks, particularly for adults. BIOPIC study aims to investigate whether&#xD;
      replacing half of a habitual diet with specialised milkshakes will improve response to&#xD;
      standard treatment with biologics in adults with CD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      80 adult patients with active CD who are due to start biologic injections therapy with&#xD;
      adalimumab as part of their standard of care for the first time will be recruited for this&#xD;
      study. Patients will be randomly allocated to replace either half of their normal diet with&#xD;
      nutritionally complete milkshakes or to follow their usual diet for 6 weeks. The&#xD;
      investigators will compare the proportion of patients whose symptoms and disease markers will&#xD;
      improve between the two groups at 6 and 12 weeks, and how many of them will remain&#xD;
      symptoms-free for up to a year following treatment. The investigators will also explore&#xD;
      whether the half-liquid diet will influence patients' nutrition and quality of life. Last,&#xD;
      the investigators will investigate if gut bacteria changes and their metabolites associate&#xD;
      with patients' eating habits and their responses to treatment with biologics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the BIOPIC study is to investigate if replacement of 50% of habitual food&#xD;
      intake with a proprietary liquid diet for 6 weeks will improve remission rates at 12 weeks in&#xD;
      adult patients with active ileocolonic CD treated with first-line biologics (TNFα&#xD;
      antagonists, adalimumab) as their standard treatment of care. The secondary aim is to&#xD;
      investigate if replacement of 50% of habitual food intake with a proprietary liquid diet for&#xD;
      6 weeks will prolong remission in adult patients with active ileocolonic CD treated with&#xD;
      first-line biologics (TNFα antagonists) as their standard treatment of care.&#xD;
