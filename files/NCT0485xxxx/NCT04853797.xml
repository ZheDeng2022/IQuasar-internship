  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperpolarization-activated cation (HCN) channels have recently been implicated in&#xD;
      neuropathic and inflammatory pain processes, and HCN channel activity is modulated by&#xD;
      signalling molecules, such as cyclic nucleotides (cAMP, cGMP) and extracellular potassium,&#xD;
      known to induce migraine. To uncover the role of HCN channels in migraine, the researchers&#xD;
      will investigate the anti-migraine effect of ivabradine, the only HCN channel blocker&#xD;
      available for clinical use, on levcromakalim-induced migraine.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hyperpolarization-activated cation (HCN) channels have recently been implicated in&#xD;
      neuropathic and inflammatory pain processes through their hyperfunction and/or&#xD;
      overexpression, and HCN channels may play a significant role in migraine pathophysiology, as&#xD;
      both an inflammatory and a neuropathic component has been hypothesized to contribute to&#xD;
      migraine, and HCN channel activity is facilitated by cyclic nucleotides, e.g. cAMP and cGMP&#xD;
      (molecules thought to be central in migraine pathophysiology) and increases in extracellular&#xD;
      K+ concentration causing Ih current amplification. Indeed, increases in cAMP or directly&#xD;
      opening adenosine 5'-triphosphate-sensitive K+ channels (KATP channel) by levcromakalim leads&#xD;
      to migraine attacks in a high proportion of patients, suggesting a crucial role for these&#xD;
      channels in migraine pathophysiology. KATP channel activation leads to hyperpolarization,&#xD;
      which in turn could increase the open probability of HCN channels. To uncover the role of HCN&#xD;
      channels in migraine, the researchers will investigate the anti-migraine effect of&#xD;
      ivabradine, the only HCN channel blocker available for clinical use, on levcromakalim-induced&#xD;
      migraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that this project will contribute greatly to the current&#xD;
      understanding of migraine pathophysiology and the hypothesized role of HCN channels in&#xD;
      migraine pain mechanisms. This is of great interest in future research, as such knowledge is&#xD;
      an important prerequisite for further investigation and understanding of intracellular&#xD;
      signalling mechanisms in migraine, which in turn will lead to the development of more&#xD;
      effective and mechanism-based drugs.&#xD;
