  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health care professionals (HCPs) help an support patients living with type 1 diabetes (PWT1D)&#xD;
      who need to achieve optimal blood glucose control in order to prevent short and long term&#xD;
      complications of T1D. However, studies show that not all HCPs are aware of T1D management as&#xD;
      most of them only see PWT1D occasionally. This makes it difficult for HCPs to remain aware of&#xD;
      the particularities of the condition and stay up-to-date on rapidly evolving technologies and&#xD;
      therapies available. Moreover, low confidence levels and the inaccessibility to continuing&#xD;
      medical education on the specificities of new therapies and technologies might increase the&#xD;
      failure of HCPs to propose the optimal treatment plan to their PWT1D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SUPPORT online platform, that was first developed for PWT1D, was adjusted to suit the&#xD;
      needs of HCPs (SUPPORT-Pro). The regularly updated bilingual (English and French)&#xD;
      peer-reviewed content of SUPPORT, which covers the various elements that an individual with&#xD;
      T1D needs to know to manage the disease and aims at making a better use of technologies and&#xD;
      new therapies, is the first in its kind and is highly relevant for HCPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to determine if the SUPPORT-Pro online training platform&#xD;
      can increase HCPs' (dietitians, nurses, pharmacists, medical doctors) confidence level in&#xD;
      treating individuals with T1D. This study is a non-randomized pre-post trial. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that the training provided through the SUPPORT-Pro online platform will significantly&#xD;
      increase HCPs' confidence level in treating individuals with T1D after 3 months when compared&#xD;
      to their confidence level before the intervention.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare the level of confidence in treating individuals with type 1 diabetes measured at 3 months to the level of confidence measured at baseline.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Levels of confidence will be measured using a questionnaire inspired from the Maternal Self-Efficacy for Diabetes Management Scale (MSED). For this study, MSED was modified to better assess the self-confidence of health care professionals. We have converted the 17-item questionnaire to a 19-item questionnaire (removing questions specific to familial support and adding questions on new therapies and technologies) and edited the wording of the questions. Every item is rated on a scale from 1 to 5. The satisfaction score will be the sum of all items, on a maximum of 95.&#xD;
Confidence levels at 3 months and at baseline will be compared using paired t-test with a 95% confidence interval, if normality assumption of the paired difference holds. Otherwise, the non-parametric counterpart, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, will be used and a 95% non-parametric confidence interval will be provided.</description>

    <description>Levels of confidence will be measured at baseline, after 3 months and after 12 months using a questionnaire inspired from the Maternal Self-Efficacy for Diabetes Management Scale (MSED).

Every item is rated on a scale from 1 to 5. The satisfaction score will be the sum of all items, on a maximum of 95.&#xD;
Sustainability of change will be assessed by comparing level of confidence at the 3 time points using a one-way repeated measures ANCOVA, with change from baseline as the outcome, and baseline level of confidence adjusted for in the model.</description>

    <description>Participants will have access to the SUPPORT-Pro self-guided online training platform addressing many aspects of type 1 diabetes care. The SUPPORT-Pro content was developped by a team of health professionals specialized in type 1 diabetes as well as patient partners. It's content is regularly updated, evidence-based and divided into 6 categories (medication, blood glucose monitoring, diet, physical activity, hypo and hyperglycemia, health and other particularities). In each category, users can pick between 3 levels (beginner, intermediate and advanced) according to their level of confidence and knowledge.&#xD;
Participants will be asked to fill out questionnaires at baseline, 3-month, and 12-month of the intervention which include the following: Eligibility assessment, identification, background, confidence, platform satisfaction.</description>
