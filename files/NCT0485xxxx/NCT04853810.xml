  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of technological tools in the treatment of diabetes has intensified and become common&#xD;
      in recent years. Many of these systems adhere to the skin with an adhesive in place between 2&#xD;
      and 14 days. The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence and consequences of&#xD;
      skin reactions to skin adhesive systems for the treatment of diabetes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The use of technological tools in the treatment of diabetes has intensified and become common&#xD;
      in recent years. Many of these systems adhere to the skin with an adhesive in place for&#xD;
      between 2 and 14 days, or even longer, depending on the system under consideration.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, an increase in skin reactions has been observed in diabetic patients using&#xD;
      these new technologies, sometimes leading to discontinuation. The number of studies&#xD;
      evaluating the cutaneous tolerance of the patches used by these technologies is limited, so&#xD;
      the prevalence of these skin intolerances is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence and consequences of skin reactions&#xD;
      to skin adhesive systems for the treatment of diabetes. It will be implemented with the&#xD;
      following design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  observational, cross-sectional, multicentre study involving 4 Diabetology centres and&#xD;
           over a period of 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establishment of an observatory on skin reactions to FreeStyle Libre® (FSL) and all&#xD;
           other adhesive systems related to new technologies for the treatment of diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A questionnaire will be systematically proposed to the patients concerned, during the&#xD;
           usual diabetes follow-up consultations made by all investigators.&#xD;
