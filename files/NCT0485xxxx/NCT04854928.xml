  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase IIa, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised study designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect, safety and tolerability of LTX-109 administered topically to the anterior nares in&#xD;
      subjects with COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 60 subjects will be randomised to achieve approximately 46 completed and evaluable&#xD;
      subjects. Subjects will be randomised 1:1 to one single dose of either active treatment or&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All potential study subjects will be contacted and invited to a screening video-call with the&#xD;
      Investigator. Full verbal information will be given and the consent for participation in the&#xD;
      study will be signed electronically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be visited twice at home by a study nurse on Day 1. During the first&#xD;
      visit, one standard deep nose swab (one nostril) and one from the anterior part of the nose&#xD;
      (both nostrils) will be collected. Symptom score will be assessed by the subject before&#xD;
      dosing. The investigational medicinal product (IMP) will then be applied topically to both&#xD;
      nostrils by the study nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study nurse will come back to collect nasal swab samples 2 hours after administration of&#xD;
      the IMP, using the same sampling procedure as for the baseline samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will use an electronic diary for daily registrations of adverse events, concomitant&#xD;
      medications and symptom score until Day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up phone contact will be performed 7 days after IMP administration.&#xD;

Symptoms included are fever, cough, trouble breathing, loss of smell or taste, nasal congestion or runny nose, sore throat and/or difficulty swallowing, headache, muscle and/or joint pain, stomach-ache and/or nausea and diarrhoea. The frequency of each symptom will be graded by the Subject using a 5 graded scale from Grade 1 (None of the time) through Grade 5 (All of the time). For each symptom, the absolute and percent change from baseline to Day 7 will be calculated.</description>
