  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our primary aim is to investigate the prevalence and severity of Periodonotal Disease (PD) in&#xD;
      a population of obese patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our secondary objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigate inflammatory biomarkers that have been associated with PD in the saliva of obese&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigate the association of FTO gene (Obesity) polymorphisms with the prevalence of PD in&#xD;
      this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigate and describe the subgingival microbial flora in obese patients with PD from&#xD;
      subgingival dental plaque samples as well as the salivary samples.&#xD;

      Overall design and plan of the study This is a cross-sectional association study. The study&#xD;
      population will be recruited among individuals attending the UCLH Centre for Weight Loss,&#xD;
      Metabolic &amp; Endocrine Surgery (UCLH bariatric clinic) and have given written informed consent&#xD;
      to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design All individuals who consent to this study will receive as part of their&#xD;
      routine care a medical examination, where a series of parameters are recorded (including age,&#xD;
      gender, smoking status, Bio-impedance for full body composition, ethnicity, and body mass&#xD;
      index). These data will be copied for this study. A blood sample will also be collected for&#xD;
      genetic analysis unless the patients have DNA already collected and it has been verified that&#xD;
      the results are available. In that case no venepuncture will be needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive a basic periodontal examination (BPE). For individuals with signs&#xD;
      of destructive periodontitis (BPE scores 3-4) full mouth plaque and gingival bleeding scores&#xD;
      will also be calculated. In addition to that also a comprehensive full mouth periodontal&#xD;
      probing depths assessment will be performed.&#xD;
