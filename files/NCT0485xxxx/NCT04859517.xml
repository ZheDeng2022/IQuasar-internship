  <brief_summary>

      This placebo-controlled study is intended to evaluate ADG20's safety and ability to prevent&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2/3, multicenter, double blind, placebo controlled, randomized study of the&#xD;
      mAb ADG20 in the prevention of symptomatic COVID 19 in adults and adolescents with no known&#xD;
      history of SARS-CoV-2 infection but whose circumstances place them at increased risk of&#xD;
      acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection and developing symptomatic COVID-19. This objective will be&#xD;
      independently evaluated in a cohort of participants with reported recent exposure to an&#xD;
      individual diagnosed with a SARS-CoV-2 infection (post-exposure prophylaxis) and in a cohort&#xD;
      of participants with no reported exposure to SARS-CoV-2 ( pre-exposure prophylaxis). These&#xD;
      cohorts will enrich for participants whose advanced age (≥55 years old) or health status&#xD;
      places them at risk for severe COVID 19 or COVID 19 complications.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Agrees to defer receipt of COVID-19 vaccination for minimum of 180 days (6 months)&#xD;
             after dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received (1) a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, (2) mAb or (3) convalescent plasma from a&#xD;
             person who has recovered from COVID-19 or prior participation in SARS-CoV2 vaccine,&#xD;
             convalescent plasma, or mAb clinical trial any time prior to participation in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of any investigational product within 30 days or 5 half lives before the day&#xD;
             of enrollment.&#xD;

          -  Is acutely ill or febrile 72 hours before or at Screening or has other COVID-19&#xD;
             symptoms including cough, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, or loss of taste or&#xD;
             smell. Fever is defined as a body temperature ≥38.0°C (≥100.4°F).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received or plans to receive a non-COVID-19 vaccine within 28 days before or after&#xD;
             dosing (except for seasonal influenza vaccine, which is not permitted within 14 days&#xD;
             before or after dosing).&#xD;
