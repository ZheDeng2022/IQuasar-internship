  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators show that by upskilling of primary care physicians (PCPs) in&#xD;
      SDM and leveraging on a novel pictorial Visual Analogue Uroflowmetry Score (VAUS), they can&#xD;
      enhance older men's recognition of LUTS and stimulated discussion with their PCPs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), often related to prostatomegaly, is common but seldom&#xD;
      sought medical attention amongst older men. Visual-aid and shared decision-making (SDM) are&#xD;
      potential solutions to address LUTS. The study aimed to determine the effect of a novel&#xD;
      pictorial Visual Analogue Uroflowmetry Score (VAUS) and primary care physicians (PCP) SDM&#xD;
      training on the decisional quality amongst men selecting their treatment options for LUTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study recruited 60 multi-ethnic Asian men aged ≥50 years with moderate-to-severe LUTS&#xD;
      (International Prostate Symptoms Score≥8 and/or QOL≥3) in a Singapore public primary care&#xD;
      clinic. Men used the VAUS to report their symptoms. 60 men were randomly assigned to PCPs&#xD;
      trained in SDM in the intervention group (n=30) and the other 30 to the control group (PCPs&#xD;
      without SDM-training). Patient-physician dyad decision quality was measured using the&#xD;
      validated SDMQ-9 (patient) and SDMQ-Doc (physician) questionnaires.&#xD;

    <description>The Shared Decision Making-9 (SDMQ9) Questionnaire measures decision quality from the perspective of the patient. Nine individual items in the questionnaire is scored from 0 to 5 on a six-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (&quot;completely disagree&quot;) to 5 (&quot;completely agree&quot;). Standard scoring for the full scale is the total score, with values from 0 to 45. Higher scores indicate higher quality decisions.</description>
