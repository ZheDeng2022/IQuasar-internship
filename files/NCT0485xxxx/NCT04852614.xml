  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational, open-label, pharmacokinetic study will evaluate PK of&#xD;
      SOF/DAC in lactating HCV-infected females at weaning or women who voluntarily decided to&#xD;
      forego breastfeeding to initiate HCV infection treatment. Therefore, drug concentrations can&#xD;
      be determined in maternal plasma and milk without risk to the children. HCV infected women at&#xD;
      weaning after various durations of breastfeeding and HCV infected women who wish to initiate&#xD;
      treatment immediately after delivery and forego breastfeeding will be recruited to start&#xD;
      treatment under the guidance of their physician with SOF/DAC to determine M/P ratios of each&#xD;
      of SOF, GS-331007 and DAC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible women will be advised to arrange for initiation of treatment with their physician&#xD;
      once they decide to stop breastfeeding. Treatment will be initiated once the women decide to&#xD;
      wean their children and a warning will be given to abstain from any breast-feeding once&#xD;
      treatment is started. This treatment is prescribed by the physician either the patients&#xD;
      choose to participate in the study or not. In addition, effective contraceptive methods&#xD;
      should be used. The treatment consists of SOF/DAC: 400 mg sofosbuvir and 60 mg daclatasvir&#xD;
      administered with food for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All recruited patients will be screened for the following data at baseline: Serum creatinine,&#xD;
      bilirubin, albumin, AST, ALT, prothrombin time (PT), CBC, and viral load by PCR. The&#xD;
      patient's general and demographic information (age, gender, height, and weight),&#xD;
      comorbidities, and concurrent medications will be assessed and recorded in a specially&#xD;
      designed patient data sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in the Faculty of Medicine Ain-Shams Research Institute Clinical&#xD;
      Research Center (MASRI -CRC). After the first dose, women will be instructed to express their&#xD;
      milk and discard it on the first two days and come to the research center on the third day&#xD;
      for plasma and milk sampling. Patients will be instructed to take the dose on time especially&#xD;
      the day before sampling. They will be asked to record the time of dose administration. They&#xD;
      might be also followed up by telephone calls&#xD;
