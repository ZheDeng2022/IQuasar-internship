  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children affected by high risk or relapsed/refractory leukaemia have a poor prognosis, with&#xD;
      an increased risk of relapse. These patients generally need treatment intensification and a&#xD;
      bone marrow transplantation (BMT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, with conventional treatent the risk of relapse after transplant remains high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radioimmunotherapy provides a way to deliver high dose irradiation to the bone marrow (where&#xD;
      leukaemia resides), while sparing normal organs and tissues from its toxicity.This can be&#xD;
      achieved by linking a radioactive molecule (Yttrium90) to an antibody that, once infused in&#xD;
      the blood, targets marrow/leukemic cells.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In our Phase 1 trial which concluded in 2019, 9 children affected by refractory or relapsed&#xD;
      leukaemia were enrolled at Great Ormond Street Hospital or UCLH. Participants received&#xD;
      infusion of a tumour cell targeting antibody to deliver irradiation to the bone marrow and&#xD;
      sites containing leukemic blasts prior to BMT. The aim of the Phase 1 study was to identify&#xD;
      the dose limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of targeted radiotherapy, and it was&#xD;
      found that this treatment was well tolerated with minimal infusion-related side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will enrol a larger cohort of children (aged 0.5 - 18 years) who will&#xD;
      receive 90Yttrium administered at an infused activity to target the optimal absorbed dose to&#xD;
      the bone marrow. Patients will be treated at GOSH and UCLH and followed up for 12 months&#xD;
      post-BMT to evaluate safety and efficacy of targeted radiotherapy with a reduced toxicity&#xD;
      conditioning regimen prior to BMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE AND DESIGN OF THE STUDY Children with high risk or relapsed leukaemia have a poor&#xD;
      prognosis with an increased risk of relapse after standard bone marrow transplant. There is&#xD;
      an urgent need to offer a different therapeutic strategy for children with such poor risk&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence that targeted radioimmunotherapy prior to a stem cell transplantation is a&#xD;
      feasible and effective treatment that delivers high dose radiation to the bone marrow and&#xD;
      spleen (where leukaemia resides),while sparing other tissues and organs from its toxicity.&#xD;
      Since leukaemic cells are generally radiosensitive, this approach might increase&#xD;
      leukaemia-free survival, while reducing transplant-related morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our previous phase 1 radio-immunotherapy study demonstrated that radio-immunotherapy is&#xD;
      non-toxic, but can elicit myelosuppression, with potential for better disease eradication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol offers a novel and non-toxic therapeutic strategy to children with poor risk&#xD;
      leukaemia and aims at reducing the risk of disease relapse after transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT and CONSENT Children with poor risk leukaemia who fulfill the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria of this study might be recruited in this trial. Patients and/or their&#xD;
      parents will receive appropriate information from one of the investigators regarding the&#xD;
      rationale of this study, the possible risks and benefits and the alternatives to taking part.&#xD;
      Patients and/or their parents will be given an age appropriate information sheet and consent&#xD;
      form and they will be given the time to think about this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA Children enrolled in this study must be affected by high risk or&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory leukaemia, with a high risk of disease relapse after conventional&#xD;
      transplant. Children eligible for this treatment must also be clinically fit for an&#xD;
      allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, according to clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      parameters, which have been specified in details in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISKS, BURDENS AND BENEFITS Patients eligible for this trial are affected by high risk or&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory leukaemia and have an indication to an allogeneic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation. Stem cell transplantation carries a significant risk of morbidity/mortality,&#xD;
      due to: a)the toxicity of the preparative regimen, b) the posttransplant immunodeficiency&#xD;
      with high risk of opportunistic infections, and c) the possible occurrence of graft versus&#xD;
      host disease. The use of radioimmunotherapy in the context of a reduced toxicity conditioning&#xD;
      regimen prior to the transplantation has proved to be feasible and safe in adult and&#xD;
      paediatric studies, without a significant increase of the treatment related toxicity when&#xD;
      compared to standard conditioning regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, higher doses of radiation delivered to patients with leukaemia generate a better&#xD;
      leukaemia response and this approach in children with poor risk leukaemia is promising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children undergoing this treatment will be carefully followed up and haematological&#xD;
      (prolonged cytopaenia, stromal damage) and nonhaematological (mucositis, liver and kidney&#xD;
      damage)toxicity will be monitored and recorded.&#xD;
