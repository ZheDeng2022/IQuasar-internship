  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of selinexor alone or with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in participants with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC).&#xD;
      Approximately 78 participants with advanced or metastatic CRC will be enrolled, and&#xD;
      randomized (1:1:1) into three arms A (selinexor only), B (selinexor and pembrolizumab), and C&#xD;
      (standard of care [Combination of trifluridine and tipiracil]). Randomization will be based&#xD;
      on stratification factors: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or&#xD;
      1 versus 2. The end of treatment (EoT) visit will occur less than or equal to (&lt;=30) days&#xD;
      post-treatment discontinuation. A survival follow-up visit will be performed every 3 months&#xD;
      from EoT and will continue for 12 months.&#xD;
