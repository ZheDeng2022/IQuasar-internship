  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study consists in the design, implementation and evaluation of an animation (Alerta&#xD;
      Alcohol 2.0)- versus text-based (Alerta Alcohol) computer-tailored game intervention aimed to&#xD;
      prevent alcohol consumption and binge drinking (BD) in Spanish adolescents. A Cluster&#xD;
      Randomized Controlled Trial (CRCT) is conducted to test the effectiveness of Alerta Alcohol&#xD;
      versus Alerta Alcohol 2.0 in students aged 14 to 19 years across 24 high schools from&#xD;
      Andalusia (southern Spain), which are randomized either to the experimental (EC-1, EC-2) or&#xD;
      the control conditions (CC).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use and misuse, and particularly, BD in adolescents are a highly prevalent healthcare&#xD;
      problem that associates physical and mental health complications and community implications.&#xD;
      The Alerta Alcohol and Alerta Alcohol 2.0 programs are based on the I-Change Model. A CRCT is&#xD;
      carried out. The schools from Andalusia are randomized either to the experimental (EC-1,&#xD;
      EC-2) or the control conditions (CC). The EC-1 receives an online intervention (Alerta&#xD;
      Alcohol, which has adapted from a previous version) with personalized health advice, using&#xD;
      textual feedback and several gamification techniques, and consists of nine sessions&#xD;
      (performing seven of them at the high school): session 1 or baseline, sessions 2 and 3 where&#xD;
      adolescents are provided with answers related to their views to provide highly specific&#xD;
      feedback regarding their knowledge, risk perception, self-esteem, attitude, social influence&#xD;
      and self-efficacy; sessions 4, 5, 7 and 8 are reinforcement sessions (booster sessions) and&#xD;
      sessions 6 and 9 are follow-up questionnaires at six and twelve months. The EC-2 receives an&#xD;
      improved version of Alerta Alcohol (Alerta Alcohol 2.0) using animated videos and new&#xD;
      gamification strategies. The CC just completes the baseline and the evaluation questionnaires&#xD;
      and then they are allowed to receive the intervention as well (as a waiting list). To test&#xD;
      the effectiveness, the primary outcome is BD within 30 days prior to evaluation and alcohol&#xD;
      use (high-intensity drinking, weekly and any consumption) in the previous week as secondary&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>The EC-1 receives Alerta Alcohol, which consists of session 1 or baseline, two sessions in three scenarios: at home, celebrations, and public places, and two follow-up evaluations. The adolescents are provided with answers related to their views of each scenario; this information is used to provide highly specific feedback regarding their knowledge, risk perception, self-esteem, attitude, social influence (modelling, norms and social pressure), self-efficacy and action plans. In addition, four booster sessions are given at home to reinforce the contents of the three scenarios. Evaluations take place after six and twelve months.</description>

    <description>The intervention consists of preventive messages about the benefits of not consuming alcohol, reducing the positive attitudes and encouraging the negative attitudes towards alcohol drinking and BD, as well as social influence and self-efficacy, by personalized feedback. Skills and action plans are encouraged to help the student to reject BD. This information is presented through different tailored text messages. Moreover, several gamification strategies are used (i.e. offering a challenge, giving different stories and the use of avatars in these stories that take place in three different scenarios: at home, at celebrations and in public places).</description>

Skills and action plans are encouraged to help the student to reject BD. This information is presented through different animated videos. Moreover, new gamification strategies are added (i.e. giving rewards and allocating points that can be accumulated and shown in a progress ranking) to those already used in Alerta Alcohol.</description>
