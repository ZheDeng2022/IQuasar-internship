      This Phase III Trial evaluates whether breast conservation surgery and endocrine therapy&#xD;
      results in a non-inferior rate of invasive or non-invasive ipsilateral breast tumor&#xD;
      recurrence (IBTR) compared to breast conservation with breast radiation and endocrine&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast conservation therapy for early stage breast cancer has been an important achievement&#xD;
      of oncology practice in the last half century and breast radiotherapy (RT) has been essential&#xD;
      in its development. Several seminal randomized clinical trials conducted in the 1980's era&#xD;
      demonstrated that breast radiotherapy following lumpectomy yielded overall survival outcomes&#xD;
      equivalent to mastectomy for treatment of early stage invasive breast cancer leading to the&#xD;
      National Institute of Health (NIH) Consensus Conference statement in 1991 supporting breast&#xD;
      conservation treatment.This established lumpectomy with RT as an alternative to mastectomy&#xD;
      and subsequently the rate of breast conservation for eligible breast cancer patients rose&#xD;
      steadily. Shortly thereafter, investigators recognized that the toxicity, patient burden, and&#xD;
      geographic barriers associated with the protracted treatment course for breast RT was a&#xD;
      potential barrier to breast conservation utilization. Numerous phase III clinical trials were&#xD;
      conducted randomizing women post lumpectomy to RT vs. observation aimed at identifying which&#xD;
      cases did not derive a significant RT benefit. No such subsets of breast cancer patients were&#xD;
      consistently identified, thereby solidifying the standard that breast conservation required&#xD;
      both lumpectomy and RT. Two meta-analyses by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists Collaborative&#xD;
      Group (EBCTCG) in 2005 and 2011 further reinforced the value of breast RT post lumpectomy by&#xD;
      examining the relationship of local recurrence and breast cancer mortality relative to the&#xD;
      use of breast RT post lumpectomy. In each analysis, it found for axillary node negative&#xD;
      breast cancer patients undergoing breast conservation a small but consistent increase in&#xD;
      breast cancer mortality when breast radiotherapy was omitted. As a result, breast RT after&#xD;
      lumpectomy has become an established paradigm for breast conservation for early stage breast&#xD;
      cancer and is recommended by the NCCN 2018 guidelines (as it has for nearly two decades) that&#xD;
      are commonly used today by clinicians and health systems alike. The landscape of early stage&#xD;
      breast cancer has changed dramatically over the past three decades since the establishment of&#xD;
      breast conservation. Widespread screening with mammography has led to the diagnosis of&#xD;
      smaller and earlier stage disease. All breast cancers are now routinely characterized by&#xD;
      their hormone sensitivity based on the presence of estrogen and progesterone receptors on&#xD;
      tumor cells within the biopsy or surgical specimen and presence of HER2 (human epidermal&#xD;
      growth factor receptor 2) which has provided an additional means of stratifying breast cancer&#xD;
      into distinct prognostic groups. Small, node negative invasive breast cancer that is hormone&#xD;
      sensitive (HS) and HER2-negative has a lower overall recurrence rate (local, regional, and&#xD;
      distant) than breast cancers characterized by more adverse clinical pathologic features.&#xD;
      However, other than in a smaller subset of women greater than 70 years old, clinical trials&#xD;
      in this HS population still demonstrated unacceptable local recurrence risks long term after&#xD;
      lumpectomy alone emphasizing that clinical and pathologic features are insufficient for&#xD;
      consistently identifying when RT can safely be omitted.&#xD;

             younger with no spontaneous menses for at least 12 months prior to study entry (e.g.,&#xD;
             spontaneous or secondary to hysterectomy) and with a documented estradiol level in the&#xD;
             postmenopausal range according to local institutional/laboratory standard; or&#xD;
