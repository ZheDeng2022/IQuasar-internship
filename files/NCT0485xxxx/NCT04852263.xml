  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Fiberoptic intubation is an effective technique for establishing airway access in&#xD;
      patients with critical airways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: It was hypothesized that the learning of oral fiberoptic intubation by the&#xD;
      anesthesia resident trainee is easier and safe using modified nasopharyngeal airway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: This prospective randomized study was done on 62 adult patients with normal&#xD;
      airway scheduled for elective oral fiberoptic intubation, their age 20 -60 years, 56 males&#xD;
      and 6 females, American Society of Anesthesiologists I-III class. After institute ethical&#xD;
      committee clearance and written informed consent, patients were randomly divided into two&#xD;
      groups of 31 each; Group I: oral fiberoptic intubation was carried out using lingual&#xD;
      traction. In group II, FOI was carried out using lingual traction plus a shortened uncuffed&#xD;
      nasal endotracheal tube (modified nasopharyngeal airway). Time taken to successful tracheal&#xD;
      intubation and other technical parameters were recorded. Heart rate, mean arterial blood&#xD;
      pressure, oxygen saturation, end-tidal carbon dioxide tension, and any associated&#xD;
      complications were also recorded.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients with normal airway, 20 - 60 years, ASA grade I-III with mallampati class I or II&#xD;
      were scheduled for elective oral FOI. Patients who refused to undergo the procedure, presence&#xD;
      of an absolute contraindication to nasal intubation like head trauma, a nasal mass, and&#xD;
      deviated nasal septum were excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly divided into two equal groups; Group I: FOI was carried out without&#xD;
      NPA, and Group II: FOI was performed using NPA (NPA group). Lingual traction was used in both&#xD;
      groups. Patients were optimized for surgery and fasting for 8 hours. While the patients in&#xD;
      the preoperative holding area, they were premedicated with glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg&#xD;
      intravenously 30 min prior to the procedure. At the same time, patients have been treated&#xD;
      with xylometazoline 0.1% nasal drops in both nostrils followed by lignocaine jelly 2%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All staff in the pre, intra, and postoperative area are licensed with ACLS according to the&#xD;
      standard and guidelines of patient safety. The patient file and vital signs will be monitored&#xD;
      during the stay in the holding area to discover any abnormalities. And each patient will sign&#xD;
      a written consent form after explaining and informing about the procedure of the study. Vital&#xD;
      signs (pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and body temperature) and oxygen saturation&#xD;
      will be checked before receiving any medication and frequently every 5 minutes till the end&#xD;
      of the procedure to detect early concerns (hemodynamics instability, bleeding, neurocognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction, and failed technique) The procedure was stopped if any patient feels abnormality&#xD;
      or observed by a physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENT consultant must be informed before the procedure to be around. Consultant Anesthesia will&#xD;
      be closely included during the procedure for maintaining the accurate and optimum procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the operating room, patients were connected to standard monitors including pulse oximetry,&#xD;
      ECG, non-invasive blood pressure, and temperature monitoring prior to administering&#xD;
      premedication drugs. Then, 2 mg of midazolam and 50 μg fentanyl were injected intravenously 3&#xD;
      min prior to the procedure. In a group, II (NPA group), when the patient sedated with&#xD;
      midazolam and fentanyl, a well-lubricated uncuffed tube (Portex®) 7.0 for male and 6.5 for&#xD;
      female) was inserted nasally and advanced until the tip stands just above the opening of the&#xD;
      larynx and then connected to a source of oxygen. After a period of 2-3 min of preoxygenation,&#xD;
      the patient was anesthetized with total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) using propofol and&#xD;
      remifentanil infusion. The anesthesia resident trainee was asked to use a fiberoptic&#xD;
      bronchoscope (Karl Storz® Intubation fiberscope 11301 BN1) to pass it through a cuffed&#xD;
      endotracheal tube (ETT), visualize the vocal cords, pass through the glottic aperture and&#xD;
      then pass the ETT over the fiberoptic bronchoscope. The correct ETT placement was confirmed&#xD;
      by visualization of the carina and tracheal rings and bilateral equal air entry. The same&#xD;
      scenario was done by the resident trainee in group I but without using the NPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time of fiberscope insertion and intubation and the number of attempts were recorded.&#xD;
      Hemodynamic and respiratory changes (HR, MAP, SpO2, and ETCo2) were recorded at 3 points; at&#xD;
      the baseline before induction of anesthesia, during insertion of the scope (two minutes after&#xD;
      induction of anesthesia), and after FOI (two minutes after securing ETT). Any adverse events&#xD;
      were also recorded as sore throat, PONV, dental trauma,...etc. If necessary, facilitating&#xD;
      techniques like jaw thrusts were used.&#xD;
