  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total joint replacement (TJR) is an increasing effective procedure in orthopedics. However,&#xD;
      TJR failure due to aseptic or septic loosening remains an important problem, often due to&#xD;
      predisposing factors of the patient, which determine the need to perform a revision surgery.&#xD;
      In light of the recent conclusions emerged on the still open problems concerning the&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy of serum and synovial fluid markers in the diagnosis of peri-prosthetic&#xD;
      joint infection (PJI), the project aims at evaluating the diagnostic accuracy and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of the combination of serum and/or synovial markers in the diagnosis of&#xD;
      PJI. Through a diagnostic clinical study on patients hospitalized for revision surgery the&#xD;
      project would provide evidences on the potentiality of the combination of some markers in&#xD;
      accelerating the PJI diagnosis for the best selection of surgical strategy, choosing the&#xD;
      suitable cutoff thresholds to mitigate the effect of some factors on markers' discriminatory&#xD;
      capability.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total joint arthroplasties (TJA) are constantly increasing in older and multi-morbid&#xD;
      patients; knee and hip joints are the most frequently treated due to high incidence of&#xD;
      osteoarthritis in these joints. The indication to TJA is now extended to younger and active&#xD;
      patients with high functional demands and longer life expectancy. Because of these, an&#xD;
      increase in revision surgeries and a PJI risk is also expected. The type of revision surgery&#xD;
      (RS) approach and of antimicrobial treatments is based on the presence or absence of&#xD;
      infection: one-stage revision with maintenance/replacement of prosthesis in combination with&#xD;
      debridement and irrigation (aseptic RS); and two-stage revision with prosthesis removal,&#xD;
      debridement and irrigation, the possible use of a temporary spacer, and the potential&#xD;
      reimplantation after weeks or months (septic RS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, PJI remains an important dangerous and devastating complication; it has been reported&#xD;
      for hip and knee joints an incidence of 0.2-1.5%, prosthesis failure of 15-25%, revision&#xD;
      success rate of 80-95% and annual cost per infection of $20,000-$40,000. The timely and most&#xD;
      accurate diagnosis is essential for the correct treatment of PJI as patients undergoing&#xD;
      revision need extensive physical, psychological and economic supports. Following the&#xD;
      definition and standardization of diagnostic major and minor criteria for PJI by the&#xD;
      Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) an improvement in the diagnosis and treatment of PJI&#xD;
      was observed. Recently, the International Consensus Group on PJI revised MSIS criteria&#xD;
      defining that patients should be considered to have PJI in the presence of one of the major&#xD;
      criteria or three of five minor criteria. Finally, an evidence-based and validated criteria&#xD;
      for hip and knee PJI definition to diagnose patients within the preoperative period was&#xD;
      published in 2018. Patients with an aggregate score of more than or equal to 6 are considered&#xD;
      infected, while a 2-5 score requires the inclusion of intraoperative findings (positive&#xD;
      histology, purulence and single positive culture) for confirming or refuting the diagnosis. A&#xD;
      4-5 score is inconclusive, and a score of less than or equal to 3 is not infected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the last International Consensus Meeting on Musculoskeletal Infection, various&#xD;
      questions on PJI were discussed and among them the working groups (WG) provided&#xD;
      recommendations based on limited (4 - due to small numbers) and moderate (12 and 19) levels&#xD;
      of evidence: WG4, on which patient-specific factors influence the thresholds for serum and&#xD;
      synovial markers in acute and chronic PJI; WG12, on which serum tests have the best&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy for PJI and if the combination of any number of tests increase the&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy; WG19, if the profile of organisms causing surgical site infection or PJI&#xD;
      following orthopaedic procedures changed over recent years. The WG4 highlighted that no&#xD;
      inflammatory arthritis (IA)-specific factors are known to influence the thresholds for serum&#xD;
      and synovial markers in PJIs. It appears that in IA patients there are overlaps in values of&#xD;
      synovial markers such as alphadefensin, white blood cell count (sWBC) and C-reactive protein&#xD;
      (CRP), limiting their usefulness in differentiating septic from aseptic patients. The WG12&#xD;
      stated that it is evident that diagnosis of PJI cannot be based solely on serological tests&#xD;
      and that CRP and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are well-researched screening tests and&#xD;
      have high sensitivity when used alone. However, the combination of serological tests has&#xD;
      shown to improve diagnostic accuracy, but the identification of the optimal combination needs&#xD;
      further investigations. Finally, the WG19 recommended to perform further investigations&#xD;
      regarding the profile of microorganism with next generation sequencing (NGS), as it may&#xD;
      confer significant antibiotic selection implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among pre-operative test on synovial fluid, alpha-defensin showed the highest degree of&#xD;
      accuracy in the diagnosis of PJI when measured by laboratory-based immunoassay rather than&#xD;
      lateral flow test, suggesting that care must be taken with interpretation of the lateral flow&#xD;
      test when relying on its results for the intra-operative diagnosis. Synovial fluid could be&#xD;
      tested for other newly markers such calprotectin and cathelicidin LL-37, whose sensitivity&#xD;
      and specifity are to be defined or for microbiological tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Synovial fluid analysis for WBC and %PMN has high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing&#xD;
      PJI, and it represents an easy and widespread available method. Our meta-analysis evaluated:&#xD;
      1) accuracy in terms of sensitivity and specificity of synovial fluid WBC and %PMN tests in&#xD;
      the diagnosis of PJI after total knee (TKA) and hip (THA) arthroplasty; 2) which test yielded&#xD;
      superior test performance; and 3) the influence of study characteristics such as anatomic&#xD;
      site and threshold value on the diagnostic accuracy of these tests. The meta-analysis results&#xD;
      revealed that both synovial fluid WBC and %PMN have a high specificity and sensitivity in&#xD;
      detecting PJI, and no clear superiority of one test over the other exists. In addition, an&#xD;
      anatomic site effect was demonstrated on sensitivity of synovial fluid %PMN, suggesting that&#xD;
      cutoff thresholds should be identified separately for TKA and THA. The differences in bearing&#xD;
      surfaces and the possibility of fretting corrosion in dual taper stem designs might&#xD;
      substantially alter automated synovial fluid analysis in THA compared to TKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the project is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness of the&#xD;
      combination of serum and/or synovial markers in the pre- or intraoperative (lateral flow&#xD;
      test)/post- diagnosis of PJI. To such purpose a clinical diagnostic study on patients&#xD;
      hospitalized for revision surgery based on the guidelines of MSIS will be carried out; the&#xD;
      combinations of two or more markers with the highest diagnostic accuracies will be identified&#xD;
      and evaluated in term of cost-effectiveness towards individual markers whose thresholds are&#xD;
      based on the MSIS 2013 ICM. The significance of this research is to provide evidences on the&#xD;
      potentiality of the combination of some markers in accelerating the PJI diagnosis for the&#xD;
      best selection of surgical strategy to be followed. A prompt diagnosis and recognition of the&#xD;
      etiological agent are crucial to define the appropriate antimicrobial therapy and to reduce&#xD;
      to a minimum the cases of erroneous diagnosis and of consequent erroneous surgical conduct,&#xD;
      with the need for subsequent re-operations, and multiplication of risk for patients and of&#xD;
      costs for the health care system.&#xD;
