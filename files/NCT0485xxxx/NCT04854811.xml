      The aim of the current project is to validate the effects of chronic rolflumilast treatment&#xD;
      (12 weeks) on cognitive functions (i.e. episodic memory) by means of behavioral tasks, in&#xD;
      people suffering from cognitive impairments at least 1 year after stroke. Secondarily, the&#xD;
      effects of roflumilast on daily activities and well-being will be assessed.&#xD;

      Rationale: In the Netherlands there are about 400.000 people who suffer from long-term&#xD;
      consequences of a stroke. In the first months, spontaneous neurological recovery can take&#xD;
      place, but there is hardly any functional recovery found one year after a stroke. About 40%&#xD;
      of these patients indicate that one of the greatest problems they are facing is the&#xD;
      impairment in cognitive functions, which also seems to be predictive for the disease outcome.&#xD;
      Currently, the main focus of helping these patients is helping them to cope with and adapt to&#xD;
      the new situation. There is a great medical need to actually improve cognitive functions in&#xD;
      people that still suffer from persistent cognitive impairments one year after a stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Animal studies have shown that the enzyme phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) plays an important&#xD;
      role in the brain, as it has been shown to be critically linked to neuronal plasticity.&#xD;
      Although animal studies may not always predict effects in humans, there is a strong case that&#xD;
      PDE4 inhibition may also work in humans. Researchers from Maastricht University, and others,&#xD;
      have shown that the PDE4 inhibitor roflumilast improved memory performance in old healthy&#xD;
      participants and in schizophrenic patients. This is a proof of concept that PDE4 inhibition&#xD;
      can improve memory performance in humans. A logical next step is to test if roflumilast can&#xD;
      improve cognitive functioning and daily life activities in people suffering from cognitive&#xD;
      problems more than one year after stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The objective is to validate the effects of chronic roflumilast treatment on&#xD;
      cognitive function (i.e. episodic memory) by means of behavioral tasks, in people suffering&#xD;
      from cognitive impairments at least 1 year after stroke. Secondary, the effects of&#xD;
      roflumilast on daily activities and well-being will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The first phase of study will be conducted according to a double-blind,&#xD;
      randomized placebo-controlled, between-subjects design. In a second phase, the placebo group&#xD;
      will be given the opportunity to receive roflumilast. This is an open label design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 100 female and male, people (41-70 years old) suffering from cognitive&#xD;
      complaints 1 year after stroke will be recruited via advertisements via social media and via&#xD;
      local caretaking organizations (e.g., SGL, Adelante).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The study will consist of 2 arms (N = 50 per arm): placebo and 100 Î¼g&#xD;
      roflumilast. The duration of treatment is planned for 3 months and participants will be&#xD;
      tested at baseline, after 1.5 months, after 3 months. The participants will also do daily&#xD;
      computer games to stimulate their brain function. The roflumilast group will be tested 3&#xD;
      months treatment stopped to test if the effects last after treatment is discontinued. After&#xD;
      the end of the 3 months-intervention period, the participants of the placebo group will be&#xD;
      identified and they will be asked whether they would like to take roflumilast for a 3-month&#xD;
      period. This will give information as to the roflumilast effects in an open label setting.&#xD;
      Moreover, this gives the participants in the placebo group the opportunity to receive the&#xD;
      active treatment (if they wish).&quot;&#xD;
