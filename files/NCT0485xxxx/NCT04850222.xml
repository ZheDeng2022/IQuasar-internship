  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Musculoskeletal trauma is one of the leading causes of disability in the United States and&#xD;
      its negative quality of life impact extends beyond that of physical recovery. More than 50%&#xD;
      of victims of musculoskeletal trauma suffer lasting mental health issues following their&#xD;
      injury. These symptoms can develop across all spectrums of patients with a variety of injury&#xD;
      severities. Previously, this research team developed a ten-step program with the aim of&#xD;
      developing fostering coping mechanisms in trauma patients. We were unable to demonstrate a&#xD;
      measurable benefit to their mental health or physical function. This has been mirrored in&#xD;
      other studies as well; talk therapy and support groups are not a strong enough intervention&#xD;
      for some patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that a subset of the trauma population would benefit from medical treatment&#xD;
      for their depressive and anxious symptoms in the early recovery period. Given the limited&#xD;
      resources of mental health systems, it would be ideal for their surgical providers to be able&#xD;
      to manage safely their post-injury mental health issues during their surgical follow up. This&#xD;
      is a pragmatic pilot study to develop an effective, acceptable, time-limited treatment&#xD;
      strategy that could be safely implemented by non-mental health care providers for victims of&#xD;
      musculoskeletal trauma.&#xD;

      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over 50% of victims of musculoskeletal trauma suffer prolonged depressive and anxious&#xD;
      symptomology following their initial injury. This is an independent risk factor for prolonged&#xD;
      mental and physical disability. In previous research by the study team in orthopedic trauma&#xD;
      patients without previous diagnosis of psychiatric illness, we have demonstrated 28% of these&#xD;
      patients had depressive symptomology and 40% had anxiety symptomology 3 months following&#xD;
      their traumatic injury. [1] Mental health resources are limited, placing the bulk of patient&#xD;
      care on the orthopedic surgeons and primary care physicians. Support groups, self-help&#xD;
      programs and talk therapy, while valuable, have not demonstrated measurable efficacy for this&#xD;
      patient population. We hypothesize that a subset of the trauma population would benefit from&#xD;
      medical treatment for their depressive and anxious symptoms in the early recovery period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Evaluate the efficacy of immediate Fluoxetine therapy versus standard of care Calcium&#xD;
      treatment in improving mental health and wellbeing in the post-injury period for patients&#xD;
      with musculoskeletal trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Patients randomized to Fluoxetine will have less severe depression, anxiety and&#xD;
      post-traumatic stress symptoms than those treated with calcium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Patients &gt;18 years of age admitted to UF Health with extremity fracture(s)&#xD;
      resulting from high energy trauma (more than ground level fall) will be enrolled during their&#xD;
      index hospitalization. Baseline mental well-being surveys will be obtained (Table 1) and&#xD;
      patients will be randomized to calcium supplementation or Fluoxetine. The medications will be&#xD;
      started during the hospitalization and prescribed upon discharge. The patient will be&#xD;
      followed in the orthopedic clinic on a standard of care post-operative schedule (2 weeks, 3&#xD;
      months, 6 months, and 12 months). Serial mental well-being surveys will be administered at&#xD;
      these time points. Post-operative complications such as infection, nonunion or any other&#xD;
      reason for return to the operating room will be tracked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Develop a safe Fluoxetine treatment protocol with a goal to be therapeutic by 6 weeks&#xD;
      and taper completely off of treatment by 6-12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: We will be able to develop a standardized, time-limited protocol that could&#xD;
      feasibly be utilized by non-mental health providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Dr. Barbosa De Faria will monitor symptoms and side effects of the Fluoxetine&#xD;
      treatment study arm. Any evidence of escalation of depressive or suicidal ideology in either&#xD;
      study population will result in immediate psychiatric treatment. Common side effects,&#xD;
      medication adherence and appropriate discontinuation will be tracked. Patient reported pain&#xD;
      scales will be obtained at each clinic visit as well as documentation of narcotic and&#xD;
      cannabis pain treatment during recovery. Patients will be informed of the finite nature of&#xD;
      the medical management. We will assess how many patients in the Fluoxetine arm report&#xD;
      worsening of symptomology after the cessation of therapy at 9 months and how many seek&#xD;
      continued management.&#xD;
