    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial finds the best dose of selinexor and its effect with pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      treating patients with urothelial carcinoma that are not eligible to receive the chemotherapy&#xD;
      drug cisplatin, or have been given cisplatin and the cancer has gotten worse. Patients must&#xD;
      also have urothelial carcinoma that has spread locally, near where it started (locally&#xD;
      advanced), or has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic). Selinexor may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking a protein, called XPO1, that is needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune&#xD;
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. Giving selinexor and pembrolizumab may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of selinexor in combination with&#xD;
      standard-dose pembrolizumab in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma who are&#xD;
      cisplatin-ineligible or platinum-refractory. (Phase Ib) II. To determine the objective&#xD;
      response rate (ORR) of selinexor in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced&#xD;
      urothelial carcinoma who are cisplatin-ineligible or platinum-refractory. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To further evaluate the toxicity profile of the combination of selinexor with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To further evaluate the efficacy of the combination of selinexor with pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma as defined by progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;
