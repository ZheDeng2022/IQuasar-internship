  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lid cleansing is the standard regime that is recommended for the management of blepharitis in&#xD;
      the UK and beyond. Whilst many successful commercial preparations exist, and some with&#xD;
      clinical evidence, professional guidelines (UK Royal College of Ophthalmologists, UK College&#xD;
      of Optometrists, AAO, etc.) continue to advocate the use of a diluted solution of baby&#xD;
      shampoo, despite no clinical evidence of its safety, tolerance or long term effectiveness,&#xD;
      and despite a statement form the manufacturers that it should not be used for this purpose.&#xD;
      Where licensed, registered products exist it seems bizarre that we have this situation, but a&#xD;
      Cochrane review from 2012 indicated that only a longitudinal, randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      against baby shampoo would alter their conclusions. Whilst that sort of clinical study is&#xD;
      possible, it is proposed here to start with a short-term study to look at the immediate&#xD;
      changes induced in the tear film and ocular surface when comparing baby shampoo with&#xD;
      Blephasol solution, in a blind, randomized controlled trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aims/Key Questions: The hypothesis is: Diluted baby shampoo is more disruptive and&#xD;
      deleterious to the human tear film and ocular surface than Blephaclean solution. It is&#xD;
      expected that there will be a clinically meaningful difference (approximately 30%) in the&#xD;
      non-invasive tear-break up time after the application of baby shampoo compared to&#xD;
      Blephaclean.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential outcomes: To raise awareness that the safety profile of baby shampoo is&#xD;
      insufficient to make it a professional and ethical recommendation for daily lid hygiene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: All subjects will be recruited from the staff and student population of the&#xD;
      Faculty of Health and Human Sciences, Plymouth University as well as patients of The Centre&#xD;
      for Eyecare Excellence (CEE) and Well-being centre (WBC) at Plymouth University. The&#xD;
      recruitment will be carried out via email, flyers and direct invitation. After the first&#xD;
      contact, the information sheet, as well as the informed contents, will be sent, or a printed&#xD;
      version will be given to all potential subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This prospective study is a two-visit, prospective, cross-sectional, double-blinded&#xD;
      and randomized controlled trial. The basic population is described as a healthy UK population&#xD;
      with diverse ethnic backgrounds and physiological variation. The principal investigator will&#xD;
      carry out the data collection at the Peninsula Allied Health Centre, CEE or WBC (Plymouth&#xD;
      University). Ethical approval was grantet. This study conforms to the ethical principles of&#xD;
      the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and Plymouth&#xD;
      University's Principles for Research Involving Human Participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations were performed for detecting differences between two dependent&#xD;
      not-normally distributed means. A maximum effect size (NIK-BUT difference after the&#xD;
      application of baby shampoo compared to Blephaclean) of 0.4 is expected with alpha=0.05 and&#xD;
      beta=0.20 (80% power). A sample size of 52 will be required. If considering potential&#xD;
      dropouts, the study will aim to recruit 60 subjects. The effect size was calculated based on&#xD;
      the distribution of the NIK-BUT in healthy eyes (Abdelfattah et al. 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure: The non-invasive Keratograph (tear film) break-up time (NIK-BUT) is&#xD;
      defined as the primary outcome parameter for the present study. The NIKBUT is defined as the&#xD;
      interval between the last complete blink and the first appearance of a dry spot, or&#xD;
      disruption in the tear film detected automatically by the Keratograph 5M (in seconds).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation Method: The choice of the eye side, as well as the first cleansing product,&#xD;
      will be randomised to minimise investigator bias. Block-wise randomisation is chosen to&#xD;
      guarantee an equal group size. The block size is calculated with m = 2n (n means a number of&#xD;
      possible groups) per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject History &amp; Study Eligibility (Fig. 1 - 1 &amp; 2): Before determining study eligibility&#xD;
      for each subject, the information sheet and the informed content will be handed out to the&#xD;
      patient subject again. During recruitment potential subjects will also be given the&#xD;
      information sheet. This will ensure that the participant has had sufficient time to&#xD;
      understand the study and make an informed decision about participating in the study. Eligible&#xD;
      subjects will be allowed to continue. Non-eligible subjects will be dismissed at this time.&#xD;
      Subjects will have procedures performed on both eyes. Testing order was designed to&#xD;
      sequentially administer the least invasive test to the most invasive test. This methodology&#xD;
      will ensure that a previous procedure will have a minimal effect on all subsequent&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual Acuity with height and low contrast: The investigator will measure the subject's&#xD;
      visual acuity (VA) on a calibrated LogMAR chart at 100% contrast and FrACT for low contrast&#xD;
      VA. If the patient is unable to read the 6/12 letters monocular, the investigator will&#xD;
      pinhole over the patient's unaided or presenting refractive error correction to determine the&#xD;
      subject's visual potential. After finishing both eyes separately, the visual acuity will be&#xD;
      examined binocularly with the same procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires: Subjects will be asked to complete the OSDI and McMonnies questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tear film &amp; ocular surface assessment: The tear film will be examined with the Oculus&#xD;
      Keratograph 5M from Oculus Optikger√§te GmbH (following K5M). This will include automatic&#xD;
      assessments of the Non-Invasive Keratograph Break-Up time (NIKBUT), the tear meniscus height,&#xD;
      lipid layer assessment, tear flow and bulbar (conjunctival) redness. Additionally, the K5M&#xD;
      will also be used to assess corneal and conjunctiva staining. For assessing bulbar and&#xD;
      palpebral conjunctival staining a sterile Lissamine green strip will be wet with sterile&#xD;
      saline and applied to the superior bulbar conjunctiva.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lid cleansing procedure: One investigator will prepare the products such that the principal&#xD;
      investigator and the participant are masked. The Principal investigator will apply the&#xD;
      product to the upper and lower lid areas and margins, using standard techniques. One eye will&#xD;
      be treated using Blephaclean the other eye will be treated using baby shampoo, randomised for&#xD;
      visit 1 and visit 2. The Principal investigator needs to apply and gently massage foam from&#xD;
      one bottle onto the periocular skin of the closed superior and inferior eyelids of the&#xD;
      designated eye with clean fingertips for one minute before rinsing with water, and to take&#xD;
      care to avoid the transfer of residual products to the fellow eye during cleansing and&#xD;
      drying. The Principal investigator has to avoid direct contact with the ocular surface, and&#xD;
      to clean their hands prior to using the second treatment for the fellow eye, in order to&#xD;
      prevent cross contamination.&#xD;
