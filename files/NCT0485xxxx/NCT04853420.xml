  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The NHS' Genomic Medicine Service offers whole genome sequencing as part of the drive to&#xD;
      improve cancer outcomes. It is recognised that actionable mutations (current and emerging),&#xD;
      will ultimately improve outcomes across multiple disease sites by identifying which&#xD;
      treatments may benefit individual patients the most, and by providing earlier and more&#xD;
      accurate diagnoses. However, testing in the cancer setting is currently limited to&#xD;
      haematological malignancies and sarcoma. The majority of patients with solid tumours do not&#xD;
      yet have access to this platform and the benefits that it may bring. Therefore, expanding&#xD;
      genomic testing capacity within a research setting has potential to benefit those patients&#xD;
      that would otherwise not be able to access testing. In this study we will be using tissue&#xD;
      derived from patients undergoing surgery for cancer to validate an in-house genomic testing&#xD;
      platform against Roche's Foundation Medicine genomic profile service, which is an FDA-&#xD;
      approved commercial platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, two blood samples will be taken in order that we can test whether markers&#xD;
      present in the tissue may also be seen in blood. We hope that this will help us monitor&#xD;
      minimal residual disease in patients, allowing earlier detection of relapse/recurrence than&#xD;
      radiology currently allows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may also agree to donate optional excess fresh tissue from their surgery. This will&#xD;
      be integrated with other laboratory platforms which may offer information on prospective drug&#xD;
      response based on genotypic profiles (e.g., patient-derived explants).&#xD;

        Trial participants will consist of patients with solid tumours that have a high likelihood&#xD;
        of rapid post-surgical relapse. Such tumours types typically include gastroesophageal,&#xD;
        gastrointestinal cancers and colorectal liver metastases, but other malignancies will also&#xD;
        be considered.&#xD;
