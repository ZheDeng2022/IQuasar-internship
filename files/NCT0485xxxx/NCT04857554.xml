    <textblock>
      This study aimed at 1. to determine the glycemic index and glycemic load of three sugar-free&#xD;
      products with added sweeteners: apricot jam, cranberry cereal bar, and cocoa drink, and 2. to&#xD;
      investigate the effects of these products on the postprandial glycemic response in healthy&#xD;
      subjects&#xD;

    <description>Twelve healthy, normal weight subjects (male: 6, female: 6) after 10-14 hr fast, consumed 25g available carbohydrate from D-glucose, three times, in different weeks as reference food along with 250ml water; and 25g available carbohydrates from white bread, white bread and apricot jam, cereal bar with cranberries, and cocoa drink, tested once, in different weeks along with 250ml water or 500ml fat-free milk for the cocoa drink. Fingertip capillary blood glucose samples were taken at baseline, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120min. The first glucose sample was taken exactly 15min after the first bite of food or drink.</description>
