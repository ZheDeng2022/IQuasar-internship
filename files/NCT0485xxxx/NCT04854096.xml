    <textblock>
      This study will enroll male and female subjects who are 18 years of age or older with Primary&#xD;
      Myelofibrosis, post-polycythemia Vera Myelofibrosis, or post-essential Thrombocythemia&#xD;
      Myelofibrosis with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;50,000/µL) including subjects&#xD;
      with intermediate-2 or high-risk MF according to the Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring&#xD;
      System (DIPSS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NS-018 will be self-administered orally at a dose of 300 mg BID. The BAT will be administered&#xD;
      according to manufacturer's instructions and Investigator discretion. Subjects will complete&#xD;
      study visits at Screening, Day 1 and Day 15 of Cycle 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and Day 1 of every&#xD;
      cycle thereafter. At these visits, blood/urine sampling, spleen measurements, bone marrow&#xD;
      assessments, patient-reported outcome (PRO) assessments, and safety assessments may be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
