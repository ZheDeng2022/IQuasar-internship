  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Black family caregivers of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and/or related dementias&#xD;
      (ADRD), have an increased mortality risk related to pre-existing health conditions and&#xD;
      stress. Targeted, culturally responsive, health interventions that help Black ADRD caregivers&#xD;
      to effectively manage their own health and use community preferenced ways of coping, can&#xD;
      improve caregivers' overall health, perceived ability to provide care for a person with ADRD&#xD;
      (self-efficacy), and increases the likelihood that they will experience benefits from&#xD;
      caregiving. This clinical trial pilot will test the feasibility of a community based&#xD;
      intervention designed to improve health outcomes for Black family caregivers of persons with&#xD;
      ADRD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed intervention is a telephonically-based support program that will follow a peer&#xD;
      supportive model to engage small groups of caregivers over 12 weeks. During each week of the&#xD;
      intervention, participants (n = 36, 4/ group) will engage in a small facilitator lead,&#xD;
      support group. Each week, caregivers will be provided with a different culturally relevant&#xD;
      caregiving or personal health strategy to practice. During the weekly support calls, a&#xD;
      facilitator will provide an overview of the content covered and each participant will have&#xD;
      the opportunity to discuss their past week and how they engaged the weekly strategy or found&#xD;
      barriers to it. The format will be structured enough to ensure that content is covered and&#xD;
      everyone is able to be equally engaged while flexible enough that caregivers can receive&#xD;
      support in the areas they need. A battery of assessment measures will be taken prior to the&#xD;
      start of the intervention, halfway through at 6 weeks, at 12 weeks, 30 days following the&#xD;
      intervention, and then 6 months following the intervention.&#xD;

    <description>Caregiver self-efficacy will be measured by the Revised Scale for Caregiving Self-Efficacy, which evaluates the caregivers' ability to obtain respite care, respond to disruptive behaviors, and control one's own upsetting thoughts about caregiving. Scoring is collected across three separate domains including ability to obtain respite, control upsetting thoughts, and responding to disruptive behaviors. Scoring measures self-reported from 0-100%</description>
