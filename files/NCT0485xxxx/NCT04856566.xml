  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol and Cannabis (CNB) are two of the most widely used intoxicants. The effects of&#xD;
      driving while intoxicated on alcohol are well documented, resulting in numerous drunken&#xD;
      driving laws and regulations. As CNB begins to be decriminalized, medical CNB use allowed in&#xD;
      multiple U.S. states, and perception of harmfulness falls, CNB use is predicted to rise and&#xD;
      it will become increasingly common to publicly encounter persons who recently used the drug.&#xD;
      An area of potentially high concern is if ever-greater numbers of CNB users and its&#xD;
      legalization will increase the risk of driving while intoxicated from recent CNB use, thereby&#xD;
      increasing the risks to public safety. This study aims to examine the combined effects of&#xD;
      smoking marijuana and drinking alcohol on simulated driving.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol is one of the most widely used substances. The effects of driving while intoxicated&#xD;
      are well documented, leading to laws and regulations behind drunk driving. Marijuana is also&#xD;
      a commonly abused drug. Marijuana use is not specific to social class, is linked to cognitive&#xD;
      impairment and may be the cause of intoxication-induced accidents. The effects of marijuana&#xD;
      intoxication on driving impairments are less documented. Data is being gathered in regards to&#xD;
      this risk from our Neuroscience of Marijuana Impaired Driving study. The principle&#xD;
      investigator's previous research includes the Brain and Alcohol Research with College&#xD;
      Students (BARCS) study along with additional epidemiological studies reveal that most&#xD;
      marijuana smokers also consume alcohol when they are intoxicated. These drugs interact&#xD;
      pharmacodynamically and change each other's levels in the user's blood. They both have&#xD;
      deleterious effects on driving. These effects are not additive but rather multiplicative.&#xD;
      Someone using both substances will show more deleterious effects than someone using just one&#xD;
      of these substances. This study will aim to investigate the brain and behavior in the same&#xD;
      individuals, using a similar design to the NHTSA: Examine the Feasibility of a Standardized&#xD;
      Field Test for Marijuana Impairment study. This structure coupled with past alcohol driving&#xD;
      studies (Marijauna and Alcohol Impaired Driving) uses similar techniques of other measures of&#xD;
      drunk driving. We hypothesize that alcohol and marijuana use combined will lead to greater&#xD;
      impairment in a simulated driving task, as well as other driving related cognitive&#xD;
      impairments. This study will aim to study feasible roadside sobriety tests for marijuana&#xD;
      impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of 5 days (screening visit and 4 dose visit days). In a randomized,&#xD;
      counterbalanced, double-blind study, investigators will dose participants with alcohol to a&#xD;
      legal amount of 0.05% blood alcohol content on 3 study days and dose to 0.08% blood alcohol&#xD;
      content on 1 study day. Then investigators will administer high THC marijuana, low THC&#xD;
      marijuana or placebo marijuana using paced inhalation through a vaporizer. Participants will&#xD;
      include 12 regular alcohol consumers aged 21 to 40 years of age; all participants must report&#xD;
      smoking and drinking together. Following this dosing, investigators will assess impairment&#xD;
      through cognitive testing as well as a simulated driving test and neuropsychological tests.&#xD;
      Samples of blood will also be collected at multiple time points throughout the study visits&#xD;
      to be measured for THC concentration and its metabolites. This allows clarification between&#xD;
      the relationship of impairment, as well as subjective and objective intoxication, and levels&#xD;
      of THC and it's metabolites in the users system.&#xD;

These tasks include a Reaction Time/Decision Making/DAT in which the subject has to press in two different locations on the Ipod screen dependent on which target shape appeared. The second task is a Reaction Time/Time Estimation/DAT task in which the subjects has to internally count up to 60 seconds while also touching the screen each time a target shape appears on the screen. The third task is a Motor Tracking/DAT tasks in which the subject must keep their finger on a moving circle on the screen. The last task is a balance task in which the subject is told to stand on one foot with the Ipod in an opposite hand keeping it as still as possible.</description>
