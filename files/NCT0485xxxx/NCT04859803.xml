  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rhomboid intercostal block (RIB) can provide good analgesia effects after thoracic&#xD;
      surgery . The ultrasound-guided RIB is novel analgesic techniques recently described by&#xD;
      Elsharkawy et al. . Additionally, the RISS block anesthetizes the lateral cutaneous branches&#xD;
      of the thoracic intercostal nerves and can be used in multiple clinical settings for chest&#xD;
      wall and upper abdominal analgesia. However, the analgesic effects of the RISS block after&#xD;
      breast surgery have not been analyzed through a randomized-controlled trial.&#xD;

    <description>Following endotracheal intubation, patients allotted to the RIB group were positioned in the lateral decubitus position with the chest on the operating side lying superiorly. The ipsilateral arm was abducted from the chest to move the scapula laterally. The RIB was performed as described previously [8]. A high-frequency (6-12 MHz) linear ultrasound probe (LOGIQ e ultrasonic system, Deutschland GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Solingen, Germany) was placed medial to the medial border of the scapula in the oblique sagittal plane. The landmarks, i.e., the trapezius muscle, rhomboid muscle, intercostal muscles, pleura, and lung, were identified in the ultrasound. Under aseptic conditions, an 80-mm 21-gauge needle was inserted at the level of T6-7 in the ultrasound view. A single dose of 30 ml 0.25% bupivacaine will be injected in the interfascial plane between the rhomboid major and intercostal muscles. The spread of the local anesthetic solution under the rhomboid muscle was visualized by ultrasonography.</description>
