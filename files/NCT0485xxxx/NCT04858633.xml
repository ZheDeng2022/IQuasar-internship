  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 affected more than 9 million of people with more than 130 thousand death in India.&#xD;
      If adequate preventive and therapeutic measures are not taken, India has very high risk of&#xD;
      affecting million of more people with high mortality because of the large population along&#xD;
      with very high population density. At present there are no definitive therapeutic drugs or&#xD;
      vaccine available for the treatment and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Symptomatic and&#xD;
      supportive care are being given to COVID-19 cases along with isolation and quarantine measure&#xD;
      are being taken for the suspected individual at risk for COVID-19 to limit the spread of the&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection . Among the all the drugs being used for the treatment of COVID-19,&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), has given some rays of hope to battle against this deadly pandemic.&#xD;
      HCQ has some anti viral effect against SARS-CoV in vitro. HCQ is quite safe and being used in&#xD;
      rheumatology patients for lifelong without much side effect, so it allow for higher dose&#xD;
      without any significant side effects and drug-drug interaction. Recently published clinical&#xD;
      trial suggested HCQ can be used for the therapeutic purpose of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and&#xD;
      many governments have endorsed that due to lack of any other better alternative drugs. Indian&#xD;
      council of medical research (ICMR) has advised for HCQ prophylaxis for the people who are at&#xD;
      risk for developing SARS-CoV-2 infection, all asymptomatic health care workers involved in&#xD;
      taking care of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases and all asymptomatic household contacts&#xD;
      of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases. With this encouragement an open level clinical trial&#xD;
      was conducted on HCQ as post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for the prevention of COVID-19 in&#xD;
      asymptomatic high risk house hold contact of the laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases. The&#xD;
      result was very promising showing absolute risk reduction of around 9% in participant who&#xD;
      received PEP with HCQ as compared to the control group and there was no serious adverse&#xD;
      event. But there is still conflicting scientific data to prove or disprove the efficacy of&#xD;
      HCQ for the treatment and prophylaxis for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Being a tertiary care center&#xD;
      PGIMER is catering many states which include Punjab, hariyana, himachal Pradesh, Uttara&#xD;
      khand, Uttar Pradesh. This put the institute to handle highest burden of suspected cases of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 in northern India. So, this double blind clinical trial has been planned to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of HCQ as PEP for the prevention of COVID-19 in asymptomatic&#xD;
      individuals who are at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The asymptomatic individual with direct contact with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases will&#xD;
      be randomized into one PEP group and one control/placebo group as per inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Individual who will not give consent for HCQ prophylaxis and those with&#xD;
      contraindication for HCQ therapy like, hypersensitivity to HCQ or 4-aminoquinolone&#xD;
      derivatives, patients with known retionopathy, cardiac arrhythmia, G6PD deficiency, psoriasis&#xD;
      and pregnancy will be excluded from the study. All symptomatic individual and all health care&#xD;
      workers related to suspected or proven COVID-19 and who received CoVID-19 vaccine will be&#xD;
      excluded from the study. The PEP group will receive tablet HCQ 400 mg q 12 hourly on day one&#xD;
      followed by 400 mg once weekly for 3 weeks (total cumulative dose of 2000 mg). The control&#xD;
      group will receive placebo instead of HCQ. Both the groups will receive standard care of&#xD;
      therapy in the form of home quarantine for 2 weeks along with social distancing and personal&#xD;
      hygiene. The participants will be followed up for 4 weeks telephonically or physically as and&#xD;
      when required and will be enquired regarding development of any COVID-19 symptoms like fever,&#xD;
      cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, diarrhoea, myalgia. During follow up nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      swab of the participants will be taken for processing reverse transcription polymerase chain&#xD;
      reaction (RTPCR) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA to confirm the CoVID-19. Samples for&#xD;
      RTPCR will be taken when any asymptomatic participants becomes symptomatic and by the 5-14&#xD;
      days of contact in asymptomatic participants through in-hospital visit at the institute's&#xD;
      COVID-19 screening clinic.&#xD;
