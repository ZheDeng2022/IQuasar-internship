  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of children attending the Glasgow feeding clinic (GFC) which looks&#xD;
      after children with severe feeding problems who commonly have low appetite and extreme&#xD;
      thinness. The investigators want to find out if thin children respond to food in the same&#xD;
      way, using an established method to assess energy compensation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thinness occurs as a result of undereating, but it is not always clear why an individual&#xD;
      child has not eaten enough, or how to get them to eat more. There is a need to understand the&#xD;
      child characteristics that predispose to undereating and the how these operate, in order to&#xD;
      design more effective treatment and prevention programmes. The Glasgow feeding clinic (GFC)&#xD;
      looks after a range of children with severe feeding problems who commonly have low appetite&#xD;
      and extreme thinness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Ghanaian student will come to Glasgow, funded by the Glasgow University /Scottish funding&#xD;
      council Global Challenges Research fund, to learn these techniques to use in future PhD&#xD;
      research. The student will conduct a pilot study of children attending the GFC. The student&#xD;
      will invite 40 families to complete our standardised online questionnaire (ICFET) about their&#xD;
      child's eating behaviour and collate existing growth measurements as well as their feeding&#xD;
      history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standardised energy compensation study will then be undertaken in 20 of the thinnest&#xD;
      children. At two visits at least a week apart, the children will be given one of two similar&#xD;
      tasting drinks in random order, one with very few calories and another with extra, without&#xD;
      them knowing which is which. After 30 minutes they will eat as much as they want of a&#xD;
      standardized lunch. All foods and drinks offered will be weighed before and after, to&#xD;
      calculate the amount of energy eaten in total after the low energy drink, compared to the&#xD;
      high energy drink.&#xD;

    <description>Child will be given a high energy drink: a flavoured high energy milk or juice-based drink, used clinically to supplement the diet of preschool children (either Pediasure plus or Duocal). This will provide 1.5 kcals per ml in various flavours as preferred. The amount given will supply 10% of the child's daily energy requirements per Kg - for example for a 2-year-old child weighing 15 KG this would be 80 mls of drink supplying 120 Kcal.&#xD;
They will be given 10 minutes to drink the preload and 30 minutes after this they will eat lunch containing a range of pre-packaged foods of known energy content suitable for their age, chosen in consultation with the parents.</description>

    <description>Child will be given a low energy drink of the same volume selected to be as similar as possible to the high energy drink, made either of skim milk or sugar free fruit juice, with a similar sugar free flavour; for above example this will supply 25 kcal.&#xD;
They will be given 10 minutes to drink the preload and 30 minutes after this they will eat lunch containing the same range of pre-packaged foods as above.</description>
