  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the efficacy and safety of oral MT-1303 compared to placebo at 12 weeks&#xD;
      as the induction treatment in subjects with active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (UC),&#xD;
      as well as maintenance treatment with open-label MT-1303 for up to 36 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled 3-arm, multi-center,&#xD;
      parallel-group study with an open-label extension (OLE) period. The study includes a&#xD;
      Screening Period (of up to 28 days) and a 12-week Double-Blind Period (Day 1 through Day 85)&#xD;
      for all subjects. Subjects completing the Double-Blind Period through Day 85 will be provided&#xD;
      the opportunity to continue in the OLE Period of the study to receive treatment through&#xD;
      approximately one year. Subjects who do not participate in the OLE Period will be followed&#xD;
      for 84 days in a Safety Follow-up Period.&#xD;

    <description>The modified Mayo Score for ulcerative colitis disease activity provides an assessment of disease severity and can be used to monitor subjects during therapy. Scoring is accomplished by summation of subscores for endoscopic findings, stool frequency, and rectal bleeding, with higher scores indicating worse severity. Each subscore ranges from 0 to 3. The modified Mayo Score is defined as the sum of the endoscopy findings subscore + stool frequency subscore + rectal bleeding subscore, with a range from 0 to 9.</description>

    <description>The modified Mayo Score for ulcerative colitis disease activity provides an assessment of disease severity and can be used to monitor subjects during therapy. Scoring is accomplished by summation of subscores for endoscopic findings, stool frequency, and rectal bleeding, with higher scores indicating worse severity. Each subscore ranges from 0 to 3.&#xD;
Remission is defined as follows:&#xD;
Endoscopy subscore of ≤1 (excludes friability); and&#xD;
Rectal bleeding subscore of 0; and&#xD;
At least one-point decrease in stool frequency subscore from Baseline to achieve a stool frequency subscore of ≤1.</description>
