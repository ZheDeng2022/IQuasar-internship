      The purpose of this study is to investigate and compare the effect of whole-body vibration to&#xD;
      aerobic exercise on inflammatory status in females with premenstrual syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a complex disorder characterized by moderate to severe&#xD;
      symptoms taking place during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. It has a negative&#xD;
      impact on females' lives, which can affect their relationships, educational efficiency,&#xD;
      social activities, and quality of life. Despite previous studies reported that physical&#xD;
      exercise improves the symptoms of PMS, the effects of physical exercise on inflammatory&#xD;
      status in females with PMS are not clear yet. sixty females allocated to three groups&#xD;
      randomly to group (A) that will receive whole-body vibration+supplementation, group (B) that&#xD;
      will receive aerobic exercises+supplementation, and group c that will receive supplementation&#xD;
      only&#xD;

    <time_frame>up to twelve weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The premenstrual syndrome questionnaire also measured the occurrence and severity of two menstrual pain symptoms, including cramp and backache experienced during the first 2 days of the women' last menstrual period. Premenstrual symptoms were scaled as: mild (1); moderate (2); and severe (3). Young women with PMS should experience a premenstrual symptoms score of at least 50% greater than the postmenstrual score</description>

    <description>All participants in the WBV group will perform the WBV training on a vibrating device (Confidence Vibration Plate Power Plus, China), which produces a lateral peak-to-peak oscillation. They will stand on the WBV platform with a 150Â° knee angle during the exposure minute. They started the training with three sets of 1 min separated by a 1-min resting period and vibration amplitude of 1 mm. They will add one set every session until they performed 10 sets of WBV. The frequency started at 20 Hz, which will be increased gradually by 2 Hz every 2 weeks +magnesium (Mg) (250 g) and vitamin B6 supplementation</description>
