  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research will test the efficacy of a weight management intervention through a&#xD;
      three-group randomized trial: mHealth only, mHealth+Community Health Worker (CHW) support,&#xD;
      versus control group, among residents of Boston's public housing developments. The mHealth&#xD;
      group consists of a 1-year text messaging program to promote diet and physical activity&#xD;
      behavior changes and the CHW support consists of monthly phone counseling delivered by a CHW&#xD;
      to support the text messaging program. Our hypothesis is that the mHealth+CHW group will be&#xD;
      more effective in bringing about weight loss compared to mHealth alone or the assessment only&#xD;
      control group. The findings are expected to inform future health promotion efforts among&#xD;
      residents in public housing developments.&#xD;
