    <textblock>
      Lateral elbow pain can be difficult to diagnose because of the different pathologies or&#xD;
      combinations of pathologies that can cause this clinic. Although lateral epicondylitis is the&#xD;
      most common cause of lateral elbow pain, symptoms of radial tunnel syndrome may masquerade as&#xD;
      lateral epicondylitis or they can be seen together with rate of 21-41%. The aim of the study&#xD;
      is; to evaluate the presence of radial tunnel syndrome in the patients who have resistant&#xD;
      lateral epicondylitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lateral epicondylitis (LE), also known as &quot;tennis elbow,&quot; is an overuse syndrome of the&#xD;
      common extensor tendon (CET), predominantly affecting the extensor carpi radialis brevis.&#xD;
      History and physical examination including manual provocation tests are key elements for the&#xD;
      diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound imaging of the CET is an important complementary method to the clinical diagnosis&#xD;
      of LE. It provides information about the severity of the disease with evidence of tendon&#xD;
      thickening, focal/diffuse areas of decreased echogenicity in the tendon, epicondylar cortical&#xD;
      irregularity or spur formation, and increased vascularity in case of local inflammation&#xD;
      depicted by power- Doppler imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radial tunnel syndrome (RTS) is a dynamic/intermittent compression neuropathy of the radial&#xD;
      nerve, where different structures can potentially compress the nerve. Local inflammatory&#xD;
      and/or vascular changes (scarring, fibrosis), which are seen in LE may lead to compression of&#xD;
      the radial nerve or its branches (especially the deep branch) at the radial tunnel. While RTS&#xD;
      can often be the cause of refractory LE, some patients with LE actually have RTS&#xD;
      concomitantly. The diagnosis of RTS is difficult/controversial due to inconclusive findings&#xD;
      on electrophysiological tests and its close relationship with LE. Ultrasound is a superior&#xD;
      imaging modality that can be used as an adjunct to electromyography for the evaluation of&#xD;
      peripheral nerve problems. It can be used to diagnose compression neuropathies and to&#xD;
      identify the entrapment site of the nerve. For the exact diagnosis of RTS complete relief&#xD;
      should be achieved with a nerve block at the radial tunnel. Patients who have RTS coexisting&#xD;
      with LE (18-43%) usually experience incomplete relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is; to evaluate the RTS and LE with physical examination, special&#xD;
      clinical tests, electrophysiological and ultrasonographic examinations and, to confirm the&#xD;
      presence of RTS accompanying LE with the evaluation of clinical findings after the posterior&#xD;
      interosseous nerve and lateral epicondyle diagnostic injections.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, 30 minutes after PIN injection, 30 minutes after lateral epicondyle injection</time_frame>
    <description>Pain of the participants will be assessed by one of the most commonly used pain scale &quot;numerical rating scale&quot;. It is numeric version of visual analog scale in which a patient selects a whole number (0-10 integers) that best reflects the intensity of his/her pain. The 11-point numeric scale ranges from '0' representing &quot;no pain&quot; to '10' representing &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;. Participant is asked to indicate rates of their pain on the day of presentation during resting, during function and physical examination as a baseline and, 30 minutes after PIN injection for each, 30 minutes after lateral apicondyle injection for each.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Handgrip strength was measured by using a Jamar Hand Dynamometer with patients seated, their elbow by their side and flexed to right angles, and a neutral wrist position. Three measurements were performed for both side, and the mean score was recorded (effected site and dominancy were noted)</description>

    <measure>The Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>PRTEE is a validated pain severity and functional disability scale that assesses pain (5 questions graded 0 to 10) and functional disability (10 questions graded 0 to 10). Functional scores are then halved and added to pain scores. The minimum score is 0 (no pain or disability) and the maximum is 100 (severe pain and disability)</description>

    <measure>Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The DASH is a validated questionnaire designed to measure upper limb disability and symptoms. Functional domains include physical, social, and psychological. It uses a single-scale, 30-item questionnaire of upper extremity function and symptoms. The minimum sum score is 30 points; the maximumscore is 150 points</description>

It measures eight scales: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional, and mental health</description>
