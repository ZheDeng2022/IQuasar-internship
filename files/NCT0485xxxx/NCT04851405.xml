    <textblock>
      Falls are a major health care problem for seniors. The Otago Exercise Program, which consists&#xD;
      of strength and balance training delivered by a physiotherapist, can reduce falls in this&#xD;
      population. We will test two methods to deliver the Otago program. These will include a new&#xD;
      coaching approach by a physiotherapist with the use of a Fitbit to provide feedback versus&#xD;
      the traditional delivery. The degree to which the program is delivered as intended by&#xD;
      physiotherapists as well as the number of falls, risk of falling, and participation in&#xD;
      walking activities in older adults will be assessed over 24 months. Lastly, we will assess if&#xD;
      the coaching approach is a cost-effective option.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Falls are a major health care problem for older adults (i.e., those aged ≥ 65 years) and&#xD;
      health care systems. Falls account for 50% of injury-related admissions to hospital, 40% of&#xD;
      admissions to nursing homes, and a 10% increase in home care services. They are also the&#xD;
      leading cause of fatal injury among Canadians over 65 years old. This represents a&#xD;
      significant health burden. Fortunately, falls are preventable. There is strong evidence that&#xD;
      the Otago Exercise Program (OEP), physiotherapist (PT)-led home-based exercise program of&#xD;
      strength and balance training, is effective at preventing falls in older adults with complex&#xD;
      medical conditions. Originally developed in New Zealand the OEP has been implemented&#xD;
      worldwide, but adherence to the program is a challenge. We propose that the suboptimal&#xD;
      adherence is partly due to a lack of focus on behaviour change techniques such as&#xD;
      self-monitoring and action planning in the delivery of OEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use a mixed-methods approach, involving a RCT and in-depth interviews.&#xD;
      The delivery of OEP+ vs OEP, from PTs, and its recipients, the older adults, will be&#xD;
      determined at random. The training for the PT's will be provided by the Centre for&#xD;
      Collaboration Motivation &amp; Innovation (CCMI), a non-profit organization with a mandate to&#xD;
      support the use of behaviour change techniques to improve health care. Prior to data&#xD;
      collection, the PTs will attend a 2-hour workshop on the coaching protocol using the OEP app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this project is to assess OEP+ as an implementation strategy to improve OEP&#xD;
      delivery (by PTs) and adherence (by older adults).&#xD;

    <measure>Physiotherapist-level outcome - Brief Action Planning (BAP) Scores</measure>

    <description>This measure includes 33 items from three domains: 1) BAP content, 2) warmth and tone, and 3) overall interaction quality (total score: 0-35, higher score = better). The scores will be derived from the physiotherapists' sessions with the first, middle (Participant 3 or 4 out of 8) and last older adult participant. The recording from these treatment sessions will be coded and analysed by one of four researchers. The average of BAP scores of the middle and last participants for each PT will be used in the analysis .</description>

    <description>EQ-5D-5L is a generic preference-based utility measure composed of 5 domains of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain, and anxiety/depression). Each domain contains 5 levels, with a '1' indicating no problem and a '5' indicating major problem. The 5 dimensions (i.e., the health state profile) will be converted into a weighted health state utility values between '0' and '1', where '1' represents &quot;perfect health&quot; and '0' represents a health state equivalent to death. Values less than '0' indicate a health state worse than death. These health state utility values will provide weightings for QALYs. We will employ Canadian conversion tariffs for transforming health state profiles into utility scores.</description>
