      The present study is a feasibility study in which we will determine if a mind-body program&#xD;
      that we have previously developed for chronic back pain can improve the multiple somatic&#xD;
      complaints associated with the COVID Long Haul Syndrome.&#xD;

      This study is a pilot and feasibility study to determine if a mind-body program that we have&#xD;
      previously developed for chronic back pain can improve the multiple somatic complaints&#xD;
      associated with the COVID Long Haul Syndrome in patients without evidence of ongoing tissue&#xD;
      injury. We will perform a 12-week intervention consisting of a series of classes which will&#xD;
      focus on knowledge therapy, desensitization, emotional expression, and stress reduction.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, 4, 8, and 13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed using the Somatic Symptom Scale-8 (SSS-8). The minimum score is 0 and the maximum 32, with higher values indicating a worse outcome (more severe symptoms)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4, 8, and 13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). The minimum score is 0 and the maximum is 10, with higher values indicating higher pain.</description>

    <measure>Pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline 4, 8, and 13 weeks</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Bothersomeness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4, 8, and 13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed using a numerical rating scale (0-10). Higher numbers indicate higher pain bothersomeness.</description>

    <measure>Pain-related Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline 4, 8, 13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed using the Pain Anxiety Symptom Scale (PASS). The minimum score is 0 and the maximum 100, with higher values indicating higher pain anxiety</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline 4, 8, 13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). The minimum score is 9 and the maximum 63, with higher scores indicating greater fatigue severity</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dyspnea</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline 4, 8, and 13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed using the Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile (MDP). A1, Scale: Scale about breathing sensations with a defined start- and endpoint (neutral - unbearable). Values reach from 0-10, and higher values represent a worse outcome.&#xD;
SQ1 (sensoric quality), Choice: 5 Phrases and terms about breathing sensations. Choose between yes and no and select one as &quot;most accurately&quot;.&#xD;
SQ2 (sensoric quality), Scales: 5 subscales about intensity of breathing sensations. Values reach from 0 - 10, and higher values represent a worse outcome.&#xD;
A2 (emotional quality), Scales: 5 subscales about emotions. Values reach from 0 - 10, and higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>
