      This trial is part of the European Paediatric Investigational Plan and the US Pediatric Study&#xD;
      Plan and has been developed in line with guidance from the EMA Paediatric Committee and the&#xD;
      US FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will commence with cohort 1 (aged ≥6 and &lt;18 years) and proceed to lower age&#xD;
      groups: cohort 2 (≥3 and &lt;6 years); and, in European sites only, cohort 3 (full-term birth to&#xD;
      &lt;3 years). The Data Monitoring committee (DMC) may convene any time after at least half of&#xD;
      the subjects in cohort 1 or 2 have completed the study, to review PK,safety and efficacy&#xD;
      data. If there are no concerns, the DMC may recommend to initiate concurrent dosing in the&#xD;
      next younger cohort (cohort 2 or 3) in parallel to dosing the remaining subjects in cohort 1&#xD;
      or 2 Dosing for cohort 3 will be predicted based on PK modelling as well as efficacy and&#xD;
      safety outcomes of the older age groups. Enrolment of patients aged &lt;2 years will not be&#xD;
      permitted until supported by adequate juvenile toxicity data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will consist of three visits: Screening (Day -21 to day 1),Treatment (Day 1), and&#xD;
      Follow-up (Day 4 [+3/-1 days]).&#xD;
