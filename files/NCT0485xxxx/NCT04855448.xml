  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Central South University in collaboration with Tianjin University developed the first&#xD;
      domestically produced Chinese minimally invasive surgical (MIS) robot system which named&#xD;
      &quot;Micro Hand S&quot; in 2013. This new MIS robot had been authorized to enter the clinical trial&#xD;
      stage by the Ethics Committee of the Third Xiangya Hospital at Central South University. The&#xD;
      Micro Hand S robot is safe and feasible in the preliminary study. However, the learning curve&#xD;
      in low anterior resection for rectal resection with the Micro Hand S robot are unclear and&#xD;
      whether the two surgical robots (Micro Hand S and da Vinci) shared a similar learning curve&#xD;
      and the two robot can be trained simultaneously. Therefore, the investigators conduct this&#xD;
      retrospective study to focus on this concern.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Micro Hand S robor has been appiled in low anterior resection for rectal cancer. The&#xD;
      safey and feasibility has been evaluated. However, the learning curve of this procedure is&#xD;
      unclear. Specially,whether the two surgical robots (Micro Hand S and da Vinci) shared a&#xD;
      similar learning curve and the two robot can be trained simultaneously are unclear.Therefore,&#xD;
      this srudy is conducted to evaluate the learning curve of the two robots in low anterior&#xD;
      resection.&#xD;
