  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a respiratory disease are at higher risk of poor outcomes due to worsening of&#xD;
      symptoms caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other&#xD;
      respiratory infections. New therapies are needed for treating high risk patients at early&#xD;
      stages of an infection. This study will assess the safety, tolerability and feasibility of&#xD;
      using an inhaled nitric oxide generating solution, RESP301, as a self-administered treatment&#xD;
      following flare-up of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESP301 is a liquid solution which produces nitric oxide in the lungs when inhaled using a&#xD;
      nebuliser. The components of RESP301 are already used in clinical practice and inhaled nitric&#xD;
      oxide is used as a treatment for newborns and patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary&#xD;
      Disease (COPD). In a laboratory setting, RESP301 has been shown to be effective against&#xD;
      respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will first determine the maximum tolerated dose of RESP301 in up to 48 adult&#xD;
      patients with COPD or bronchiectasis in the United Kingdom (UK) (Part 1; Dose Finding Phase).&#xD;
      After completion of Part 1, approximately 150 patients will be recruited into Part 2 of the&#xD;
      trial (Expansion Phase). A minimum of 50 participants will receive a test dose of RESP301&#xD;
      during a screening visit. Response to the test dose will be monitored. Participants who&#xD;
      tolerate the test dose will continue in the study and should contact the study team if they&#xD;
      experience exacerbation symptoms in the next 52 weeks. Following a call with the site team to&#xD;
      discuss symptoms, participants will receive RESP301 delivered to their home to&#xD;
      self-administer for 7 days. The study duration for each participant will be at most 57 weeks,&#xD;
      including the study visit and monthly calls. Participants who start the course of study&#xD;
      treatment, will receive daily calls during the treatment period and will also be followed up&#xD;
      after they complete the treatment.&#xD;

Provided that individual stopping criteria are not met in ≥3 participants, and there are no serious adverse events that are at least possibly related to RESP301, the next dose cohort can be enrolled. Patients can be enrolled into more than one dose cohort provided they did not meet individual stopping criteria.&#xD;
In Part 2, a minimum of 150 patients will be enrolled. This may include patients who took part in Part 1. At least the first 50 patients will receive a test dose of RESP301 before enrolment into the &quot;dormant phase&quot;. Patients who experience flare-up symptoms while in the dormant phase, may proceed to the treatment phase where they will self-administer RESP301 at home for 7 days.</description>
