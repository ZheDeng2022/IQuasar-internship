  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuropathic pain is described as a &quot;pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion or&#xD;
      dysfunction in the nervous system&quot;. It is thus often a chronic affection, as a&#xD;
      difficult-to-treat condition. As such, there is growing proportion of patients with&#xD;
      inefficient pain relief. The prevalence of chronic neuropathic pain has been estimated from&#xD;
      6.9 to 10% in the general population and represents a heavy financial burden for the health&#xD;
      care systems. Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) is a well-established therapy to alleviate severe&#xD;
      intractable neuropathic pain (SCS is a reversible treatment option which leads to improve&#xD;
      pain relief and quality of life Using conventional SCS, the prerequisite to target any pain&#xD;
      relief is to obtain an appropriate coverage of the painful area with induced paresthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite its effectiveness, conventional SCS has some limitations (Selectivity, Energy&#xD;
      consumption …) and in order to address these limitations and challenges, medical devices and&#xD;
      neuromodulation industries have developed the Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) stimulation. DRG&#xD;
      stimulation appears to be a promising technology that can be proposed to patients with&#xD;
      chronic neuropathic pain for several reasons: DRG stimulation has shown promising results in&#xD;
      pathologies generating focal pain with more selectively than SCS, lead localization appeared&#xD;
      to be less discriminative than SCS. Consequently, DRG seems more stable and efficient to&#xD;
      relief pain with lower energy consumption than SCS (therapy can be delivered with very low&#xD;
      amplitude compared to SCS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Last but not least, Abbott technology has moved forward to Burst stimulation a couple of&#xD;
      years ago and validated this new way of delivering electrical stimulation through several&#xD;
      major publications. To our knowledge, applying new waveforms to DRG has not been yet&#xD;
      validated. This will represent a fantastic opportunity to refine the design of the next&#xD;
      generation of Internal Pulse Generators (IPGs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the baseline study comparing DRG stimulation to SCS is the ACCURATE study. This is a&#xD;
      high quality prospective, multicenter, randomized comparative trial conducted in 152 patients&#xD;
      implanted with either SCS or DRG stimulation system. Although ACCURATE study is well&#xD;
      designed, it has some limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To bridge this gap, the investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
      with a crossover design, where SCS and DRG stimulation will be used within patient in three&#xD;
      conditions: (i) SCS alone, (ii) DRG stimulation alone (DRGS), (iii) combination of SCS and&#xD;
      DRGS (DUAL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our goal will be to compare SCS vs DRGS vs DUAL therapies in order to establish the&#xD;
      superiority of DRG stimulation over SCS in a crossover design, assess the added value of&#xD;
      hybrid stimulation (DUAL) over the separate standalone stimulation types, compare the&#xD;
      different cortical pathways involved in both techniques, by functional imaging, incl. MRI,&#xD;
      analyze energy consumption by optimizing neural targeting. assess the added value of applying&#xD;
      Burst on these different targets, after a 3-month follow-up and to reinforce the perception&#xD;
      of neurostimulation techniques through the pain community, as the investigators will&#xD;
      demonstrate their benefits on pain relief, functional capacity and quality of life, with&#xD;
      objectives measures and a randomized design. This study represents a unique opportunity to&#xD;
      boost the rationale of SCS/DRGS since each arm of treatment will be blinded for the patient&#xD;
      and the implanter.&#xD;
