  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In intramuscular injection applications, which are among the responsibilities and basic&#xD;
      skills of nurses, different methods are used to reduce the pain caused by injection and&#xD;
      increase the individual's satisfaction. ShotBlocker and local vibration are among the methods&#xD;
      used for this purpose. The aim of the study is to examine the effectiveness of ShotBlocker&#xD;
      and local vibration, which are among the non-pharmacological methods, on the perceived pain&#xD;
      and satisfaction during ventrogluteal intramuscular antibiotic injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized, controlled experimental study will be carried out in the adult emergency&#xD;
      clinic of a training and research hospital in Istanbul between February and April 2021.&#xD;

      The purpose of study was to evaluate four research hypotheses as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Using ShotBlocker during intramuscular antibiotic injection reduces the patient's&#xD;
      injection pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: Using ShotBlocker during intramuscular antibiotic injection increases the patient's&#xD;
      satisfaction with the injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3: Using a local vibrator device during intramuscular antibiotic injection reduces the&#xD;
      patient's injection pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H4: Using a local vibrator device during intramuscular antibiotic injection increases the&#xD;
      patient's satisfaction with the injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling of the Research: The sample number was determined at the 0.5 effect size and 0.05&#xD;
      error level with the power analysis performed by taking into account the numerical values of&#xD;
      the findings obtained from a previous study on this subject. ShotBlocker group: 35; Local&#xD;
      vibration group: 35, Control Group: 35 people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample of the study will consist of volunteer patients who apply to the adult emergency&#xD;
      department, who are administered antibiotics (amoxicillin / cefuroxime sodium) upon the&#xD;
      physician's request, and who meet the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Tools: Research data will be collected using the Structured Information Form&#xD;
      created by the researchers, VAS Pain and VAS Satisfaction Scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structured Information Form; Five questions regarding the descriptive characteristics of the&#xD;
      participants (age, gender, body mass index (BMI), educational status, marital status) were&#xD;
      included. BMI (kg/m2) of the participants will be calculated by the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Initial Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Verbal information will be given to the participants and their written consents will be&#xD;
           obtained prior to the intramuscular injection. The &quot;Structured Information Form&quot;&#xD;
           consisting of five questions will be applied by face to face interview method, BMI will&#xD;
           be calculated by measuring height and weight and recorded in the &quot;Structured Information&#xD;
           Form&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ShotBlocker is a patented tool developed by Bionix (Toledo, OH, United States). It is a&#xD;
           small, flat, horseshoe (U-shaped) shaped plastic tool with a thickness of 2 mm, which is&#xD;
           used for pain control in intramuscular and subcutaneous injections, suitable for all age&#xD;
           groups, has no known side effects, does not have drug properties, is non-invasive. Since&#xD;
           it is not an invasive device, it is stated by the manufacturer that it can be used&#xD;
           several times for the same patient after washing with soap. The protruding surface of&#xD;
           the vehicle is placed in the area to be applied just before injection. Short blunt bumps&#xD;
           on the surface of the vehicle do not pierce the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Local Vibrator one of the electric vibrator devices (dolphin massager device, 210-240 V,&#xD;
           50 Hz) produced by different brands was used. These devices with interchangeable heads&#xD;
           have the ability to affect deep muscle groups, stimulate nerve endings and accelerate&#xD;
           blood circulation thanks to mechanical vibration. During application, the device must be&#xD;
           in full contact with the skin. Local vibration application reduces perceived pain by&#xD;
           stimulating nerve fibers according to Melzack and Wall's Gate Control Theory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Application:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Before the drug is prepared, the physician's request will be checked by the researcher.&#xD;
           Hands will be washed, the drug (amoxicillin / cefuroxime sodium) will be prepared by&#xD;
           diluting with 4 ml of water for injection, the needle tip will be changed to 21G&#xD;
           (0.8x40mm - green). The patient will be verbally informed, and the drug allergy status&#xD;
           will be questioned. The patient will be asked to lie down in the prone position. The&#xD;
           skin surface in the area where the IM injection will be applied will be observed by the&#xD;
           researching specialist nurse for ecchymosis, scar, inflammation or edema. The presence&#xD;
           of tenderness or stiffness will be evaluated by palpation, paying attention to muscle&#xD;
           integrity. To the patient group who was applied local vibration; Before injection, local&#xD;
           vibration will be applied to the region with a vibrator for five minutes, guided by a&#xD;
           previous study on this subject. Afterwards, the skin will be cleaned using 70% alcohol&#xD;
           and the injection will be applied with the appropriate technique, and then a light&#xD;
           pressure will be applied to the area with a cotton pad for 15-20 seconds. For the&#xD;
           patient group treated with ShotBlocker; After skin cleaning, the protruding surface of&#xD;
           the vehicle will be placed facing the skin surface and the injection will be applied&#xD;
           with the appropriate technique, then ShotBlocker will be removed and a light pressure&#xD;
           will be applied to the area with a cotton pad for 15-20 seconds. In the control group;&#xD;
           IM injection into the ventrogluteal area will be performed with the appropriate&#xD;
           technique without using any tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Final Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The change from baseline in pain and satisfaction scores on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)&#xD;
      will be measured immediately after intramuscular injection using VAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations: The ethical compliance of the study was approved by the Istanbul&#xD;
      Medeniyet University Goztepe Training and Research Hospital clinical research ethics&#xD;
      committee (date and number: 10.02.2021/0067). Written institutional permission was obtained.&#xD;
      After the purpose and duration of the study is explained, written informed consent is&#xD;
      obtained from the patients on a voluntary basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses: Data will be analyzed using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social&#xD;
      Sciences, Chicago, Illinois) version 16.0.&#xD;
