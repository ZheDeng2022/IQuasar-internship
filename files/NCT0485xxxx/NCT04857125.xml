  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to evaluate the implementation and effect of an evidence based,&#xD;
      multicomponent intervention on postoperative delirium, when fast implemented throughout the&#xD;
      patients stay in hospital before, during and after acute surgery in a risk population, the&#xD;
      primary outcome being frequency of patients with positive Confusion Assessment Method (CAM)&#xD;
      score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the frequency of postoperative delirium will be reduced after&#xD;
      implementation of the preventive interventions.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative delirium identified with the screening tool Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), assessing change from negative to positive score.</measure>
    <time_frame>During the 5 initial postoperative in-hospital days. Patients are screened twice a day; in the morning (7-10 AM) and in the evening (7-11 PM).</time_frame>
    <description>Patients are screened with the tool Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). A patient will be considered CAM positive, according to the CAM algorithm for diagnosis of delirium that requires the presence of both the first (acute onset and fluctuating course) and the second criteria (inattention) and of either the third (disorganised thinking) or the fourth criterion (altered level of consciousness).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Inadequate emergence identified with the screening tool Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) in the Post-Anaesthesia Care Unit (PACU), assessing change from negative to positive score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients are screened at time of arrival and until discharge from PACU</time_frame>
    <description>Patients are screened with the tool Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) in the Post-Anaesthesia Care Unit (PACU). A patient will be considered CAM positive, according to the CAM algorithm for diagnosis of delirium that requires the presence of both the first (acute onset and fluctuating course) and the second criteria (inattention) and of either the third (disorganised thinking) or the fourth criterion (altered level of consciousness). A positive CAM score at any time during the PACU stay is considered as having &quot;Inadequate emergence&quot;, assessing change from negative to positive score.</description>

    <description>The multicomponent intervention consists of several elements regarding avoidance of specific pre-medications and optimising the patients condition before surgery (reducing fasting and fluid-fasting time).&#xD;
Per-operative focus on using bispectral index (BIS) guided anaesthesia, Total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) as first choice, pain-and PONV (postoperative nausea and vomiting) prophylaxis and treatment.&#xD;
Postoperative focus on: Reducing indwelling catheters, Fluid (p.o. or IV), Nutrition, Mobilisation, Sleep, Non-pharmacological interventions (Shielding, involving of relatives, orientation, optimizing of senses)</description>

    <description>Staff will be educated for at least 1-2 hours. Anaesthesiologist and nurse anaesthetists will receive a brush up on the use of bispectral index (BIS) and the intervention elements that are implemented and monitored. Staff in the PACU, as well as staff in the surgery wards, will be educated in postoperative delirium, learning to identify symptoms of delirium and how to use the screening tool CAM.</description>
