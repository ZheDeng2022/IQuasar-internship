    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological distress affects many people diagnosed with a primary malignant brain tumor&#xD;
      (PBT). Distress can include negative feelings such as anger, fear, or sadness. Researchers&#xD;
      want to see if a type of therapy called CALM can help. It promotes well-being in people who&#xD;
      have cancer that cannot be cured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find out if the CALM therapy can help people with a PBT suffering from distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      English-speaking adults ages 18 and older who have a PBT and are taking part in NIH protocol&#xD;
      #16C0151.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will not take place in person. It will be done by smartphone, computer, or tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will fill out 7 surveys. The surveys will take 40 to 60 minutes to complete.&#xD;
      They are all electronic. They will ask about physical and emotional symptoms, depression,&#xD;
      feelings about death and dying, feelings about close relationships, and general well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned to a CALM therapist. They will have 3 to 6 individual therapy&#xD;
      sessions in 6 months. Each session will last 45 to 60 minutes. Sessions may be audio&#xD;
      recorded. If needed, participants may have extra sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CALM includes symptom management and discussions of meaning, purpose, and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have a family member take part in at least one CALM session with them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the third CALM session, participants will be asked questions about CALM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3 and 6 months, participants will complete the 7 surveys again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last about 6 months.&#xD;

      PRECIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological distress is an emotional state experienced by primary brain tumor (PBT)&#xD;
      patients throughout the illness trajectory. It can often be under identified in this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limited therapeutic interventions in managing distress symptoms can allow symptoms to linger&#xD;
      without tailored mechanisms to manage the emotional challenges experienced with a tumor&#xD;
      diagnosis. Individualized therapy in advanced cancer patients is a preferred method over&#xD;
      pharmacological interventions when managing psychological distress, but more evidence-based&#xD;
      research is needed to address the benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CALM intervention is a brief, individualized psychotherapeutic intervention established&#xD;
      to meet an unmet need to address psychological distress and promote well-being in advanced&#xD;
      cancer patients. Previous studies implementing the CALM intervention have focused on&#xD;
      metastatic and advanced cancer patients and have reported positive effects. Implementing the&#xD;
      CALM intervention in a sample of PBT patients will be one of the first studies to identify&#xD;
      the preliminary effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate the effects of the CALM intervention in reduction of depressive symptoms using&#xD;
      the PROMIS-Depression scale in PBT participants, from baseline to 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult participants greater than or equal to 18 years of age with a PBT diagnosis who are&#xD;
      undergoing standard of care or experimental treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ability of the subject to speak English&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects who have a life expectancy of at least 3 months from time of study entry to&#xD;
           allow for participation in the 3 required sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ability of the subject to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
           document as determined by the assessment of the clinical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 100 participants will be enrolled&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuro-Oncology participants being seen in the clinical center or receiving telehealth&#xD;
      services will be screened to participate. Participants will be assigned a CALM therapist and&#xD;
      all sessions will be completed remotely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from standardized measures will be collected at 3 timepoints (Baseline, 3 months, 6&#xD;
      months) and qualitative interviews will be completed after the 3rd CALM session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximate time for sessions is 45-60 minutes.&#xD;
