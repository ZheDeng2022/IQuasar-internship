  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/1b open-label, dose-escalation, and cohort expansion study with BID&#xD;
      (tablet) oral dose of MPT-0118 in subjects with advanced or metastatic refractory solid&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 3 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part A: MPT-0118 dose-escalation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part B: MPT-0118 dose-escalation in combination with pembrolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part C: Cohort expansion of MPT-0118 in combination with pembrolizumab&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MPT-0118 will be administered orally twice daily (BID). Pembrolizumab will be administered&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Part A: Each dose-escalation cohort will initially recruit single-subject cohorts until a subject has a Grade 2 or greater adverse event (AE) during the DLT period considered at least possibly related to MPT-0118, at which time 2 additional subjects will be enrolled in that cohort, and a 3 + 3 design will subsequently be utilized.&#xD;
Part B: Each dose-escalation cohort will initially recruit 3 patients to receive MPT-0118 + pembrolizumab in a standard 3+3 design; the cohort will be expanded in the event of a DLT.&#xD;
Part C: Once the RP2D has been established for MPT-0118 monotherapy and combination therapy with MPT-0118 + pembrolizumab, expansion cohorts will be enrolled to further evaluate combination therapy.</intervention_model_description>
