  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery is one of the clinical surgical specialties that carries a particularly high&#xD;
      risk for patients to suffer from severe bleeding perioperatively and consequent anemia, which&#xD;
      subsequently requires transfusion of allogeneic blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although a surprisingly high number of patients in cardiac surgery do not require&#xD;
      perioperative transfusions, it is primarily those patients who do require transfusion who are&#xD;
      subsequently at risk for a worse outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years many studies have been published discussing measures that can assist&#xD;
      physicians in avoiding the triad of anemia, bleeding, and transfusion in cardiac surgery.&#xD;
      Within these publications, the implementation of Patient Blood Management (PBM) is advised.&#xD;
      PBM is a set of measures aimed at improving patient outcome by reducing perioperative&#xD;
      bleeding and thus preventing both anemia and bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three pillars of this bundle are the preoperative preparation of anemic patients with&#xD;
      iron, erythropoietin, folic acid and vitamin B12, the prevention of intraoperative blood loss&#xD;
      and the reasonable indication for allogeneic transfusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, it must be mentioned that the implementation of at least part of these measures&#xD;
      is laborious, and full implementation of the recommended bundle is therefore rarely achieved.&#xD;
      As a consequence, the full potential of Patient Blood Management is not always realized.&#xD;
      Unfortunately this means that transfusion of allogeneic blood cannot be prevented in many&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small proportion of patients undergoing cardiac surgery requires a very large amount of&#xD;
      allogeneic blood perioperatively. These patients are typically those with a particularly poor&#xD;
      outcome. Massive transfusion of allogeneic blood in this situation is an indicator of&#xD;
      complications and a cause of increased mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although cardiac surgeons and anesthesiologists believe they can assess which patients are at&#xD;
      high risk for hemorrhage, recent publications indicate that there is an urgent need for&#xD;
      adequate predictive methods. A variety of studies exist that attempt to predict perioperative&#xD;
      transfusion requirements, but to date have been plagued by several limitations. Either the&#xD;
      previous publications do not focus on the prediction of massive transfusion of allogeneic&#xD;
      blood, i.e. administration of ten or more packed red blood cell units perioperatively, but on&#xD;
      much lower transfusion volumes, have only low predictive strength to predict massive&#xD;
      transfusion in daily clinical practice, or are hardly usable for true prediction because they&#xD;
      use factors (features) that are not strictly present only in the preoperative phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an accurate prediction model based on a few features could be created and those patients&#xD;
      particularly at risk of massive transfusion of allogeneic blood could be identified, it would&#xD;
      subsequently be possible to develop an adapted clinical pathway that would allow patient care&#xD;
      to be improved and individualized interventions adapted to the situation to be implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the best case, an adapted care of patients would be possible, which is able to increase&#xD;
      the acceptance for the use of even complex measures of patient blood management. This is&#xD;
      especially true for measures such as preoperative preparation with iron and/or&#xD;
      erythropoietin, the use of a cell saver, and a particularly careful surgical approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even if it is difficult to apply all measures of patient blood management in all patients, it&#xD;
      would be possible with an approach as described to identify those patients who would benefit&#xD;
      most from individualized approaches.&#xD;
