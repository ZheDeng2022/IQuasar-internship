  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is carried out in two phases. The first phase adopts an open design, and&#xD;
      the second phase adopts a randomized, blinded, and similar vaccine-controlled non-inferiority&#xD;
      trial design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first stage: According to the order of two age groups of 18-60 years old and 10-17 years&#xD;
      old, 40 cases were enrolled in each age group (20 persons for the 5-dose program and 20 for&#xD;
      the 4-dose program). Subjects in the 5-dose group received 1 dose of test vaccine on 0, 3, 7,&#xD;
      14, and 28 days each. Subjects in the 4-dose group received 1 dose each on both arms on day&#xD;
      0, and 1 dose on day 7 and day 21 each. All subjects in the first stage were only observed&#xD;
      for safety and were followed up to 6 months after the entire course of vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second stage: the total number of enrolled 2400 cases, 10-60 years old, the 4-dose&#xD;
      program group and the 5-dose program group of the test vaccine, the 4-dose program group and&#xD;
      the 5-dose program group of the control vaccine according to the random ratio 1:1:1:1. Among&#xD;
      the total number of participants, 1680 cases (420 cases per group) were simultaneously&#xD;
      observed for immunogenicity and safety, and the remaining 720 subjects (180 cases per group)&#xD;
      only underwent safety observation. 800 subjects (200 cases in each group) received 6-month&#xD;
      immune persistence observation after full vaccination, and 400 subjects in the test vaccine&#xD;
      group received 12 months immune persistence observation after full vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second stage, 1680 subjects were collected before the immunization, 7 days after the&#xD;
      first dose, 14 days after the first dose, and 14 days after the full vaccination to test&#xD;
      rabies virus antibodies to evaluate the immunogenicity of the test vaccine. 800 subjects were&#xD;
      in the whole process Immune persistent blood sampling was performed 6 months after&#xD;
      vaccination, and subjects in the test vaccine group were further subjected to immune&#xD;
      persistent blood sampling 12 months after the full course of vaccination to evaluate immune&#xD;
      durability. Collect all AEs within 30 minutes after each dose, AEs from 0-7 days, all&#xD;
      non-collective AEs from the first dose to 30 days after the full course of vaccination, and&#xD;
      all serious AEs from the first dose to 6 months after the full course of vaccination Adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
