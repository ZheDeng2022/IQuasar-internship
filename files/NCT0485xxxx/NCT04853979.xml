      The investigator hypothesis is that early implementation of early, awake prone position for&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring oxygen therapy will reduce the need for escalation&#xD;
      of respiratory support. Escalation of respiratory support is defined as the need for&#xD;
      respiratory support with HFNO, NIV or IV.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The world health organization has designated the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome&#xD;
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as an ongoing pandemic and a public health emergency of&#xD;
      international concern. The disease is estimated to be severe in 20% of patients and about&#xD;
      5-10% will need critical care with respiratory support. ARDS is thought to be the main cause&#xD;
      of respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. Research is still ongoing to further elucidate&#xD;
      the different ARDS subtypes that may exist in COVID-19. It is crucial to find new targets for&#xD;
      treatment and support of COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prone positioning causes a substantial improvement in oxygenation that appear to persist&#xD;
      after the patient is returned to a supine position. It has also been shown to have a&#xD;
      significant mortality benefit in invasively ventilated ARDS patients. Observational studies&#xD;
      have shown improvement in oxygenation with awake prone positioning in non-intubated patients&#xD;
      with COVID-19 pneumonia. There is no published RCTs to date. It remains unclear whether prone&#xD;
      positioning averts invasive or non-invasive ventilation, accelerates recovery, or reduces&#xD;
      mortality. Similarly, there is no data on presumed viral pneumonia. Future studies are needed&#xD;
      to identify the optimal indications for, duration of pronation, and assessment of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigator hypothesis is that early implementation of early, awake&#xD;
      pronation for patients with Covid19 pneumonia requiring oxygen therapy will reduce the need&#xD;
      for escalation of respiratory support. Escalation of respiratory support is defined as the&#xD;
      need for respiratory support with HFNO, NIV or IV Research participants: Adults 18 years and&#xD;
      older with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 presenting to HMC with hypoxemic respiratory&#xD;
      failure (PF&lt;200 or SpO2 less than 94% on FiO2&gt;=0.4 or =&gt;5 lit/min O2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a non-blinded randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      one of two study arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intervention arm: Any combination of prone or side position (defined as any part of the&#xD;
           anterior chest wall being in contact with the bed) for at least 3 hours and up to 16&#xD;
           hours per day during wakefulness. Patients will be asked to prone on three occasions:&#xD;
           morning, afternoon and evening. Breaks of 30-120 min are allowed in sitting position or&#xD;
           supine each 4 hours. Bed elevation of &gt;30 degrees will be maintained unless otherwise&#xD;
           requested by the patient. No control or intervention is made during sleep periods.&#xD;
           Intervention will last for up to 3 days or until the patient achieves oxygen saturations&#xD;
           of 94-98% on room air. Oxygen delivery may be via NC, HM, HFNC or NIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control arm: Usual care (no Prone unless asleep and assumes this position&#xD;
           spontaneously). The patient is able to adopt their preferred natural position. The bed&#xD;
           will be elevated &gt;30 degrees unless requested otherwise by the patient. However prone&#xD;
           position may be used as rescue therapy if oxygen requirements are =&gt;15 lit/min O2 or&#xD;
           HFNC/NIV with FiO2 =&gt;0.6 with O2 saturation less than 90% at the discretion of the&#xD;
           treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed for escalation of respiratory support within the first three days of&#xD;
      the study. Escalation of respiratory support is defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  escalation from NP/HC/NRB to HFNO or NIV or IV&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  escalation from HFNO or NIV to IV Several secondary outcomes will be analyzed as well as&#xD;
           outlined in outcomes section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous studies of prone position in COVID-19 patients, anticipate an improvement&#xD;
      in oxygenation and possible prevention of intubation with shorter mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      times. Awake proning has been shown to be safe in local practice.&#xD;
