  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who inject drugs (PWIDs) are a socially vulnerable population and are exposed to risk&#xD;
      factors including unstable housing and underlying medical conditions such as human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis (TB), and viral hepatitis that put them at&#xD;
      increased risk for severe COVID-19 symptoms, including death. PWIDs also experience barriers&#xD;
      such as a history of stigmatization and discrimination by health care systems and exposure to&#xD;
      misinformation about testing that reduces access to health care services and testing. Because&#xD;
      timely receipt of services relative to symptoms onset is critical for positive health&#xD;
      outcomes and to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, lack of testing has significant implications&#xD;
      for PWID, highlighting an urgent need to increase testing uptake among this population.&#xD;
      Despite this, PWIDs have been an underserved population in the context of the current&#xD;
      pandemic; thus, little is known about the prevalence of COVID-19 and the acceptability and&#xD;
      possible reach of testing for COVID-19 among PWIDs. To address this gap, this study leverages&#xD;
      a current partnership with HIV Alliance (HIVA) in Oregon and our Community and Scientific&#xD;
      Advisory Board to support implementation and sustainability of a COVID-19 testing program.&#xD;
      Specifically, we will use community-based participatory approaches to develop, implement, and&#xD;
      evaluate a COVID-19 testing program offered through HIVA's Syringe Services Programs (SSP), a&#xD;
      natural point of care for PWIDs. Moreover, SSPs may offer a natural venue for dissemination&#xD;
      and delivery of a vaccine, once available. The COVID-19 testing program will include&#xD;
      procedures for sample collection, transmission of specimens to the University of Oregon&#xD;
      CLIA-certified laboratory, and results reporting. For aim 1, we will assess the testing&#xD;
      program utilization. For aim 2, we will develop and test a brief motivational enhancement&#xD;
      intervention to optimize testing utilization among PWIDs. Using a randomized control trial,&#xD;
      we will evaluate intervention effects on utilization of COVID-19 testing resources. For aim&#xD;
      3, we will collect data from syringe exchange staff and key volunteers on program&#xD;
      acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness, adoption, and implementation barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators related to the testing program and intervention. The current project has the&#xD;
      potential to enhance COVID-19 testing access and reach among a significantly underserved&#xD;
      population who experience multiple risks that make it difficult to prevent SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      exposure and transmission and who are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 symptoms, if they&#xD;
      were to contract the disease.&#xD;
