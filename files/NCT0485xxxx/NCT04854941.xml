  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of the new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) and COVID-19-associated diarrhoea&#xD;
      and liver injury remains challenging. Optimizing treatment approaches for COVID-19 remains an&#xD;
      issue. It is assumed, that changes in composition of intestinal microbiota is closely related&#xD;
      to a change in the regulation of the immune response in the lungs in patients with COVID-19.&#xD;
      These gut microbiota changes in combination with antibiotic prescription during the treatment&#xD;
      increase the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and C. difficile infection as well as&#xD;
      worse clinical outcomes in these patients. Probiotics are useful for restoring the human gut&#xD;
      microbiome and increasing anti-inflammatory response also. Despite the variety of uses of&#xD;
      probiotics, there is still insufficient data on the clinical efficacy of including probiotics&#xD;
      in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 infection.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled open-label study approved by the local ethical committee. The study&#xD;
      included patients with COVID-19 admitted to the T.M. Tareev Clinic of Internal Diseases of&#xD;
      I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University in whom the disease was confirmed using&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs to detect severe acute&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2). The study was conducted from&#xD;
      December 2020 to March 2021 and included participants in the age range from 18 to 75 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria were age over 75 years or under 18 years, consumption of probiotics&#xD;
      for 3 months prior to admission, history of intolerance to probiotics or their components,&#xD;
      refusal to participate and sign informed consent, pregnancy or breastfeeding, cancer or&#xD;
      mental illness, and severe renal (glomerular filtration rate less than 50 mL/min) or hepatic&#xD;
      (equivalent to cirrhosis class B or C on the Child-Pugh scale) dysfunction at the time of&#xD;
      admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who prematurely discontinued the consumption of probiotics for reasons not related&#xD;
      to the development of side effects were excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were randomised to the probiotics group (PRO group) or the control group (CON&#xD;
      group). Patients in the PRO group received probiotics containing ~109 colony forming units&#xD;
      (CFU) of Lactobacillus rhamnosus PDV 1705, ~109 CFU of Bifidobacterium bifidum PDV 0903, ~109&#xD;
      CFU of B. longum subsp. infantis PDV 1911, and ~109 CFU of B. longum PDV 2301 three times a&#xD;
      day during the hospital stay but for no more than 14 days (PDV is the commercial letter&#xD;
      designation of the bacterial strains). The end point of the trial was day 14 of&#xD;
      hospitalisation or the day of the patient's discharge or death, whichever occurred earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group consisted of patients who did not receive probiotics. Patients in both the&#xD;
      groups also received dexamethasone and antiviral (favipiravir and/or riamilovir),&#xD;
      antibacterial, anticoagulant (enoxaparin in most cases; rivaroxaban and dabigatran were used&#xD;
      much less frequently), and anticytokine (tocilizumab or/and olokizumab) drugs according to&#xD;
      indications and contraindications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Death from any cause was considered the primary outcome. Duration of hospitalisation, total&#xD;
      duration of the disease, incidence of admission to intensive care unit, need for oxygen&#xD;
      support or mechanical ventilation, and changes in the values of key biomarkers were&#xD;
      considered the main secondary outcomes. The duration of diarrhoea [loose or watery stools or&#xD;
      an increase in the frequency of bowel movements (more than three times per day)] and&#xD;
      incidence of hospital-acquired diarrhoea as well as the progression of pre-existing liver&#xD;
      injury and onset of liver injury were considered additional secondary outcomes. Liver injury&#xD;
      was determined through the presence of abnormalities in any of the main liver test findings&#xD;
      (serum alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl&#xD;
      transferase, total bilirubin, and albumin levels).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volume of the affected lungs was measured using chest computed tomography (CT); it&#xD;
      included the sum of ground glass and consolidation volumes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results are presented as the median [interquartile range]. The groups were compared using&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney test for continuous data and chi-square test for categorical data. Wilcoxon test&#xD;
      was used to assess the changes in continuous biomarker values. Mortality was assessed using&#xD;
      the Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox's test. A p value ≤0.05 was considered the criterion for&#xD;
      significance. Statistical calculations were performed using &quot;Statistica 10&quot; soft (TIBCO&#xD;
      Software inc, Palo Alto, CA)&#xD;
