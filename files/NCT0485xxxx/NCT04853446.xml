  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will assess the beneficial and harmful effects of oral dexamethason (12 mg or 24 mg)&#xD;
      versus placebo in patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery of their hand or forearm with a&#xD;
      lateral infraclavicular brachial plexus block as the means of providing anaesthesia and&#xD;
      analgesia.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to first pain (measured in minutes)</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Time to first pain will be recorded by the patient and measured as the time to first perceived pain in minutes in the surgical area. The patient will be asked to record the time and date of their first perceived pain in their trial log. This date and time will be compared to the date and time of the block performance as recorded in the electronic Case Report Form. In the event of the patient not experiencing any pain, the time to first pain will be set to 48 hours.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of the motor block (measured in minutes)</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of the motor block will be recorded by the patient and measured in minutes as the time from removal of the needle to the first movement of their bicep muscle on the operative site, and not the first movement of their distal extremity. The patient will record the date and time of their time to first bicep movement on the operative side in their trial log. This date and time will be compared to the date and time of the block performance as registered in the electronic Case Report Form. In the event of the patient not regaining movement of the bicep, the duration of the motor block will be set to 48 hours.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of sleep (Numerical Rating Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep will be measured on the Numerical Rating Scale from '0' to '10' points where '0' points correspond to the worst possible sleep and '10' points correspond to the best possible sleep. The outcome measure will be recorded by the patients in their trial log after the first postoperative night and second postoperative night.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of participants with one or more serious adverse events.</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Serious adverse events as defined by the ICH-GCP will be collected and reported as the proportion of participants with one or more serious adverse events. Furthermore, the individual serious adverse events will also be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of participants with one or more adverse events not considered to be serious</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>We will record any adverse events not considered to be serious. We will report the proportion of participants with one or more adverse events not considered to be serious and all individual adverse events not considered to be serious.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Cumulative oxycodone consumption (measured in milligrams)</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Cumulative oxycodone consumption will be recorded in the electronic medical files of the patients during hospitalisation and in their trial log at 24 hours and 48 hours by the patient after discharge. The patient will be instructed to record whenever they ingest escape oxycodone, as well as record the total amount of ingested escape oxycodone at 48 hours postoperatively. The patient will be instructed to not count in any usual opioid consumption, but only the escape oxycodone provided by the investigators.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Pain (measured on the Numerical Rating Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be recorded during rest and measured on the Numerical Rating Scale from '0' to '10' points where '0' points correspond to no pain and '10' points correspond to the worst possible pain. The patients will record their perceived pain at 24 hours and 48 hours in their trial log. The patient will also be asked to record their highest pain and average pain between 0 hours and 24 hours, and 24 hours and 48 hours postoperatively</description>
