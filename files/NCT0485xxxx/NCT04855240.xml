&#xD;
          -  Has a planned concurrent surgical procedure (e.g. bilateral bunionectomy or collateral&#xD;
             procedures like hammertoe correction on the surgical foot)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any subacute or chronic pain condition or use of a medication that would impair/impact&#xD;
             the ability to rate the pain associated with the bunionectomy, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator and Medical Monitor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known or suspected regular use of opioids within the previous 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has taken opioids within 24 hours prior to the scheduled surgery or within five&#xD;
             half-lives of the drug, whichever is longer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known or suspected history of drug abuse, a positive drug screen at Screening or&#xD;
             Day -1, or a recent (i.e., within the last 5 years) history of alcohol abuse. Subjects&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has initiated treatment with any medications within 1 month prior to study drug&#xD;
             administration that could impact pain control or quantitation of their pain response&#xD;

&#xD;
        Additional inclusion/exclusion criteria apply. Patients will be evaluated at screening to&#xD;
        ensure that all criteria for study participation are met. Patients may be excluded from the&#xD;
        study based on these assessments (and specifically, if it is determined that their baseline&#xD;
        health and psychiatric condition do not meet all pre-specified entry criteria).&#xD;
