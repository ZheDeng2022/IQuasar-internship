    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomised, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy of neratinib&#xD;
      in combination with SOC systemic therapy on CNS metastasis both as for secondary prevention&#xD;
      (cohort 1), primary treatment (cohort 2) and for the treatment of LM disease (cohort 3) in&#xD;
      subjects with HER2 positive metastatic BC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer will be eligible for the trial and will&#xD;
      be enrolled in one of the following cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: Eligible subjects include HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer subjects treated&#xD;
      with at least one line of systemic anti HER2 therapy and pre-treated with local approaches at&#xD;
      least for the previous CNS event and currently progressive but locally treated CNS&#xD;
      metastasis. Local therapy includes: stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or/and WBRT or/and&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will measure the effect of the drug combination on the time to next CNS event(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2: Eligible subjects include HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer subjects treated&#xD;
      with at least one line of systemic anti HER2 therapy or progressing less than 12 months after&#xD;
      end of adjuvant therapy with a first diagnosis of brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will measure the objective CNS response in each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 3: Eligible subjects include HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer subjects treated&#xD;
      with at least one line of systemic anti HER2 therapy with confirmed LM defined as the&#xD;
      presence of malignant cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or combination of typical&#xD;
      symptoms and MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will measure the effect of the drug combination on the time to CNS progression&#xD;
      including LM progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As per investigator's choice, eligible subjects in all cohort will receive neratinib in&#xD;
      combination with capecitabine or with T-DM1 or with paclitaxel or with vinorelbine as per&#xD;
      investigator's choice. Trastuzumab can be added as per investigator's choice to those&#xD;
      regimens except for T-DM1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At screening and during the study treatment period (every 9 weeks), brain MRI for cohort 1&#xD;
      and cohort 2 or contrast-enhanced neuraxis brain and spine MRI for cohort 3 and tumour&#xD;
      assessment by thoracic and abdomino-pelvic CT scan for all cohorts should be performed. For&#xD;
      cohort 3 only, CSF cytological assessment should also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, at screening and at each cycle during the study treatment period, subjects must&#xD;
      fill quality of life questionnaires: EORTC core questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and brain module&#xD;
      (QLQ-BN20).&#xD;
