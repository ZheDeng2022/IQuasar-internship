  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of air-polishing device that operates by directing a fine slurry of pressurized air,&#xD;
      water, and abrasive particles has become widespread in dentistry for polishing. The&#xD;
      introduction of abrasive powders with different properties creates the need to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of these powders on dental hard tissues. This study was focused on the effect of&#xD;
      sodium bicarbonate, glycine and erythritol air polishing on enamel and exposed root surface.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of sodium bicarbonate, glycine and erythritol&#xD;
      air polishing on enamel and exposed root surface. Forty eight single root extracted teeth&#xD;
      were included into the study. The teeth were divided into three groups, the crown and exposed&#xD;
      root surface were air polished using three powders at instrumentation time of 5s,&#xD;
      combinations of medium and maximum power and medium water settings, distance of 5mm and&#xD;
      angulation of 60 degree. Samples were scanned in a micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) at&#xD;
      baseline and then after powder treatment and the defect depth, defect volume,&#xD;
      demineralization depth and mineral density values were estimated.&#xD;

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>sodium bicarbonate group</arm_group_label>
    <description>Sodium bicarbonate-based powder (CLASSIC®, EMS SA, Nyon, Switzerland) was used for air polishing the samples belonging to this group. All surfaces were numbered and application was made to the mesial and distal surfaces of the root, buccal and lingual surfaces of the crown to avoid repeated instrumentations. After device and samples were fixed, a metal plate with a 5 mm diameter hole was placed on the sample to limit the application area. Surfaces one and three were air-polished using the with a medium power setting (9 LED power setting), and surfaces two and four were air-polished using the with a maximum power setting (17 LED power setting). The distance between the handpiece and the tooth surface was kept constant at 5 mm, and the treatment angulation was adjusted to 60 degrees. In all applications, the application time was 5 seconds and the water setting was medium (6 LED). The powder chambers of the device were filled to the maximum level in each application.</description>
