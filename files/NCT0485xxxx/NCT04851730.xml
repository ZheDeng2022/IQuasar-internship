  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to establish if an individualized, impairment-based&#xD;
      orthopedic intervention (IOI) can improve pelvic floor function and pain in women with&#xD;
      Chronic Pelvic Pain (CPP). Dry needling will be used as a part of the IOI to intervene upon&#xD;
      peripheral muscles stiffness previously found to be more stiff in this population compared to&#xD;
      healthy controls. This study is intended to initiate a line of research aimed at assessing&#xD;
      widely used orthopedic physical therapy practices to address orthopedic impairments and&#xD;
      muscle stiffness differences in women with CPP potentially decreasing time to care for a&#xD;
      widely experienced condition. This study will guide potential future studies aimed at&#xD;
      intervening upon a larger population and establishing the characteristics of participants who&#xD;
      respond favorable to orthopedic care alone. First, this study will establish if this type of&#xD;
      intervention has an effect on pelvic floor function and symptoms, pain, and muscle stiffness,&#xD;
      all of which are often priorities of treatment for PHPTs treating CPP. A single-subject&#xD;
      design is well suited in studying an intervention on such a heterogeneous patient population&#xD;
      that does not currently have physical therapy treatment subclassifications. Future studies&#xD;
      could help to establish possible subclassifications of CPP to include an orthopedic or&#xD;
      peripheral muscle stiffness classification and empower therapists with associations between&#xD;
      peripheral orthopedic and myofascial dysfunction and pelvic floor function and pain. This&#xD;
      line of research could help prioritize which patients require specialty care, who could&#xD;
      initiate care with an orthopedic PT, and who may resolve dysfunction and pain with orthopedic&#xD;
      PT alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When patients make their initial appointment at the private outpatient pelvic health office,&#xD;
      they will be informed about a study looking for participants with pelvic pain that includes 4&#xD;
      weeks of free physical therapy care. If the patient is interested they will be given the&#xD;
      researcher's email address and phone number to make appropriate arrangements. Once the&#xD;
      potential participant contacts the researcher they will take part in a prescreening phone&#xD;
      call. This prescreening call will assess their willingness to enroll in the study and ask&#xD;
      preliminary inclusion criteria. This prescreening is necessary to allow participants to be&#xD;
      taken off of the therapists' regular schedule and go onto the research schedule, allowing&#xD;
      therapists to fill vacancies in their schedule if appropriate. If a participant emails or&#xD;
      leaves a message, the researcher can call them to initiate the prescreening phone call.&#xD;
      Potential subjects will be called a maximum of 2 times and up to 2 messages will be left for&#xD;
      any potential subject that voiced interest by initiating contact with the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the individual does not wish to participate after hearing more details from the researcher&#xD;
      or for some reason does not meet inclusion criteria, the only information collected from the&#xD;
      prescreening phone call will be gender, age, race, ethnicity, and reason for exclusion so&#xD;
      that the number of patients that were screened compared to the number of patients that were&#xD;
      enrolled, per the CONSORT guidelines, can be tracked. No further data will be collected or&#xD;
      recorded from this call as it is intended to assess interest level and inform potential&#xD;
      subjects that they will be scheduling with a researcher instead of a clinician. Individuals&#xD;
      who contact researchers showing interest in the study from physician referral will also&#xD;
      provide their contact information in order to schedule their first appointment with the&#xD;
      researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information collected for prescreening or scheduling will only be shared with a small&#xD;
      group of researchers in an encrypted file on a password protected computer. This file will be&#xD;
      saved separately from any data collected by the study of enrolled participants. Enrolled&#xD;
      subjects will be coded with a participant number as to not cross-identify with any record of&#xD;
      contact information saved with the individual's name.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ABA single-subject research design will be used for this study. Participants will undergo&#xD;
      3-5 sessions of baseline testing based on the stabilization of the dependent variable, with&#xD;
      two visits per week until stabilization. If stabilization of two of the three dependent&#xD;
      variables (NPRS, muscle stiffness, and PPT) can not be met then the participant cannot&#xD;
      continue into the intervention phase of the study. Then the participants will undergo four&#xD;
      weeks of intervention, two times a week for a total of 8 intervention appointments. Dependent&#xD;
      variables will be collected one and two weeks after the last intervention ends to establish&#xD;
      if there is a continuation of the data trend without intervention taking place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      15 women with CPP will be recruited as previously discussed. The participant will also be&#xD;
      asked to wear a mask during the testing procedures and wash your hands before starting the&#xD;
      session. First, we will take the participants temperature and ask if they have any symptoms&#xD;
      of COVID-19, prior to each appointment. The researcher(s) will wash their hands with soap&#xD;
      using methods recommended by the CDC before and after the research sessions. If hand washing&#xD;
      is not available, we will use and ask them to use hand sanitizer. The researchers will also&#xD;
      limit the number of research team members present to one treating member.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately hands on intervention does not allow for social distancing. The researchers&#xD;
      will conduct the study in a time efficient manner to minimize their time at the research&#xD;
      site. The researcher(s) will wear masks during the entire study. If needed, the researchers&#xD;
      will wear other PPE (personal protective equipment) such as laboratory coats or gowns,&#xD;
      gloves, and eye protection during the study. When the researcher(s) must be in close&#xD;
      proximity to the participants (e.g., performing the screening exam, performing manual therapy&#xD;
      or dry needling), the researchers will have a face shield in addition to a mask.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the participant has met inclusion and exclusion criteria and is enrolled in the study&#xD;
      by Investigator #1, the participant will answer demographic and health history (Appendix A),&#xD;
      pain, (Appendix B and C), psychosocial (Appendix F and G) and function and disability outcome&#xD;
      measures (Appendix E). Next, Investigator #2 will perform a pelvic floor muscle assessment&#xD;
      (Appendix D) in a private room at the consent of the participant and after informing the&#xD;
      participant of the entire exam. Clean technique will be used with the therapist using one&#xD;
      gloved finger with lubrication. The therapist will visually observe automatic and volition&#xD;
      actions of shortening and lengthening of the pelvic floor and intra-vaginally manually assess&#xD;
      the muscle strength of the superficial muscles consistent with the International Continence&#xD;
      Society muscle grading system. Then the levator ani muscles will be assessed for power and&#xD;
      endurance. All pelvic floor muscle measurements will be taken at each visit in the baseline&#xD;
      and intervention phases, but will not be used as an outcome measure that determines&#xD;
      stabilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle stiffness measurements (Appendix C) will be collected using the MyotonPro by&#xD;
      Investigator #1. MyotonPro measurements will be collected in the same order for each person&#xD;
      to ensure similar resting time of each muscle. Testing will be done on the rectus femoris,&#xD;
      adductor longus, lumbar paraspinals at levels L1/L2 and L4/L5 and the piriformis as these&#xD;
      muscles were previously found to be significantly more stiff in those with CPP as compared to&#xD;
      those without pelvic pain. Measurements of the individual muscles will be acquired on the&#xD;
      more painful side if the participant is able to identify one, or by drawing a previously&#xD;
      randomized card to determine the side of measurement. All measurements will be taken with the&#xD;
      limb supported in a resting state. One measurement will be taken at each muscle due to&#xD;
      previously acquired reliability measures. This measurement will establish if muscular&#xD;
      stiffness is over 1 standard deviation (SD) above the average stiffness of a person without&#xD;
      CPP, per muscle. If the person does have stiffness over 1SD, then dry needling will be&#xD;
      performed on that muscle during the intervention phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, PPT measurements (Appendix C) will be taken to assess local sensitivity to pain and&#xD;
      pressure to measure changes in central sensitization over time at all muscle sites. PPT will&#xD;
      also be assessed directly after dry needling is performed in the intervention phase. PPT&#xD;
      measurements will be taken at all muscle sites, even if they do not meet the threshold to&#xD;
      perform dry needling. A digital pressure algometer (Wagner Force Ten FDX, Wagner Instruments,&#xD;
      Greenwich, CT) will be used to assess PPT. The algometer will be held by an examiner directly&#xD;
      perpendicular to the muscle belly of and advanced at a rate of approximately 5N/sec.&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed to verbally signal when they first perceive the force exerted&#xD;
      as painful or uncomfortable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After baseline measurements of pelvic floor muscle assessment, muscle stiffness, and PPT are&#xD;
      complete, Investigator #1 will perform a standard lumbopelvic orthopedic exam (Appendix I).&#xD;
      Based upon the preliminary MyotonPro testing and the orthopedic exam the intervention will be&#xD;
      planned. This study is intended to replicate an individualized orthopedic plan of care using&#xD;
      an impairment-based approach during the physical therapy evaluation. Since the intervention&#xD;
      is based on what is found in the evaluation there is some discernment left up to the&#xD;
      therapist. Standards will be established for each section of the orthopedic assessment in&#xD;
      order to standardize which patient presentation gets what intervention as shown in Appendix&#xD;
      J. The same order of care will be followed for each participant as well. Appendix J shows the&#xD;
      possible interventions that can be performed based on each region of the evaluation.&#xD;
      Documentation of the intervention and dosage will be recorded for each participant at each&#xD;
      appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be seen 2 times a week for 4 weeks for the intervention phase of the&#xD;
      the A-B-A design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the intervention portion of the study, the participant will come back for further&#xD;
      dependent variable testing without intervention. The participant will return 1 time per week&#xD;
      for 2 weeks. Measurements of PPT, muscle stiffness, NPRS, and pelvic floor and orthopedic&#xD;
      function measurements will be taken at each visit through all phases of the study.&#xD;
      Questionnaires such as the PFDI, CSI and BDI will be taken at the first baseline visit, last&#xD;
      intervention visit and last follow-up visit since we do not expect these outcome measures to&#xD;
      change from visit to visit.&#xD;

    <description>Third, the investigator will dry needle appropriate muscles. Dry needling treatment technique will include insertion of a sterile, disposable, solid filament needle into the muscle belly in the area palpated as listed below. A 0.30 × 0.50mm, or specified size below, stainless steel Seirin J-type or Myotech needle will be used (Dommerholt 2011). &quot;Clean technique&quot; will be employed throughout the treatment procedure which includes hand washing, clean latex-free glove use, and skin-surface preparation with an alcohol swab ( Baima &amp; Isaac 2008). Each muscle will receive a maximal number of 2 insertions and each insertion consists of up to 5 seconds of a &quot;pistoning&quot; (in and out motion) technique in an attempt to elicit a local twitch response. Standard protocol for each muscle will be established prior to beginning data collection.&#xD;
