      The objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness of mindfulness/meditation using&#xD;
      the Headspace App on post-operative pain and opioid consumption in patients after&#xD;
      arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs, biceps tenodesis, and Mumford procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of mindfulness/meditation on&#xD;
      post-operative pain and opioid consumption. Patients will be randomized into one of two&#xD;
      standardized groups after shoulder arthroscopy: Control group (CON) and&#xD;
      mindfulness/meditation group (MM). All participants will be consented and enrolled into the&#xD;
      study before surgery. Both groups will receive the same standardized method of post-operative&#xD;
      pain medication for post-operative pain relief. Participants in the MM group will utilize a&#xD;
      Headspace application on their smart phone meditate twice a day while the control group will&#xD;
      not perform any meditation or mindfulness. Patient reported outcomes will be collected at&#xD;
      regular intervals. Patients age 18 and older undergoing shoulder arthroscopy for rotator cuff&#xD;
      repair and/or biceps tenodesis and/or Mumford procedure. The study includes 3 visits which&#xD;
      are standard of care pre-operative and post-operative visits. The duration of the study will&#xD;
      be 6 months which will include 3 standard of care post-operative visits and electronic&#xD;
      surveys to track patient reported outcome.&#xD;
