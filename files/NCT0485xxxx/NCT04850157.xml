  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the biological characteristics and liver anatomical characteristics of liver cancer,&#xD;
      liver cancer cells easily invade the vascular system, especially the portal venous system,&#xD;
      forming portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) , and its incidence is reported to be 44.0% ~&#xD;
      62.2%. Once PVTT occurs in patients with liver cancer, the disease develops rapidly, and&#xD;
      intrahepatic and extrahepatic metastasis, portal hypertension, jaundice, and abdominal&#xD;
      effusion can occur in a short time with an average survival time of 2.7 months. PVTT is one&#xD;
      of the major adverse factors for the prognosis of liver cancer and occupies an important&#xD;
      weight influence in the clinical staging system of liver cancer. In some hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma (HCC) patients with PVTT and selective resectability, surgery versus non-surgery&#xD;
      can lead to better survival of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective analysis showed that neoadjuvant radiotherapy can reduce the extent of&#xD;
      invasion of PVTT and improve postoperative survival in some HCC patients. Another prospective&#xD;
      study showed that neoadjuvant radiotherapy could significantly improve the overall survival&#xD;
      of resectable liver cancer with PVTT, and neoadjuvant radiotherapy could improve the 2-year&#xD;
      survival of patients from 9.4% to 27.4% 27.4%, with an effective response of 20.7%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective, single-center, single-arm study to assess the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of neoadjuvant therapy with tislelizumab combined with IMRT for resectable liver&#xD;
      cancer with PVTT.&#xD;
