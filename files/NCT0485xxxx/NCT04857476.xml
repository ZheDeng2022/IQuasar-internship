  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriatic Arthritis is an inflammatory condition that typically affects joints and soft&#xD;
      tissues such as tendons. Poorly controlled or untreated psoriatic arthritis can lead to joint&#xD;
      damage, disability and poor physical and mental wellbeing. Evidence suggests that early&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of psoriatic arthritis can minimise adverse health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Musculoskeletal ultrasound has become an extremely useful tool in aiding rheumatologists to&#xD;
      diagnose inflammatory joint conditions particularly at an early stage in the course of a&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psoriatic arthritis is known to affect up to 30% of patients with skin psoriasis. Therefore,&#xD;
      national dermatology guidelines advise that patients with skin psoriasis should be asked&#xD;
      about any joint symptoms at least every year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study investigates whether skin psoriasis patients who are not on biologic treatment are&#xD;
      indeed being asked about any joint symptoms and we subsequently invite patients for a&#xD;
      musculoskeletal ultrasound scan to see if they have features of early psoriatic arthritis on&#xD;
      ultrasound. Those who do are then invited for a thorough rheumatology clinical assessment.&#xD;
