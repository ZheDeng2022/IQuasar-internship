  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The association of hyperglycaemia in pregnancy (gestational diabetes mellitus; GDM) with&#xD;
      adverse maternal and fetal outcomes is clearly recognised. Traditionally the diagnosis is&#xD;
      made at 28 weeks gestation at which stage children of affected women already have a two-fold&#xD;
      rate of excessive weight gain (abdominal circumference &gt; 90th percentile). This is attributed&#xD;
      to fetal exposure to undiagnosed high blood glucose earlier in pregnancy. Indeed almost 25%&#xD;
      of women with GDM develop the condition before 20 weeks gestation. Interventional studies in&#xD;
      women diagnosed in the late second trimester have shown benefits in reducing fetal&#xD;
      macrosomia. It is unknown whether screening in the first trimester would predict fetal&#xD;
      macrosomia and allow more timely and effective intervention. To examine this question, we&#xD;
      propose a prospective cohort study of 1,662 women at increased risk of GDM to determine if an&#xD;
      elevated HbA1c (39-48mmool/l) in early pregnancy (&lt;14 weeks) can identify babies at risk of&#xD;
      excessive weight gain in later pregnancy, as determined by ultrasound measurement of&#xD;
      abdominal circumference at 28 weeks gestation. The study will be largely integrated into&#xD;
      routine clinical practice enabling a large number of women to participate. Study participants&#xD;
      will all undergo formal screening (75g oral glucose tolerance test) for GDM at 28 weeks&#xD;
      gestation. Secondary outcomes, namely the ability of early pregnancy HbA1c to predict later&#xD;
      maternal GDM, and fetal and maternal complications of pregnancy will also be evaluated. The&#xD;
      results of this study, if positive, are likely to impact upon patient care almost immediately&#xD;
      following study completion. In addition, given the stability of the Northern Ireland&#xD;
      population, the relatively unique data set will facilitate future work on predictive markers&#xD;
      for cardiovascular disease, and prospective studies on the cardiovascular consequences of GDM&#xD;
      on both mother and baby.&#xD;

      Study Aim: The overall aim of this study is to identify a feasible, easily adopted, early&#xD;
      screening method for excessive fetal weight gain; a known risk factor for childhood obesity&#xD;
      and type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To examine the effect of increased (39-48mmol/mol) maternal HbA1c,&#xD;
      measured before 14 weeks gestation, on the ultrasound finding of fetal abdominal&#xD;
      circumference greater than the 90th percentile at 28 weeks gestation. We hypothesise that&#xD;
      women with a high early pregnancy HbA1c (39-48mmol/mol) will have a significantly increased&#xD;
      risk of excessive weight gain in their babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To establish ability of maternal HbA1c in early pregnancy (&lt; 14 weeks) to predict the&#xD;
           diagnosis of GDM in the late second trimester (28 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the effect of an increased (39-48mmol/mol) maternal HbA1c, measured before&#xD;
           14 weeks gestation, on fetal, maternal and neonatal complications of pregnancy&#xD;
           (stillbirth, preterm delivery, birth weight &gt;90th percentile, shoulder dystocia, birth&#xD;
           injury, neonatal hypoglycaemia, neonatal intensive care, caesarean delivery,&#xD;
           preeclampsia, gestational hypertension) taking account of any GDM intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine dietary patterns among women with and without a diagnosis of GDM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Outline: Prospective cohort study of women at increased risk of GDM presenting for&#xD;
      obstetric care at the Royal Jubilee Maternity Hospital Belfast; the largest maternity unit in&#xD;
      Northern Ireland with some 5000-6000 deliveries per year. The study will be conducted over&#xD;
      three years by healthcare staff with support from the research team. The study will largely&#xD;
      be integrated into routine clinical practice thus enabling a large number of women to take&#xD;
      part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: 1,828 women in early pregnancy (≤ 14 weeks gestation) will be recruited,&#xD;
      following informed consent, during their booking visit at the Royal Jubilee Maternity&#xD;
      Hospital, Belfast. Inclusion criteria include age ≥ 18yrs, and NICE risk factors for glucose&#xD;
      intolerance namely body mass index ≥ 30kg/m2, family history of diabetes (first-degree&#xD;
      relative), previous macrosomic baby (&gt;4.5kg) and minority ethnic family origin with a high&#xD;
      prevalence of diabetes14. Exclusion criteria will include pre-existing type 1 or type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, a previous history of GDM, booking HbA1c ≥ 48mmol/mol (6.5%), anaemia&#xD;
      diagnosed on booking full blood count, booking diagnosis of a multiple pregnancy, and use of&#xD;
      corticosteroids or metformin within two weeks of booking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Booking visit: Participants at 10-14 weeks gestation will be consented at their booking&#xD;
      visit. At this visit patient demographics such as height, weight and blood pressure, are&#xD;
      recorded on the Northern Ireland Maternity Information System (NIMATS) by the booking&#xD;
      midwife. Study blood samples (14 mls) will be taken alongside routine antenatal bloods by the&#xD;
      booking midwife, and plasma analysed for HbA1c (4mls) in the Regional Haematology Laboratory&#xD;
      as outlined below. Serum and urine will also be collected (10mls whole blood, 10mls urine),&#xD;
      processed and stored at -80°C for future work. Sample processing (as outlined below) will be&#xD;
      carried out immediately following venesection/urine collection. Women with HbA1c ≥ 48mmol/mol&#xD;
      (6.5%) will informed of their result by telephone (RD); referred for ongoing care at the&#xD;
      Diabetes Antenatal Clinic and excluded from the study. Women with HbA1c &lt; 48mmol/mol (6.5%)&#xD;
      will be recruited to the study but will continue to be managed according to their routine&#xD;
      obstetric care pathway. Women booking at the Royal Jubilee Maternity Hospital will also be&#xD;
      offered ultrasound measurement of visceral/subcutaneous fat depth. This will be performed at&#xD;
      the end of their routine booking ultrasound (RD) and measurements will be recorded in the&#xD;
      study database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nested Observational Study In a subset of women, visceral adipose tissue depth and&#xD;
      subcutaneous adipose tissue depth will be measured using the technique described by Martin et&#xD;
      al following booking ultrasonography. Measurements will be taken with the participant&#xD;
      recumbent and measurements taken approximately 1cm above the umbilicus in triplicate. These&#xD;
      measurements will be added to the dataset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      28 weeks: Oral Glucose Tolerance Test: All participants will be invited to attend for a 75g&#xD;
      oral glucose tolerance test at 28 weeks gestation as part of their routine clinical care14.&#xD;
      Testing will be performed by clinical midwives in the Day Obstetric Unit. The test will take&#xD;
      place in the morning following an overnight fast from 10pm the evening before. Maternal&#xD;
      weight will be recorded at this visit. Baseline bloods (24mls in total) will be taken for&#xD;
      glucose (4mls) and storage (20mls). Following a drink containing 75g glucose, blood will be&#xD;
      taken after 60min and 120mins for glucose (4mls) and storage (4mls). Samples for storage will&#xD;
      be processed following collection. Glucose will be analysed in the Regional Biochemistry&#xD;
      Laboratory immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma glucose results will available within 4 hours of each OGTT. World Health Organisation&#xD;
      criteria will be used to diagnose GDM (fasting glucose ≥ 5.1mmol/l; 1-hr ≥ 10.0mmol/l; 2-hr&#xD;
      8.5mmol/l)15. Each woman will be contacted with the results of their OGTT as per our routine&#xD;
      practice with immediate referral to the Diabetes Antenatal Clinic for those diagnosed with&#xD;
      GDM. Glucose results will be inputted to the study dataset on a daily basis using a unique&#xD;
      patient identifier. Samples for storage will be processed as outlined below. Participant&#xD;
      weights will also be entered into a database on a daily basis and linked to&#xD;
      clinical/biochemical data via a unique patient identifier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      28 weeks: Fetal ultrasound: At the time of their OGTT, participants will also attend the&#xD;
      study ultrasonographer for their study ultrasound scan. Abdominal circumference, head&#xD;
      circumference, femur length and estimated fetal weight will be measured using the ellipse&#xD;
      function on a Voluson E8 ultrasound scanner at the recommended anatomical sites25. The&#xD;
      ultrasonographer will be experienced in fetal ultrasound and blinded to early pregnancy HbA1c&#xD;
      results. The same scanner will be used for all study participants. Ultrasound measurements&#xD;
      will be recorded initially on a study case report form and transferred daily to the&#xD;
      electronic study database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      28 weeks: Food Frequency Questionnaire: Each participant will be asked to complete a food&#xD;
      frequency questionnaire whilst waiting for blood sampling during their OGTT. This is to&#xD;
      evaluate dietary patterns of women with and without GDM and will provide a basis from which&#xD;
      future dietary interventions can be formed. The questionnaire used is a validated&#xD;
      questionnaire used recently in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Children&#xD;
      (http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivery: Each participant will continue their usual obstetric care following their 28 week&#xD;
      appointment. At the end of the study, obstetric outcome information will be extracted from&#xD;
      the Northern Ireland Maternity Information System (NIMATS) and, if necessary, paper records.&#xD;
      This will include gestational age at delivery, mode of delivery and the fetal, maternal and&#xD;
      early neonatal complications as outlined above in the objectives. Delivery outcomes will be&#xD;
      linked to the study data using matched unique participant identifiers.&#xD;
