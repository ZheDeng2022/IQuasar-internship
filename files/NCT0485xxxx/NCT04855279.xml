    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the use of different desensitizing agents before in-office&#xD;
      bleaching. A total of 64 volunteers were randomly divided into four groups. Before undergoing&#xD;
      in-office bleaching with 38% hydrogen peroxide gel (three applications of 15 minutes each,&#xD;
      one session), clinicians applied a placebo gel (control group), casein&#xD;
      phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP), neutral sodium fluoride gel (NSF), or&#xD;
      nano-hydroxyapatite solution (n-HAP) on all buccal surfaces of teeth. The gel was left&#xD;
      undisturbed for 4 minutes. Patients recorded their tooth sensitivities on the VAS scale.&#xD;
      Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare changes in tooth&#xD;
      color and intensity of tooth sensitivity between groups.&#xD;

      Color evaluation was performed with Vita Shade Guide Classical (Vitapan Classical, Vita, Bad&#xD;
      Sakingen, Germany). The shades were evaluated with shade guide units (SGUs). Vita Classical&#xD;
      Shade Guide consisted of 16 shades, and the shades were aligned light-to-dark from B1-C4.21,&#xD;
      22 The shades were taken before and after 24 hours and 7 days of treatment.Next, the&#xD;
      hypersensitivity was recorded by asking each subject to establish his or her perception of&#xD;
      sensitivity before treatment using a visual analog scale (VAS). A stimulus of an evaporative&#xD;
      blowing triple syringe (25 psi at ambient conditions) was applied for 3 seconds on the upper&#xD;
      central incisors from a distance of 1 cm. After 24 hours and 7 days of bleaching treatment,&#xD;
      stimuli testing was performed again.The subjects were divided into four groups. Group 1.&#xD;
      Subjects were treated with a placebo gel. The agent was applied for 4 min. to all the teeth&#xD;
      to be bleached. Group 2. Subjects were treated with ACP-CCP gel (Tooth Mousse, GC Corp.,&#xD;
      Tokyo, Japan) for 4 min. to all the teeth to be bleached. Group 3. Subjects were treated with&#xD;
      nano-hydroxyapatite solution for 4 min. to all the teeth to be bleached. Group 4. Subjects&#xD;
      were treated with neutral sodium fluoride (NSF) gel for 4 min. to all the teeth to be&#xD;
      bleached. After treatment, the agent was removed by washing with water in all groups. Each&#xD;
      subject underwent one session of bleaching on the anterior teeth from canine-to-canine.&#xD;
      Bleaching systems were applied according to the manufacturer's instructions by one of the&#xD;
      authors. Subjects were treated with hydrogen peroxide at 38% activated by a light source&#xD;
      composed of 12 LEDs with blue light generators. The calculated hypersensitivity values and&#xD;
      color change values were tested with Shapiro-Wilk and Levene tests for normal data&#xD;
      distribution and homogeneity of variances. Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Mann-Whitney U&#xD;
      test was performed to compare groups.&#xD;
