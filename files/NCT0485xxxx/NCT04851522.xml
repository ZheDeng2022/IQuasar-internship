  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is looking at the safety of applying dilute bleach compresses to patients&#xD;
      receiving radiation therapy and the impact of these dilute bleach compresses on the frequency&#xD;
      and severity of skin changes that occur during radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Di-Dak-Sol: dilute bleach compresses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  White petrolatum ointment&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a planned open-label prospective clinical trial to determine the safety of applying&#xD;
      dilute bleach compresses to pediatric patients being treated for rhabdomyosarcoma and other&#xD;
      soft tissue and bone sarcomas with radiation therapy (RT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is interested in finding out whether dilute bleach compresses are safe to apply&#xD;
      and evaluating their impact on the frequency and severity of skin changes that occur in&#xD;
      children who are receiving radiation therapy for cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This information may help treat other patients receiving radiation therapy for cancer&#xD;
      treatment in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      weekly evaluations and follow up visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive study treatment throughout their radiation therapy and for one week&#xD;
      after. They will be followed for one month after the completion of radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 12 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;

Participants will also be asked to apply white petrolatum ointment 2x daily throughout treatment: once after radiation and once in the evening.&#xD;
Participants will be provided with a log and asked to document information (dates/times of application) about the study treatment .</description>
