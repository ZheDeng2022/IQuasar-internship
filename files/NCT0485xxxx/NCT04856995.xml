      This study; It was planned to (1) determine the effect of surgical smoke on indoor air&#xD;
      quality and (2) examine its effect on physical symptoms and throat culture results in&#xD;
      operating room employees and compare it with those working in internal units.&#xD;

      Background:This study is a experimental study. The aim of this study is; to determine the&#xD;
      effect of surgical smoke containing toxic chemicals on indoor air quality and to examine the&#xD;
      physical symptoms of employees in the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:It was carried out in general surgery operating room between June 2020 and July 2020&#xD;
      In the study, 45 air samples were taken from the with active sampling method before, during&#xD;
      and after surgery. Physical complaints of 19 people working in the operating room were asked&#xD;
      and throat cultures were taken before and after surgery. These results were compared with&#xD;
      those working in internal units. Data were analyzed using a statistics program.&#xD;
