    <textblock>
      The study will be a multi-national, endpoint-driven, randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, adaptive study in which participating adults will be randomized 1:1 to&#xD;
      receive 2 doses of either candidate vaccine or placebo on Day 0 and 28. A total of 28,000&#xD;
      healthy adults aged 18 years and older will be enrolled and followed for efficacy, safety,&#xD;
      and immunogenicity evaluations.&#xD;
