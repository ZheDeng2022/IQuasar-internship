    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether participation in the Play and Learning&#xD;
      Strategies (PALS) parenting intervention results in increased caregiver responsiveness&#xD;
      behaviors and to test if participation in PALS results in increases in toddler skills and/or&#xD;
      toddler neurological development.&#xD;

    <description>In this task the child will interact with their parent in a &quot;free play&quot; task for 10 minutes with a set of standardized toys, and the interaction will be videotaped. Parents are asked to play with their children in &quot;typical ways&quot; with a few constraints (e.g., television must be off). Behavior will be coded and assigned a score of how of 1-5 which indicates how often the assessed behavior occurs: 5 (Almost Always); 4 (greater than half the time); 3 (half the time); 2 (less than half the time); 1 (None of the time).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-test-2 (4 months after post test1)</time_frame>
    <description>This task measures child skill related to problem solving through goal-directed play. For this task, the child is videotaped while playing alone with five sequentially presented toys, each presented for 2mins. The video will be subsequently coded by dividing the play session into 10 second intervals. Level of the child's play is coded based on a hierarchical level-of-play scale ranging from 1 (off task) to 13 (goal-directed play with mastery).</description>

    <measure>Change in Child working memory as assessed by the 3-6-9 box task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-test-2 (4 months after post test1)</time_frame>
    <description>This task measures child working memory. During the task, children are asked to search 3-, then 6-, then 9- box arrays for hidden rewards. Children are asked to search individual boxes in the array one at a time and to keep track of the boxes that were previously searched. Between each search attempt, the boxes are covered which requires children to remember which boxes were previously searched. The task begins with a 3-box array where children are given 10 trials to find three rewards. Children who complete the 3-box array will move on to a 6-box array where they will have 20 trials to locate six rewards. Children will only progress to the nine-box array (max. 30 trials) if the six-box array is completed in 14 trials or less. Score is reported as the number of rewards found divided by the number of total reaches.</description>

    <description>In this assessment, children are seated across a table from an assessor and are told that they will receive a present but that the present must be wrapped. The experimenter asks that the child turns their back and does not peek while she wraps the present because seeing it ruins the surprise. While the child is turned away, the experimenter noisily wraps for 1 minute. After this portion is complete, the experimenter tells the child that she forgot to put a bow on the gift, and asks the child to wait and not touch the box until she returns with a bow. The experimenter leaves for 2 minutes. Child's self-restraint is scored from 0-3 where 0 = no peeking, 1=Child looks over shoulder to peek, 2=child turns body in seat to peek, and 3 = child left her seat.</description>

    <measure>Change in Noncompliance behaviors of child toward parent as measured by the Tool task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-test-2 (4 months after post test1)</time_frame>
    <description>The parent and child complete two problem solving tasks that are graded in difficulty. The assessor explains the problem to the parent and gives the tool and apparatus to the child. The parent is instructed to allow the child to solve the problem independently, but provide as much help as they believe the child needs. Task 1 is the &quot;tube task&quot;, in which the child has to insert a stick inside a tube to get a toy. Task 2 is the &quot;clear box task&quot; that requires the child to place a toy brick on a lever, which raises the lever to the top of the box, in which a toy becomes available. Only children who pass task 1 will go on to task 2. Noncompliance is scored from 1-6, and a higher score indicates greater non-compliance behaviors.</description>

    <measure>Change in Attention Disengagement to Positive and Negative Emotions as assessed by total time child looked at faces on screen during the looking task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-test 2 (4 months after post test1)</time_frame>
    <description>Children will complete a looking task in which fearful, happy, neutral, and control faces are presented individually on a screen. After the looking task, the child will complete an overlap task with the same stimuli. First, child's attention will be directed to the center of the screen with an 'attention-getter'. After attention is fixated for 1 second, a face appears centered on the screen. After 1 second, a distractor image appears in the periphery either to the right or left and remains on the screen for 3 seconds.</description>

    <description>The Play and Learning Strategies (PALS) intervention provides parents with behaviors that, collectively, are known as a responsive parenting style. Four constructs make up this responsive parenting style: 1) contingent responsiveness, (responses are conditionally linked to the child's signals) 2) warm sensitivity (high levels of affection and understanding of child states), 3) maintaining vs. redirecting attention, and 4) verbal scaffolding (providing child appropriate language supports). Parents assigned to this intervention will be paired with a coach who will guide them through the program over the course of 9 weekly sessions. The intervention (ePALS) will be implemented via an internet adaptation through the Children's Learning Institute's ENGAGE platform. However, ePALS could easily be adapted for other platforms and accessed with any web-enabled device.</description>

    <description>Families assigned to the control condition will be provided with a website with information corresponding to milestones of toddler development. Control families will be asked to review that week's materials before the each of the 9 weekly coach calls. The active control condition serves three important purposes: 1) Maintains an active line of communication and accurate contact records for Post-test 1 and Post-test 2 session scheduling; 2) Masks participant's awareness of intervention vs. control assignment; and 3) Approximates communication with intervention staff such that results showing ePALS effects are attributable to intervention rather than regular communication with an interventionist.</description>
