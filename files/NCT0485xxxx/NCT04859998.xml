  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to evaluate the effects of a dog-assisted therapy program on physical function and&#xD;
      communication in a sample comprised of 24 adults with autism spectrum disorder. The sample&#xD;
      will be divided into 2 groups, a control group and an experimental group. Changes after 10&#xD;
      weeks (20 sessions) will be compared between-groups.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention program will consist of 20 sessions conducted twice a week in the facilities&#xD;
      of the collaborator associations. Each session will be conducted in groups of 3 participants&#xD;
      and will last 30 minutes. It will include a welcome part, a main part (based on different&#xD;
      activities and physical exercises with the dog) and a closing part to say goodbye to the&#xD;
      dogs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical function measures will be conducted before and after the completion of the study.&#xD;
      The interaction and communication will be assessed during the sessions in the first, tenth&#xD;
      and last ones.&#xD;
