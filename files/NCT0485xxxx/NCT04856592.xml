  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The APAC VICI Study is a prospective, non-randomized, multicenter, single-arm study. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical results of using the Boston Scientifc's&#xD;
      Vici Venous Stent (Vici stent) to treat significant blockage in the iliofemoral veins under&#xD;
      the guidance of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) in ethnic Chinese patient population. The&#xD;
      study will assess the safety and effectiveness of Vici stent implanted under the guidance of&#xD;
      the Boston Scientific's IVUS technology (by using Opticross 35 catheter) for treating adult&#xD;
      ethnic Chinese patients with symptomatic chronic venous obstruction in the iliofemoral veins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the trial, anticoagulant or antiplatlet therapy will be administered for 6 - 12 months&#xD;
      post index procedure. Ongoing dynamic data safety monitoring will be performed throughout the&#xD;
      trial to minimize subject risk. All enrolled subjects receiving the Vici stent treatment will&#xD;
      be followed for 24 months post index procedure.&#xD;
