    <textblock>
      Previous studies used spatial frequency analysis of tendon ultrasound images and considered&#xD;
      that the parameters can reflect the micro-structure of the tendon. In this study, we try to&#xD;
      recruit and analysis the rotator cuff tendon in healthy adults with different ages and&#xD;
      different equipment to explore the the normal range and differences of spatial frequency&#xD;
      parameters. The hypotheses of this study are (1) the young and the elderly would have&#xD;
      significantly different spatial frequency value; and (2) there would be significant different&#xD;
      results between different equipment.&#xD;

      Tendons are hierarchical fibrous tissues. The speckle signals of ultrasonic images have&#xD;
      parallel stripes arranged along the long axis of the tendon, reflecting the arrangement of&#xD;
      collagen fiber bundles in the tendon. The micro-structure of tendons can be quantified by&#xD;
      analyzing the speckle pattern of ultrasonic images. A research team used fast Fourier&#xD;
      transform to convert ultrasound images of tendons into two-dimensional spatial frequency&#xD;
      spectra, and used linear discriminate analysis to calculate multiple spatial frequency&#xD;
      parameters. The results indicated that there were 5 parameters with the highest accuracy in&#xD;
      discriminating Achilles tendinopathy. There is a significant difference in the spectrum&#xD;
      frequency parameters of whether the tendon was loaded and whether there was a tendinopathy&#xD;
      tendon. Past studies using spatial frequency analysis in patients with shoulder pain, and&#xD;
      they found that there was no significant difference between the asymptomatic control group&#xD;
      and shoulder pain patients. The risk factors of rotator cuff tendon injury is related&#xD;
      advanced age, dominant hand, and repeated overhead activities. Therefore, in this study, we&#xD;
      will recruit participants of different ages and investigate the results of spatial frequency&#xD;
      analysis of bilateral shoulders ultrasound images. The aim of this study is to know whether&#xD;
      these factors may affect the micro-structure of the rotator cuff tendons and establish the&#xD;
      reference norm of spatial frequency analysis parameters in those without obvious tendon&#xD;
      degeneration or injury. In addition, we aim to compare the differences between spectrum&#xD;
      analysis parameters with several instruments by using different ultrasonic equipment. This&#xD;
      study could provide a reference for the clinical application of spatial frequency analysis in&#xD;
      tendon ultrasound images.&#xD;
