    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the feasibility of delivering symptom-triggered alcohol withdrawal&#xD;
      management by telemedicine and determine whether this intervention is satisfactory to&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single-arm pilot feasibility study will recruit actively drinking participants with a&#xD;
      history of alcohol withdrawal in order to provide remotely monitored symptom-triggered&#xD;
      alcohol withdrawal treatment using telemedicine. Participants will initially complete a&#xD;
      screening and eligibility visit. If eligible, participants will then be scheduled for 3-day&#xD;
      remote withdrawal management (which can be extended by 1-2 days if medically indicated).&#xD;
      During remote withdrawal management, participants will receive symptom-triggered diazepam&#xD;
      treatment using a modified version of the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for&#xD;
      Alcohol Scale, revised (CIWA-Ar). Within one week following termination of withdrawal&#xD;
      treatment, participants will be scheduled for a remote follow up visit in which they will&#xD;
      complete patient satisfaction questionnaires and will be offered weekly counselling sessions&#xD;
      and anticraving medication to prevent relapse to alcohol use. Approximately 30 days following&#xD;
      treatment initiation, relapse to alcohol use will be assessed.&#xD;
