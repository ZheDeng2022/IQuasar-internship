  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine how we can best support coaches to implement an injury&#xD;
      prevention (IP) program (Prep-to-Play) in female community Australian Football. We will&#xD;
      recruit at least 2,600 female community footballers aged &gt; 14years from 15 different football&#xD;
      leagues. We will train and support coaches to implement the IP program and evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of the IP program on injuries across two football seasons.&#xD;

      Primary Aim: To compare the impact of supported and unsupported implementation strategies on&#xD;
      the use of an IP program (Prep-to-Play) in female community Australian Football.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the effects of supported implementation of Prep-to-Play on injury risk&#xD;
           reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identify barriers and enablers to sustainability of the Prep-to-Play implementation&#xD;
           model, and develop clear recommendations for a future, sustainable national roll out of&#xD;
           Prep-to-Play.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Prep-to-Play.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that supported implementation will result in increased use of&#xD;
      Prep-to-Play in female community Australian Football compared to unsupported implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary hypotheses are that the supported implementation of Prep-to-Play will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  result in a reduction of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in females&#xD;
           participating in community Australian Football;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  result in a reduction of other musculoskeletal injuries and concussion among females&#xD;
           participating in community Australian Football;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  be more cost-effective than the unsupported implementation.&#xD;

    <intervention_model>Crossover Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>Stepped-wedge randomised controlled trial. Prior to study initiation, the leagues will be randomly allocated to one of the five wedges for time of crossover from the control to the intervention phase using a computer-generated list of random numbers provided by a statistician. The randomisation sequence will be concealed to the coaches until shortly before the switch (~four weeks to allow time to organise their workshop).</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>It will not be possible to blind all involved research fellows, or the Prep-to-Play Physiotherapists involved in the project, but the statistician who will perform statistical analyses for the primary and secondary outcomes will remain blinded.&#xD;
To optimise allocation concealment: i) each cluster will be a league or leagues in a unique geographical area; ii) data collection at all sites will commence in the control period, iii) team designate and/or sports trainers will remain blinded to allocation sequence; iv) Prep-to-Play observers validating the primary outcome (Prep-to-Play implementation) will be independent to the club and blinded to allocation; v) research fellows collecting injury data will be independent of the club and blinded to allocation.</masking_description>
  </study_design_info>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Use of Prep-to-Play (Primary outcome)</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Use of Prep-to-Play will be calculated as the proportion of all possible team sessions (training and games) where Prep-to-Play essential components were completed.&#xD;
The primary outcome assessor will be the Team Designate (i.e., nominated team manager, or team representative) who will record (via the Smartabase App or website) whether essential components of Prep-to-Play were completed at each training session and games.&#xD;
In addition to the Team Designate, Prep-to-Play Observers (research assistants blinded to randomisation) will make five random visits (≥one prior to the intervention period and ≥two after the intervention period) to observe the execution of Prep-to-Play in order to validate team use data from the Team Designates.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of players with an ACL injury (Secondary outcome)</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary injuries of interest are ACL injuries and concussion. An ACL/all other injuries will be defined as any injury occurring during a football match or training that results in a player being unable to return to the field of play for that match, or missing at least one match.&#xD;
ACL injury definition&#xD;
• Ruptured ACL is confirmed by clinical examination, with or without magnetic resonance imaging or surgery.&#xD;
Injury data will be collected via two methods to minimise missing data: (i) sports trainer; (ii) direct from player</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of players with a concussion (Secondary outcome)</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>A head injury will be defined as any injury to the head region occurring during a football match or training, regardless of time loss.&#xD;
Concussion definition&#xD;
• Direct or indirect impact to the head resulting in loss of consciousness and/or any of the following clinical symptoms (memory loss, headache, dizziness, nausea, difficulty concentrating, feeling like being in a fog, feeling not quite right).&#xD;
Injury data will be collected via two methods to minimise missing data: (i) sports trainer; (ii) direct from player</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of player hours (training and match)</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The number of match and training hours will be combined to measure total exposure. Player hours will be collected via three methods to minimise missing data: i) team designate reporting training and match hours, ii) publicly available online match data, and iii) directly from the players.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Healthcare utilisation</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Healthcare use for players sustaining a knee or head injury will be obtained by the blinded research officer to estimate healthcare costs of sustaining an injury to inform health economic evaluation.</description>

    <description>Our supported implementation approach is designed to improve uptake of Prep-to-Play. The Prep-to-Play program consists of four components: dynamic warm-up, strength training, football fundamentals, and education. At the start of the intervention period, Prep-to-Play Physiotherapists will conduct a 3-hour workshop for coaches and influential players. Ongoing support will be provided via a range of strategies. Prep-to-Play Physiotherapists will attend training (two times) during and immediately post implementation to provide coaches with support (feedback on missing components, player technique, questions). Monthly Coaches Shed; Online drop-in session with education component to meet other coaches (peer support &amp; networking) and ask questions. Refresher workshops will be run in pre-season 2022 for the teams who have received the intervention in 2021.</description>

Access to the Prep-to-Play resources, including videos, downloadable manuals and posters, are freely available to coaches online. The online resources incorporate the same four concepts as described in the supported implementation - dynamic warm-up, strength exercises, football fundamentals, and education. In the control arm, no additional resources, education, or support will be provided.</description>
