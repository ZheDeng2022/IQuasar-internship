  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today, primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is considered to be a safe and successful&#xD;
      therapy for end-stage osteoarthritis of the knee. In the past decades, different total knee&#xD;
      prostheses have been released on the market showing minor or more important differences in&#xD;
      design features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smith and Nephew® (Memphis, Tennessee, USA) introduced a new posterior sacrificing (PS)&#xD;
      design in 2005, which was called Journey BCS®, a bicruciate stabilizing design throughout&#xD;
      knee flexion. This second generation guided motion total knee system prevents not only tibial&#xD;
      posterior translation, but also limits tibial anterior translations by articulation between&#xD;
      post and femoral box. As a consequence of the good results in the older population group, an&#xD;
      increasing amount of younger and more active patients receiving TKA can be observed. In&#xD;
      general, this age group scores remarkable lower in satisfaction. A possible explanation is&#xD;
      the absence of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in these designs, which still causes abnormal&#xD;
      kinematics. Therefore, in a further step, the research has been focusing on preserving both&#xD;
      cruciate ligaments within the same basic design as Journey BCS®, keeping the curvature and&#xD;
      contour of the femoral and tibial component, as well as the joint line principles.&#xD;
      Consequently, a bi-cruciate retaining (BCR) design was developed, preserving both the ACL and&#xD;
      posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BCR TKA of Smith &amp; Nephew, called Journey XR®, has a clear potential to result in a better&#xD;
      functional outcome while avoiding the limitations and complications of previous other designs&#xD;
      so that previously disappointing results of the pasts are not confirmed. As a result,&#xD;
      patients are expected to be more capable to return to an active lifestyle with normal&#xD;
      kinematics and proprioception of the knee. New insights in biomechanics, kinetics and&#xD;
      proprioception in native knee and TKA make higher interest in BCR TKA inevitable. Yet, there&#xD;
      is no prospective clinical trial available that compares Journey BCS® with Journey XR® from&#xD;
      Smith &amp; Nephew in regard to PROMS, functional performance including gait analysis, survival&#xD;
      and revision rates.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Today, primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is considered to be a safe and successful&#xD;
      therapy for end-stage osteoarthritis of the knee. In the past decades, different total knee&#xD;
      prostheses have been released on the market showing minor or more important differences in&#xD;
      design features. As such, knee prostheses can differ in the level of constraint they provide.&#xD;
      More specifically, for a few decades, two main designs were available for clinical use.&#xD;
      First, designs that only sacrifice the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), but retain the&#xD;
      patient's own posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), the so-called cruciate retaining (CR)&#xD;
      design, and secondly, designs that sacrifice the patient's ACL and PCL, the so-called&#xD;
      posterior sacrificing (PS) design. The CR design has been considered historically as the&#xD;
      least constrained design. The containment can be adjusted by equalizing the cavity and&#xD;
      geometry of tibial end femoral surfaces. The PS knee design, known by the cam-post mechanism,&#xD;
      offers more constrain, but sacrifices both cruciate ligaments. In terms of complications and&#xD;
      outcome no difference can be found between PS and CR knee designs. However, the last decade,&#xD;
      prosthetic research focused more and more on the preservation of both PCL and ACL, in an&#xD;
      attempt to mimic better natural kinematic behaviour of the knee and to keep the&#xD;
      proprioceptive function of the ACL and PCL vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smith and Nephew® (Memphis, Tennessee, USA) introduced a new PS design in 2005, which was&#xD;
      called Journey BCS®, a bicruciate stabilizing design throughout knee flexion. This second&#xD;
      generation guided motion total knee system prevents not only tibial posterior translation,&#xD;
      but also limits tibial anterior translations by articulation between post and femoral box.&#xD;
      The main purpose of this type of TKA was to achieve a more normal and natural kinematic&#xD;
      behavior with more lateral posterior roll back, while keeping the medial side stable and&#xD;
      preserving the normal natural joint line inclination. In particular, the medial femoral&#xD;
      condyle is more distal than lateral condyle. There is a 3° varus joint line and the convex&#xD;
      lateral tibial surface in sagittal plane creates a slight posterior slope. More anterior&#xD;
      translation of the femur is seen with CR design during flexion allowing possibly little more&#xD;
      flexion in BCS design. However, although the specific design properties of this prosthesis&#xD;
      tended to mimic the stabilizing function of the natural cruciate ligaments much better, the&#xD;
      patient's ACL is still sacrificed and at least its proprioceptive function is still&#xD;
      completely lost. Mid-term results of Journey II BCS® are similar compared to other knee&#xD;
      designs. However, the younger population group seems to end up with better scores when&#xD;
      looking at postoperative clinical and functional results. As a consequence of the good&#xD;
      results in the older population group, an increasing amount of younger and more active&#xD;
      patients receiving TKA can be observed. Unfortunately, a significant part of these young&#xD;
      patients keeps complaining of residual symptoms and pain in the knee after TKA. In general,&#xD;
      this age group scores remarkable lower in satisfaction. A possible explanation is the absence&#xD;
      of ACL in these designs, which still causes abnormal kinematics. Furthermore, the loss of its&#xD;
      proprioceptive function might be a factor in the mentioned feeling of imperfection.&#xD;
      Therefore, in a further step, the research has been focusing on preserving both cruciate&#xD;
      ligaments within the same basic design as Journey BCS®, keeping the curvature and contour of&#xD;
      the femoral and tibial component, as well as the joint line principles. Consequently, a&#xD;
      bi-cruciate retaining (BCR) design was developed, preserving both the ACL and PCL vessels.&#xD;
      Patients retain better knee kinematics, stability, proprioception and consequently better&#xD;
      functionality and satisfaction by retaining ACL in TKA. Although the design is available on&#xD;
      the American market for about five years, and since 2 years also on the European market, it&#xD;
      is still not widely used, even not by surgeons who are familiar with the other designs of the&#xD;
      same prosthetic line. One of the reasons therefore might be the published higher rates of&#xD;
      early revisions or poly exchange of another recent design in which both cruciate ligaments&#xD;
      are preserved, released on the market by another prosthetic company a few years earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BCR TKA of Smith &amp; Nephew, called Journey XR®, is designed to retain both cruciate ligaments.&#xD;
      Journey XR® design has a clear potential to result in a better functional outcome while&#xD;
      avoiding the limitations and complications of previous other designs so that previously&#xD;
      disappointing results of the pasts are not confirmed. As a result, patients are expected to&#xD;
      be more capable to return to an active lifestyle with normal kinematics and proprioception of&#xD;
      the knee. Journey XR® preserves specific features of Journey BCS®, such as asymmetric femoral&#xD;
      condyles, 3° varus joint line and low constraint concave medial and convex lateral articular&#xD;
      surface. In order to preserve both cruciate ligaments Journey XR® design has some&#xD;
      adjustments, which are mentioned here. Tibial base plate design with continuous keel and&#xD;
      anterior bridge, consists of high-quality forged Ti-6Al-4V which is less stiff. These tibial&#xD;
      component updates were implemented to reduce the risk of bone resorption from stress&#xD;
      shielding and to double fatigue strength compared to BCR design of another company. Fixation&#xD;
      of tibial Journey XR® baseplate, which is provided with an asymmetrical notch to accept ACL&#xD;
      footprint, is based on four-corner peg fixation with maximal bone coverage and good results&#xD;
      compared to known knee designs with stem fixation. Furthermore, tibial insert lock is&#xD;
      optimized. Previous total knee designs of Smith and Nephew® already proved very limited poly&#xD;
      wear when using highly cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) in combination with OXINIUM,&#xD;
      according to VERILAST® technology. Approximately 4000 Journey XR® procedures have been done&#xD;
      globally in the last 3 years in 10 countries, among which US, Japan, South Africa and some&#xD;
      countries in Western EU like Belgium. Currently 21% of these cases is placed using NAVIO®&#xD;
      robot technology but this proportion is growing. Present literature is clear that retention&#xD;
      of ACL and PCL has significant higher satisfaction compared to TKA patients, as with partial&#xD;
      knee arthroplasty. Moreover, last update of journey XR® design of 2017 had interesting&#xD;
      solutions for the limitations of the mentioned previous design. Problems like tibia poly&#xD;
      wear, tibia insert lock and implant strength were common. New insights in biomechanics,&#xD;
      kinetics and proprioception in native knee and TKA make higher interest in BCR TKA&#xD;
      inevitable. Yet, there is no prospective clinical trial available that compares Journey BCS®&#xD;
      with Journey XR® from Smith &amp; Nephew in regard to PROMS, functional performance including&#xD;
      gait analysis, survival and revision rates.&#xD;
