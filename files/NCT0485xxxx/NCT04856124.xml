  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of intranasal esketamine as maintenance&#xD;
      antidepressant therapy in patients who have demonstrated clinical improvement with off-label&#xD;
      intravenous racemic ketamine for treatment-resistant depression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective case series of ten consecutive outpatients with treatment-resistant&#xD;
      depression who all had a clinically meaningful response when treated with intravenous racemic&#xD;
      ketamine and were then switched to intranasal esketamine for maintenance therapy. Efficacy&#xD;
      and adverse effects were assessed at each treatment All patients underwent an extensive&#xD;
      consenting process with a detailed discussion about the off-label use of IV racemic ketamine&#xD;
      for TRD and known risks of the treatment. Other available approved therapies were offered&#xD;
      including alternative medication, TMS, ECT, and VNS. All patients signed an informed consent&#xD;
      form prior to treatment and a consent form allowing their data to be used for retrospective&#xD;
      research reporting. All patients had baseline lab work and an electrocardiogram to determine&#xD;
      medical stability. Patients were encouraged to undergo a series of six ketamine infusions&#xD;
      over 14 to 21 days. If a response (&gt;50% improvement) or partial response (25-50% improvement)&#xD;
      occurred as determined by a reduction of Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS),&#xD;
      Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9), and/or a Clinical Global Impressions - Improvement&#xD;
      (CGI-I) rating of 3 or more and infusions were well tolerated, patients were offered weekly&#xD;
      infusions for four weeks. Patients then had the option of receiving successive maintenance&#xD;
      infusions with variable frequency depending on individual patient response and preference.&#xD;
      Vital sign and clinical monitoring, dosing, and frequency of IV ketamine treatment were based&#xD;
      on the published available data in this area.Treatment with IV ketamine was initiated at&#xD;
      subanesthetic doses of 0.5mg/kg with flexible dosing based on response and tolerability up to&#xD;
      1.0mg/kg. Patient's oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and pulse were monitored continuously&#xD;
      with pulse oximetry and Caretaker Â® finger sensor. Patients that transitioned to IN&#xD;
      esketamine received an initial dose of 28mg (n=1) or 56mg (n=9) of IN esketamine and all&#xD;
      patients were eventually titrated up to a target dose of 84mg for the remainder of&#xD;
      treatments. All patients were monitored as required by the REMS protocol for IN esketamine.&#xD;
      Prior to treatment at the beginning of each clinic visit, MADRS and PHQ-9 were completed. CGI&#xD;
      ratings were obtained by the treating physician at each treatment. All treatments were&#xD;
      administered on-site at the clinic and any adverse effects related to treatment with IV&#xD;
      ketamine or IN esketamine were captured through spontaneous reporting and rated as mild,&#xD;
      moderate, and severe at the discretion of the treating psychiatrist.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects had a clinically meaningful response to IV racemic ketamine and remained on other psychotropic medications during treatment with both IV ketamine and IN esketamine. Concomitant medication classes included CNS stimulants (n = 7), atypical antipsychotics (n = 6), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (n = 5), serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (n = 4), anticonvulsants (n = 3), antipsychotics (n = 3), mood stabilizers (n = 3), benzodiazepines (n = 2), norepinephrine/dopamine reuptake inhibitors (n = 2), alpha 2 antagonists (n=1), and sedative hypnotics (n = 1). Two patients (20%) previously underwent ECT with partial but transient relief from depressive symptoms, two (20%) failed TMS, and no patients reported any period of greater than 50% improvement during their current depressive episode prior to ketamine treatment.</description>

        Six females and four males with a mean age of 41.1 years. Nine (90%) had one or more&#xD;
        psychiatric diagnoses, including generalized anxiety disorder (n = 9), attention deficit&#xD;
        hyperactivity disorder (n = 4), post-traumatic stress disorder (n = 3), and panic disorder&#xD;
        (n = 1). Six (60%) were unemployed at baseline due to the disabling effects of their&#xD;
        depression and five (50%) reported daily suicidal ideation prior to treatment. The duration&#xD;
        of the current depressive episode ranged between 5 and 20 years.&#xD;
