  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavac, one of the vaccines developed within the scope of combating the COVID-19 pandemic&#xD;
      that has surrounded the world for a year, started to be applied in the first healthcare&#xD;
      workers in our country. In this important step taken to end the pandemic, information on&#xD;
      vaccines is still limited. Most vaccines, including the Coronavac vaccine, are applied with&#xD;
      approval for emergency use before phase 3 studies are fully completed. While investigating&#xD;
      the effect of the vaccine on the virus, possible side effects should also be considered. In&#xD;
      this context, it is not known whether the vaccine has an effect on the menstrual cycle,&#xD;
      especially of women of reproductive age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary aim in our study is to evaluate the effect of the vaccine on the menstrual cycle&#xD;
      and if the vaccine has any effect on the menstrual cycle, what kind of changes this effect&#xD;
      causes.&#xD;

      The survey contains 20 questions aimed at obtaining information about the menstrual cycles of&#xD;
      health workers before and after vaccination. Demographic data of the participants are also&#xD;
      taken.&#xD;

    <description>The change in the menstrual cycle of vaccinated healthcare workers after the first or the second dose is questioned with 20 questions. The content of the question consists of yes and no questions explaining the general epidemiological data of the patients and the amount of menstruation. These questions question the amount and change of menstruation before and after the vaccine.</description>
