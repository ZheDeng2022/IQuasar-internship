    <ipd_time_frame>A major focus of this work is sharing and dissemination of the image acquisition and analysis methods we develop as well as standard operating procedures for 129Xe MRI. In all instances we will adhere to the NIH Sharing Policies and Related Guidance on NIH-Funded Research Resources for Recipients of NIH Grants and Contracts on Obtaining (https://grants.nih.gov/policy/sharing.htm) and Disseminating Biomedical Research Re-sources (issued December 1999). However, we intend to greatly exceed these requirements, making as much of our work freely available to the broader research community either before, or immediately after publication of manuscripts, as well as through PubMedCentral. While we we will provide relevant protocols upon request at any time, we further intend to pursue several proactive data sharing mechanisms.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>We are committed to making de-identified datasets and image analysis available to to qualified investigators. When required scientifically, data including identifiers will be shared under an agreement that provides for: (1) a commitment to using data only for research purposes and not to identify any individual participant; (2) a commitment to securing the data appropriately; and (3) a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed.</ipd_access_criteria>
