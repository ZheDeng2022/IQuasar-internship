    <textblock>
      Purpose: Pilonidal sinus disease (PSD) is a chronic inflammatory condition of skin due to&#xD;
      implanted loose hair. PSD is commonly seen in sacrococcygeal region, but can also be seen in&#xD;
      axilla, perineum, suprapubic regions, on hands and umbilicus. The aim of this project was to&#xD;
      find factors influencing the development and treatment of umbilical pilonidal sinus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods: In this cross-sectional prospective study, the investigators evaulated&#xD;
      82 (19 female, 63 male) patients with a history of umbilical pilonidal disease (e.g.&#xD;
      predisposing factors, treatment modalities) between 2012 and 2020.&#xD;

      In this study, participants were volunteer patients admitted to Erzincan University Medical&#xD;
      Faculty to the General Surgery Outpatient Clinic between March of 2012 and December of 2020&#xD;
      with umbilical symptoms such as umbilical discharge and umbilical pain. All patients were&#xD;
      diagnosed by physical examination confirmed with ultrasonography . Patients with diseases&#xD;
      other than umbilical sinus were excluded from the study. Examined patients' characteristics&#xD;
      include age, gender, intergluteal sinus disease history, family history, belly shaving&#xD;
      histoy, daily shower, treatment modality and healing status. There were 3 treatment&#xD;
      modalities: conservative approach (daily shower, shaving, antibitics if infected); topical&#xD;
      silver nitrate treatment; surgical operation for umbilical sinus as excracting the hairs from&#xD;
      the sinus Â± excising the sinus. To determine if &quot;healed&quot; the investigators followed up our&#xD;
      patients ensuring no symptoms for a minimum 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chi-square tests were conducted to compare the distribution of categorical variables. Age was&#xD;
      analyzed as a continuous variable with a t-test. Univariable and multivariable logistic&#xD;
      regression models were used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. P-values&#xD;
      of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were&#xD;
      conducted with R version of 3.6.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria,&#xD;
      https://www.r-project.org) software packages.&#xD;
