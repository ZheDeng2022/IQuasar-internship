  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study will be to investigate the effect of an opioid-free anesthesia regimen&#xD;
      with a mixture of dexmedetomidine-lidocaine-ketamine in the same syringe versus fentanyl&#xD;
      analgesia in elective laparoscopic gynecological surgery&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inadequately treated postoperative pain after gynecological surgery may untowardly affect&#xD;
      early recovery and also lead to the development of chronic pain. Laparoscopic surgery is&#xD;
      associated with diminished postoperative pain but this does not mean that patients subjected&#xD;
      to laparoscopic operations are not in need for analgesia intra- and postoperatively.&#xD;
      Opioid-based analgesia is associated with side-effects, such as respiratory depression,&#xD;
      postoperative nausea and vomiting and occasional induction of tolerance and hyperalgesia.&#xD;
      Therefore, in recent years research has focused on the quest for non-opioid-based regimens&#xD;
      for perioperative analgesia in the context of multimodal analgesic techniques. These&#xD;
      techniques have been shown to possess significant advantages, such as allowing earlier&#xD;
      mobilization after surgery, early resumption of enteral feeding and reduced hospital length&#xD;
      of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the intraoperative intravenous injection of lidocaine has been reported to&#xD;
      improve postoperative pain control, reduce opioid consumption and improve the quality of&#xD;
      postoperative functional recovery after general anesthesia. Intraoperative infusions of&#xD;
      ketamine (an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor inhibitor) have also been correlated with reduced&#xD;
      pain scores and a decrease in analgesic requirements postoperatively. Lastly, dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      is a highly selective alfa-2 adreno-ceptor agonist that provides sedation, analgesia, and&#xD;
      sympatholysis. Its perioperative intravenous administration has been associated with a&#xD;
      reduction in postoperative pain intensity, analgesic consumption and nausea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is insufficient data in literature investigating the effect of combinations of these&#xD;
      agents intraoperatively. It would be of interest to demonstrate whether the administration of&#xD;
      combinations can be used towards the achievement of a completely opioid-free anesthetic&#xD;
      regimen. Additionally, it can be hypothesized that the combination of non-opioid drugs with&#xD;
      different targets can lead to enhanced postoperative recovery, an improved opioid-sparing&#xD;
      effect and a decrease in the development of chronic pain as compared to the administration of&#xD;
      opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study will be to investigate the effect of a combination of&#xD;
      intravenous infusions of lidocaine-ketamine-dexmedetomidine versus fentanyl on recovery&#xD;
      profile, quality of recovery and postoperative pain after elective laparoscopic gynecological&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
