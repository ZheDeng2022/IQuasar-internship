  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to understand whether the drug metformin could be used in the&#xD;
      future to help prevent patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance&#xD;
      (MGUS) and smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) from developing multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drug involved in this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metformin, extended release&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo ( a pill that has no active ingredients)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial in patients with&#xD;
      higher-risk monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and low-risk smoldering&#xD;
      multiple myeloma (SMM) to test the efficacy of metformin in reducing clinical indicators of&#xD;
      disease progression in MGUS and SMM patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metformin is considered &quot;investigational&quot;, which means it has not been approved for the study&#xD;
      of cancer prevention by the United States Food and Drug Administration. It has been approved&#xD;
      for other uses including for blood sugar control in some people with Type II diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple myeloma is a cancer of the plasma cells, which is an important part of the immune&#xD;
      system. Patients with active multiple myeloma generally require treatment. There are&#xD;
      currently no approved therapies for MGUS and SMM patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metformin is a medication that is commonly used in the treatment of diabetes. Metformin works&#xD;
      by decreasing glucose production in the liver, decreasing glucose absorption, and improving&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity. This study is interested in studying this medication because several&#xD;
      recent studies indicate that the drug may help prevent progression in patients with MGUS or&#xD;
      SMM. This study is looking to learn more about whether metformin will benefit patients with&#xD;
      MGUS or SMM who may not have diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrollment participants will be randomized assigned to receive either the Placebo or&#xD;
      Metformin pills and to take them for 6 months depending on participant tolerance to the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 80 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health is supporting this trial.&#xD;
