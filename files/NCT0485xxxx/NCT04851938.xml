  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain and anxiety levels experienced during labour are important factors affecting mother and&#xD;
      baby health. An indicator that affects these factors is the levels of hormones that special&#xD;
      for birth in the mother's blood. The application of transcutaneous electrical nerve&#xD;
      stimulation is a nonpharmacological method that midwives can apply and determining the effect&#xD;
      on these factors will be a guide for the future applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will be conducted between 20 March 2020 and 10 March 2021 at the Adana Seyhan&#xD;
      State Hospital of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Turkiye. The universe will be&#xD;
      formed by the all pregnant women who are accepted to give birth to the birth room of the&#xD;
      named hospital. The number of normal births in the relevant hospital in 2019 is 5979 per&#xD;
      year. Power analysis was done with Gpower 3.1 for the number of samples. Báez-Suárez et al.&#xD;
      Based on his study, the standard deviation of the pain scale was found as 1.48 and it was&#xD;
      determined that at least 25 pregnant women per group with %5 error and %90 strength would be&#xD;
      sufficient. It was planned to conduct a study with 28 pregnant women per group, with an&#xD;
      increase in the sample size by %10, with the prospect of possible employment. One hundred and&#xD;
      twelve pregnant women selected among pregnant women will be divided into 4 groups using a&#xD;
      simple randomisation method and a random sequence will be created. Active transcuteneous&#xD;
      electrical nerve stimulation at different doses will be applied to the two groups and the&#xD;
      third group will be set as a placebo group. In the active phases of labour, active&#xD;
      trancutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, which is adjusted to the first group of the&#xD;
      pregnant women with a cervical aperture of at least 4 cm, modified biphasic asymmetric&#xD;
      pulseand it was set to a pulse width of 100 μs and a frequency of 100 Hz (1). In the active&#xD;
      transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation second group, it emitted an asyymetric, balanced,&#xD;
      biphasic square waveform at a mixed stimulating frequency that randomly varied between 80 and&#xD;
      100 Hz, and it had a pulse duration of 350 μs (2) will be applied for 30 minutes.&#xD;
      Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation electrodes will be connected to the placebo group&#xD;
      and 30 minutes will be waited without electric application. Transcutaneous electrical nerve&#xD;
      stimulation electrodes will be connected to the control group and 30 minutes will be waited&#xD;
      without electric application. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation will be connected&#xD;
      to the spinal cord in parallel with the levels of T10-L1 and S2-4 with two adhesive&#xD;
      electrodes. Before and after transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation application to&#xD;
      pregnant women, hormon levels, visual analogue scale (VAS), pain assessment, state worry&#xD;
      scale for anxiety assessment will be performed. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences&#xD;
      20.0 program will be used in the analysis of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Birth pain is one of the most common types of pain. Various studies have been conducted on&#xD;
      whether or not birth pain can be effectively reduced with transcutaneous electrical nerve&#xD;
      stimulation application. However, no study evaluating the effect of transcutaneous electrical&#xD;
      nerve stimulation application at different frequencies during delivery as a placebo&#xD;
      controlled and double blind experimental study in terms of perception of birth pain, anxiety,&#xD;
      hormon levels such as endrophin, oxytocin and cortisol was not found. Therefore, this study&#xD;
      will be conducted as a randomised controlled experimental study to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on birth pain, endorphine level, anxiety and&#xD;
      satisfaction during delivery.&#xD;
