  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A assessment of the efficacy of first-/second-line endocrine therapies ± target therapies and&#xD;
      chemotherapy in real-life of in patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/HER2-negative&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer has not yet been conducted in Moscow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Observational, retrospective study carried out in oncology hospitals in Moscow, in&#xD;
      patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. The&#xD;
      descriptive analysis will be conducted for patient characteristics, responses to treatment&#xD;
      and treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide retrospective chart review of evidence on the use of therapy in&#xD;
      routine clinical practice, with a focus in population of Moscow&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The combination CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) (Palbociclib, Ribociclib and Abemaciclib) with&#xD;
      endocrine therapy (ET, i.e. aro- matase inhibitors (AI) or Fulvestrant) has significantly&#xD;
      increased objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) of first- and&#xD;
      second-line treatments in patients with hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative (luminal)&#xD;
      mBC. Now this combination is the standard treatment for luminal mBC. Recommendation for&#xD;
      endocrine therapy versus chemotherapy as first-line treatment of luminal mBC is endorsed by&#xD;
      the main international guidelines such as ASCO and ESO-ESMO guidelines. Endocrine therapy&#xD;
      should be used as initial treatment except in cases of immediately life-threatening disease,&#xD;
      tumors refractory to endocrine therapy, visceral crisis, or rapid progressive disease that&#xD;
      mandate a high response rate treatment. The aim of this study is to provide real-life&#xD;
      treatment patterns data for luminal MBC with a focus in population of Moscow&#xD;
