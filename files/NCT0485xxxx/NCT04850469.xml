  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, a number of projects related to MSCs have been approved for graft-versus-host&#xD;
      disease, myocardial infarction, Crohn's disease and other diseases, indicating a strong&#xD;
      therapeutic potential of MSCs. However, the efficacy of MSC-Exo for severely infected&#xD;
      children is not fully evaluated. In our study, patients who met the inclusion criteria will&#xD;
      be divided into trial group and control group. Clinical and demographic data, as well as&#xD;
      treatment outcome will be collected from the electronic health record. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate the application and therapeutic effect of MSC-Exo in severely infected children, and&#xD;
      determine the Optimal dosage and infusion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent stem cells with high self-renewal ability and&#xD;
      multidirectional differentiation potential. studies revealed that local or systemic&#xD;
      administration of mesenchymal stem cell-derivrd exosomes (MSC-Exo) efficiently suppressed&#xD;
      detrimental immune response in inflamed tissues and promoted survival and regeneration of&#xD;
      injured parenchymal cells. European Union countries have written MSCs into treatment&#xD;
      guidelines for refractory graft-versus-host disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In China, the technology for isolation, in vitro culture and expansion of MSCs is already&#xD;
      mature. With further research on the therapeutic efficacy of MSC-Exo and the development of&#xD;
      clinical trials, it is expected to become a treatment for severe illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A predictable infection plan is going to be widely used in clinics to provide individualized&#xD;
      treatment for patients, improve the prognosis of patients and improve the quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to enroll all children who were hospitalized in pediatric intensive&#xD;
      care unit PICU of Children's Hospital of Fudan University from January 2022 to December 2023.&#xD;
      Children with a PICU length of day less than 48h will be excluded.&#xD;

    <description>The Marshall Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (MODS) assesses the same six organ systems using slightly different values for four grades of organ dysfunction. The total score, ranging from 0 to 24, arises from the sum of all single organ scores using the first measured value of the day. Intervals for the most abnormal value of each variable were constructed on a scale from 0 to 4 so that a value of 0 represented essentially normal function and was associated with an ICU mortality rate of &lt; 5%, whereas a value of 4 represented marked functional derangement and an ICU mortality rate of &gt; or = 50%.</description>

    <measure>the age, PaO2/FlO2, and plateau pressure score (APPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 3 to 15 days after the start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The APPS is a 9-point score that is calculated by measuring the age, PaO2/FIO2 ratio, and plateau pressure at 24 h after the patient is diagnosed with moderate to severe ARDS and counting each one to 1-3. Since many variables are not needed for calculations, clinicians can easily predict the in-hospital mortality of mechanically ventilated patients with moderate to severe ARDS patients at bedside.</description>
