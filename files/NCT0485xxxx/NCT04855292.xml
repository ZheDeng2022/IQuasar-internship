  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of&#xD;
      TG103 injection in overweight/obese subjects without diabetes&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-doses, parallel-group&#xD;
      study to characterize the safety (including the anti-drug antibodies (ADA)), tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of TG103 injection. The study will consist of&#xD;
      3 periods: an approximately 4-week screening period, followed by a 12-week treatment period,&#xD;
      and a 3-week safety follow-up period. Eligible subjects will be enrolled into three&#xD;
      paralleled dose groups (15 mg, 22.5 mg and 30 mg) with 16 subjects in each group. Within each&#xD;
      group, subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive TG103 injection or placebo&#xD;
      subcutaneously (SC) once a week (QW) over a period of 12 weeks. Each group will be started at&#xD;
      a low dose of 7.5 mg and gradually up-titrated at weekly intervals until the target dose.&#xD;
