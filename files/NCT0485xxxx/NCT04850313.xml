      The study design is a prospective, randomized, controlled interventional study to compare the&#xD;
      outcome of ProKera Plus® with conventional treatment in patients with vision-threatening&#xD;
      bacterial corneal ulcers. The study will be conducted at the University of Arkansas Medical&#xD;
      Sciences (UAMS) in two phases for patients who present to an Ophthalmology clinic or&#xD;
      Emergency Department at UAMS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bacterial keratitis is a serious bacterial infection of the cornea, usually caused by a&#xD;
      persistent epithelial defect or ulcer that can lead to permanent vision loss from corneal&#xD;
      scarring, perforation or endophthalmitis. An infectious corneal ulcer requires immediate&#xD;
      treatment with intensive topical fortified broad-spectrum antibiotics to try to eliminate the&#xD;
      pathogen. Corneal tissue destruction can be caused directly by infectious agents, the&#xD;
      associated inflammatory response, or by ocular toxicity from frequent dosing of fortified&#xD;
      antibiotics.1 Sutured amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) has been shown to reduce pain&#xD;
      and promote healing in human bacterial keratitis.2 ProKera® is a sutureless form of CryoTek&#xD;
      amniotic membrane that is clipped into a dual polycarbonate ring system with the epithelial&#xD;
      side up when in contact with the ocular surface. ProKera Plus® contains a double layer of&#xD;
      CryoTek amniotic membrane tissue to provide extra therapeutic benefit. ProKera Plus® has&#xD;
      several advantages over sutured AMT including ease of administration in a clinic setting and&#xD;
      reduced overall procedural cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of ProKera® in the treatment algorithm of corneal ulcers has yet to be fully&#xD;
      clarified. There are currently no prospective case studies comparing the use of ProKera® to&#xD;
      standard of care conventional treatments in corneal ulcers. The utility of this device would&#xD;
      provide valuable information in the treatment of bacterial corneal ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if ProKera Plus® can lead to better visual recovery when used with&#xD;
           bacterial corneal ulcers compared to conventional treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if ProKera Plus® can actively modify corneal wound healing during the&#xD;
           course of managing bacterial corneal ulcers and decrease the overall time to&#xD;
           re-epithelialization&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine if ProKera Plus® can decrease pain associated with bacterial corneal ulcers&#xD;
           compared to conventional treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine if ProKera Plus® can decrease the amount of corneal opacity and corneal&#xD;
           thinning associated with bacterial corneal ulcers compared to conventional treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To determine if ProKera Plus® can decrease the need for further interventions or&#xD;
           surgeries related to complications from bacterial corneal ulcers&#xD;
