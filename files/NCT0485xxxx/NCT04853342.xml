      This is a phase 3 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, study to assess the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of Furmonertinib (AST2818) versus placebo in patients with stage II-IIIA non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with centrally confirmed, most common sensitising EGFR mutations&#xD;
      (Ex19Del and L858R) either alone or in combination with other EGFR mutations as confirmed by&#xD;
      a central test, who have had complete tumour resection, with or without postoperative&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of primary non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) on&#xD;
             predominantly non-squamous histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MRI or CT scan of the brain must be done prior to surgery as it is considered standard&#xD;
             of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be classified post-operatively as Stage IB, II, or IIIA on the basis of&#xD;
             pathologic criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmation by the central laboratory that the tumor harbors one of the 2 common EGFR&#xD;
             mutations known to be associated with EGFR-TKI sensitivity (Ex19del, L858R), either&#xD;
             alone or in combination with other EGFR mutations including T790M.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Complete surgical resection of the primary NSCLC is mandatory. All gross disease must&#xD;

             negative for the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Complete recovery from surgery and standard post-operative therapy (if applicable) at&#xD;
