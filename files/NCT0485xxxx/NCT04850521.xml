  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As in-clinic pulmonary function testing is greatly restricted due to Coronavirus Disease 2019&#xD;
      (COVID19), alternative approaches to monitoring patients with long-term respiratory&#xD;
      conditions need to be developed and assessed. This project will evaluate the feasibility of a&#xD;
      remote monitoring programme designed for interstitial lung disease (ILD) [including&#xD;
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)] patients which includes patient-reported spirometry &amp;&#xD;
      pulse oximetry (to estimate lung airflow and oxygen levels in the blood).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of ILD will be asked to measure spirometry &amp; pulse&#xD;
      oximetry once/day for approximately three months. Each patient will be supplied with a&#xD;
      spirometer &amp; pulse oximeter for home use. There will be no other changes to patients' care.&#xD;
      The clinical teams responsible for care of the patients will be able to view all&#xD;
      patient-recorded data immediately after data are recorded by the patient. Feasibility of&#xD;
      remote monitoring will be assessed by determining the proportion of patients who provide&#xD;
      measurements at least 3 times/week and on at least 70% of days in the observation period.&#xD;
      Patient engagement (Patient Activation Measure), changes in spirometry measurements over time&#xD;
      and healthcare resource utilisation (e.g. number of in-clinic visits) will also be assessed.&#xD;
      Other outcomes assessed will include estimation of the proportion of patients with&#xD;
      significant decreases in lung function, number of occasions where critical alert values of&#xD;
      physiological parameters are reported and number of interventions by healthcare professionals&#xD;
      in response to observations or alerts from remote monitoring. Feedback from patients and&#xD;
      healthcare providers on user experience will also be sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Learnings from this project will be used to assess the wider application of delivery of&#xD;
      digitally-based remote monitoring in management of long-term respiratory conditions.&#xD;
