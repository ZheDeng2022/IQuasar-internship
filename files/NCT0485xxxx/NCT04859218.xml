  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a recent analysis of a large transfusion database (Transfusion Research Utilization,&#xD;
      Surveillance and Tracking database [TRUST]), the investigators found that the transfusion of&#xD;
      ABO non-identical RBCs to group A individual was associated with an increased risk of death&#xD;
      in-hospital compared to patients transfused with ABO identical RBCs (Red Blood Cells). Our&#xD;
      finding was corroborated in a separate study of low birth weight neonates who received only&#xD;
      group O RBCs (e.g., group O neonates received ABO identical RBCs but group A, B, and AB&#xD;
      neonates received ABO non-identical RBCs). A subgroup of neonates who received ABO&#xD;
      non-identical transfusions had higher mortality (Z. Sohl, personal communication, April 30th,&#xD;
      2020). Similar adverse clinical outcomes have been reported in a number of studies where&#xD;
      patients have received ABO non-identical RBCs and/or platelets. Together, these findings&#xD;
      raise the concern that the longstanding policy of transfusing group O non-identical RBCs and&#xD;
      platelets may increase the risk of harm for some patients. In Hamilton, Ontario hospitals,&#xD;
      approximately 20% of transfused patients receive ABO non-identical RBCs every year because of&#xD;
      inventory shortages, urgent requests, and specific phenotype requirements. The negative&#xD;
      impact of this practice could have widespread national and international implications for&#xD;
      transfusion policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to undertake critical exploratory analyses in transfusion medicine is enabled by&#xD;
      large research and administrative data sets that include all Hamilton hospitals. The initial&#xD;
      finding of potential harm with ABO non-identical RBCs is hypothesis-generating and requires&#xD;
      confirmation through external datasets and translational studies to support a biological&#xD;
      mechanism. If confirmed, this hypothesis can then be tested in a clinical trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Why ABO non-identical RBCs may cause harm: In addition to the two exploratory studies&#xD;
      published by our group (Z. Sohl, personal communication, April 30th, 2020), other&#xD;
      investigators have also suggested that ABO non-identical transfusions could be harmful. A&#xD;
      retrospective study by Heal et al., evaluated the effects of a policy change to provide only&#xD;
      ABO identical RBCs and platelets for patients undergoing stem cell transplantation and&#xD;
      patients receiving treatment for hematological malignancies. A historical control group was&#xD;
      used for comparison. The ABO identical policy resulted in less bleeding (5% vs. 15-20%) and&#xD;
      improved survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other retrospective studies have also shown ABO non-identical platelet transfusions to be&#xD;
      associated with an increased risk of platelet refractoriness and that refractory patients had&#xD;
      circulating immune complexes for several days. Post transfusion platelet count increments&#xD;
      were also higher when ABO identical platelets were transfused. In a retrospective study of&#xD;
      153 patients undergoing primary coronary artery bypass graft or coronary valve replacement&#xD;
      surgery, the transfusion of at least one ABO non-identical platelet pool was associated with&#xD;
      an increased hospital stay, more days with fever, and more RBC transfusions. Other outcomes&#xD;
      (mortality in hospital, length of stay in the intensive care unit, antibiotic days, and a&#xD;
      total number of platelet transfusions) were not statistically different. A subgroup analysis&#xD;
      (n=139) of patients who received at least two platelet pools showed a non-significant trend&#xD;
      towards increased morbidity and mortality (8.6% vs. 1.9%; p=0.10) in recipients of&#xD;
      ABO-matched platelets. A retrospective study by Lapierre et al. analyzed data from 186&#xD;
      consecutive children with neuroblastoma or brain tumors who were treated with high-dose&#xD;
      chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The primary endpoint was&#xD;
      hepatic veno-occlusive disease. In their multivariate analysis, two factors significantly&#xD;
      increased the risk of this outcome: transfusion of platelet concentrates containing&#xD;
      ABO-incompatible plasma and use of melphalan in the conditioning regimen. They concluded that&#xD;
      transfusion of platelet concentrates containing ABO-incompatible plasma increases the risk of&#xD;
      hepatic veno-occlusive disease and hypothesized that passive antibody binding to A and/or B&#xD;
      antigens expressed on the surface of hepatic endothelial cells could be involved in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to emphasize that a publication bias probably exists in this literature with&#xD;
      primarily positive studies being reported, and most of the studies are observational (lower&#xD;
      quality evidence). Many of the platelet studies also included both minor incompatibilities&#xD;
      (plasma in the platelet product has ABO antibodies that react with the recipient's RBCs) and&#xD;
      major incompatibilities (recipient's plasma has ABO antibodies that react with ABO antigens&#xD;
      on the transfused platelets); however, this literature combined with our preliminary&#xD;
      exploratory analyses (Z. Sohl, personal communication, April 30th, 2020) raises the&#xD;
      hypothesis that ABO non-identical transfusions (whether minor or major) could impact patient&#xD;
      outcomes and should be further explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible biological mechanism: The concept of transfusion-related immune modulation (TRIM)&#xD;
      was defined over 30 years ago. More recent evidence suggests that biological mechanisms&#xD;
      leading to TRIM can be the heterogeneous involving donor, product, and/or patient factors&#xD;
      that contribute to patient morbidities and mortality. A conceptual framework for two possible&#xD;
      mechanisms that could lead to harm post-transfusion are a proinflammatory pathway and an&#xD;
      immunosuppression pathway. For both pathways, inflammation is one of the prime targets that&#xD;
      contribute to the adverse events seen in recipients. In this study, the investigators will&#xD;
      use biomarkers of inflammation to determine if the differences are seen between patients who&#xD;
      receive ABO identical RBC or platelet transfusions compared to those receiving ABO&#xD;
      non-identical blood products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that passive anti-A and anti-B (from group O donors) can bind&#xD;
      to recipients' endothelial cells or soluble antigen causing circulating immune complexes that&#xD;
      can signal cytokine generation and release causing a &quot;cytokine storm&quot;. The severity of the&#xD;
      storm may be tempered or enhanced by the secretor status of the recipient and possibly the&#xD;
      donor, the titre of the passive antibody transfused, and Group A or AB recipients' subgroup&#xD;
      status (A1/A2). Antibody incompatibility could also lead to small amounts of hemolysis, which&#xD;
      could trigger an inflammatory response. The biomarkers frequently used to detect inflammation&#xD;
      include interleukin-6 (IL-6); tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α); interleukin-8 (IL-8) and&#xD;
      interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β); CD40 Ligand and, C-reactive protein (CRP). Markers of hemolysis&#xD;
      in patients post-transfusion include bilirubin, haptoglobin, and lactate dehydrogenase. The&#xD;
      investigators will also measure circulating immune complexes as these have been linked to&#xD;
      inflammation and a serological profile of the donor/product and the patient will also be&#xD;
      performed. A complete list of biomarkers is included below.&#xD;
