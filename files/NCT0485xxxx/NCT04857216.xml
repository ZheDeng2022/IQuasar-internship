  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With this study, it was aimed to compare the block characteristics evaluated with traditional&#xD;
      methods in infraclavicular and costoclavicular block applications performed in upper&#xD;
      extremity surgery in our clinic with the perfusion index&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral nerve block is to anesthetize the dermatomes belonging to the nerve or nerve group&#xD;
      to which the block is applied, by performing sympathetic, sensory and motor blocks. Brachial&#xD;
      plexus blockade; It is a peripheral nerve blockage that can be used in surgical operations to&#xD;
      be performed on the upper extremity and can be performed at the level of interscalene,&#xD;
      supraclavicular, infraclavicular, costoclavicular, axillary and terminal nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The costoclavicular brachial plexus block has been used as an alternative to lateral sagittal&#xD;
      infraclavicular block, due to its ease of application, its rapid onset of action and its high&#xD;
      success rate. The effectiveness of the block is measured by sensory, motor and sympathetic&#xD;
      block effects. The sensory block can be evaluated by cold or pinprick test, and motor block&#xD;
      by traditional methods such as the patient's response to verbal commands and can be&#xD;
      objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sympathetic block manifests itself with vasodilation and an increase in blood flow rate and&#xD;
      can be measured with the more quantitative perfusion index (PI). The perfusion index&#xD;
      represents the ratio of pulsatile blood flow to static blood flow in peripheral tissue and&#xD;
      can be measured continuously and noninvasively from a pulse oximeter. Successful peripheral&#xD;
      nerve blockade; It is seen as local vasodilation, increased local blood flow, some increase&#xD;
      in skin temperature and loss of sensation in the extremity due to the blockage of sympathetic&#xD;
      fibers. It can be a guide in determining the effectiveness of the block because it is&#xD;
      noninvasive and easy, providing rapid evaluation, without requiring patient cooperation to&#xD;
      evaluate the success of the block.&#xD;
