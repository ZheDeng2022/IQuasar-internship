  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is an interventional study that proves the eficacy of the manual therapy with active&#xD;
      manual therapy and combined with exercise in cervical pain.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be divided in two different groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A control group (group A) : they will receive a treatment with manual therapy and&#xD;
           physical exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An experimental group (group B) : they will receive the previous treatment, but also the&#xD;
           pacient's do active muscle active contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise is compound by a home program of several exercises with diferent difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The contraction will consist on a combination of concentric and isometric work. being the&#xD;
      patient's pain threshold the one that will guide us to the choice of the predominance of&#xD;
      concentric or isometric contraction . Both groups will be joined by a five-minute work on&#xD;
      pain education.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Neck disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month (primary timepoint) , 2 months and 5 months after intervention commencement.</time_frame>
    <description>Using the Neck Disability Index (NDI). It is made up of 10 items and each item is scored on a 6-point Likert scale (0 to 5), leading to a total score ranging from 0 to 50 (0 to 4 = no disability; 5 to 14 = mild disability; 15 to 24 = moderate disability; 25 to 34 = severe disability; and 35 to 50 = complete disability).</description>

    <measure>Change in craniocervical flexion</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month (primary timepoint) and 2 months after intervention commencement.</time_frame>
    <description>Using the craniocervical flexion test (CCFT) we make a evaluation of the strength of the deep cervical flexor muscles. From 22 to 30 mmHg of preasure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in kinesophobia</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month (primary timepoint) , 2 months and 5 months after intervention commencement.</time_frame>
    <description>Using the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia-11 (TSK-11), self-report of 17 items that address fear of movement and injury relapse. Four of the items are negatively written and scored inverse (4, 8, 12 and 16). The scores are added together to obtain a total score, with higher values reflecting greater kinesiophobia.</description>
