      A randomized cohort study applied to patients with mechanical heart valve prosthesis who will&#xD;
      be delivered by caesarean section at or after 28 weeks of gestation . Using a table of random&#xD;
      numbers, participants will be divided into 2 equal groups. Group A (57 patients) in which&#xD;
      warfarin will be started day 2 after caesarean delivery (i.e. 24 hours postoperative), and&#xD;
      group B (57 patients) in which warfarin will be started day 5 after caesarean delivery, then&#xD;
      maternal complications are compared among these 2 groups.&#xD;

      -Background and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac valve replacement surgery has saved the lives of hundreds of thousands of patients&#xD;
      with acquired (e.g. rheumatic) or congenital cardiac disorders (McLintock, 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy induces a state of hypercoagulability with a high risk of thromboembolism. The&#xD;
      thromboembolic risks are much higher in patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves&#xD;
      (Hanania, 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) constitute the safest anticoagulation for mechanical heart&#xD;
      valves (MHV) whether within or outside of pregnancy. However, these drugs can cross the&#xD;
      placenta and can cause embryopathy, fetopathy, and bleeding. In the peripartum period, there&#xD;
      is also an increase in the bleeding risk for both, the mother and the neonate. (Bhagra et al,&#xD;
      2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, heparins, both unfractionated (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin&#xD;
      (LMWH), do not cross the placenta and are considered safe for the fetus. However, heparin&#xD;
      seems an inadequate anticoagulant when used for MHV over long periods such as in pregnancy.&#xD;
      This is due in part to the thrombogenic nature of MHV (Arya, 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preferred approach from the European society of cardiology (ESC) is the sequential use of&#xD;
      heparin (LMWH or UFH) in the first trimester, VKAs in second and third trimesters reverting&#xD;
      to heparin at 36 weeks gestation. If the warfarin dose required to reach the therapeutic&#xD;
      international normalized ratio (INR) is 5 mg or less, it is suggested that warfarin could be&#xD;
      continued in the first trimester. Therapeutic heparin (either unfractionated or low molecular&#xD;
      weight) should be restarted 4-6 hours after delivery as long as the patient has no&#xD;
      significant bleeding, then oral anticoagulants (VKAs) are introduced together with heparin&#xD;
      till INR reaches the therapeutic level (Regitz-Zagrosek et al,2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After delivery, patients with mechanical heart valves are at significant risk of maternal&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Morbidity includes primary and secondary postpartum hemorrhage,&#xD;
      wound hematoma, intra-abdominal bleeding, need for reopera¬tion or other intervention, valve&#xD;
      thrombosis, and other thromboembolic manifestations e.g. Stroke. However, there is limited&#xD;
      guidance on when to start oral anticoagulants in the postpartum period (Irani et al, 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pooled institutional data and an interdisciplinary approach are recommended to minimize&#xD;
      competing risks, sequelae of valve thrombosis, and obstetrical hemorrhage and, thereby, to&#xD;
      optimize maternal outcomes and develop evidence-based guidelines for postpartum&#xD;
      anticoagulation management (Irani et al, 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our observations at the high-risk pregnancy department in Kasr Al Ainy school of&#xD;
      medicine, we noticed that the postpartum bleeding complications were different when oral&#xD;
      anticoagulants (VKAs) were started on different days after cesarean section as we found that&#xD;
      postpartum bleeding was noticeably less when warfarin was started 5 days after cesarean&#xD;
      section, so we decided to conduct this study to address the appropriate timing to start oral&#xD;
      anticoagulants after cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Population of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women presenting to Kasr Al Ainy high risk pregnancy outpatient clinic with&#xD;
      mechanical prosthetic mitral and/or aortic valves, and indicated to deliver via caesarean&#xD;
      section at or after 28 weeks of gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Study location: Study will be conducted in Kasr Al Ainy high risk pregnancy unit.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from Kasr Al Ainy high risk pregnancy outpatient clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves who are planned to deliver by&#xD;
           caesarean delivery, provided that the gestational age at delivery is 28 weeks of&#xD;
           gestation or more whether singleton or multi-fetal pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients with right sided mechanical heart valves.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients with history of any thrombotic events e.g. Stuck prosthetic valve, or&#xD;
                cerebrovascular stroke, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients with hypertensive disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients with known bleeding disorders or coagulation defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients with known thrombophilia.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients who refuse to share in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Methodology in details:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised (using tables of random numbers for randomization), cohort study, including 114&#xD;
      pregnant women presenting to Kasr Al Ainy high risk pregnancy outpatient clinic with&#xD;
      mechanical prosthetic mitral and/or aortic valves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After taking a written consent from all participants, they will be subjected to thorough&#xD;
      history taking regarding age, parity, gestational age on presentation, medical history,&#xD;
      duration since cardiac surgery, type and number of replaced valves, average dose of warfarin&#xD;
      used during pregnancy, type and dose of anticoagulant immediately used before delivery,&#xD;
      history of prosthetic valve complications and history of obstetric complications. General&#xD;
      examination including maternal weight and height and abdominal (obstetric) examination will&#xD;
      be performed. Antenatal ultrasonography will be done to determine gestational age and to&#xD;
      assess for fetal wellbeing, then all patients will be examined by a Cardiology consultant to&#xD;
      assess the cardiac status, adjust the anticoagulation dose, follow up for the occurrence of&#xD;
      any cardiac complications, and to help in determining when to terminate and mode of&#xD;
      termination according to individual patient's situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting from 36 weeks of gestation, all patients will be reverted to unfractionated heparin&#xD;
      in a therapeutic dose (as determined by the cardiology consultant) to maintain activated&#xD;
      partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) within a therapeutic level. Unfractionated heparin will be&#xD;
      stopped 6 hours before caesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who will be indicated to deliver via caesarean section (upon obstetric or&#xD;
      cardiac recommendations), will be included, and will be operated upon by the same surgical&#xD;
      team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine preoperative labs including complete blood count, coagulation profile (to ensure that&#xD;
      the PC is &gt;60% and the INR is &lt;1.5 prior to surgery), liver and kidney functions, and fasting&#xD;
      and 2 hours postprandial blood sugar level will be withdrawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During caesarean section, adequate hemostasis will be achieved, an intraperitoneal drain will&#xD;
      be inserted, parietal peritoneum will be closed, gel foams, and suction drain in the&#xD;
      sub-rectus space will be inserted. After delivery, heparin will be started 4-6 hours and then&#xD;
      switched to low molecular weight heparin (LMWHs) 12 hours after caesarean section, in the&#xD;
      absence of significant bleeding, in twice daily subcutaneous injections in a therapeutic dose&#xD;
      (1 mg/kg twice daily) (James 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a table of random numbers, participants will be divided into 2 equal groups. Group A&#xD;
      (57 patients) in which warfarin will be started day 2 after caesarean delivery (i.e. 24 hours&#xD;
      postoperative), and group B (57 patients) in which warfarin will be started day 5 after&#xD;
      caesarean delivery. In both groups, LMW heparin will be continued in a therapeutic dose as&#xD;
      mentioned above beside warfarin till INR achieves a therapeutic value as determined by the&#xD;
      cardiologist. When a therapeutic level of warfarin is achieved, LMW heparin will be stopped,&#xD;
      patient will continue on warfarin, and will be discharged from the hospital. Duration till&#xD;
      control of the INR will be reported in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all participants, the amount of blood in the sub-rectus and intraperitoneal drains will&#xD;
      be recorded. Clinical examination as well as transabdominal ultrasonography will be performed&#xD;
      daily till the end of hospital stay, then 1 and 2 weeks after delivery to check for signs of&#xD;
      wound hematoma . The ultrasonographic findings suggesting the presence of subcutaneous or&#xD;
      sub-rectus hematoma include; a homogeneous or heterogeneous fluid collection within the&#xD;
      abdominal wall, and Doppler colour flow which does not reliably detect the presence of active&#xD;
      extravasation, then the size of hematoma will be measured in centimetres, and will be&#xD;
      followed up in the daily consecutive ultrasonography examinations (Allen and Sevensma 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all patients, Other maternal outcomes will be recorded including primary postpartum&#xD;
      hemorrhage, intra-abdominal bleeding, need for blood transfusion, need for reoperation e.g.&#xD;
      re-exploration in case of significant intraperitoneal hemorrhage or evacuation of wound&#xD;
      hematoma, or other intervention ( e.g. re-do cardiac valve replacement surgery in cases with&#xD;
      stuck valve), valve thrombosis, other thromboembolic manifestations e.g. stroke, length of&#xD;
      hospital stay, and maternal death. The timing and indication for caesarean delivery will be&#xD;
      identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative haemoglobin and haematocrit values will be done 24 hours after the end of the&#xD;
      operation as well as at the end of hospital stay before discharge. Estimation of&#xD;
      intraoperative blood loss will be obtained through measuring the volume of blood in the&#xD;
      suction machine reservoir and weighing the swabs (surgical towels) as soon as possible. The&#xD;
      weights of dry swabs will be subtracted from the weights of swabs used during the operation.&#xD;
      The weight of swabs found in grams will be translated to ml by using blood density (1.050&#xD;
      g/ml) (Caglar et al 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative blood loss in the first 24 hours and after will be measured by subtracting&#xD;
      intraoperative blood loss from total blood loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total blood loss will be measured through pre and postoperative hematocrit values through the&#xD;
      following equations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated total blood loss will be derived by multiplying the calculated pregnancy blood&#xD;
      volume by percentage of blood volume lost.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy blood volume = (0.75 × {[maternal height (inches) × 50] + [maternal weight in&#xD;
           pounds × 25]})&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percent of blood volume lost = ({predelivery HCT - postdelivery HCT}/predelivery HCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total blood loss = pregnancy blood volume × percent of blood volume lost (Stafford et&#xD;
           al, 2008)&#xD;
