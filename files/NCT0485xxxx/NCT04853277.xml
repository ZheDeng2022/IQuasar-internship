  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to provide an educational visit addressing common emotional&#xD;
      stressors involved in the transplant/CAR-T process, and determine if this added education&#xD;
      improves levels of anxiety, depression, and fatigue after transplant/CART in comparison to&#xD;
      people who do not receive the brief educational visit.&#xD;

      Individuals who decide to participate in this study, will be provided with a survey&#xD;
      evaluating symptoms they are currently having. This survey should take approximately 10&#xD;
      minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals will then be scheduled for a 30 minute telephone visit to review common emotional&#xD;
      stressors experienced after Stem Cell Transplant/CAR-T therapy as well as strategies to help&#xD;
      reduce these symptoms. They will be provided with a pamphlet to review during the visit and&#xD;
      on their own time afterwards. This visit will be conducted by telephone to avoid extra travel&#xD;
      to the hospital, and will be conducted prior to admission for Transplant/CAR-T.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals will then be asked to fill out the same set of surveys at 1 month, 3 months, 6&#xD;
      months, and 12 months after their transplant/CAR-T therapy. These surveys will be conducted&#xD;
      during other scheduled clinic visits to avoid additional travel to the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An individual's involvement will be complete at 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an individual receives their post-transplant/CAR-T care at a hospital other than DHMC,&#xD;
      surveys will be mailed to them to complete and return at the same time points.&#xD;

    <description>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-29) includes 29 questions for 8 categories (Physical Function, Anxiety, Depression, Fatigue, Sleep Disturbance, Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities, Pain Interference, and Pain Intensity) with a Likert scale from 1-5. Transformed scores will be used in analysis. The T-score rescales the raw score into a standardized T-score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. For the categories measured in this study (Anxiety, Depression, and Fatigue) a higher value represents greater symptom burden, while a lower value represents lower symptom burden.</description>

    <description>The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Thermometer consists of a single-item self-report measure of psychological distress, which consists of an 11-point scale with the endpoints labeled &quot;No distress&quot; (0) and &quot;Extreme distress&quot; (10).</description>
