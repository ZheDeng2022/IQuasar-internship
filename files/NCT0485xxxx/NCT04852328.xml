    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 trial to assess the safety and tolerability of three schedules of CUE-101&#xD;
      administered in the neoadjuvant phase before standard of care (SOC) therapy to treatment&#xD;
      naïve, HLA-A*0201 positive patients with newly diagnosed, locally advanced HPV16+&#xD;
      oropharyngeal squamous-cell carcinoma (OPSCC). This is an exploratory trial of a limited&#xD;
      sample size to confirm safety and to assess for pharmacodynamic signals of efficacy in each&#xD;
      of three schedules of CUE-101. Safety assessments will be performed at baseline and after&#xD;
      CUE-101 administration. To assess for efficacy, peripheral blood and tumor samples will be&#xD;
      collected at baseline and after CUE-101 administration. Following CUE-101, patients will&#xD;
      proceed with SOC therapy, as prescribed by the treating physician.&#xD;

A major pathologic response (mPR) will be defined as ≤ 10% residual viable tumor within the tumor sample collected after administration of CUE-101. A complete pathologic response (cPR) will be defined as no invasive cancer in the tumor sample collected. For surgical patients, the tumor sample will include the primary tumor specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes at the time of resection. For def-chemoradiation therapy patients, the tumor sample will comprise the biopsy(s) submitted. Pathologic tumor response will be stratified based on if the patients underwent surgery or post-CUE-101 biopsy only.</description>
