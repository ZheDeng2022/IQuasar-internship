    <textblock>
      Non Alcohlic Fatty Liver (NAFLD) is a spectrum of diseases that ranges from accumulation of&#xD;
      fat in the liver (Hepatosteatosis) that may be accompanied by inflammation (Steatohepatitis)&#xD;
      to necrosis, fibrosis and even cirrhosis resembling alcoholic hepatitis in the absence of&#xD;
      alcoholic abuse (Pardee et al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been estimated that the global prevalence of NAFLD is as high as one billion. In the&#xD;
      United States, NAFLD is estimated to be the most common cause of chronic liver disease,&#xD;
      affecting between 80 and 100 million individuals, among whom nearly 25% progress to NASH&#xD;
      (Loomba et al., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, the prevalence of NAFLD has increased over the last 20 years. The Middle East and&#xD;
      South America have the highest NAFLD prevalence at 31% and 32% respectively with the lowest&#xD;
      prevalence in Africa at 13.5% (Younossi et al., 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver biopsy (LB) is still the standard test of NAFLD diagnosis and the presence of early&#xD;
      liver fibrosis. However, histologic lesions are not evenly distributed throughout the liver.&#xD;
      A sampling error is the biggest limitation in the diagnosis of NAFLD by LB with inflammatory&#xD;
      lesions and ballooning degeneration potentially resulting in misdiagnoses and staging&#xD;
      inaccuracies (Lee et al., 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome these limitations, several non-invasive markers have been used instead of liver&#xD;
      biopsy. These methods are either laboratory markers or imaging modalities. Controlled&#xD;
      attenuation parameter (CAP) is a new technology based on the principle of the ultrasonic&#xD;
      attenuation of transient elastography depending on the viscosity [fat] of the medium [liver]&#xD;
      and the distance of propagation of the ultrasonic signals into the liver, providing a useful&#xD;
      method for the quantitative detection of liver fat content and is considered a better&#xD;
      assessment method for hepatic steatosis. Compared with ultrasound, this technology improves&#xD;
      the sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of fatty liver and can be used for&#xD;
      universal screening, diagnosis, and follow-up in NAFLD patients (Sasso et al., 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NAFLD is known to be closely associated with metabolic conditions, including insulin&#xD;
      resistance, abdominal obesity, dyslipidaemia and type 2 diabetes, and is thus regarded as the&#xD;
      hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome (Ballestri., 2016). In recent epidemiological&#xD;
      studies, NAFLD was shown to be connected with diseases that are usually not dependent on&#xD;
      obesity, such as sarcopenia and osteoporosis (Poggiogalle et al., 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoporosis is becoming a public health problem all over the world. Disability resulting&#xD;
      from low-energy fractures, e.g: hip or vertebral fractures, is the major concern for early&#xD;
      detection and treatment. It is estimated that osteoporosis affects 200 million women&#xD;
      worldwide (Kanis et al., 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver is the source of many proteins and is the regulator of several pathways involving bone&#xD;
      metabolism; one of the most well-known of all is vitamin D metabolism pathway. Considering&#xD;
      the role of liver in bone metabolism, the association between NAFLD and bone abnormalities is&#xD;
      not surprising especially with substantial supporting evidences in recent years (Eshraghian&#xD;
      et al., 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides its role in the calcium and bone metabolism, vitamin D may also exert pleiotropic&#xD;
      effects in many tissues. NAFLD patients were reported to have a marked reduction in serum&#xD;
      25(OH) vitamin D when compared with controls (Yilmaz et al., 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In adults, bone is constantly being remodeled, first being broken down (bone resorption) and&#xD;
      then being rebuilt (bone formation). The resorption and reformation of bone is important for&#xD;
      repair of microfractures and to allow modification of structure in response to stress and&#xD;
      other biomechanical forces. Bone formation is normally tightly coupled to bone resorption, so&#xD;
      that bone mass does not change. Bone diseases occur when formation and resorption are&#xD;
      uncoupled. Several assays are available that measure bone turnover markers (BTMs). These&#xD;
      assays measure collagen breakdown products and other molecules released from osteoclasts and&#xD;
      osteoblasts during the process of bone resorption and formation. Markers that are specific to&#xD;
      bone formation include bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), osteocalcin, and N-terminal&#xD;
      propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP); markers specific to bone resorption include&#xD;
      N-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (NTX), C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen&#xD;
      (CTX), and pyridinoline cross-links (Rosen et al., 2019).&#xD;

      All included patients will be subjected to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Complete history taking including age, sex, current medical history (e.g. hypertension,&#xD;
           diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, renal, thyroid, parathyroid diseases and&#xD;
           menopausal status), daily alcohol consumption and smoking status will be recorded from&#xD;
           interviews with the participants during the examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. thorough clinical examination. The participants' anthropometric measurements will be&#xD;
           obtained including: their body weight, height, waist circumference (WC) and body mass&#xD;
           index (BMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
           General examination Arterial blood pressure will be recorded and for detection of&#xD;
           stigmata of chronic liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Abdominal examination will be done for assessment of the size of the liver and spleen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Diagnosis of NAFLD:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The diagnosis will be based on abdominal ultrasound findings and will be confirmed by&#xD;
           fibroscan examination as the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Abdominal ultrasound: steatosis will be graded according to Quinn and Gosink (1985)&#xD;
                as the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Grade I: Minimal diffuse increase in the fine echoes. Liver appears bright compared&#xD;
                to the cortex of the kidney.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Grade II: Moderate diffuse increase in the fine echoes. Slightly impaired&#xD;
                visualization of the intrahepatic vessels and diaphragm.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Grade III: Marked increase in the fine echoes. Poor or no visualization of&#xD;
                intrahepatic vessels and diaphragm and poor penetration of the posterior segment of&#xD;
                the right lobe of the liver&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Fibosscan to evaluate steatosis grades by CAP score and fibrosis stages as&#xD;
                described by (Sasso et al., 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Laboratory investigations:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Complete Blood Count (CBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Liver profile: alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST),&#xD;
                serum albumin, total and direct bilirubin, prothrombin time and INR.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Renal profile: creatinine and urine analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C),&#xD;
                low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Fasting blood sugar.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. (HBsAg, HCV Ab) Viral markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. 25-hydroxyl-vitamin D (25(OH)D) in serum.&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Serum Osteocalcin as a marker of bone formation and serum NTX as a marker of bone&#xD;
                resorption.&#xD;
