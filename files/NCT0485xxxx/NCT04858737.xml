  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal is to design, develop and evaluate a personalized intervention to prevent&#xD;
      depression in the workplace, based on Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs),&#xD;
      predictive risk algorithms and decision support systems (DSS) for employed workers. The&#xD;
      specific goals are: 1) to design and develop a DSS, called e-predictD-Work-DSS to elaborate&#xD;
      personalized plans to prevent depression and its monitoring in the employed working&#xD;
      population; 2) to design and develop an ICT solution that integrates the DSS on the web, a&#xD;
      mobile application (App), the predictD risk algorithm, different intervention modules&#xD;
      (including a work stress management module) and a monitoring-feedback system; 3) to evaluate&#xD;
      the usability, adherence, acceptability and satisfaction of employed working population with&#xD;
      the e-pD-Work intervention; 4) to evaluate the effectiveness of the e-pD-Work intervention to&#xD;
      reduce the incidence of major depression, depression and anxiety symptoms, the probability of&#xD;
      major depression next year and to improve quality of life; 5) to evaluate the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of the e-pD-Work intervention to prevent depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial with two parallel arms (e-pD-Work&#xD;
      vs active m-Health control) and 12 months follow-up. A total of 3,160 depression-free&#xD;
      workers, aged between 18 and 55 years old will be recruited in Spain and randomly assigned to&#xD;
      one of the two groups in a 1:1 ratio considering a stratification of age (18-29, 30-39,&#xD;
      40-49, 50-55 years) and sex similar to the Spanish population. Participants, interviewers and&#xD;
      statisticians will be blinded to participants' allocation. The e-pD-Work intervention is&#xD;
      self-guided, has a biopsychosocial approach and is multi-component (9 modules: physical&#xD;
      exercise, improve sleep, expand relationships, solve problems, improve communication,&#xD;
      assertiveness, decision making, manage thoughts and reduce work stress). The e-pD-Work&#xD;
      intervention will be implemented in the smartphone of the workers and pivot on an already&#xD;
      validated risk predictive algorithm and a DSS that helps workers to develop their own&#xD;
      personalized depression prevention plans. Primary outcome will be the rate of major&#xD;
      depression measured by CIDI. As secondary outcomes: depressive and anxiety symptomatology&#xD;
      measured by PHQ-9 and GAD-7 respectively, the risk probability of depression measured by the&#xD;
      predictD risk algorithm, quality of life measured by SF-12 and EuroQol, and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness and cost-utility.&#xD;

    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) measures symptoms of depression through 9 items, each of which is scored 0 ('not at all') to 3 ('nearly every day'). Low scores are equivalent to less symptoms of depression, the scale range is 0 to 27 (9 items).</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Job Content Instrument measures psychological demands, decision latitude, social support, physical demands, and job insecurity with a total of seven items.

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The e-Health Impact Questionnaire (e-HIQ) assesses the effects of websites containing health information. The e-HIQ questionnaire consists of two independently administered and scored parts. In the first part items represent general attitudes towards using the internet to access health information. In the second part items measure a person's ease with using online information, particularly emphasising a person's openness to learning and gaining support from other peoples experiences. Both parts of the questionnaire have a five point response category for all items ranging from 'Strongly disagree to Strongly agree'.</description>

    <description>The intervention is based on validated risk algorithms to predict depression and includes: 1) Mobile applications as main user's interface; 2) a DSS that helps worker participants to develop their own personalized plans to prevent (PPP) depression; 3) nine intervention modules (the core of the system) including activities to prevent depression, to be proposed by the DSS and chosen by the participants. The intervention is biopsychosocial and multi-component, including the following modules: physical exercise, improve sleep, expand relationships, solve problems, improve communication, assertiveness, decision making, manage thoughts and reduce work stress. Worker participants will implement the recommendations and the tool will monitor these actions, offering feedback to improve their PPP at 6 and 12 months.</description>
