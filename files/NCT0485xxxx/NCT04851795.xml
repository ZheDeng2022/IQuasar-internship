    <description>Participants assigned to the supervised exercise group will perform a supervised routine of approximately 30 minutes, 2 days per week (Monday and Wednesday at the Txagorritxu hospital, and Tuesday and Thursday at the Santiago hospital from 7:15 to 7:45 and from 15:15 to 15:45).</description>

    <description>For the non-supervised group, we will propose climbing the stairs from floor 0 to floor 7 three times during the working day and doing planks and stretching exercises outside of work. For the latter, an educational session will be given at the beginning of the study to explain how to perform them correctly.</description>
