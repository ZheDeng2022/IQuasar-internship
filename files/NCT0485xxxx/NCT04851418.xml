  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overcrowding in the emergency department is an increasing problem in hospitals worldwide.&#xD;
      Point-of-care Troponin (POC cTn) testing combined with a well investigated risk&#xD;
      stratification tool (HEART-score) used in the ambulance may contribute to more rapidly&#xD;
      diagnostics of ruling in or ruling out myocardial infarctions (MI) and subsequently reduce&#xD;
      unnecessary hospital admissions, total admission time and costs. However, the applicability&#xD;
      of the POC cTn and the HEART-score in the pre-hospital setting remains unclear. This study&#xD;
      will evaluate this applicability.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Co-primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the interobserver agreement of the HEART-score performed by ambulance&#xD;
           personnel compared to the HEART-score performed by emergency physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the diagnostic performance of a strategy based on a pre-hospital HEART-score&#xD;
           (with POC cTn testing) or combined with an adjuvant single hs-cTn test at the emergency&#xD;
           department to rule-in or rule-out acute coronary syndrome (ACS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the diagnostic performance of (serial) POC cTn testing or combined with&#xD;
           hs-cTn testing compared to (serial) hs-cTn testing to rule-in or rule-out MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To investigate the feasibility of using the pre-hospital HEART-score and POC cTn in the&#xD;
           0/1 hour algorithm to rule-out ACS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in all included&#xD;
           patients with a follow up time of 30 days from first medical contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To evaluate the patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) in all chest pain patients&#xD;
           transported to the hospital at baseline and at 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To perform a cost-analysis of an early diagnostic strategy using the pre-hospital&#xD;
           HEART-score&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A prospective, observational, single multicentre study Study population: Total&#xD;
      number of patients needed for analysis: n=650 Inclusion criteria: - All out-of-hospital chest&#xD;
      pain patients visited by an ambulance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transportation to a hospital with working diagnosis NSTE-ACS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age â‰¥ 18 years Exclusion criteria: - Comatose state, hemodynamic instability or shock&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiographic ST-segment elevation in the pre-hospital setting treated as STEMI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No pre-hospital 12-lead electrocardiogram performed or available&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An obvious non-cardiac cause for the chest pain (trauma, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suspicion of aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suspicion of COVID-19 by ambulance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures: The HEART-score and the POC cTn will be calculated in all included patients&#xD;
      in the pre-hospital phase. Simultaneously, a venous blood sample will be drawn from the&#xD;
      venous access site for later hs-cTn testing. Outcomes of any pre-hospital study measurements&#xD;
      (i.e. pre-hospital POC cTn results or calculated pre-hospital HEART-scores) are blinded to&#xD;
      the physicians at the ED and will not affect usual care. According to current practice, all&#xD;
      patients will be transported to the hospital for further evaluation. At the emergency&#xD;
      department (ED) all included patients will undergo regular hs-cTn testing and HEART-score&#xD;
      assessment performed by emergency physicians (standard care), and an extra venous blood&#xD;
      sample will be drawn for this study. Additional cTn tests (POC and hs-cTn) will be performed&#xD;
      in the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. HEART-score agreement (interobserver variability between pre-hospital and in-hospital&#xD;
           HEART-score assessment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Final diagnosis of NSTE-ACS at discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Myocardial infarction at discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Composite endpoint (cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, urgent&#xD;
           revascularisation) at 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Angina frequency and stability, physical limitations, treatment satisfaction,&#xD;
           quality-of-life, cardiac anxiety and depression (SAQ, PHQ-4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: Total follow-up duration is 30 days after initial presentation. Other demographic&#xD;
      and clinical parameters at baseline will be taken into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: All patients will undergo a POC cTn test performed by ambulance personnel. In&#xD;
      all patients, two venous blood samples will be drawn in the pre-hospital phase (1x) and at&#xD;
      the emergency department (1x). Besides the minimal risks of performing a POC finger prick&#xD;
      test, no other risks are involved with study participation. All patients will be asked to&#xD;
      fill in questionnaires (i.e. SAQ, PHQ-4) at baseline and at follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>HEART-score agreement (interobserver variability between pre-hospital and in-hospital HEART-score assessment): the calculated heart score by the ambulance will be subtracted from the calculated score of the emergency department. The minimum value could be -10 and the maximum value could be +10. A positive score means that the ambulance estimates the patient to be sicker or at higher risk. A negative value means that the ED estimates the patient to be sicker/at higher risk for developing major adverse cardiac events.</description>

    <description>All patients with a suspicion of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) in the pre-hospital phase are eligible for inclusion. In all included patients, the POC cTn will be performed and the HEART-score will be calculated in the pre-hospital phase.

Outcomes of both the POC cTn or the pre-hospital HEART-score will be blinded for the physicians at the emergency department (ED) and will not affect current treatment strategy. All patients with suspected NSTE-ACS will undergo hs-cTn testing and the HEART-score will also be calculated at the ED (T1, standard of care). Here, an additional venous blood sample will be drawn next to routine blood testing testing (T1).</description>
