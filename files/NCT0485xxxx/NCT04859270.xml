  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-cardiac arrest mortality remains high and proper care after cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      resuscitation is an important clinical challenge. This prospective observational cohort aims&#xD;
      to (1) identify the factors that affect short-term and long-term survival in post-cardiac&#xD;
      arrest survivors and (2) investigate the patients and their families' health-related quality&#xD;
      of life and psychological well-being.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For this cohort study, adult survivors (â‰§20 years) of sudden cardiac arrest for more than 5&#xD;
      minutes after cardiopulmonary resuscitation will be enrolled. Basic demographic information,&#xD;
      clinical events throughout hospitalization, and laboratory examination results will be&#xD;
      recorded. Patients will be assessed for their neurological outcome using Glasgow coma score&#xD;
      (GCS) and cerebral performance categories (CPC) upon hospital discharge, 1, 3, 6, and 12&#xD;
      months after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-cardiac arrest care is clinically challenging and this study aims to evaluate not just&#xD;
      the physical well-being but also the psychological well-being of these patients on the&#xD;
      short-term and long-term survival. Patients and their families will be assessed on their&#xD;
      health-related quality of life and psychological well-being upon hospital discharge using the&#xD;
      following scales: Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory (MPAI-4), World Health Organization&#xD;
      Quality of Life Scale (WHOQOL-BREF), Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R), and Family&#xD;
      Resilience Framework. They will also be followed for one year after discharge at 1, 3, 6, and&#xD;
      12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using the SPSS and SAS package. Odds ratios and hazards ratios will be&#xD;
      determined for the factors that affect survival after cardiac arrest. The findings will help&#xD;
      clinicians provide timely support to the patients and their families to promote physical and&#xD;
      psychological well-being, and integrate them back to society as soon as possible.&#xD;
