&#xD;
               -  Located at a bifurcation in the anterior or posterior circulation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Aneurysm neck diameter between 2 and 10 mm and aneurysm equatorial diameter&#xD;
                  between 2 and 10.5 mm&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Wide-necked, defined as neck size ≥ 4 mm or a dome/neck ratio &lt; 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient may be treated with Contour without the use of additional implanted devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient is able to comply with all aspects of the screening, evaluation, treatment,&#xD;
             and the post-procedure follow-up schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient or legally authorized representative has signed and dated an institutional&#xD;
             review board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC)-approved written informed consent prior to&#xD;
             initiation of any study procedures.&#xD;

             FOR PATIENTS WITH UNRUPTURED ANEURYSM&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient meets the criteria outlined in the &quot;Guidelines for the Management of Patients&#xD;
             With Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms&quot; as published by the AHA/ASA FOR PATIENTS WITH&#xD;
             RUPTURED ANEURYSM&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient meets the criteria outlined in the &quot;Guidelines for the Management of&#xD;
             Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: A Guideline for Healthcare Professionals From the&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Target IA contains other devices/implants (e.g., coils) that could interfere with the&#xD;
             correct placement of the Contour device&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has a known, untreatable hypersensitivity to contrast dye, iodine, or any&#xD;

             seizure disorder).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score ≥ 2 prior to presentation or rupture (as&#xD;
