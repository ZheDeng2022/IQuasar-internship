  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two mobile health technologies&#xD;
      (text messaging or a mobile app) designed to help people take HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis&#xD;
      (PrEP) as directed by the clinic. PrEP is the use of a daily anti-HIV medications by&#xD;
      HIV-negative people to help prevent HIV infection.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinic-based, multi-site, randomized, two-arm study to compare the effectiveness of&#xD;
      two mobile technologies designed to support PrEP adherence and continuation in cisgender and&#xD;
      transgender men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW). All study&#xD;
      participants will receive PrEP per standard of care at each of the study sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to PrEPmate will receive an interactive bidirectional text-messaging&#xD;
      intervention that supports PrEP use through personalized communication between patients and&#xD;
      providers. Key components include (1) weekly short message service (SMS) check-ins and a&#xD;
      bidirectional SMS messaging platform; (2) customized daily SMS pill-taking reminders; (3)&#xD;
      link to online PrEP Basics and videos and testimonials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to Dot Diary will receive a mobile app that promotes self-management&#xD;
      of PrEP use and sexual health. Key components include (1) a digital pill-taking and sexual&#xD;
      diary, with pill-taking reminders; (2) sex-positive badges earned via app use; and (3)&#xD;
      real-time feedback on protection levels afforded by PrEP. Each participant will be followed&#xD;
      for approximately 12 months. Staff at the participating clinics will also participate in&#xD;
      in-depth interviews to give feedback on implementation challenges and experiences in the&#xD;
      clinic-setting, and experience working with patients using the mobile technologies.&#xD;

    <description>PrEP adherence will be measured by tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) levels in dried blood spots (DBS). Adequate adherence will be defined as having a TFV-DP ≥ 700 femtomoles/punch in DBS for daily PrEP users, which has been associated with high levels of protection in prior PrEP trials.</description>

    <measure>Sexual satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Sexual satisfaction measured through 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Sexual satisfaction will be measured by the New Sexual Satisfaction Scale Short Version (NSSS-S), a validated 12-item questionnaire in which patients score their sexual satisfaction on five dimensions (sexual sensations, sexual presence/awareness, sexual exchange, emotional connection/closeness, and sexual activity)</description>

    <intervention_name>PrEPmate</intervention_name>
    <description>PrEPmate is a multi-component mHealth intervention grounded in the information, motivation, behavioral skills (IMB) theory of behavior change and developed through user-centered design. PrEPmate promotes personalized communication between patients and providers through interactive weekly &quot;check-in&quot; messages asking participants how PrEP is going, allowing navigators to identify patients needing more help in taking PrEP, and customized daily pill-taking reminder messages. Trained PrEP navigators reach out to participants who indicate they need assistance via text or phone call and provide tailored support. Additionally, the platform supports 2-way communication between patients and PrEP navigators, including reminders for upcoming clinic visits. Participants are provided links to key information about PrEP (PrEP Basics), and video testimonials of peers taking PrEP. Messages are available in English and Spanish. PrEPmate is aimed at both patients and PrEP navigators.</description>

    <intervention_name>Dot Diary</intervention_name>
    <description>Dot Diary is a mobile phone app that integrates an electronic pill-taking and sex diary and delivers real-time feedback on PrEP protection. Using the self-management model to increase self-efficacy and patient empowerment, participants log daily PrEP pill-taking and sexual behaviors in the app, which then provides real-time feedback on the level of protection achieved from PrEP (high, medium, low), and customized instructions on doses of PrEP needed to achieve or maintain high protection. Participants can also view a weekly and monthly calendar, including visualizations of the proportion of sex acts covered by PrEP. Finally, the Dot Diary app incorporates gamification components, including an ability to earn sex-positive badges, to increase engagement. Dot Diary is aimed only at patients.</description>
