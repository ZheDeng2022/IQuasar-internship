  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With this study the researchers aim to provide observational data on the treatment efficacy&#xD;
      of currently used antibiotic treatment regimens for NTS BSI in hospital-admitted children.&#xD;
      The study is an observational cohort study where the antibiotic treatments used and treatment&#xD;
      outcomes in the St. Luc general referral hospital in Kisantu health zone (Province Kongo&#xD;
      Central, DR Congo) will be described.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In sub-Saharan Africa, non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) are a frequent cause of bloodstream&#xD;
      infection (BSI) in young children, display high levels of antibiotic resistance and have a&#xD;
      high case fatality rate (15%). In Kisantu hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR&#xD;
      Congo), NTS account for 75% of blood culture pathogens in young children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, NTS BSI are mostly treated with third generation cephalosporins or&#xD;
      fluoroquinolones. However, resistance to these antibiotics is emerging in NTS BSI. Third&#xD;
      generation cephalosporine and fluoroquinolone resistant Salmonella are identified as critical&#xD;
      priority pathogens by the World Health Organization (WHO). To combat the developing&#xD;
      antimicrobial resistance, rational and evidence-based antibiotic treatment of NTS BSI is&#xD;
      crucial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, there are no guidelines to treat NTS BSI in a low-resource setting. The currently&#xD;
      used antibiotic regimens are experience-based or extrapolated from typhoid fever. The absence&#xD;
      of dedicated studies addressing antibiotic treatment efficacy in NTS BSI in sub-Saharan&#xD;
      African children hampers the development of evidence-based antibiotic treatment guidelines&#xD;
      and antibiotic stewardship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical practice guidelines established for high- and middle-income countries recommend 7 -&#xD;
      14 days of parenteral antibiotic treatment for NTS BSI. In sub-Saharan Africa however,&#xD;
      financial, logistic and nursing care barriers preclude such long parenteral treatment&#xD;
      regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To decrease the case fatality and combat antibiotic resistance of NTS BSI in its most&#xD;
      affected population (i.e. children in sub-Saharan Africa), data that support appropriate&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment (i.e. antibiotic class, dose, route and duration) are urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers aim to provide observational data on the treatment efficacy of currently used&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment regimens for NTS BSI in hospital-admitted children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They hypothesize that, in terms of treatment efficacy in hospital admitted children with NTS&#xD;
      BSI, a short course of parenteral antibiotics (&lt;7 days) with switch to oral antibiotics is&#xD;
      not inferior to a full parenteral antibiotic course (≥7 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as a prospective, single-center, hospital-based observational study on&#xD;
      the efficacy of antibiotic treatment of a cohort of young children (1 month to 5 years old)&#xD;
      with NTS BSI. Data will be collected from the enrolled children during three different study&#xD;
      phases, i.e., upon admission, daily in-hospital follow-up and post-discharge follow-up.&#xD;
