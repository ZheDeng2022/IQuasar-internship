  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common malignancy in the world.&#xD;
      Major hepatectomy (resection of &gt; 3 liver segments) is needed if tumor is close to major&#xD;
      blood vessels within liver. Despite low mortality, open major hepatectomy (OMH) is associated&#xD;
      with high tumor recurrence rate, and short survival. Immunosuppression due to surgical stress&#xD;
      and blood transfusion, and dissemination of tumor cells because of tumor manipulation all&#xD;
      contribute to tumor recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic major hepatectomy (LMH) is a newly developed minimally invasive technique for&#xD;
      HCC. Apart from less wound problems and shorter recovery time than open surgery, LMH may have&#xD;
      potential oncological benefits of prolonging survival. These could be related to the reduced&#xD;
      intraoperative blood loss, less immunosuppression due to surgical stress, and less tumor&#xD;
      manipulation. Hence, LMH could be a better treatment option than OMH for HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the long-term oncological outcome between laparoscopic and open major&#xD;
           hepatectomy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To achieve the comparison under the study design of multi-center randomized trial&#xD;
           involving 5 high-volume centers in Asia-Pacific region&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Primary outcome is 2-year recurrence-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Secondary outcome as intraoperative blood loss, blood transfusion, 30-day and hospital&#xD;
           mortality, postoperative morbidities according Clavien-Dindo classification, hospital&#xD;
           stay, quality of life, overall and recurrence-free survival rates up to 5 years after&#xD;
           surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To compare the perioperative changes in stress-related cytokines, which help to clarify&#xD;
           the stress response and immunosuppression and their correlations with overall and&#xD;
           recurrence-free survival rates&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Laparoscopic major hepatectomy is associated with less surgical stress, less&#xD;
      immunosuppression and thus less tumor recurrence and better survival than open major&#xD;
      hepatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is an open-labelled prospective randomized trial involving 106 patients in&#xD;
      each treatment arm (Total number of patients recruited: 212). The study will involve 5&#xD;
      surgery centers in Asia-Pacific region (2 centers in Hong Kong, 3 centers in Mainland China&#xD;
      Foshan, Shanghai and Sichuan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Patients with HCC undergone major hepatectomy. Recruitment centres involved:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Department of Surgery, The Chinese University of Hong Kong&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Department of Surgery, Kwong Wah Hospital, Hong Kong&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Department of Surgery, West China Medical School of Sichuan University&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Department of Biliary Surgery, Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital &amp; Institute,&#xD;
           Second Military Medical University&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Department of Surgery, The First People's Hospital of Foshan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Consented patient will be randomized 1:1 to one of the two treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Laparoscopic group: LMH&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Open group: OMH The randomization schedule will be generated by the Clinical Trials&#xD;
           Centre (CTC) of principle investigator's center, prior to the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measure: The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that LMH is associated&#xD;
      with less surgical stress, less immunosuppression and thus less tumor recurrence and better&#xD;
      survival than OMH. The primary outcome measure is 2-year recurrence-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: Statistical plan and data monitoring Statistical analysis will be performed&#xD;
      using SPSS version 11.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill). The 2-year recurrence-free survival&#xD;
      (primary outcome) will be evaluated by Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank test&#xD;
      between studied groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: The result of this study provides level 1 evidence on the best treatment&#xD;
      option for HCC, which needs major hepatectomy. Such information will influence the&#xD;
      evidence-based policy in professional practice in the management algorithm for HCC. Since&#xD;
      postoperative complications and tumor recurrence are substantial after OMH, potential&#xD;
      benefits of LMH tested in this study will help to alleviate these problems.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common malignancy in the&#xD;
      world.The practice of screening by ultrasonography and serum alpha-fetoprotein concentration&#xD;
      in cirrhotic patients and hepatitis B carriers has led to an increasing incidence of HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatectomy, local ablation and liver transplantation are regarded as the mainstay of&#xD;
      curative treatment for HCC according to international guidelines by EASL, AASLD and ESMO.The&#xD;
      shortage of liver grafts has limited the application of liver transplantation. Hepatectomy is&#xD;
      thus widely accepted as the treatment option of choice for patients with HCC and non&#xD;
      cirrhotic liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major hepatectomy (resection of &gt; 3 Couinaud's segments) is always needed when HCC is large&#xD;
      or is close to major blood vessels within liver. With the advancements in techniques of&#xD;
      hepatectomy and perioperative patient care, the operative mortality of open major hepatectomy&#xD;
      (OMH) has reduced to &lt; 5% in recent years. Nonetheless, OMH for HCC is still associated with&#xD;
      major problems as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. It is associated with significant morbidities. The morbidity rate after OMH remains high&#xD;
           (30% - 40%) even in high-volume centres. Wound infection and bronchopneumonia are among&#xD;
           the most common complications after hepatic resection. Long incision and vigorous&#xD;
           retraction of the rib cage are required to achieve adequate exposure of the liver tumor&#xD;
           during hepatic resection. As a result, sepsis due to chest complications and wound&#xD;
           problems are frequently encountered. Furthermore, division of the porto-systemic&#xD;
           collaterals in the anterior abdominal wall contributes to postoperative ascites, which&#xD;
           is another common complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. It is associated with a high tumor recurrence rate, even when performed with a curative&#xD;
           intent. The 3-year recurrence rate has been reported to be more than 50%. Most&#xD;
           recurrences occur in the liver remnant, in the forms of intrahepatic metastasis or&#xD;
           multicentric tumor recurrence. Risk factors related to recurrence include unfavorable&#xD;
           tumor factors such as microscopic venous or capsular invasion. Hence, tumor cell&#xD;
           dissemination could be the main mechanism of recurrence. In this context, manipulation&#xD;
           of the tumor during OMH leading to tumor cell dissemination can potentially contribute&#xD;
           to high tumor recurrence rate. Furthermore, it has been suggested that postoperative&#xD;
           immunosuppression induced by surgical stress may induce tumor growth in the liver&#xD;
           remnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopy has a well-defined role in the staging and diagnosis of hepatobiliary&#xD;
      malignancies. However, laparoscopic hepatectomy has not yet been widely practiced, because of&#xD;
      the technical difficulties in liver resection, difficulty in the control of hemorrhage during&#xD;
      liver transection and retraction of the liver for optimum exposure. With the advanced&#xD;
      laparoscopic techniques, much enthusiasm has been developed in laparoscopic major hepatectomy&#xD;
      (LMH). Recent series have proven the feasibility and safety of LMH for HCC. The selection&#xD;
      criteria of the reported series included tumor size up to 10cm and single or multiple tumors&#xD;
      confined to one liver lobe. The overall conversion rates was around 10%. There was no&#xD;
      hospital mortality and the morbidity rate was about 10%. Apart from the documented advantages&#xD;
      of laparoscopic surgery (less wound and chest complications, and shorter hospital stay),&#xD;
      theoretically, LMH carries oncological advantages over OMH. LMH may result in less surgical&#xD;
      stress and immunosuppression due to less intraoperative blood loss than OMH. Moreover, using&#xD;
      laparoscopic instruments, it involves minimal manipulation of the tumor and less cancer cells&#xD;
      dissemination during surgery. Potentially, postoperative tumor recurrence could be reduced&#xD;
      and hence patient survival could be prolonged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, only retrospective studies using propensity score matching to compare LMH with OMH&#xD;
      were reported. In these study, the studied patient number was small (&lt; 40) in each matched&#xD;
      treatment arm and the reported 2-year overall (86% - 88% vs. 85% - 100%) and recurrence-free&#xD;
      survival (72% - 83% vs. 81% - 85%) rates were comparable between OMH and LMH. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      there is a trend that LMH is associated with better overall and recurrence-free survival than&#xD;
      OMH. It is likely that these studies were underpowered (Type II error) to show the potential&#xD;
      oncological benefits of LMH over OMH. Because of these limited data on LMH, according to&#xD;
      EASL, AASLD and ESMO guidelines, its role for HCC is still not yet defined. In the sphere of&#xD;
      laparoscopic hepatectomy, according to the European Guideline Meeting for Laparoscopic Liver&#xD;
      Surgery (Southampton consensus), there was only limited data on short-term outcome but no&#xD;
      data on long-term outcome of LMH. With these reasons, there is an urge for a prospective&#xD;
      study aiming to define the role of LMH for HCC with respect to its potential oncological&#xD;
      benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the principle investigator's institution (the Department of Surgery, The Chinese&#xD;
      University of Hong Kong), preliminary data using propensity score matching analysis on&#xD;
      patients with HCC (median size = 4cm) undergone either laparoscopic (n = 112) or open&#xD;
      hepatectomy (n = 224) (major hepatectomy accounts for 40.5%), the intraoperative blood loss&#xD;
      (median: 159 mL vs. 419 mL), blood transfusion rate (0% vs. 4.5%) and morbidity rate (5.4%&#xD;
      vs. 28.1%) were significantly lower in laparoscopic group than open group. The hospital&#xD;
      mortality (0% vs. 0.4%), long-term overall (5-year: 56% vs. 42%) and recurrence free (5-year:&#xD;
      36% vs. 33%) survival rates were comparable between groups. (Supplementary information&#xD;
      attached) With this experience, the principle investigator proposes an open labelled&#xD;
      prospective multi-center randomized trial (AP-LAPO Trial) comparing LMH with OMH for HCC.&#xD;
      This study involves 5 high-volume centres specialized in liver surgery and with facilities&#xD;
      supporting LMH and OMH in Asia-Pacific region (Hong Kong, Sichuan, Guangzhou and Foshan).&#xD;
      These centres perform at least 30 LMH or OMH per year (The Chinese University of Hong Kong,&#xD;
      median no. = 51; Kwong Wah Hospital, median no. = 30; West China Medical School of Sichuan&#xD;
      University, median no. 120; Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital &amp; Institute, median no. =&#xD;
      115; The First People's Hospital of Foshan, median no. = 102), and have achieved excellent&#xD;
      perioperative and oncological outcome after LMH or OMH (operative mortality 1% - 2%;&#xD;
      complication rate 14% - 23%; 2-year overall survival rate 85% - 88%; 2-year disease-free&#xD;
      survival rate 81% - 84%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and hypothesis: The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that LMH is&#xD;
      associated with less surgical stress, less immunosuppression and thus less tumor recurrence&#xD;
      and better survival than OMH. The primary outcome measure is 2-year recurrence-free survival.&#xD;
      The secondary outcome measures include hospital mortality, morbidity, quality of life and&#xD;
      overall survival between groups. Besides, stress-related cytokines (interleukin-6 [IL-6] and&#xD;
      immunosuppressive acidic protein[IAP]) will also be measured during the perioperative&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation: Based on a reported 2-year recurrence-free survival rate of 72% after&#xD;
      OMH and an expected 88% after LMH (about 20% improvement) according to a previously reported&#xD;
      series, 106 patients need to be recruited to each arm in order to demonstrate a statistically&#xD;
      significant difference with a 80% power at the 0.05 level of 2-sided significant difference&#xD;
      between laparoscopic and open hepatic resection, allowing a drop-out rate of 10%. This sample&#xD;
      size will also allow detection of reduction of 2-year tumor recurrence from 50% in OMH group&#xD;
      to 30% in LMH with a similar power and level of significance. The principle investigator's&#xD;
      unit is a major referral center for management of HCC in Hong Kong, with more than 150 new&#xD;
      cases seen per year. There are one other centers in Hong Kong and 3 centers in Mainland&#xD;
      China, which are specialized in both laparoscopic and open surgery for patients with HCC,&#xD;
      with referral patient number ranging from 50 to 200 per year. The planned number of patients&#xD;
      recruited in each participating centres is as follows (The Chinese University of Hong Kong, N&#xD;
      = 32; Kwong Wah Hospital, N = 20; West China Medical School of Sichuan University, N = 50;&#xD;
      Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital &amp; Institute, N = 50; The First People's Hospital of&#xD;
      Foshan, median no. = 60) It is therefore expected that recruitment can be completed in about&#xD;
      12 months. All patients will be observed for at least 24 months after treatment. Hence, the&#xD;
      total period of study including follow-up is estimated to be about 3 years for the funding&#xD;
      period. After the funding period, recruited patients will be followed up periodically up to 5&#xD;
      years after surgery to evaluate the long-term outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS version 11.0 (SPSS&#xD;
      Inc., Chicago, Ill). The 2-year recurrence-free survival (primary outcome) will be evaluated&#xD;
      by Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank test between studied groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other secondary outcome measures will be compared using Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact&#xD;
      test for categorical variables, and Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables between&#xD;
      groups. Overall survival is again computed by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the&#xD;
      log-rank test between groups. P &lt; 0.05 is considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical consideration: All aspects of the study will be discussed with each subject during a&#xD;
      phone interview or screening visit. An information sheet will be provided, and each subject&#xD;
      will be given the opportunity to seek medical advice or to discuss the study with friends or&#xD;
      family prior to involvement. Each volunteer will give written, informed consent, in&#xD;
      accordance with the attached form, and the subjects will be free to withdraw from the study&#xD;
      at any time. This study will be performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki of 1975 and its later versions. Ethics approval from the&#xD;
      institutional review broad of individual center will be sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance to clinical applications: The proposed study is an open-labelled prospective&#xD;
      multi-center randomized trial investigating the potential benefits of laparoscopic major&#xD;
      hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as compared to conventional open surgery. It&#xD;
      involves 5 high-volume surgery centers in the Asia-Pacific region, where the incidence of&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma is high. The result of this study provides level 1 evidence on the&#xD;
      best treatment option for HCC, which needs major hepatectomy. Such information will influence&#xD;
      the evidence-based policy in professional practice in the management algorithm for HCC. Since&#xD;
      postoperative complications and tumor recurrence are substantial after OMH, potential&#xD;
      benefits of LMH tested in this study will help to alleviate these problems. Ultimately, the&#xD;
      long-term survival of patients with HCC could be improved.&#xD;
