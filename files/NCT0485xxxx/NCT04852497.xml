      Context :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ventricular tachycardia (VT) are serious heart rhythm disorders which can lead to sudden&#xD;
      death. A curative treatment for these abnormalities in the cardiac electrical conduction&#xD;
      system is possible through an interventional electrophysiology procedure. A catheter is&#xD;
      inserted, generally via a femoral access, and is introduced in the heart ventricles in order&#xD;
      to collect various 3D electro-anatomical maps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pace-mapping technique developed in Nancy (de Chillou et al, Heart Rhythm 2014) allows&#xD;
      the reentrant circuit underlying the VT to be identified, as well as a definition of the&#xD;
      target zones to be ablated, using radiofrequency energy with the catheter. The pace-mapping&#xD;
      technique consists of stimulating the ventricle from various sites within its internal&#xD;
      surface, in order to generate different activation pathways of the myocardium. When an&#xD;
      activation pathway is similar to the VT pathway, this means that the stimulation site is&#xD;
      located near the pathologic zone to be ablated. The surface electrocardiogram (ECG) is used&#xD;
      to compare activation pathways. A 3D correlation ma is then generated: the zones with high&#xD;
      correlation (&gt;90%) indicated the exit of the reentrant circuit, while rapid transition zones&#xD;
      (several %/mm) indicate the entrance of the VT circuit. The pace-mapping technique has&#xD;
      several limitations: (i) it requires an ECG recording of the clinical VT of the patient&#xD;
      (spontaneous or induced at the beginning of the procedure), however it is not always possible&#xD;
      to induce it; (ii) sometimes several VT circuits may be present, rendering the procedure of&#xD;
      identification and ablation non-exhaustive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to analyze retrospectively electroanatomical data collected during&#xD;
      the intervention, in order to develop a new method for identifying target zones to be&#xD;
      ablated, and to compare the results with the conventionally used method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that alternative methods to analyze electroanatomical data&#xD;
      (surface ECG and spatial coordinates of the pacing sites) could provide information&#xD;
      equivalent to conventional methods (e.g. VT correlation map, VT activation maps etcâ€¦) without&#xD;
      the need for a reference recording of the clinical VT of the patient.&#xD;
