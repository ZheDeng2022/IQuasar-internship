&#xD;
      Detailed Description&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. The main objective of the present paper: Explore the impact of compassion empathy on an&#xD;
      empathic attunement training program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following hypothesis will be contrasted:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Presumably, the training on empathy/compassion will increase therapeutic presence to a&#xD;
           larger extent than the empathy/focusing training. A statistically significant effect of&#xD;
           the interaction of time x group on presence scores is expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Presumably, the training on empathy/ compassion will increase the emotional regulation&#xD;
           abilities of the therapists to a larger extent than the empathy/focusing training. A&#xD;
           statistically significant effect of the interaction of time x group on the DERS&#xD;
           subscales ratings is expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Presumably, the empathy/compassion training will increase the therapists therapeutic&#xD;
           Alliance scoring to a larger extent than the empathy/focusing training. A statistically&#xD;
           significant effect of the interaction of time x group on the alliance scoring is&#xD;
           expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Presumably, the empathy/compassion training will reduce empathic distress (Interpersonal&#xD;
           Reactivity Index) and the empathic distress (Cognitive and Emotional Empathy Test), it&#xD;
           will increase empathic happiness (Cognitive and Emotional Empathy Test) and the empathic&#xD;
           worry (Interpersonal Reactivity Index) to a larger extent than the empathy/focusing&#xD;
           training. A statistically significant effect of the interaction of time x group on these&#xD;
           measures is expected. Specifically on the Interpersonal Reactivity Index and Cognitive&#xD;
           and Emotional Empathy Test subscales scores. On the other hand, fantasy (Interpersonal&#xD;
           Reactivity Index), empathic perspective (Interpersonal Reactivity Index), perspective&#xD;
           adoption (Cognitive and Emotional Empathy Test) and emotional understanding (Cognitive&#xD;
           and Emotional Empathy Test), are expected to remain unchanged on both empathy training&#xD;
           groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Mediation hypothesis: Changes of the therapist's empathy (Cognitive and Emotional&#xD;
           Empathy Test, Interpersonal Reactivity Index, empathic understanding, expressed empathy)&#xD;
           on empathy/compassion compared to empathy/focusing, will be mediated by changes on&#xD;
           facets of mindfulness (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire) and self-compassion&#xD;
           (Self-Compassion Scale; Sussex-Oxford Compassion Scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Spanish validation of empathy measures (empathic understanding subscale from&#xD;
      Barrett-Lennard´s relational inventory, expressed empathy, and the Sussex-Oxford Compassion&#xD;
      Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Criterion Validity: Statistically significant correlation between the expressed empathy&#xD;
           measure and empathic understanding measures are expected. Significant correlations&#xD;
           between self-report measures (Interpersonal Reactivity Index, Cognitive and Emotional&#xD;
           Empathy Test) and the measures of expressed empathy and the empathic understanding&#xD;
           measures, as well as therapeutic presence, are expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evidence for adequate reliability (Cronbach´s alfa and McDonald´s omega) on the empathic&#xD;
           understanding measures of the relational inventory, both on the therapists and the&#xD;
           patient's version, is expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evidence for an adequate interrater reliability on the expressed empathy measures is&#xD;
           expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Incremental validity: The patient's version of empathic understanding explain will show&#xD;
           statistically significant associations with the session evaluation (alliance), once&#xD;
           controlled the empathic understanding assessed by the therapists and expressed empathy&#xD;
           (assessed by external raters). However, the empathic understanding version of the&#xD;
           therapist will not explain variance once discounted the effect of the patient's version&#xD;
           and expressed empathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Explore patient variables related to empathy evaluation: the role of patient´s&#xD;
      self-critic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Empathy perceived by patients with higher self-critic scoring will be inferior to the&#xD;
           empathy perceived by patients with less self-critic scoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Empathy/compassion training will get higher scores on these patients than the&#xD;
           empathy/focusing training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To recruit people as patients, students from Comillas University will be asked to&#xD;
      participate, coming from Psychology and other degrees. They will be informed about the&#xD;
      research goals, as well as their role and personal data protection. If they wish to&#xD;
      participate, they will be asked to sign an informed consent to use the data and ask them to&#xD;
      facilitate their email so they can be contacted, and self-critic questionnaire will be&#xD;
      administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In every moment participants will have available the contact information of the main&#xD;
      researcher so they can ask any question or doubt. Participants will also be informed that&#xD;
      they can revoke their participation and the storage of their data at any moment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the therapists, a brochure will be disseminated on social networks with all the&#xD;
      information about the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and therapists will receive an email, with all the information about the research&#xD;
      development and will be asked to sign the informed consent about the usage of their&#xD;
      information, as well as a specific confidentiality document for the therapists about the&#xD;
      information they are going to gather from the patients during the online interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Therapists in training Based on previous meta-analysis, we predict a mean effect size (g&#xD;
           of Hedge=0.51) on the change between previous and subsequent moments to treatment. A&#xD;
           power analysis assuming an alfa of 0.05, with a potency of 0.8, reveals that 26&#xD;
           participants are necessary. A total of 30 participants for each condition is aimed in&#xD;
           this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To handle the high drop-out rate, usually present in online interventions, 80 therapists&#xD;
           will be randomly allocated between two conditions: compassion training and focusing&#xD;
           training.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exclusion criteria for the therapists group: every student that has taken the &quot;empathic&#xD;
           attunement&quot; course will be excluded. Subjects that have received training in either&#xD;
           focusing or compassion will also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inclusion criteria for the therapists group: Psychologists with experience in&#xD;
           Psychotherapy (at least one client).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants interviewed as patients A total of 40 people will be interviewed by the&#xD;
           therapists. Exclusion criteria for participants/patients: Participants presenting severe&#xD;
           mental illness (schizophrenia, psychotic and personality disorders) will be excluded,&#xD;
           those presenting severe addictions or eating disorders will also be excluded. The&#xD;
           presence of these diagnoses will be inquired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria for participants/patients: voluntary participation, above 18 years-old&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Quality assurance plan that addresses data validation and registry procedures, including&#xD;
      any plans for site monitoring and auditing: Two external experts will monitor and audit the&#xD;
      research project, and data registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method Once the voluntary therapists are inscribed, they will be randomized on one&#xD;
      randomizing session using sample function to generate random numbers on R statistical&#xD;
      package.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapists in training who participate will receive the measures exposed on table 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapist self-report measures. Pre and post self-report measures: Cognitive and Emotional&#xD;
      Empathy Test, Interpersonal Reactivity Index, Self-Compassion Scale, Five Facet Mindfulness&#xD;
      Questionnaire, Sussex-Oxford Compassion Scale Measures after the pre and post interview:&#xD;
      Presence and RI, Adherence to program measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this group of measures affective, cognitive and behavioral aspects of empathy are&#xD;
      encompassed. Participants on the patient's role will receive the measures depicted on Table&#xD;
      3. Two external judges will evaluate the 10 final minutes of the intervention, evaluating the&#xD;
      expressed empathy of the therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 3. Self- report measures for the participants on the patient role. BAI FSCRS RI-EU&#xD;
      therapist empathy (patient version) Therapist presence (patient version) SRS (session&#xD;
      evaluation)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interview method To make the interview, each patient and therapist will receive and&#xD;
      appointment by means of an online Teams session, to ensure data confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To simulate a psychotherapy session, and activate emotional processes previous to the&#xD;
      empathic exploration, the participant will be invited to do a two-chair dialogue to explore&#xD;
      his/her self-critic voice and his/her experiencing voice. Lastly, the therapist is asked to&#xD;
      explore empathically for 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mixed linear models will be used to analyze the impact of different types of training on the&#xD;
      dependent variables analyzed. The statistical package lme4 will be used (Bates, Mächler,&#xD;
      Bolker and Walker, 2015), of R (R Core Team, 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mediation analysis will be done using SPSS and the process syntax of Hayes (2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working with adherence criterion: Participants that do not attend more than a 25% of the&#xD;
      sessions will be eliminated. G * Power 3.1. 9. 6 (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, and Buchner, 2007)&#xD;
      was used for the potency calculations.&#xD;
