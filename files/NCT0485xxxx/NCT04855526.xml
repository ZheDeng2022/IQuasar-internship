  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Memory deficits are one of the most consistently observed cognitive effects of marijuana use.&#xD;
      There is evidence that some decrements attributable to the primary psychoactive ingredient,&#xD;
      delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), may be attenuated by cannabidiol (CBD). This study will&#xD;
      help us learn more about the relationship between THC and CBD consumption with memory&#xD;
      processes. A combination of MRI and neuropsychological tests (which are computer and&#xD;
      paper/pencil tasks) will be used to measure the neurocognitive and behavioral impacts of THC&#xD;
      and CBD use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With increased legalization and medicalization of marijuana (MJ), there is an urgent need to&#xD;
      understand the acute effects of use. One of the most consistently observed cognitive outcomes&#xD;
      associated with MJ use is memory dysfunction, which may have a substantial impact on daily&#xD;
      life in individuals using MJ for recreational or medicinal purposes. Notably, there are&#xD;
      numerous preparations of MJ with varying proportions of cannabinoids, which may differ in&#xD;
      behavioral and cognitive effects. For instance, there is emerging evidence that acute&#xD;
      administration of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive constituent of&#xD;
      MJ, hinders memory and reduces prefrontal and hippocampal functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (fMRI) activation, but cannabidiol (CBD) may mitigate some of these impairments.&#xD;
      Given the role of glutamate in learning and memory, the investigators suggest that these&#xD;
      effects may be subserved, in part, by glutamatergic mechanisms. The investigators will use&#xD;
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to non-invasively measure glutamate in order to explore&#xD;
      the neurochemical underpinnings of memory-related fMRI response changes following acute&#xD;
      administration of THC and CBD in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over&#xD;
      design. A total of 9 healthy participants ages 18-40 will be enrolled. Participants will&#xD;
      first undergo one screening visit (~4 hours), comprising informed consent, assessment of&#xD;
      health history, psychiatric diagnoses, cognitive function, and substance use history, and a&#xD;
      structural MRI session. This will be followed by 3 separate MJ dose visits (~4 hours each),&#xD;
      at which participants will complete neuroimaging after administration of one of 3&#xD;
      preparations of vaporized MJ in a randomized, counterbalanced, double-blinded fashion: 1)&#xD;
      high THC and no CBD (THC), 2) high THC and high CBD (THC+CBD), and 3) no THC and no CBD&#xD;
      (placebo MJ). As in the investigator's ongoing studies, bulk MJ plant material will be&#xD;
      provided by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. MJ dose visits will comprise MJ&#xD;
      administration, blood collection, MRS/fMRI scan, subjective reports, and a brief cognitive&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
