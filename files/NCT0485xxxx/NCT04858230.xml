  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is a first-in-man, single arm, open-label, single center study to assess&#xD;
      feasibility and safety of a novel implantable device, LymphoPilot, in patients suffering from&#xD;
      secondary upper limb lymphedema.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists in a first-in-man clinical investigation for LymphoPilot, an&#xD;
      investigational implantable medical device. LymphoPilot is composed of an implanted part and&#xD;
      an external wearable device. The implanted part (pump, drainage catheter and output&#xD;
      catheter), is implanted in the subcutaneous tissue of the arm and drains excess fluids to the&#xD;
      supraclavicular subcutaneous tissue, where fluids are naturally reabsorbed by the healthy&#xD;
      lymphatic and venous system. The external part consists in a wearable controller used to&#xD;
      activate the implanted pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subcutaneous implantation of the device is performed in loco-regional anesthesia, in&#xD;
      ambulatorial settings, and the patient is dismissed from the hospital on the same day of the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device is activated in the postoperative room by placing the external wearable device on&#xD;
      patient's arm area, in proximity of the implanted pump. Patients are required to wear the&#xD;
      external controller continuously throughout the study, except 30 minutes per day, to allow&#xD;
      taking a shower/bath.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits are planned 1, 4 and 8 weeks after device implantation. The implanted device&#xD;
      is removed with a surgical procedure in local anesthesia 8 weeks after device implantation,&#xD;
      and 2 additional follow-up visits are planned after device removal.&#xD;
