  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of the Wolverhampton Assessment Tool (WATapp), a five-item questionnaire for&#xD;
      patients with advanced or metastatic prostate cancer to say how they feel normally in terms&#xD;
      of pain, urinary frequency, eating, and tiredness. It is widely recognised that&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes give a measure of overall effect of clinicians' actions on patients&#xD;
      and that they can be used to guide the management of the patient's condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WATapp is designed to reduce the need for the patient to attend hospital so much for routine&#xD;
      follow-up consultations (an important aspect in light of COVID-19), to give the patient some&#xD;
      sense of agency and control and to inform his clinician of just he feels he is coping with&#xD;
      his treatment. Now the investigators want to find out just how the results from WATapp&#xD;
      correspond to, for example, changes in the patient's PSA, testosterone or other blood results&#xD;
      which are routinely measured; and to find out how patients and clinicians feel about using&#xD;
      WATapp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men with advanced or metastatic prostate cancer will be eligible to take part in the study&#xD;
      and participation is in addition to whatever treatment they are on. Clinicians who choose to&#xD;
      offer WATapp to their patients will also be invited to take part and they will be asked to&#xD;
      share with the researchers anonymised, linked patient data and scores from WATapp.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      It is widely recognised that patient-reported outcomes give a measure of overall effect of&#xD;
      clinicians' actions on patients and that they can be used to guide the management of the&#xD;
      patient's condition. They can also have an empowering effect as the patient may feel that&#xD;
      they are agents, and not just subjects, in their treatment pathway. In the case of advanced&#xD;
      and metastatic prostate cancer (i.e. cancer which has spread from the prostate to distant&#xD;
      sites), the clinical means of assessing how the patient's disease is responding to treatment&#xD;
      (radiological/magnetic scans) are somewhat imperfect as they do not take into account the&#xD;
      impact on the patient's life and his response and reaction. Patient-reported outcomes, such&#xD;
      as WATapp, allow a way to measure the impact of clinicians' actions on patients' lives. They&#xD;
      offer an assessment of how well treatments are working and this is critical in the management&#xD;
      of patients with advanced or metastatic prostate cancer. Failure to recognise how the patient&#xD;
      responds to treatment can lead to effective treatment being stopped inappropriately;&#xD;
      progression of the disease may not always be recognised; and the patient may have unnecessary&#xD;
      side effects that go unchecked. Ignoring the patient-reported outcomes, such as WATapp, can&#xD;
      reduce the opportunity to use alternative treatments. WATapp has been developed as an&#xD;
      objective and reproducible clinical assessment tool by using questions from these validated&#xD;
      clinical study tools:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate; The Brief Pain Inventory; The&#xD;
      Karnofsky Performance Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
      WATapp was refined with patient and clinician input to produced the present 5-item&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a mixed-method study, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative elements. As&#xD;
      such, it is both objective and subjective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. It is subjective in that, in using the WATapp, the patient selects his response to each&#xD;
           question on the basis of how he feels normally&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. It is objective in that the tools to be used in the analysis of the quantitative data&#xD;
           [i.e. statistical tests such as Mann Whitney-U, Spearman Rank Correlation etc.] are&#xD;
           independent of the person using them&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determining clinically the patient's disease status employs objective measures such as&#xD;
           PSA, size, distribution and type of metastasis, frequency of night-time urination etc.&#xD;
           as well as the clinician's professional judgment which contains both objective and&#xD;
           subjective elements&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The researchers are not mirrors but rather prisms and hence the entire study from&#xD;
           conception to analysis and report is a refraction of their experiences&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 The main outcome of the first phase will be to refine, as necessary, both the WATapp&#xD;
      and the research instruments as well as to establish proof of principle of the clinical&#xD;
      utility of WATapp. This will entail a full pilot of the WATapp in New Cross Hospital,&#xD;
      Wolverhampton. Patients who agree to use the WATapp to self-monitor aspects of their health&#xD;
      will be invited to consent to share with the researchers their anonymised data from it as&#xD;
      well as linked, anonymised clinical data. The frequency of collection of data will be at the&#xD;
      discretion of the clinician. Participating patients and clinicians will be invited to take&#xD;
      part in a short, semi-structured interview on their experience of using WATapp. All patient&#xD;
      data will be treated anonymously, and none linked back to the patient or to their&#xD;
      clinician/s. Clinicians will be asked to record any reasons given by patients who decline to&#xD;
      use the WATapp. Whether a patient chooses or not to use WATapp or chooses or not to take part&#xD;
      in this study will have no bearing on their clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical data sought on patients will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Stage of cancer at diagnosis in terms of the primary tumour, and any presence of disease&#xD;
           in lymph nodes and bones&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Current stage of cancer in terms of the primary tumour, and any presence of disease in&#xD;
           lymph nodes and bones&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Level of PSA - prostate specific antigen, produced normally in the prostate but also&#xD;
           produced in prostate cancer cells, testosterone and other blood results which are&#xD;
           routinely measured&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Any other illnesses the patient may have&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Current and previous treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 The second phase is to invite oncologists across the West Midlands of England, many&#xD;
      of whom have already expressed an interest, to join the study and to send the researchers&#xD;
      anonymised, linked patient data (as in Phase 1) and that from the WATapp.&#xD;
