  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study for individuals who have cancer associated with human papillomavirus&#xD;
      (HPV) and are being treated with radiation as part of standard care for their cancer. Doctors&#xD;
      leading this study will use blood tests to find out if they can detect the HPV virus in the&#xD;
      blood of study participants before, during, and after radiation treatment. They will also&#xD;
      collect blood and archival tumor tissue (from a previous biopsy) to perform other tests in&#xD;
      the future that could provide more information about HPV-associated cancers and how they&#xD;
      respond to treatment. Participation in this study will last approximately 2 years.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Accuracy of HPV DNA Levels in Predicting Cancer Recurrence at 24 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The accuracy of post-treatment HPV DNA levels in predicting cancer recurrence at 24 months after treatment. This accuracy will be assessed using statistical calculations incorporating data from the participant's HPV DNA detection test results and clinical records.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Retrospective (Participants Who Have Already Been Treated for HPV-Related Cancer Before Study)</arm_group_label>
    <description>This group will use medical records from participants who have already received chemoradiation for their HPV-related anal or cervical cancer at a time before this study started. Because they have already received treatment, these participants will provide previous blood/tumor tissue samples that contain detectable HPV DNA as well as at least one post-treatment sample that their doctor collected before the study. Data from these previously collected samples will be compared to current samples from participants who are actively enrolled in this study in present day (chart review).</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Prospective (Participants Who Will Receive Radiation Treatment for HPV-Related Cancer During Study)</arm_group_label>
    <description>This group is for participants who plan to receive radiation treatment (with or without chemotherapy) for their HPV-related anal or cervical cancer during the time this study will be conducted. Participants in this group will sign a consent form allowing researchers to collect their blood samples and analyze/compare them to the samples from the retrospective group of participants.</description>
