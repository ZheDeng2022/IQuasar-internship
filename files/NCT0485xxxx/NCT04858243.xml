  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Men in sub-Saharan Africa who test HIV-positive continue to have poor ART initiation and&#xD;
      retention outcomes. The proposed project will test a home-based ART intervention for men who&#xD;
      are living with HIV compared to facility-based ART. Findings will provide essential&#xD;
      information on how to best reach men across the testing and treatment continuum, a critical&#xD;
      step to curbing the HIV epidemic.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Men in sub-Saharan Africa are less likely than women to use HIV services. HIV&#xD;
      testing strategies have dramatically improved for men through HIV self-testing (HIVST) and&#xD;
      other male-focused strategies, but men who are identified as living with HIV are still less&#xD;
      likely than women to initiate ART or remain in care, particularly within the first several&#xD;
      months after initiation. In Malawi, men represent only 31% of new ART initiates2 - and men on&#xD;
      ART are more likely than women to be lost to follow up (LTFU) at all time intervals of care&#xD;
      than women. Men's absence from care is concerning not only for their own health, but also for&#xD;
      the health of girls and young women who continue to be infected at unacceptably high rates.&#xD;
      Offering ART at home or other locations convenient for men (i.e., home-based ART) for a brief&#xD;
      period of time may help men overcome barriers related to facility-based treatment, develop&#xD;
      coping strategies for ART engagement, and better engage in facility-based services over the&#xD;
      long-term. In this study we will assess the impact of hbART by comparing two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Facility-Based ART (fbART arm): community-based male-specific counseling followed by linkage&#xD;
      to a local health facility for ART initiation and continuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home-Based ART (hbART arm): community-based male-specific counseling followed by home-based&#xD;
      ART initiation (or at any location that is convenient for participants) and home-based ART&#xD;
      continuation for a 3-month period, followed by linkage to a local health facility for further&#xD;
      ART continuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Our primary objective is to compare the impact of home-based ART against standard&#xD;
      of care for ART initiation and retention among men identified as HIV-positive through HIVST&#xD;
      in Malawi. Our specific Aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Test the effectiveness of hbART versus fbART on ART initiation and 6-month viral&#xD;
      suppression among men living with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Identify predictors of ART initiation and 6-month viral suppression in the hbART arm&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Determine the cost-effectiveness and scalability of hbART at a national level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: We will perform an individually randomized control trial with 700 HIV-positive men&#xD;
      who have not yet initiated ART and a subset of 400 of their female partners. Men will be&#xD;
      individually randomized 1:1 to one of the two intervention arms described above and will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study for 18-months or until 12-month retention (secondary outcome) can be&#xD;
      measured, whichever comes first. The study will be performed at 10 health facilities&#xD;
      supported by Partners in Hope (PIH). Data collection will include baseline and follow-up&#xD;
      surveys at 2-, 4-, and 7-months, as well as medical charter reviews for men at 2-, 4-, 7-,&#xD;
      and 13-months after study enrollment. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with a subset&#xD;
      of men and women to understand perceptions of the intervention and experiences with ART&#xD;
      engagement, and cost data from a provider perspective will be collected for a cost analysis&#xD;
      of each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated results: Findings will establish the effectiveness of home-based ART among men&#xD;
      living with HIV who have not yet engaged in treatment, and can directly inform HIV programs&#xD;
      throughout the region. Findings will also help us assess if short-term home-based ART is&#xD;
      sufficient to engage men in long-term facility-based care, or if additional, more&#xD;
      resource-intensive services are needed, such as major changes to the structure of&#xD;
      facility-based ART.&#xD;
