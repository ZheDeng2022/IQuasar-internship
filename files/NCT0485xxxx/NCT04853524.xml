        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, and vital signs&#xD;
             performed at screening. If there are abnormalities, the participant may be included&#xD;
             only if the investigator judges the abnormalities to be not clinically significant or&#xD;
             to be appropriate and reasonable for the population under study. This determination&#xD;
             must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by the&#xD;
             investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at screening. If the&#xD;
             results of the blood biochemistry, blood coagulation, and hematology, or urinalysis&#xD;
             are outside the normal reference ranges, the participant may be included only if the&#xD;
             investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically&#xD;
             significant or to be appropriate and reasonable for the population under study. This&#xD;
             determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by&#xD;
             the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative highly sensitive serum&#xD;
             (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [beta-hCG]) at screening and urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             on Day -1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood pressure (after the participant is supine for 5 minutes) between 90 and 140&#xD;
             millimeters of mercury (mmHg) systolic, inclusive, and no higher than 90 mmHg&#xD;
             diastolic. If blood pressure is out of range, up to 2 repeated assessments are&#xD;
             permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have a normal 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at screening, including: a)&#xD;
             predominant sinus rhythm, b) heart rate between 45 and 100 beats per minute (bpm),&#xD;
             extremes included, c) QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) interval less than or&#xD;
             equal to (&lt;=) 450 milliseconds (ms) in male participants/ &lt;= 470 ms in female&#xD;
             participants (QT interval corrected according to Fridericia [QTcF]), c) QRS interval&#xD;
             of less than (&lt;)120 ms, and d) PR interval &lt;=220 ms&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Having donated or lost 1 or more than 1 unit of blood (500 milliliter [mL]) or had any&#xD;
             clinically significant abnormal bleeding in the prior 60 days before the planned first&#xD;
             administration of a study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any history of clinically significant skin disease (as judged by the investigator)&#xD;
             such as, but not limited to, dermatitis, eczema, drug rash, psoriasis, food allergy,&#xD;
             and urticaria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of clinically significant drug allergy such as, but not limited to,&#xD;
             sulfonamides and penicillins, or drug allergy witnessed in previous studies with&#xD;
             experimental drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 or HIV-2 infection (confirmed by&#xD;
             antibodies) at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant history of liver disease or renal dysfunction (estimated&#xD;
             creatinine clearance &lt;60 milliliter per minute [mL/min]) at screening&#xD;
