    <textblock>
      Quercetin is one of the flavonoids. Quercetin as well as rutin are recognized to be among the&#xD;
      most active of the flavonoids. It is to quercetin that several medicinal plants, including&#xD;
      ginkgo and St. John's Wort, owe part of their therapeutic effects. Often combined with&#xD;
      vitamin C in supplements, it improves absorption by the body and delays its elimination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quercetin is extracted from a variety of plant sources, including the onion peel and seeds&#xD;
      and pods of Dimorphandra mollis, a tree in the legume family native to South America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, there is no scientific data to demonstrate the effectiveness of herbal medicine,&#xD;
      regardless of the plant, to prevent or treat COVID-19. On the other hand, some plant-based&#xD;
      food supplements have anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory properties that may disrupt&#xD;
      inflammatory defense mechanisms useful in fighting infections, and in particular against&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;

      Type of study: a randomized, double-blind study using the Quercetine in the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with SARS COV2 (covid-19) Quercetin is extracted from a variety of plant sources,&#xD;
      including the onion peel and the seeds and pods of Dimorphandra mollis, a legume tree native&#xD;
      to South America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although we are far from knowing everything about quercetin, its antioxidant,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory, and antihistamine (antiallergic) properties have been observed in numerous&#xD;
      in vitro and animal studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      History on quercetin In 1937, Albert Szent-Gyorgyi received a Nobel Prize for discovering&#xD;
      vitamin C and flavonoids, as well as for exploring their biochemical properties. Originally,&#xD;
      he gave the flavonoids the name &quot;vitamin P&quot; because of their effectiveness in reducing the&#xD;
      permeability of blood vessels. This name was abandoned when it was realized that these&#xD;
      substances were not really vitamins.&#xD;
