  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An adequate quantity of lean body mass is vital for optimal health and performance, and is&#xD;
      accrued when net protein balance (NPB) is positive. Amino acids are the building blocks of&#xD;
      protein, and when consumed following resistance exercise, significantly improve NPB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, no study has investigated how a supplement of all of the essential amino acids (EAA)&#xD;
      affects NPB following resistance exercise in a free-living, home-based setting, particularly&#xD;
      when compared to a supplement of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the impact of a novel EAA supplement on&#xD;
      anabolism (e.g., NPB) as compared to BCAA and placebo supplements following home-based&#xD;
      resistance exercise.&#xD;
