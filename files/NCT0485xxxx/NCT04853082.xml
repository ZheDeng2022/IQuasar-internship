    <textblock>
      The prevention and treatment of metabolic-related fatty liver disease (MAFLD) involves many&#xD;
      fields in preventive medicine and clinical medicine. So far, western medicine has not yet&#xD;
      completed the elucidation of the mechanism of this type of disease, and there is a lack of&#xD;
      effective therapeutic drugs.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and&#xD;
      safety of limonene capsules (marketed product in China) in the treatment of metabolic-related&#xD;
      fatty liver disease and related lipid-lowering mechanisms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In April 2020, in the famous journal &quot;Journal of Hepatology&quot; in the field of liver disease,&#xD;
      an internationally renowned liver disease expert group jointly proposed to replace&#xD;
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with metabolic associated fatty liver disease&#xD;
      (MAFLD) . The concept of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was first proposed by&#xD;
      Ludwig in 1980. It specifically refers to the excessive deposition of liver fat without&#xD;
      excessive drinking. It is a type of liver that is closely related to insulin resistance and&#xD;
      genetic susceptibility. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is China country's largest&#xD;
      chronic liver disease and the primary cause of abnormal liver enzymes in health examinations.&#xD;
      It can lead to liver disability and death. It is also closely related to a variety of&#xD;
      metabolic diseases and the high incidence of colorectal tumors. Western medicine has not yet&#xD;
      fully elucidated its mechanism, and no drugs have been officially approved for the clinical&#xD;
      treatment of NAFLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new MAFLD nomenclature highlights the central role of metabolic factors in causing liver&#xD;
      fat deposition in this type of liver disease. Traditional Chinese medicine believes that the&#xD;
      abnormal accumulation of fat in the liver of such fatty liver patients is a pathological&#xD;
      product of the microscopic loss of water and valley essence. It belongs to phlegm stasis,&#xD;
      which blocks the liver collaterals. It coincides with the core of the metabolic etiology of&#xD;
      recent liver disease experts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limonene is widely found in the essential oils of traditional Chinese medicine tangerine&#xD;
      peel, green peel and other plants. Its taste is sour, sweet and pungent.It is returned to the&#xD;
      liver and gallbladder meridian. It has an aromatic odor effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large number of animal and cell experiments in the early stage have shown that limonene can&#xD;
      inhibit the differentiation of adipocytes (pre-adipocytes) and promote the apoptosis of&#xD;
      mature adipocytes, which is related to the inhibition of fatty acid synthesis. Toxicity load&#xD;
      experiments show that limonene has very low toxicity. The accumulation of lipids in the liver&#xD;
      of mice has a regulatory effect with significantly reducing the content of liver cholesterol&#xD;
      and triglycerides, and also has a certain effect on lipid metabolism disorders, hyperglycemia&#xD;
      and other metabolic syndromes. It can alleviate the effects of high-fat diet and N- Efficacy&#xD;
      of nitro-L-arginine methyl ester-induced resistance to non-alcoholic fatty liver in rats. The&#xD;
      main indication of limonene capsules (marketed product in China) is liver and gallbladder&#xD;
      diseases. Traditional Chinese medicine believes that liver and gallbladder are related to&#xD;
      each other. This comprehensively shows that limonene capsules are promising to be developed&#xD;
      as a pure Chinese medicine product for the safe and effective treatment of MAFLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there has been no clinical evaluation of the clinical efficacy of limonene in the&#xD;
      treatment of metabolic-related fatty liver disease. As a typical aromatic Chinese medicine,&#xD;
      the mechanism of limonene in the treatment of fatty liver urgently needs to be revealed by&#xD;
      modern medicine and molecular biology techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study intends to use a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled method to evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of limonene on improving the degree of fat infiltration in patients with&#xD;
      metabolic-related fatty liver disease (MAFLD), and to evaluate its body mass index BMI, waist&#xD;
      circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, subcutaneous fat thickness, fat percentage, changes in&#xD;
      metabolic components, safety,etc. The study also intends to use metabonomics, genomics, and&#xD;
      molecular biology techniques to study the clinical relationship between metabolites and&#xD;
      physiological and pathological changes in patients with liver fat infiltration, and to detect&#xD;
      changes in key proteins and lipid components after drug intervention, which is to reveal&#xD;
      mechanism on treatment of metabolic-related fatty liver disease by limonene. It is aimed to&#xD;
      study the difference in the efficacy of limonene for people with different constitutions of&#xD;
      traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) combined with the analysis of the constitution of TCM, and&#xD;
      to clarify the modern scientific attributes of TCM therapy. Finally the study will develop a&#xD;
      safe and efficient drug treatment technology to control liver fat infiltration , and to&#xD;
      promote the development of clinical disciplines in the treatment of metabolic-related fatty&#xD;
      liver disease.&#xD;
