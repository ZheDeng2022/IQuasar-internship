  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is evaluating the safety and tolerability of neoadjuvant stereotactic body&#xD;
      radiation therapy (SBRT) with atezolizumab and bevacizumab for treating resectable&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves the following study interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Atezolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bevacizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stereotactic Beam Radiation Therapy (SBRT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgery&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, single-arm pilot study designed to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of neoadjuvant radiation therapy plus atezolizumab and bevacizumab in&#xD;
      patients with treatment-naïve resectable hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first-time investigators are examining&#xD;
      this intervention of neoadjuvant radiation therapy plus atezolizumab and bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved atezolizumab, bevacizumab,&#xD;
      stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for resectable hepatocellular carcinoma but they&#xD;
      have been approved for other uses. Surgery is an accepted and standard treatment option for&#xD;
      resectable hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study interventions (atezolizumab bevacizumab, and SBRT) are thought to increase the&#xD;
      immune system's (the system in the body that fights against disease) response to cancer&#xD;
      cells. These interventions may increase the immune system's response by helping the T cells&#xD;
      (an immune cell that identifies and attacks infected cells) recognize and find cancer cells&#xD;
      in the body. By increasing the system's response, it is believed the chances of recurrence of&#xD;
      resectable hepatocellular carcinoma will be less than when only standard of care surgery is&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment,&#xD;
      including evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive study treatment for as long as they and their doctor believe they&#xD;
      are benefitting from the study interventions and will be followed for 5 years or until&#xD;
      participants withdraw their consent to be contacted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 20 people will take part in this research study&#xD;

             should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this&#xD;
             protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the&#xD;
             duration of study participation, and 3 months after completion of atezolizumab and&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Severe infection within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, including, but&#xD;
             not limited to, hospitalization for complications of infection, bacteremia, or severe&#xD;
             pneumonia. Treatment with therapeutic oral or IV antibiotics within 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
             initiation of study treatment. Patients receiving prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., to&#xD;
             prevent a urinary tract infection or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
             exacerbation) are eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical&#xD;
             laboratory finding that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug, may affect&#xD;
             the interpretation of the results, or may render the patient at high risk from&#xD;
             treatment complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplantation or on the wait list for&#xD;
             liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding, or intending to become pregnant during the study. Women of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test result within 14 days&#xD;
             prior to initiation of study treatment. The rationale for this exclusion is the&#xD;
             unknown toxicities of immune checkpoint inhibitors on developing fetuses and the known&#xD;
             placental risk conferred by treatment with vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
             inhibitors (such as bevacizumab).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study&#xD;
             treatment, or anticipation of need for such a vaccine during atezolizumab treatment or&#xD;
             within 5 months after the final dose of atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe allergic anaphylactic reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies&#xD;
             or fusion proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or recombinant human&#xD;
             antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any of their&#xD;
             excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents (including, but not limited to,&#xD;
             interferon and interleukin 2 [IL-2]) within 4 weeks or 5 drug-elimination half-lives&#xD;
             (whichever is longer) prior to initiation of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medication (including, but not limited to,&#xD;
             corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and&#xD;
             anti-TNF-alpha agents) within 2 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, or&#xD;
             anticipation of need for systemic immunosuppressive medication during study treatment,&#xD;
             with the following exceptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who received acute, low-dose systemic immunosuppressant medication or a&#xD;
                  one-time pulse dose of systemic immunosuppressant medication (e.g., 48 hours of&#xD;
                  corticosteroids for a contrast allergy) are eligible for the study after Medical&#xD;
                  Monitor confirmation has been obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who received mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone), corticosteroids&#xD;
                  for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, or low-dose&#xD;
                  corticosteroids for orthostatic hypotension or adrenal insufficiency are eligible&#xD;
                  for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Since this study aims to enroll only resectable (with curative intent) hepatocellular&#xD;
             carcinoma subjects, patients with brain (or other sites of distant) metastases are&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with uncontrolled intercurrent illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance&#xD;
             with study requirements.&#xD;
