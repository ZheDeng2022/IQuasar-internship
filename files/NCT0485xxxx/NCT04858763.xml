    <textblock>
      Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and to our knowledge there have been no studies looking&#xD;
      systematically at the occurrence of MS relapses and their subsequent management, during the&#xD;
      peak of the first wave of the pandemic. In this study we will explore how MS relapses were&#xD;
      reported and managed during April - June 2020, compared to a control cohort who experienced a&#xD;
      relapse during the same period in 2019 across 5 UK centers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory, demyelinating and neurodegenerative&#xD;
      condition of the central nervous system (CNS) and is considered the most common cause of&#xD;
      disability in young adults. It is estimated that the number of adults with MS in the UK has&#xD;
      risen to 131,720. The majority of patients (85%) have Relapsing Remitting MS (RRMS), with&#xD;
      many later entering the secondary progressive phase (SPMS). Relapse is the cardinal clinical&#xD;
      feature of RRMS, and can be also prevalent in SPMS, however the influence of relapses on the&#xD;
      long-term disability is not yet fully defined and remains controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, in late&#xD;
      2019 and Covid-19, a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 became a pandemic in March 2020. The impact&#xD;
      of SARS-CoV-2 infection on patients with MS has yet to be elucidated. The main focus of&#xD;
      previous studies has been the actual risk of Covid-19 inpatients with MS, the risk of MS&#xD;
      exacerbation during Covid-19 infection and the impact of disease modifying drugs (DMDs) in&#xD;
      the severity of Covid-19 infection. Other studies have explored the psychological and&#xD;
      behavioural impact of Covid-19 pandemic to MS patientsÍ¾ those studies highlighted the risks&#xD;
      from missing/cancelling clinic appointments and MRIs, missing/stopping/changing DMDs, delays&#xD;
      in DMDs infusions, having a relapse and not seeking medical advice or disruptions in&#xD;
      rehabilitation services. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no study that&#xD;
      explored the effect of Covid-19 on MS patients by looking systematically into MS relapses and&#xD;
      their potential consequences. We will study the occurrence and subsequent management of&#xD;
      relapses occurring between April - June 2020 at the peak of the first wave of the pandemic,&#xD;
      compared to individuals who have relapsed during the same period in 2019. This observational,&#xD;
      retrospective study will be performed at 5 UK sites.&#xD;
