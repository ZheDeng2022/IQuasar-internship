  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autoimmune gastrointestinal dysmotility syndromes are poorly understood, and often difficult&#xD;
      to treat because the underlying pathogenesis is unclear. Refractory symptoms result in an&#xD;
      impaired quality of life. The presence of positive serum autoantibodies to peripheral nervous&#xD;
      system gangliosides and glycoproteins is suggestive of a possible mechanism. Immunomodulator&#xD;
      treatments have shown benefit in case reports and case series but standardized data for&#xD;
      treatment response is lacking. Therefore, our primary aims are to further characterize this&#xD;
      syndrome in terms of symptoms, laboratory testing, pathology, and assess treatment response&#xD;
      of immunomodulator therapy. Our research plan involves identifying this subset of patients&#xD;
      with autoimmune gastrointestinal dysmotility and dysautonomia, and studying them as they are&#xD;
      managed by their gastroenterologists.The study team will administer symptom-based&#xD;
      questionnaires in a systematic manner to assess the clinical trajectory of this population&#xD;
      and treatment response. The investigators will also analyze laboratory values (antibody&#xD;
      titers, tilt testing, inflammatory markers) and study pathology specimens (enteric and skin&#xD;
      biopsies) obtained from this cohort to gain a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      their disease.&#xD;

    <description>The Patient Assessment of Gastrointestinal Disorders-Symptom Severity Index (PAGI-SYM) is composed of 20 items and 6 sub-scales: heartburn/regurgitation (7 items), nausea/vomiting (3 items), postprandial fullness/early satiety (4 items), bloating (2 items), upper abdominal pain (2 items), and lower abdominal pain (2 items). Sub-scale scores are calculated by averaging across items comprising the sub-scale; scores vary from 0 (none or absent) to 5 (very severe).</description>

    <time_frame>Every two months up to 2 years.</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of Autoimmune Dysmotility symptoms on quality of life assessed by the Patient Assessment of Upper Gastrointestinal Disorders-Quality of Life (PAGI-QoL). The PAGI-QOL instrument consists of 30 items, each with response options based on a 6-point scale and with a recall period of the previous 2 weeks. The items are grouped into 5 dimensions: Daily Activities, Clothing, Diet and Food Habits, Relationship and Psychological Well-being and Distress. A score per dimension as well as a total score can be calculated. The PAGI-QOL scores range from 0 (lowest QoL) to 5 (highest QoL).</description>
