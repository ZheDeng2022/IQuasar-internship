  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project is aimed at children who are exposed to the toxic psychosocial stress present in&#xD;
      their mothers during pregnancy or after childbirth. Due to psychosocial stress in their&#xD;
      mothers, these children are at risk of developing a mental disorder or having impaired&#xD;
      psychosocial development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Czechia, there is no prevention of psychosocial stress in women, which also plays a&#xD;
      preventive role in the development of mental disorders in their children. Mental disorders in&#xD;
      parents are stigmatized in Czechia, which prevents parents from seeking care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to change this situation, so they will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. create and pilot a screening program for psychosocial stress in perinatal women in&#xD;
           gynecological clinics&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. connect the screening program to the integrated step care system created by the&#xD;
           investigators, including peer support, which the investigators will test&#xD;

      ACTIVITY 1 Objective of the activity: To increase the support of mental health and well-being&#xD;
      of unborn children and children in the period soon after their birth by early detection of&#xD;
      women experiencing psychosocial stress during pregnancy and after childbirth. Target group:&#xD;
      Pregnant women and postpartum women and their children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Because the occurrence of symptoms of psychosocial stress in pregnancy is one of the&#xD;
      main predictors of the development of mental disorders after childbirth, the investigators&#xD;
      will test whether the introduction of screening in gynecological clinics during pregnancy&#xD;
      reduces the incidence of untreated mental disorders in women 6 weeks after birth. Thanks to&#xD;
      screening, the investigators want to capture women and their children who are exposed to&#xD;
      toxic stress during pregnancy. Screening: Gynecological clinics will be equipped with a&#xD;
      tablet with screening software (Czech version of the Edinburgh Perinatal Depression Scale;&#xD;
      Perinatal Anxiety Screening Scale; Perinatal Psychosocial Profile). The software runs on the&#xD;
      servers of the National Institute of Mental Health (NUDZ), secured against cybercrime. Work&#xD;
      with data obtained during screening is subject to GDPR and the process is approved by the&#xD;
      NUDZ Ethics Committee. The screening software is automated and sends the woman information&#xD;
      about the results to her email.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation: a randomized controlled study in 20 gynecological clinics in 3 regions of the&#xD;
      Czech Republic (Prague, Central Bohemia and Olomouc Region). Participating gynecological&#xD;
      outpatient clinics will be randomized in a 1: 1 ratio into two groups: Intervention&#xD;
      outpatient clinics: Intervention outpatient clinics offer study participation to all pregnant&#xD;
      women during their pregnancy. Furthermore, all women checked at the end of the sixth week.&#xD;
      Intervention clinics will also be equipped with information materials on mental health during&#xD;
      pregnancy and after childbirth. Control clinics: actively offer participation to all women&#xD;
      only at the control at the end of the sixth week postpartum. The main checkpoint in both&#xD;
      groups of outpatient clinics is the 6th week after delivery, when the woman comes to the&#xD;
      gynecological outpatient clinic for a mandatory check-up in Czechia. All women who will&#xD;
      participate in Activity 1 will be examined by telephone using a structured psychiatric&#xD;
      examination by a psychiatrist at the end of the 6th week after childbirth so that we can&#xD;
      determine the presence of mental disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: There are more women in control clinics who are not treated for a mental disorder&#xD;
      at the end of the 6th week after delivery, even if they have been diagnosed, than in&#xD;
      intervention clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACTIVITY 2 Objective of the activity: To increase the support of mental health and well-being&#xD;
      of unborn children and children soon after their birth through early intervention in women&#xD;
      experiencing psychosocial stress during pregnancy and after childbirth. Target group: Women&#xD;
      who experience psychosocial stress during pregnancy and after childbirth and their children.&#xD;
      Methods: Activity 2 is directly related to activity 1 of the submitted project. As part of&#xD;
      Activity 2, the investigators will provide the women captured by the screening intervention&#xD;
      developed by them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Mom supports Mom includes at least four telephone or other contacts - Skype,&#xD;
      Zoom, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, ...) Between the project participant and a peer&#xD;
      consultant trained by the National Institute of Mental Health and MomÂ´s Smile. Within peer&#xD;
      support, the main methods are listening, psychoeducation, basic procedures of cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy and mindfulness, shared personal experiences with perinatal psychosocial&#xD;
      stress and, if necessary, a reference to professional counseling (psychology, psychiatry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation: a randomized controlled study in gynecological clinics participating in Activity&#xD;
      1 of the project. Women experiencing psychosocial stress, which we will screen through&#xD;
      Activity 1, will be randomized 1: 1 into two groups: Intervention group: The peer consultant&#xD;
      coordinator will connect the woman with the peer consultant who will carry out the&#xD;
      intervention Mom supports mom. Control group: The woman will be sent automatic feedback with&#xD;
      information on how to proceed if the participant wants to seek help herself. Evaluation of&#xD;
      the effect of the intervention: The investigators evaluate depressive symptoms using the&#xD;
      Edinburgh scale of perinatal depression; anxiety symptoms using the Perinatal Anxiety&#xD;
      Screening Scale; psychosocial stress using the Perinatal Psychosocial Profile; quality of&#xD;
      life using the 8-dimensional quality of life scale; and parental competences using the&#xD;
      Parenting Sense of Competence Scale. The investigators collect data after the woman enters&#xD;
      Activity 2 and one month after entering. The Investigators will evaluate the feedback from&#xD;
      users using qualitative questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Intervention Mom supports mom, reduces depressive and anxiety symptoms and&#xD;
      general psychosocial stress in women experiencing psychosocial stress. Intervention Mom&#xD;
      supports mom, increases the quality of life and parental competencies of women experiencing&#xD;
      psychosocial stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics: n = 120 (60 in each arm of the study). Sample size is calculated so that the&#xD;
      investigators can detect a medium-to-large group difference in the scale of depressive&#xD;
      symptoms (effect size = 0.6; t-test) at power 80%, significance level 5% (2-sided) and&#xD;
      potential drop out 30 %.&#xD;
