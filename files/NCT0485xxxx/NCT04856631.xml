  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase Ib/II, open-label, multicenter clinical trial. Here, the Study Phase Ib&#xD;
      is mainly to evaluate safety of Toripalimab + Cetuximab in treatment of relapsed or&#xD;
      metastatic HNSCC failing first-line platinum-based regimen and determine the recommended&#xD;
      Phase II dose (RP2D); the Study Phase II is mainly to evaluate efficacy and safety of the&#xD;
      combination in treatment of relapsed or metastatic HNSCC failing first-line platinum-based&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
