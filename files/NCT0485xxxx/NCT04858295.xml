  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pilot cross-over study aims to examine the feasibility of a smartphone-based&#xD;
      self-management supportive intervention, Supporting Self-Management of Healthy Behaviors&#xD;
      (SMART-HABITS) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension. SMART-HABITS&#xD;
      is a web-based application accessible on any device that has Internet access and utilizes a&#xD;
      mobile health research platform (Way to Health) that links to wearable sensor smartphone&#xD;
      applications such as FitBit and Omron Connect, to provide reminders, tailored feedback, and&#xD;
      provide access to educational resources, and to community resources. The cross-over design is&#xD;
      used to test preferences of using text message or a smartphone app to communicate blood&#xD;
      pressure readings.&#xD;

      The pilot study aims to examine the feasibility, as measured by adoption, adherence, and&#xD;
      acceptance, of a smartphone-based self-management supportive intervention, Supporting&#xD;
      Self-Management of Healthy Behaviors (SMART-HABITS) in patients with chronic kidney disease&#xD;
      (CKD) and hypertension. SMART-HABITS is a web-based application accessible on any device that&#xD;
      has Internet access and utilizes the mobile health research platform to provide the&#xD;
      components of the intervention: a) text message reminders (Arm 1), b) text message tailored&#xD;
      feedback (Arm 1 and 2), c) positive affirmation text messages (Arms 1 and 2), d) access to&#xD;
      educational resources, community resources, CKD patient forums (Arms 1 and 2), e) option to&#xD;
      select a accountability partner to share reminders and feedback (Arms 1 and 2). SMART-HABITS&#xD;
      encompasses multiple behavior change techniques and is centered on the Health Belief Model&#xD;
      and the Social Cognitive Theory. SMART-HABITS will deliver reminder text messages to a&#xD;
      participant's smartphone to perform blood pressure self-monitoring in one arm and encourage&#xD;
      an increase in walking activity both arms. The Omron Connect app will deliver the reminder&#xD;
      notifications to check blood pressure and will deliver the BP readings to research platform&#xD;
      (in the non-texting arm). After blood pressure measurements and daily step counts are&#xD;
      remotely transmitted from the smartphone to mobile health research platform server, tailored&#xD;
      feedback will be provided via text message). Additionally, intermittent positive affirmation&#xD;
      messages will also be sent to participants to encourage engagement in the behaviors. Within&#xD;
      the SMART-HABITS web-based application, there will be a participant portal that will provide&#xD;
      access to links to community resources, educational links about CKD, and a display of&#xD;
      adherence to behaviors and data transmission. At the beginning and end of the study,&#xD;
      questionnaires will be completed to assess patient-reported outcomes, which will serve as&#xD;
      secondary endpoints.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will receive automated text message reminders to check their blood pressure (BP) at least three days per week (participants will choose which days and times to receive reminders). Participants will transmit BP readings with text message to the Way to Health server. If a BP reading is not received within 3 hours, another reminder will be sent. Automated text message feedback will be sent with a tailored message. Participants will asked to set a daily step goal of at least 3,000 steps per day and transmit their step count information from their FitBit. Participants will be reminded once a day to sync their FitBit. Motivating messages will be sent weekly. After 4 weeks, and 8 weeks of the study, a usability survey will be sent. Weekly and daily feedback will be sent. At the conclusion of week 6, individuals will &quot;crossover&quot; and will continue for an additional 6 weeks using the opposite technology to communicate BP readings.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the mHealth app (Omron Connect) arm will receive reminder messages to check their BP via push notifications from the Omron Connect app at least three times weekly. Upon receipt of the BP reading to the research platform from Omron Connect, participants will receive automatic tailored text message feedback similar to the texting arm. Participants will asked to set a daily step goal of at least 3,000 steps per day and transmit their step count information from their FitBit. Participants will be reminded once a day to sync their FitBit. Motivating messages will be sent weekly. After 4 weeks, and 8 weeks of the study, a usability survey will be sent.
