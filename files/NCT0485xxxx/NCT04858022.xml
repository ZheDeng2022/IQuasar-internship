  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research will meet a public health need by evaluating the efficacy of speech&#xD;
      intervention supplemented with real-time visual-acoustic biofeedback when delivered using&#xD;
      remote technologies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a crossover design, participants will be randomly assigned to receive 10 weeks/20 sessions&#xD;
      of visual-acoustic biofeedback treatment via telepractice followed by a 10-week period of no&#xD;
      treatment, or the same two conditions in the reverse order. Production accuracy will be&#xD;
      assessed with standard probes (20 syllables, 30 words, and 10 sentences containing /r/ in&#xD;
      various phonetic contexts) administered prior to the beginning of treatment (baseline), after&#xD;
      the first 10-week phase, and again at the end of the study.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Children with residual speech errors (RSE) and typical perception will assigned to a randomized controlled trial measuring the efficacy of online visual-acoustic biofeedback treatment relative to a waitlist comparison condition. Treatment will last a total of 20 weeks. The investigators will randomly assign 20 children to receive 10 weeks of biofeedback training via video call followed by 10 weeks in a no-treatment phase; 20 children will receive the same phases in reverse order. Children with RSE may vary in pre-treatment severity, and the extent to which they can approximate /r/ may be an important indicator of subsequent treatment response. Therefore, a blocked randomization procedure will be used to protect against a situation where treatment groups are unbalanced with respect to pre-treatment severity.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>All perceptual ratings will be obtained from blinded, skilled clinician listeners recruited through online crowdsourcing. Following protocols refined in previous published research, binary rating responses (1=correct; 0=incorrect) will be aggregated over at least 9 unique listeners per token.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in perceptually rated accuracy of /r/</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-, mid- (after 10 weeks), and 1 week post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>To assess generalization of treatment gains to untreated words, participants will be assessed with standard probes (30 words [considered the primary target], 20 syllables, and 10 sentences containing /r/ in various phonetic contexts). Stimuli in each probe will be presented individually in randomized order with blocking by stimulus type (word, syllable, sentence). No auditory models will be provided; for children with reading difficulty, semantic cues will be provided to elicit the intended word. Individual words will be isolated from the audio record of each word probe and presented in randomized order for binary rating (correct/incorrect) by 9 na√Øve listeners who are blind to treatment condition and time point (but will see the written representation of each target word). The investigators will use the proportion of &quot;correct&quot; ratings for each token as our primary measure of perceptually rated accuracy.</description>

    <description>This 11-item survey, which asks parents to report the impact of speech disorder on their child's social, emotional, and academic well-being, was validated in a published study by members of the research team. An impact score, calculated as described in our previous research, will be used as the primary measure of socio-emotional well-being.</description>

    <description>In visual-acoustic biofeedback treatment, the elements of traditional articulatory treatment (i.e., auditory models and verbal descriptions of articulator placement) are enhanced with a dynamic display of the speech signal in the form of the real-time LPC (Linear Predictive Coding) spectrum. Because correct vs incorrect productions of /r/ contrast acoustically in the frequency of the third formant (F3), participants will be cued to make their real-time LPC spectrum match a visual target characterized by a low F3 frequency. They will be encouraged to attend to the visual display while adjusting the placement of their articulators and observing how those adjustments impact F3.</description>
