  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trigger finger is the common name of stenosing tenosynovitis of fingers, caused by repetitive&#xD;
      trauma. Conservative treatment includes NSAIDs or other analgesic agents, activity&#xD;
      modification, splint, and physiotherapy. Operation could be considered if conservative&#xD;
      treatments fails. With literature reviewed, there is no treatment which is both non-invasive&#xD;
      and effective, and also could avoid recurrence well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extracorporeal shock wave therapy could induce angiogenesis, anti-inflammatory reaction, and&#xD;
      recruitment of fibroblast. Although extracorporeal shock wave has been utilized in&#xD;
      musculoskeletal diseases for more than twenty years, there is no well-designed clinical trial&#xD;
      to prove the effectiveness of extracorporeal shock wave in treating trigger finger. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of extracorporeal shock wave therapy&#xD;
      with traditional physical therapy for the management of trigger finger.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quinnell stages of triggering</measure>
    <time_frame>15 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quinnell stages of triggering classifies the trigger finger using five types during flexion and extension: normal movement (Type 0), uneven movement (Type I), actively correctable (Type II), passively correctable (Type III) and fixed deformity (Type IV).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>11-point numeric scale of pain</measure>
    <time_frame>15 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 11-point numeric scale of pain requires the patient to rate their pain on a defined scale. 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain imaginable.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Chinese quick DASH (disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire is a self-administered region-specific outcome instrument developed as a measure of self-rated upper-extremity disability and symptoms. The investigators chose the first two components: the disability and symptom section (11 items, scored 1-5). The lower score means better condition of upper limbs, and vice versa.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>strength of hand grip</measure>
    <time_frame>15 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The strength of hand grip is to measure the maximum isometric strength of the hand and forearm muscles by a electicial grip strength device.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>sonographic image</measure>
    <time_frame>15 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators would record the characteristics of acquired sonographic images, such like the thickness of finger flexor tendon and A1 pulley, the presence of tendon sheath effusion, and the presence of increased vascularity by Doppler images.</description>
