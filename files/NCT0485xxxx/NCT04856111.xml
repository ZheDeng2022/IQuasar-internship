    <textblock>
      The antifibrotic agents, namely pirfenidone and nintedanib have been found to be effective in&#xD;
      the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Nintedanib has also been found to be&#xD;
      effective in treating systemic sclerosis-related interstitial lung disease (ILD) and non-IPF&#xD;
      progressive fibrosing ILDs. Pirfenidone has also been found beneficial unclassifiable ILDs.&#xD;
      Whether these drugs would be effective in treating post-COVID lung fibrosis also is unknown.&#xD;
      As the final pathway of lung fibrosis appears to be common among different diffuse&#xD;
      parenchymal lung diseases (DPLDs), it is hoped that these antifibrotic agents might be&#xD;
      helpful in post-COVID fibrosis. There are no randomized studies that have assessed the role&#xD;
      of pirfenidone or nintedanib in post COVID fibrosis. In the current study, we aim to assess&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of pirfenidone and compare it with nintedanib in the treatment of&#xD;
      post-COVID lung fibrosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the early part of 2020, the entire world has been affected by a pandemic of the&#xD;
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease has a short incubation period (median, 3 days) and is&#xD;
      highly transmissible. This disease may manifest as an asymptomatic infection and through an&#xD;
      entire range of symptoms of varying severity to severe, life-threatening disease. Although&#xD;
      diverse systemic features might be present, the usual presentation is with lower respiratory&#xD;
      tract involvement in the form of pneumonia often resulting in the development of the acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In some patients, multi-organ failure sets in, possibly&#xD;
      as a result of a cytokine storm interplaying with a thrombotic microangiopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early lung disease is characterized pathologically by neutrophilic and exudative capillaritis&#xD;
      in the lungs with some evidence of microthrombosis.2 This may be followed by a picture of&#xD;
      diffuse alveolar damage along with ongoing intravascular thrombosis in the pulmonary vessels.&#xD;
      In late stages, an organizing pneumonia (OP) develops with extensive proliferation of&#xD;
      fibroblasts within the airspaces. Clinically, most patients make a complete recovery after&#xD;
      COVID pneumonia. Other patients may demonstrate some signs of recovery from the acute illness&#xD;
      with resolution of fever and recovery of organ functions, however they continue to have some&#xD;
      degree of breathlessness, persistent infiltrates on radiologic studies, and/or hypoxemia. The&#xD;
      CT abnormalities in these patients are commonly characterized by patchy, multifocal&#xD;
      consolidation and ground-glass opacities suggestive of the OP pattern. Coarse reticulation&#xD;
      and parenchymal bands may also be present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with such diffuse lung disease after COVID-19, herein referred to as post-COVID&#xD;
      diffuse lung disease (PC-DLD) are often treated with glucocorticoids. Although most patients&#xD;
      with a predominant OP pattern of injury would have a resolution of lung parenchymal&#xD;
      abnormalities either spontaneously or with glucocorticoids, some of them might develop signs&#xD;
      of lung fibrosis, in the form of traction bronchiectasis and/or honeycombing. Some subjects&#xD;
      have ongoing respiratory symptoms despite treatment with steroids, and they may be found to&#xD;
      have persistent reticulation or non-resolving consolidation on chest imaging that may&#xD;
      represent early fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antifibrotic agents, namely pirfenidone and nintedanib have been found to be effective in&#xD;
      the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Nintedanib has also been found to be&#xD;
      effective in treating systemic sclerosis-related interstitial lung disease (ILD) and non-IPF&#xD;
      progressive fibrosing ILDs. Pirfenidone has also been found beneficial unclassifiable ILDs.&#xD;
      Whether these drugs would be effective in treating post-COVID lung fibrosis also is unknown.&#xD;
      As the final pathway of lung fibrosis appears to be common among different diffuse&#xD;
      parenchymal lung diseases (DPLDs), it is hoped that these antifibrotic agents might be&#xD;
      helpful in post-COVID fibrosis. There are no randomized studies that have assessed the role&#xD;
      of pirfenidone or nintedanib in post COVID fibrosis. In the current study, we aim to assess&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of pirfenidone and compare it with nintedanib in the treatment of&#xD;
      post-COVID lung fibrosis.&#xD;
