      Postoperative pain control is important to reduce morbidity and mortality, and this becomes&#xD;
      even more important after cesarean delivery. Severe postpartum pain is associated with&#xD;
      chronic pain, and the mother faces a 2.5-fold increased risk of chronic pain and a 3-fold&#xD;
      increased risk of postpartum depression compared to mild ones Postoperative pain management&#xD;
      is more difficult in the postpartum period. Because the main analgesics used are opioids that&#xD;
      are excreted from milk and the newborn may be exposed to the side effects of these drugs .&#xD;
      Therefore, multimodal approach is recommended in pain management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical wound infiltration (LWI) of local anesthetics is an important component of&#xD;

      COMPARISON OF THE APPLICATION OF LIDOCAINE WITH INTRAPERITONEAL BUPIVACAINE IN CESARIAN&#xD;
      OPERATIONS WOUND INFILTRATION: RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO CONTROLLED STUDY.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTRODUCTION The most common surgical procedure in pregnant women is cesarean . Postoperative&#xD;
      pain control is important to reduce morbidity and mortality, and this becomes even more&#xD;
      important after cesarean delivery. A mother with pain has trouble feeding the newborn . In&#xD;
      addition, severe postpartum pain is associated with chronic pain, and the mother faces a&#xD;
      2.5-fold increased risk of chronic pain and a 3-fold increased risk of postpartum depression&#xD;
      compared to mild ones .&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most important features of a good anesthesia application is a good postoperative&#xD;
      pain management. This management is more difficult in the postpartum period. Because the main&#xD;
      analgesics used are opioids that are excreted from milk and the newborn may be exposed to the&#xD;
      side effects of these drugs . Therefore, multimodal approach is recommended in pain&#xD;
      management. In multimodal analgesia, the drugs interact with each other and show a&#xD;
      synergistic and additive effect, thus providing better pain control with fewer side effects .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuraxial blocks, peripheral nerve blocks, NSAIDS and local anesthetic infiltration of the&#xD;
      wound, intraperitoneal local anesthetic delivery were used as part of the multimodal&#xD;
      approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical wound infiltration (LWI) of local anesthetics is an important component of&#xD;
      multimodal analgesia . Some of the pain from surgery is caused by an inflammatory response to&#xD;
      the surgical incision; therefore, reducing this inflammation can provide a better analgesia&#xD;
      and also minimize side effects .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ease of use and safety of intraperitoneal local anesthetics (IPLA) has been demonstrated in&#xD;
      studies and has become a useful alternative to opioid-based analgesic regimens for the&#xD;
      treatment of acute postoperative pain. As an effective adjuvant to postoperative multimodal&#xD;
      analgesia, their use in open abdominal operations including gynecological surgery and open&#xD;
      abdominal hysterectomy has been reported .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1975, Ranney and his friends described intraperitoneal local anesthetic (IPLA)&#xD;
      administration in 218 patients who delivered by cesarean section. Although IPLA has received&#xD;
      little attention following this publication, recent publications have been shown that IPLA&#xD;
      can be used in the treatment of intraoperative pain, prevent postoperative nausea, reduce&#xD;
      early postoperative pain and opioid requirements, and shorten hospitalization duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zohar and friends evaluated the effectiveness of IPLA after surgical procedures related to&#xD;
      both somatic and visceral pain, and showed that patient-controlled IPLA reduced the need for&#xD;
      opioids after bilateral Salpingo-oopherectomy and total abdominal hysterectomy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators aim is to compare the effectiveness of LWI and IPLA applications on&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia in women undergoing elective cesarean delivery under spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia (SA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesis, H0, was that there was no statistically significant difference&#xD;
      between the three groups in the mean postoperative pain scores (VAS scores 0 to 10) at the&#xD;
      24th hour during movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1 was a statistically significant difference between the mean postoperative pain scores at&#xD;
      the 24th hour during the movement between the three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study was pain scores during the postoperative 24th hour mobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome was total fentanyl consumption (µg) in the first postoperative 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study was&#xD;
      performed on 150 pregnant women aged 18-50 years who underwent a Pfannenstiel incision under&#xD;
      spinal anesthesia of ASA I-II, ≥34th gestational week after obtaining the approval of the&#xD;
      Atatürk University Medical Faculty Hospital ethics committee and the written consent of&#xD;
      patients. to be scheduled. Patients with neuraxial anesthesia contraindications, patients&#xD;
      allergic to drugs to be used in the study, BMI&gt; 35 kg / m2, diabetes, preeclampsia,&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, chronic pain and neuropathic pain, patients who have been given&#xD;
      opioids in operation due to intraoperative pain, patients with unsuccessful spinal anesthesia&#xD;
      who underwent general anesthesia, patients with excessive bleeding during the operation,&#xD;
      uterine atony, placement of the drain in the area to be infiltrated, patients who do not want&#xD;
      spinal anesthesia, cannot understand VAS, have a history of drug addiction and psychiatric&#xD;
      illness will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the operation, the patients were explained about the procedure, purpose of the study&#xD;
      and what VAS was and how it would be used in the postoperative period, and if they feel pain,&#xD;
      they could be informed about analgesics at any time after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After patients have transferred to the operation room, an intravenous (iv) access is obtained&#xD;
      with an applicator size of 20 and routine monitorization consisting of electrocardiogram&#xD;
      (ECG), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) and non-invasive blood pressure being performed.&#xD;
      After the skin is prepared sterile and local infiltration with 2% lidocaine is done, from&#xD;
      L3-L4 or L4-L5 range on midline all the patients had received Spinal Anesthesia (SA) and the&#xD;
      solution containing 7mg isobaric bupivacaine + 15µg fentanyl was given to the spinal interval&#xD;
      in 30 seconds. After the procedure was completed, the patients were placed in the supine&#xD;
      position by placing a height under their right hip with a 15 ° left slope. When the sensorial&#xD;
      blockade has reached the segments T4-T6 operations were started. All cases were performed&#xD;
      with the Pfannenstiel incision. Hypotension was described as systolic blood pressure falling&#xD;
      below the basal value by 20%. If hypotension occurs, it will be treated with ephedrine until&#xD;
      blood pressure reaches baseline (initial dose 10 mg, intravenously) and rapid colloid or&#xD;
      crystalloid infusion. If hypotension persists or recurs, vasopressor treatment will be&#xD;
      repeated every 1 minute. Bradycardia will be described as having a heart rate of 50 beats /&#xD;
      min and will be treated with 1mg iv atropine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were randomly assigned equally into Group IPLA, Group LWI and Group C. For this,&#xD;
      computerized random numbers table was used. Study drugs were prepared sterile by an&#xD;
      anesthesiologist who did not know about the study or did not take part in the evaluation of&#xD;
      the study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the group IPLA, after the birth of the newborn and placenta, the uterus is closed and the&#xD;
      blood accumulated in the pelvis is carefully wiped with surgical towels, after hemostasis is&#xD;
      fully achieved, a total of 20 ml solution containing 10 cc of 0.5% bupivacaine +10 cc 2%&#xD;
      lidocaine and 2 injectors containing 20ml saline and the 20ml solution were given to the&#xD;
      surgeon. The 20 ml solution containing bupivacaine and lidocaine was injected into the&#xD;
      uterine peritoneal region by spraying 5 mL to each quadrant of the uterus before closing the&#xD;
      parietal peritoneum or fascia. The parietal peritoneal layer was sutured or left open at the&#xD;
      surgeon's preference. At the end of the operation, 20 ml of saline solution was applied&#xD;
      subcutaneously in the form of LWI instead of the incision before the skin was closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the group LWI, a solution containing 20 ml of saline was added to all four quadrants of&#xD;
      the uterus in 5 ml volume and 20 ml solution containing lidocaine and bupivacaine were&#xD;
      subcutaneously in the form of LWI before the skin was closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Group C, one of the two sterile injectors containing 20 ml of saline was applied to the&#xD;
      uterine peritoneal region and the other was applied to the incision area as a local&#xD;
      subcutaneous wound infiltration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design will be discussed and standardized at a meeting with obstetricians before the&#xD;
      start of the research. The study will be blinded because the person administering the study&#xD;
      drug did not know which drug was using and the person who evaluated did not know which group&#xD;
      was evaluating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From randomization to completion of statistical analysis, the patient, responsible&#xD;
      anesthesiologist and study staff responsible for collecting data will be blinded to the&#xD;
      treatment group. The collected data will be stored in a locked cabinet in the anesthesiology&#xD;
      department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paracetamol 1g and Dexketoprofen 50 mg were administered intravenously to patients 30 minutes&#xD;
      before the end of the operation. After the operation, multimodal analgesia was applied to all&#xD;
      patients with paracetamol from 15mg / kg every 6 hours for 24 hours and 50 mg dexketoprofen&#xD;
      every 12 hours. At the end of the operation, patients started IV PCA. Implemented when 25µg&#xD;
      fentanyl iv bolus VAS≥30 was set by adjusting 10 min lock time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain during movement and rest was assessed using the visual analog score (VAS) (0-10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nausea and vomiting were evaluated on a scale of 0 to 3. 0 = no nausea or vomiting, 1 = mild&#xD;
      nausea that does not require treatment, 2 = moderate nausea that responds to treatment, 3 =&#xD;
      severe nausea or vomiting that does not respond to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Itching was also rated on a scale of 0 to 3. 0 = no itching, 1 = mild itching that does not&#xD;
      require treatment, 2 = moderate itching that responds to treatment, and 3 = severe itching&#xD;
      that does not respond to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These evaluations were made at the 2nd, 12th, and 24th hours after intrathecal anesthesia.&#xD;
      When nausea and vomiting occurred, 4 mg iv ondansetron was administered and repeated every 8&#xD;
      hours as needed. Pruritus was treated with a 10 mg cetirizine tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' age (years), weight (kg), height (meters), BMI (kg / m2), gestational week,&#xD;
      operation time (hour), analgesia duration (hour) (time from spinal anesthesia to the first&#xD;
      morphine requirement), cumulative fentanyl consumption (µg) in the first 24 hours&#xD;
      postoperatively, number of patients not requiring IV fentanyl, first ambulation time (hour),&#xD;
      time of the beginning of bowel movements (hour), local inflammation at the site of the wound,&#xD;
      patient satisfaction assessed on a 5-point Likert scale (excellent, very good, good, bad and&#xD;
      very bad) 24 hours after surgery were also recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POWER When VAS score is 25 ± 15mm (mean ± std) in the control group and VAS score (mean ±&#xD;
      std) is 17 ± 15 (effect size = 0.569) in the study group, the difference between these values&#xD;
      can be statistically significant at 80% power and 95% confidence levels in order to be&#xD;
      statistically significant, the inclusion of 50 patients in each group was calculated with the&#xD;
      G * power program.&#xD;
