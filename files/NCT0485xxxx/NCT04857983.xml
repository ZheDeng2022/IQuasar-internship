  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of schizophrenia currently includes antipsychotic medications and cognitive&#xD;
      therapies which improve some symptoms, but do not sufficiently restore cognitive functioning&#xD;
      or reduce psychosocial disability. We hypothesize that medications that specifically target&#xD;
      sensory information processing deficits, rather than psychotic symptoms per se, will&#xD;
      significantly enhance the benefits of a sensory-based targeted cognitive training (TCT)&#xD;
      intervention in patients with schizophrenia. We will complete a randomized, double-blind&#xD;
      clinical trial to: 1) confirm that the drug memantine augments TCT learning; 2) determine&#xD;
      whether memantine enhances the clinical benefits from a full 30 session course of TCT vs. TCT&#xD;
      plus placebo in antipsychotic- medicated schizophrenia patients, and 3) determine if&#xD;
      memantine's enhancement of TCT is most effective in biomarker-defined subgroups of patients.&#xD;

      Treatment of schizophrenia (SZ) currently includes antipsychotic medications and cognitive&#xD;
      therapies which improve some symptoms, but do not sufficiently restore cognitive functioning&#xD;
      or reduce psychosocial disability. We propose and will test a novel &quot;augmentation strategy&quot;&#xD;
      for using medications to specifically enhance the benefits of targeted cognitive training&#xD;
      (TCT) in schizophrenia. This project tests a rational and empirically supported platform for&#xD;
      augmenting the benefits of TCT in antipsychotic medicated SZ patients by adjunctive daily&#xD;
      treatment of 20 mg memantine, an FDA approved medication for the treatment of cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction in Alzheimer's Disease. We hypothesize that medications that specifically target&#xD;
      sensory information processing deficits, rather than psychotic symptoms per se, will&#xD;
      significantly enhance the benefits of a sensory-based targeted cognitive training (TCT)&#xD;
      intervention in patients with schizophrenia. We will complete a randomized, double-blind&#xD;
      clinical trial to: 1) confirm that the drug memantine augments TCT learning; 2) determine&#xD;
      whether memantine enhances the clinical benefits from a full 30 session course of TCT vs. TCT&#xD;

    <description>Suppressing active psychosis with antipsychotics benefits cognitive interventions for schizophrenia, but it is possible that drugs with pro-cognitive effects will specifically, and perhaps synergistically, augment the clinical benefits of cognitive therapies. A &quot;proof of concept&quot; for this approach is found in the use of the pro-extinction drugs to selectively enhance the impact of cognitive therapy for anxiety disorders. In this &quot;proof of concept&quot;, a learning-based therapy is paired with a medication that enhances a brain mechanism (extinction) that is both 1) critical to that form of learning, and 2) known to be deficient in some anxiety disorders.</description>
