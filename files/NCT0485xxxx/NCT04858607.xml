  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination in immunodeficient patients is unknown. Here&#xD;
      the investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in immunodeficient&#xD;
      patients compared to healthy controls. The investigators will assess the humoral and cellular&#xD;
      response to COVID-19 vaccination in these subjects in detail. Furthermore, factors associated&#xD;
      with good response to vaccination will be identified. The results of this study will help to&#xD;
      guide future recommendations on COVID-19 vaccination in this population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The total duration of the study is 38 months, starting in March 2021 with a recruiting period&#xD;
      until 31. December 2021 and termination of all scheduled visits until 31 May 2024.&#xD;
      Individuals having consented and fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria are included&#xD;
      in the trial. A baseline visit will take place up to 60 days before the planned date of&#xD;
      vaccination according to the Austrian vaccination plan. Scheduled vaccination with any&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccine approved in Austria will allow recruitment. If appropriate pre-vaccine&#xD;
      samples from study participants exist in the biobank of the Medical University of Graz,&#xD;
      patients may also be included in the study after vaccination starting with visit 3. In this&#xD;
      case the biomaterial available at the biobank will be used for the analyses planned on visit&#xD;
      1. The investigators will not influence the date of vaccination or the type of the vaccine&#xD;
      used. After first vaccination a telephone visit (visit 2) will assess adverse events and&#xD;
      schedule visit 3 at the appropriate time after the second vaccination. At visit 3 the&#xD;
      patient's vaccination certificate will be checked to verify correct vaccination and document&#xD;
      the type of vaccine received. Further visits (5-6) will be performed for up to two years&#xD;
      after the second vaccination. This follow-up period will allow an assessment of the duration&#xD;
      of the immune response. The data recorded directly on the Case Report Form (CRF) are&#xD;
      considered to be source data. COVID-19 vaccination, COVID-19 infection, Vaccination history,&#xD;
      Pregnancy test, Adverse Events, BMI (Body Mass Index), and Laboratory Specimen Collection are&#xD;
      recorded directly on the CRF and therefore are considered to be source data. Data will be&#xD;
      merged in an electronic database (RDA Research, Documentation &amp; Analysis; Medical University&#xD;
      of Graz, version 07.03.2019). Case Report Forms (CRFs) will be inspected in respect of their&#xD;
      accuracy and completeness and compared to original data by the monitor.&#xD;
