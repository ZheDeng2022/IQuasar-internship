      This study aims to examine the effects of an internet-based cardica rehabilitation&#xD;
      enhancement (i-CARE) programme for coronary artery disease (CAD) patients on self-care&#xD;
      behaviour, biomarkers, physiological, anthropometric parameters, clinical outcomes and&#xD;
      self-reported health outcomes and to understand why and how i-CARE influences patients'&#xD;
      health behaviours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular disease, a highly prevalent morbidity, is the number one cause of death&#xD;
      worldwide and has become a significant public health concern. The majority of these deaths&#xD;
      are attributed to an acute manifestation of coronary artery disease (CAD), defined as a&#xD;
      narrowing of the coronary arteries that causes insufficient myocardial blood flow. CAD has&#xD;
      reached an unequivocal pandemic status globally and locally. CAD imposes not only significant&#xD;
      physical and psychosocial burdens on patients, but also enormous service demands on&#xD;
      healthcare systems.As a chronic condition, CAD requires patients to practice persistent&#xD;
      self-care in a long-term manner for successful disease management. Self-care is considered&#xD;
      fundamental to the prevention and management of chronic diseases. Yet, a significant&#xD;
      proportion of the CAD population is still engaging in full-time employment, their time&#xD;
      availability restricts them to participate in traditional health promotional activities.&#xD;
      According to recent systematic reviews, substantial evidence has accumulated to support the&#xD;
      positive effects of internet-delivered interventions. Therefore, an internet-based approach&#xD;
      with self-care cardiac rehabilitation enhancement may be ab better method of engaging&#xD;
      patients in the learning process and arousing their inherent capacities to maintain&#xD;
      behavioral modifications. This mixed-method study consists of a two-arm randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial and an exploratory qualitative study. For the randomized controlled trial plans to&#xD;
      recruit 268 adults from Queen Mary Hospital and Care for Your Heart. Eligible participants&#xD;
      will be CAD patients who aged 18 above, living in the community, owning a smartphone with&#xD;
      internet access, communicable in Cantonese and able to type in Chinese or English. The&#xD;
      participants will be randomly allocated to the intervention or control group to receive&#xD;
      i-CARE or usual care, respectively. The study hypotheizes that the CAD patients who receive&#xD;
      the i-CARE intervention will report better changes in self-care behaviours, blood pressure,&#xD;
      cholesterols, waist-to-height ratio, functional status and HRQoL at 3 and 6 months after the&#xD;
      intervention, than those who receive usual care and that the CAD patients who receive the&#xD;
      i-CARE intervention will report fewer cardiovascular event rates and mortality at 6 months&#xD;
      after the intervention, than those who receive usual care. The findings will advance our&#xD;
      knowledge of the empirical effects of internet-based cardiac rehabilitation programme on CAD&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

    <description>the Chinese version of Self-Care of Coronary Heart Disease Inventory (SC-CHDI). This self-reported SC-CHDI (22 items) measures self-care maintenance, self-care management and self-care confidence on a four-point response scale. Each subscale score is transformed to 100 points, with higher scores indicate better self-care for that attribute.</description>

    <description>The functional status will be measured with the Chinese version of Seattle Angina Questionnaire. This 19-item questionnaire consists of five subscales, including physical limitation, angina stability, angina frequency, treatment satisfaction and the disease perception. The respondents have to rate on a 1 to 5 or 6 sequentially coded status. The subscale scores are transformed to a scale of 0 to 100, with higher scores indicate higher level of functioning/ satisfaction and fewer limitations.</description>

Each item is rated on a 1-7 scale, and a global score is calculated by summing the item scores, a higher score represents better HRQoL.</description>

    <description>Participants in the intervention group will receive a 12-week i-CARE intervention, which will be designed to cover the core elements of CAD self-care: self-care maintenance, self-care monitoring and self-care management. The intervention will comprise: 1) a single individualized face-to-face session and 2) an internet-based intervention through a mobile application. Various behaviour change techniques will be used to increase the self-efficacy of CAD patients in enacting self-care behaviours.</description>
