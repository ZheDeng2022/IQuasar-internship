  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hereditary epidermolysis bullosa (HEB) are rare genodermatoses, clinically characterized by&#xD;
      epithelial and subepithelial fragility leading to the formation of blisters and spontaneous&#xD;
      erosions on skin at the slightest contact, with possible mucosal damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The care of these patients consists of therapeutic baths leading to renew bandages that&#xD;
      sometimes covering the entire integument. These are difficult, delicate and painful moments&#xD;
      that patients experience daily at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For an unexplained reason for 70 to 80% of them, the weak or strong opioid analgesics, deemed&#xD;
      necessary and prescribed for good pain control, are not taken on a regular basis as a&#xD;
      premedication for baths and dressing changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to understand the child's brakes on taking weak or strong opioid&#xD;
      analgesics at the time of care and the parents' difficulties in giving these treatments by&#xD;
      means of individual interviews.&#xD;

      Hereditary epidermolysis bullosa (HEB) are rare genodermatoses, clinically characterized by&#xD;
      epithelial and subepithelial fragility leading to the formation of blisters and spontaneous&#xD;
      erosions on skin at the slightest contact, with possible mucosal damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pain Medicine and Palliative Medicine Functional Unit (UFMDP) of Necker Hospital is&#xD;
      involved on a daily basis in supporting the complex and multidisciplinary management of&#xD;
      patients with the most serious forms of hereditary epidermolysis bullosa and their family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The care of these patients consists of therapeutic baths leading to renew bandages that&#xD;
      sometimes covering the entire integument. These are difficult, delicate and painful moments&#xD;
      that patients experience daily at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical and paramedical professionals, from the UFMDP and from the reference center for&#xD;
      Genetic Diseases with Cutaneous Expression (MAGEC) (Dermatology Department) of the Necker&#xD;
      Hospital, surrounding these children, note that for an unexplained reason for 70 to 80% of&#xD;
      them, the weak or strong opioid analgesics, deemed necessary and prescribed for good pain&#xD;
      control, are not taken on a regular basis as a premedication for baths and dressing changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Care is painful, increasing the vicious circle of anxiety, conflict with caregivers, family&#xD;
      and ultimately pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to understand the child's brakes on taking weak or strong opioid&#xD;
      analgesics at the time of care and the parents' difficulties in giving these treatments by&#xD;
      means of individual interviews.&#xD;
