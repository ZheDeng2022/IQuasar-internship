  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-quality bowel preparation plays an important role in ensuring a safe and successful&#xD;
      X-ray examination, endoscopy or some kinds of bowel surgeries. Inadequate bowel preparation&#xD;
      may lead to incomplete examination of the colonic mucosa, may require increased operation&#xD;
      time and difficulty, and incur the costs for rescheduling or performing other examinations.&#xD;
      Early attention to the influencing factors of bowel cleansing effect and taking positive&#xD;
      measures can effectively improve the success rate and diagnosis rate of endoscopic and&#xD;
      radiological examinations, and reduce the possibility of postoperative complications and&#xD;
      local infections. In 2019, China released the latest &quot;Guidelines for Bowel Preparation&#xD;
      Related to Digestive Endoscopy&quot;, emphasizing the importance of dietary restrictions and&#xD;
      patient notification and education. The &quot;Guideline&quot; also recommends that sodium picosulfate,&#xD;
      magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid can be used for bowel preparation before endoscopy&#xD;
      and is well tolerated (recommended strength: weak; evidence quality: moderate). The other&#xD;
      used colonic cleansing agents also include polyethylene glycol (PEG) electrolyte powder,&#xD;
      magnesium salt, sodium phosphate, mannitol and Chinese herbal medicine. Each carries its own&#xD;
      properties, indications and safety profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compound Sodium Picosulfate Granules is a compounded preparation consisting of sodium&#xD;
      picosulfate and magnesium citrate. Each sachet contains 10 mg of sodium picosulfate, 3.5 g of&#xD;
      magnesium oxide and 12.0 g of citric acid. It is white to slightly yellow crystalline powder,&#xD;
      with a slight orange flavour. Sodium picosulfate is transformed by colonic bacteria to form&#xD;
      an active metabolite: bis-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-pyridyl-2-methane,&#xD;
      Bis-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-pyridyl-2-methane (BHPM), which acts directly on the colonic mucosa to&#xD;
      stimulate colonic peristalsis. Magnesium oxide and citric acid react to create magnesium&#xD;
      citrate (when dispersed in a solution), which is an osmotic agent that causes water to be&#xD;
      retained within the gastrointestinal tract. The stimulant laxative activity of sodium&#xD;
      picosulfate together with the osmotic laxative activity of magnesium citrate produces a&#xD;
      purgative effect, which can be used to clean the bowel prior to X-ray examination, endoscopy&#xD;
      or bowel surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since its first marketing in the United Kingdom (UK) in December 1980, Compound Sodium&#xD;
      Picosulfate Granules has been approved in more than 80 countries and regions, including&#xD;
      Germany (2010), France (2010), Spain (2011), Italy (2011) and the United States (2012), Japan&#xD;
      (2016), under the tradename PICOLAX, PICOPREP or PREPOPIK. In 2018, Compound Sodium&#xD;
      Picosulfate Granules was officially approved in China with the indication: for preparation of&#xD;
      bowel cleansing prior to X-ray examination, endoscopy or surgery when judged clinically&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
