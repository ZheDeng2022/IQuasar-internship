  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ⅰb multi-center clinical study. To explore the preliminary efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of Furmonertinib Mesilate at different doses in locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC&#xD;
      patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study plans to enroll 30 subjects, including 20 treated patients and 10 treatment-naïve&#xD;
      patients. The subjects with disease progression after previous systematic anti-tumor therapy&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive Furmonertinib Mesilate 160 mg/day (N=10) or 240 mg/day (N=10),&#xD;
      respectively. The treatment-naïve patients do not need to be randomized and all will receive&#xD;
      Furmonertinib Mesilate 240 mg/day (N=10) until disease progression, death or intolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is ORR; the secondary study endpoints include DCR, DOR, DepOR, PFS, OS,&#xD;
      CNS ORR, safety and the PK profile of Furmonertinib Mesilate and its metabolites (AST5902).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the peripheral blood ctDNA will be collected and analyzed in this study&#xD;

             radiological or pathological disease progression during or after the last systematic&#xD;
             anti-tumor therapy before the first dose of investigational product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment-naïve patients: patients with locally advanced (judged by investigators as&#xD;
