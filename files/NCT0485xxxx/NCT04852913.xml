  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No previous randomized control trial has investigated the effectiveness of Bowen's technique&#xD;
      on health status in dentists suffering from postural neck Neck pain. Moreover, there is&#xD;
      limited evidence and low agreement regarding the effect of Bowen's therapy on Neck pain.&#xD;
      Thus, this study aims to answer the question: bowmen's technique is effective for improving&#xD;
      Neck pain dentists' function by reducing pain, and disability, and improving posture, and&#xD;
      health status, without need for ergonomic alternation?&quot;&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bowen technique may be used for relaxation of tightening muscles in poor posture. The&#xD;
      findings suggest that Bowen Therapy has inconsistent immediate effects on postural control&#xD;
      and pain threshold in healthy subjects. Further studies are needed using symptomatic&#xD;
      participants. No previous randomized control trial, to our knowledge, has investigated the&#xD;
      effectiveness of Bowen's technique on health status in dentists suffering from postural neck&#xD;
      pain. Moreover, there is limited evidence and low agreement regarding the effect of Bowen's&#xD;
      therapy on neck pain. Thus, this study aims to answer the question: Bowen's technique is&#xD;
      effective for improving neck pain dentists' function by reducing pain, and disability, and&#xD;
      improving posture, and health status, without need for ergonomic alternation?&quot;&#xD;

    <measure>Modified Goniometer</measure>
    <time_frame>6th week</time_frame>
    <description>Modified goniometer can be used to measure craniovertebral angle which is helpful to assess the level of postural disability like forward head posture. It provides an estimation of head on neck angle and position of upper cervical spine.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Numerical Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6th week</time_frame>
    <description>In a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), patients circle the number between 0 and 10, 0 and 20 or 0 and 100 according to their pain intensity. It is numeric version of visual analog scale.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Neck Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>6th week</time_frame>
    <description>This is a standard instrument for measuring disability due to neck pain and it's a self-reported questionnaire. Each of the 10 items is scored from 0 - 5. The maximum score is therefore 50. The obtained score can be multiplied by 2 to produce a percentage score.</description>

    <description>The thumb of the therapist was placed on the top of the targeted muscle (upper trapezius, levator scapulae, tight pectoralis and sternocleidomastoid, longissimus capitis, splenius capitis cervical multifidus). The skin was carried away gently from the spine without disturbing the muscle. The thumb was then hooked into the lateral aspect of the muscle to form a pressure on the muscle. Then the thumb was flattened in the medial direction, when this happened the muscle would plop or 15 respond in some way. Heating pad + TENS will be given The session lasted for 20 minutes 3sessions/week for 6th week</description>

    <description>Myofascial Release + Active Range of Motion Deep transverse friction was given for 10 minutes followed by myofascial stretching of muscle for 3 times, each holding for 90 seconds. Then myofascial release was given using ulnar border of both palms of the therapist.&#xD;
Active range of motion exercises will be given 10 reps with 5 seconds hold. Heating pad + Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator (TENS) will be given The session lasted for 20 minutes 3sessions/week for 6th week</description>
