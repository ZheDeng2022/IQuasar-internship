      Study LAE205INT3101 is a Phase Ib/III study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the&#xD;
      combination therapy with afuresertib plus fulvestrant (afuresertib/placebo plus fulvestrant&#xD;
      in Phase III) in patients with HR+/HER2- breast cancer who have failed 1 to 2 prior lines of&#xD;
      endocrine therapy, and/or CDK4/6 inhibitor (up to 1 therapy), and/or chemotherapy (up to 1&#xD;
      chemotherapy) as described in the inclusion criteria.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients for this study must have either (1) progressive disease whilst receiving an&#xD;
      endocrine therapy (AI or a SERM), and/or a CDK4/6 inhibitor for locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic disease; or (2) relapsed with metastatic disease whilst receiving an ET (AI or&#xD;
      SERM), and/or a CDK4/6 inhibitor, and/or chemotherapy in adjuvant setting. No more than 2&#xD;
      prior lines of systemic treatments for locally advanced or metastatic disease are allowed for&#xD;
      this study, including 1-2 prior lines of endocrine therapy, with/without CDK4/6 inhibitor (up&#xD;
      to 1 therapy), and/or chemotherapy (up to 1 therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase Ib part is a single-arm, open-label, &quot;proof-of-concept&quot; study to evaluate&#xD;
      anti-tumor efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the combination therapy&#xD;
      with afuresertib plus fulvestrant. Twenty patients will be enrolled in this part. There will&#xD;
      be a safety run-in period during the first 28-days of treatment (Cycle 1) of the first 6&#xD;
      enrolled patients to evaluate the safety of the initial treatment doses of the combination&#xD;
      therapy, and to make dose modification if severe treatment-related toxicities occur. Patients&#xD;
      will receive afuresertib 125 mg PO, QD in combination with fulvestrant 500 mg IM, D1, 15 in&#xD;
      Cycle 1, and fulvestrant 500 mg IM, D1 Q4W in the subsequent cycles. If no severe&#xD;
      treatment-related toxicity is observed during the safety-run-in period, based on&#xD;
      investigator's clinical judgements, the enrollment will resume for the remaining 14 patients.&#xD;
      If any treatment-related toxicity (≥ grade 3) is observed in 1 of the 6 patients (e.g.,&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, hyperglycemia, rash, diarrhea, fatigue, etc.), and is not&#xD;
      resolved within 7 days in spite of active management per institutional standard of care, the&#xD;
      dose of afuresertib for all patients participating in the safety run-in will be reduced to&#xD;
      125 mg, D1-21, Q4W (if afuresertib alone or both afuresertib and fulvestrant are the&#xD;
      potential causal agents) or the dose of fulvestrant reduced to 250 mg IM D1,15 in Cycle 1,&#xD;
      and 250 mg IM D1 Q4W (if fulvestrant is the potential causal agent) in the subsequent cycles.&#xD;
      In the event that the causal relationship between study drugs and the observed AE could not&#xD;
      be reasonably established, reduction of afuresertib should take precedence based on the&#xD;
      Safety Review Committee (SRC) decision. For the primary efficacy objective of the Phase Ib&#xD;
      part, the primary endpoint is the investigator-assessed ORR based on RECIST 1.1 of the&#xD;
      afuresertib plus fulvestrant combination therapy in HR+/HER2- BC. The PK parameters of the&#xD;
      afuresertib in the combination treatment (e.g., Cmax, AUC(0-t), AUC(0-inf), Tmax, t1/2, etc.)&#xD;
      will be assessed in all patients in the Phase Ib part based on plasma levels of afuresertib,&#xD;
      obtained at different timepoints as described in the tables of Schedule of Activities (SoA).&#xD;
      The efficacy and safety data analysis will be conducted after the completion of the Phase Ib&#xD;
      part. If the efficacy and safety data of the afuresertib plus fulvestrant combination therapy&#xD;
      support a positive benefit/risk ratio, this combination regimen will be further evaluated for&#xD;
      its efficacy and safety in the Phase III part. If there is insufficient evidence of efficacy&#xD;
      for the study treatment at the end of the Phase Ib part, the sponsor and the investigators&#xD;
      must reach a consensus on whether to expand patient enrollment to continue the Phase Ib&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase III part is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal&#xD;
      study with two parallel treatment arms to further assess the anti-tumor efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of afuresertib combined with fulvestrant (experimental arm) versus placebo combined with&#xD;
      fulvestrant (control arm) in patients with HR+/HER2- BC who have failed 1 to 2 prior lines of&#xD;
      ET, and/or CDK4/6 inhibitor (up to 1 therapy), and/or chemotherapy (up to 1 chemotherapy). A&#xD;
      total of 252 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the two parallel treatment arms,&#xD;
      afuresertib plus fulvestrant and placebo plus fulvestrant. Randomization will be based on&#xD;
      stratification factors, including prior chemotherapy (yes or no), prior CDK4/6 inhibitor&#xD;
      therapy (yes or no). The doses of the study treatment will be based on doses and schedule&#xD;
      established in the Phase Ib part. The primary endpoint is the investigator-assessed PFS based&#xD;
      on RECIST 1.1 of the experimental arm and control arm. The major secondary endpoints include&#xD;
      the OS, ORR, DOR, DCR and safety.&#xD;
