  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single institution Phase I study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      E7777 when given prior to cyclophosphamide/fludarabine (CY/Flu) lymphodepletion (LD)&#xD;
      chemotherapy and Kymriah, a commercial tisagenlecleucel product, for the treatment of&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are at a higher risk for&#xD;
      failure of CAR-T therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      E7777 is a recombinant fusion toxin consisting of full-length human IL-2 fused to the&#xD;
      catalytic domains of diphtheria toxin. This trial is designed to augment lymphodepletion&#xD;
      prior to CAR-T cells by administration of a targeted immunotoxin against CD25-expressing&#xD;
      T-cells. CD25 is expressed at high levels on Tregs but also on activated effector T cells.&#xD;
      The use of the CAR-T cell product and associated apheresis and LD chemotherapy is considered&#xD;
      standard of care (SOC).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The Phase I study consists of two components: dose finding to establish a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of E7777 and a small extension component to provide an estimate of efficacy at the MTD.&#xD;
A single dose of E7777 is given on Day -7, two days prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Up to 3 dose levels will be tested. The MTD is determined by using the continual reassessment method (CRM). Enrollment begins with Dose Level 1 using a cohort of two patients. Twenty one (21) days after the 2nd patient's tisagenlecleucel infusion the next cohort of 2 patients are assigned to the most appropriate strategy based on updated toxicity probabilities corresponding to the desired maximum toxicity rate of ≤ 25% as determined by the study statistician (or designee). Enrollment continues in cohorts of 2 separated by a minimum of 28 days until 20 patients are enrolled or 10 sequential patients are enrolled at the same dose level. No intra-cohort staggering is required.</intervention_model_description>
