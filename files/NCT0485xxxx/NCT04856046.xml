      This study explores the potential values of a new blood test approach to detect measurable&#xD;
      residual disease or early coming back of cancer (recurrence)/cancer growing, spreading, or&#xD;
      getting worse (progression) in patients with liver cancer that can be removed by surgery&#xD;
      (resectable). The development of novel cancer biomarkers for liver cancer may help in&#xD;
      clinical decision making and lead to improvements in patient outcomes by facilitating&#xD;
      prediction of the response to specific treatments, improved monitoring of patients on&#xD;
      treatment, and better prognostication of patient outcomes, thus improving stratification for&#xD;
      clinical trials.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To isolate plasma deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation panel from the peripheral blood&#xD;
      of treated patients with hepatocellular carcinoma that will correlate with disease&#xD;
      progression or measurable residual disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To correlate the mutations/ DNA methylation in peripheral blood with those identified in&#xD;
      parallel tumor samples from the same patients with hepatocellular (HCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo collection of blood samples at 4-6 weeks prior to surgery/ablation and at 12&#xD;
      weeks, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after surgery/ablation. Patients' previously collected tissue&#xD;
      samples are analyzed. Patients' medical records are also reviewed at baseline, 4-6 weeks&#xD;
      prior to surgery/ablation, 12 weeks, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after surgery/ablation, and then&#xD;
      every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;
