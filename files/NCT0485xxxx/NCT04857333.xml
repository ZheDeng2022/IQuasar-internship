    <textblock>
      The researchers are aimed to investigate the dynamic evolution of indeterminate pulmonary&#xD;
      nodules by a long-term follow-up of patients with different characteristics. Influence&#xD;
      factors of clinical decision-making that might contribute to overtreatment or delayed&#xD;
      treatment will also be studied.&#xD;

      This observatory study prospectively recruits patients with indeterminate pulmonary nodules&#xD;
      identified in computed tomography (CT) scans from thoracic clinic. The radiological features&#xD;
      and their chronological changes during follow-up period will be recorded in detail. Subgroup&#xD;
      analyses will be performed based on the clinical and demographic characteristics of patients&#xD;
      (including symptomatic information, comorbidities, family history, antibiotic usage, etc).&#xD;
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is collected from each patient at multiple time&#xD;
      points to evaluate the patients' psychological status and its impact on clinical&#xD;
      decision-making. The interaction analyses between individual characteristics (such as&#xD;
      education level, occupation, disease cognitive level, etc) and Hospital Anxiety and&#xD;
      Depression Scale will also be performed. The researchers aim to provide high-quality evidence&#xD;
      for the formulation of a precise follow-up and management plan for patients with pulmonary&#xD;
      nodules.&#xD;
