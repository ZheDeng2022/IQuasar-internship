    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial assessing gastroenterology fellows' accuracy of colonic polyp&#xD;
      measurement using a Micro-Tech Endoscopic Polyp Measurement Device named Napoleon. The study&#xD;
      will evaluate the feasibility of Napoleon as a polyp measurement device. Investigators will&#xD;
      collect data on inpatient and outpatient colonoscopies performed by fellows at NYU Langone&#xD;
      Health, NYU Langone Hospital Brooklyn, Bellevue Hospital Center, and Manhattan VA Medical&#xD;
      Center from May 2021 - May 2022 for 150 patients. Investigators will include all&#xD;
      colonoscopies with polyps done in adults age 45 and above. For each colonoscopy, a fellow&#xD;
      will first visually estimate the polyp size and then measure the polyp with Napoleon.&#xD;
      Investigators will calculate the difference in polyp measurement between visual assessment&#xD;
      and using Napoleon for each fellow year and compare differences among fellow years.&#xD;
      Investigators will evaluate for changes in fellows' accuracy of polyp measurement with&#xD;
      subsequent uses of Napoleon. Investigators will determine the proportion of cases with a&#xD;
      change in the recommended surveillance interval based on polyp size. A survey will be given&#xD;
      to all fellows to assess the level of ease with using Napoleon.&#xD;
