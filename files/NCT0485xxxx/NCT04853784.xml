      This is a comparison of totally laparoscopic and laparoscopic-assisted colon cancer&#xD;
      resection, a prospective registration study comparing the safety and benefits of the two&#xD;
      operations&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in China. With the advancement&#xD;
      of medical science and technology, the treatment of colorectal cancer has become more mature,&#xD;
      forming a comprehensive and individualized treatment model focusing on surgery. The promotion&#xD;
      of the principles of TME and CME surgery has greatly standardized the operation of colorectal&#xD;
      surgery. COLOR II, COREAN and CLASICC studies have all confirmed the safety and effectiveness&#xD;
      of laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In traditional laparoscopic-assisted surgery, a small incision in the abdominal wall is used&#xD;
      to assist in trimming the mesangium to remove the specimen, and the anastomosis is completed&#xD;
      outside the abdominal wall, which will still cause postoperative incision pain and may lead&#xD;
      to complications such as incisional infection and incisional hernia. However, in some obese&#xD;
      patients, the mesangium is thick and short. The above operations are more difficult, and may&#xD;
      even cause the risk of mesangial tears and bleeding, which will weaken the minimally invasive&#xD;
      advantages of laparoscopic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total laparoscopic radical resection of colon cancer is performed under laparoscopic free&#xD;
      dissection and dissected reconstruction of the operation area. The small incision of the&#xD;
      abdominal wall Trocar is used to take out the specimen, which not only guarantees a&#xD;
      sufficient range of dissection and resection, but also avoids the troubles caused by the&#xD;
      auxiliary abdominal wall incision. Postoperative recovery may be faster, but it also raises&#xD;
      questions about the increased risk of infection in the surgical area. Total laparoscopic&#xD;
      radical resection of colon cancer still lacks corresponding high-quality clinical research.&#xD;
      In response to this problem, this study compares related surgical methods, verifies the&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of the corresponding surgical methods, and provides better guidance&#xD;
      for subsequent clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking laparoscopic-assisted radical resection of colon cancer as a control, the short-term&#xD;
      and long-term effects of full laparoscopic radical resection of colon cancer were evaluated,&#xD;
      so as to choose a more effective and safe operation method.&#xD;
