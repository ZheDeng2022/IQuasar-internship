      In order to increase motivation, it is necessary to eliminate the factors that create boredom&#xD;
      and to transform the lectures into a more enjoyable environment. In recent years, the&#xD;
      gamification strategy has been used in order to intrigue the students, and to increase their&#xD;
      motivation for learning. Gamification is a system that implements game design components on&#xD;
      out-of-game contexts and alters the subjects' behaviors.&#xD;
