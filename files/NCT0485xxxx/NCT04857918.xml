    <textblock>
      The STRIDE Pilot Trial is a randomized controlled pilot trial that will utilize social&#xD;
      identity informed virtual running groups to support underactive undergraduate students'&#xD;
      well-being and exercise behaviour. The main outcomes of this study are to determine whether&#xD;
      the intervention is feasible and acceptable to conduct as a full-scale efficacy trial.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes of interest include changes in participants' exercise identity, exercise&#xD;
      behaviour, perceived social support, and well-being. Participants' perceived social&#xD;
      identification with their running group will also be assessed at the end of the study.&#xD;

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Well-Being (Psychological Flourishing)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline (Week 0) to follow-up (Week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>Domain general well-being will be assessed using the 8-item Flourishing Scale from Diener et el., (2010). Participants will respond to the 8 flourishing items on a 7-point Likert-type scale anchored by 1 (Strongly disagree) to 7 (Strongly agree). The 8 items will be mean-scored (potential range 1-7), with higher scores indicating higher psychological flourishing and a more positive outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Social Support Received in the Context of Exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline (Week 0) to follow-up (Week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>Social support in the context of exercise will be assessed using a four-item social support scale (Gleibs et al., 2011; Haslam et al., 2005) adapted for the context of exercise participation. Participants will respond to the 4 social support items on a 5-point Likert-type scale anchored by 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The 4 items will be mean-scored (potential range 1-5), with higher scores reflecting greater perceived social support from others in the context of exercise and a more positive outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Well-Being (Subjective Vitality)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline (Week 0) to follow-up (Week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the six-item (Bostic et al., 2000) Subjective Vitality Scale (SVS; Ryan &amp; Frederick, 1997) adapted for the context of exercise behaviour. Participants will respond to the 6 exercise-related subjective vitality items on a 7-point Likert-type scale anchored by 1 (Not at All True) to 7 (Very True). The 6 items will be mean-scored (potential range 1-7), with higher scores reflecting greater subjective experiences of vitality in the context of exercise and a more positive outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Exercise Identity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline (Week 0) to follow-up (Week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the nine-item Exercise Identity Scale (Anderson &amp; Cychosz, 1994). Participants will respond to the 9 exercise identity items on a 7-point Likert-type scale anchored by 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 7 (Strongly Agree). Consistent with Wilson and Muon (2008), two separate scores will be calculated to reflect the role-identity dimension and the exercise beliefs dimension of the scale. Items 1, 2, and 6 will be mean-scored (potential range 1-7), with higher score reflecting a greater role identity in relation to exercise behaviour, and items 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 will be mean-scored (potential range 1-7), with higher scores reflecting greater exercise-related beliefs and a more positive outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social Identification with the Running Group</measure>
    <time_frame>Follow-up (Week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>Using a four-item social identification scale (Doosje et al., 1995), participants in the intervention condition will respond to four items inquiring the degree to which they positively identify with their running group. Participants will respond to the 4 social identification items using a 7-point Likert-type scale anchored by 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 7 (Strongly Agree). The 4 items will be mean-scored (potential range 1-7), with higher scores reflecting stronger positive identification with the running group and a more positive outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Exercise Behaviour</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline (Week 0) to follow-up (Week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>In reference to the past month, participants will report the number of times per week (on average) they engaged in mild, moderate, and vigorous exercise using the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (Godin &amp; Shephard, 1985), and the average duration of mild, moderate, and vigorous exercise sessions (Courneya et al., 2004). Consistent with Courneya et al. (2004), the researchers will create an indicator of average weekly moderate-to-vigorous exercise minutes (in past month) for each participant using the following equation: (number of moderate exercise bouts x average minutes per bout) + (number of vigorous exercise bouts x average minutes per bout). The scores will have a minimum value of 0 minutes, with more minutes indicating greater participation in moderate-to-vigorous exercise and a more positive outcome.</description>

    <description>Participants will join running groups of six people (males and females) for eight weeks. Each running group will be given the group goal/challenge to collectively run/brisk walk the distance across the province of British Columbia (940 km) over the course of the eight week intervention (Estabrooks et al., 2008), and encouraged to complete 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous exercise per week. Participants can record other moderate-to-vigorous exercise to contribute to the group goal. Running groups will be created on the fitness application Strava, and participants will record/post their runs on the Strava app so that members of their running group can provide 'kudos' and words of encouragement. Running groups will have a weekly a coffee chat (via Zoom) to socialize and discuss their experiences running/exercising and progress and challenges associated with meeting the group goal. Participants will also be provided running tip videos, phone armbands, and t-shirts with the study logo.</description>
