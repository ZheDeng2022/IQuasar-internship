  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To collect blood and urine samples from patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), myalgic&#xD;
      encephalomyelitis (ME), and SEID (Systemic Exertion Intolerance Syndrome) and controls for&#xD;
      genomic, viral and metabolomic testing.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To analyze gene expression (genomic) and viral analysis data from patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      ME/CFS, the study will collect blood samples (finger stick) and information from up to 500&#xD;
      subjects for analysis. In addition, urine will be collected for all subjects to evaluate the&#xD;
      study subject's metabolomics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will complete a single Study Collection event consisting of at least one MCD&#xD;
      (2nd sample is optional) and one urine collection from home: 10% of each group (ME/CFS and&#xD;
      Control) will complete a second Study Collection event approximately 1 to 2 weeks after the&#xD;
      initial Study Collection. The second collection is to compare data between two collections&#xD;
      from the same participants to observe any time-related changes in the results.&#xD;
