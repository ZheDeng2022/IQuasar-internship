      To develop application-enabled shared decision-making among patients with early breast cancer&#xD;
      and evaluate the preliminary effects of the interventions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Female breast is an amazing organ that it symbolizes not only the female gender, but also the&#xD;
      continuity of human race. In the past treating breast cancer may signal a termination of the&#xD;
      breast's predestined role in a woman or a mother. Nowadays, surgical treatment of early&#xD;
      breast cancer has two options, one is breast-conserving surgery and the other one is total&#xD;
      mastectomy. The former treatment option preserves most of the breast tissue but may spare&#xD;
      dormant cancer cells in the preserved tissue. The latter treatment option spares no breast&#xD;
      tissue and as a result no dormant cancer cells would remain. This treatment dilemma may&#xD;
      bother most of the patients especially when they are still under the shade of the bad news.&#xD;
      Many women are reluctant to discuss their diseased breasts with their folks or even their&#xD;
      doctors because of privacy; instead they would seek information through internet.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, most of their final decision is doctor's preferred choice despite they may&#xD;
      have doubts or concerns on doctor's choice of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Share decision making (SDM) is a recently developed strategy that allows patients taking part&#xD;
      in their treatment plan. Patients are invited to join the meeting where doctors explain the&#xD;
      latest treatment options and patients express their concerns and finally a decision, both&#xD;
      doctors' and patients' concerns well integrated, is reached. One of the drawbacks of SDM is&#xD;
      too time consuming; doctors have to prepare a lot of pertinent information, while patients&#xD;
      have to try their best to understand the provided information, though many patients may not&#xD;
      fully understand their treatment options. It has been reported that a well designed patient&#xD;
      decision aids (PDAs) could serve as a virtue connection between patients and doctors. Instead&#xD;
      of merely taking information from the PDAs, it allows patients to know all the possible&#xD;
      options of treatment and the side effects in an interactive way. It is supposed that patients&#xD;
      could be well prepared to discuss with their doctors after interaction with the customized&#xD;
      PDAs. In Taiwan, decision conflict and decision regret are commonly encountered among most&#xD;
      cancer patients. The impetus for developing a PDAs for female breast cancer patients and&#xD;
      evaluating its role on lowering decision conflict and decision regret among these patients&#xD;
      comes from the high rates of decision conflict and decision regret among cancer patients in&#xD;
      Taiwan.&#xD;

    <description>The knowledge tests included five items,1. Are the survival rates of breast cancer the same with conserving surgery and total mastectomy? 2. Breast-conserving surgery has a higher local-regional recurrence rate? 3. Is radiation therapy required for Breast-conserving surgery? 4. Does total mastectomy require longer recovery time? 5. Do both total mastectomy and breast-conserving surgery have the same bleeding and infection rate? The knowledge tests included five items, such as &quot;Are the survival rates of breast cancer the same with conserving surgery and total mastectomy?&quot; The correct answer was coded as one point. The scores of the knowledge tests ranged from zero to five points. Higher scores indicated more correct knowledge.</description>

    <time_frame>immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Decision Conflict Scale (DCS_SURE) included four items: uncertainty, information, values clarity, and support and effective decision. On the scale, &quot;Yes&quot; answers scored one point, while &quot;No&quot; responses were zero points. The higher score, the lesser conflict.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Decision Regret Scale DRS</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Decision Regret Scale was composed of five items: &quot;It was the right decision,&quot; &quot;I regret the choice that was made,&quot; &quot;I would go for the same choices if I had to do it over again,&quot; &quot;The choices did me a lot of harm,&quot; and &quot;The decision was a wise one.&quot; Items were scored using a five-point Likert scale, ranging from very agreed (1 point) to very disagreed (5 points), but two items were reversely scored. The higher score, the more regret.</description>
