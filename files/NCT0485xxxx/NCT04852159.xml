      Descriptive analytical study to translate the CP-QOL into local languages of Pakistan that&#xD;
      are, Pashto, Urdu, Punjabi, Sindhi and Balochi languages. Along with validation of the&#xD;
      translated versions by evaluating their validity and reliability in the people of Pakistan,&#xD;
      speaking respective languages and suffering from low back pain. No such study has been&#xD;
      previously conducted in the Pakistan region which translates the scale and follows the proper&#xD;
      cross-culture adaptation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Condition or disease: Cerebral palsy. Non-probability Purposive Sampling would be used. The&#xD;
      study will be conducted in relevant areas of Pakistan.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CP QOL has two separate forms, for both the child and the primary caregiver. CP QOL- The&#xD;
      primary caregiver proxy report consists of 66 items for children ages 4-12 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The child self-report form contains 52 items for children ages 9-12 years old. The version CP&#xD;
      QOL-Child Self Report Questionnaire (9-12 years) is divided into areas: well-being and social&#xD;
      acceptance, functionality, participation and physical health, emotional well-being and&#xD;
      self-esteem, access to services and pain and impact disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This version should be answered by the children with CP, that is, it is the child's&#xD;
      self-report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the items are rated from 1 to 9, except for one item in pain and impact of disability&#xD;
      domain, which is rated on a 5-point scale. All responses will then be converted into scale&#xD;
      score between 0 to 100. Higher scores meant a higher quality of life. In case children needed&#xD;
      any help while filling out the questionnaires, they could easily consult caregivers or&#xD;
      researchers. As the CP QOL-Child is a well-developed measurement scale, it is meaningful to&#xD;
      validate its Urdu, Pushto, Punjabi, Sindhi and Balochi versions. It is also useful to study&#xD;
      the QOL of children with CP in different cultural settings by using the same measurement&#xD;
      items so that a more direct comparison can be made. Therefore, the aim of this study is to&#xD;
      translate the CP QOL questionnaire in Urdu, Pushto, Punjabi, Sindhi and Balochi and also to&#xD;
      assess the reliability and validity of this translated version of CP QOL questionnaire in&#xD;
      Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The translation and cultural adaptation processes would start after obtaining approval from&#xD;
      the developer of the original CP QOL Child. This would be done according to WHO guidelines.&#xD;
      Translation will be done by symmetrical category. The purpose will be to gain uniformity in&#xD;
      the translation of tool in both the Target language and Source language. This will involve 5&#xD;
      steps. (Forward translation, synthesis 1, Back translation, synthesis 2 and pilot testing.)&#xD;
      Phase 2 would be done according to the guidelines of COSMIN in which psychometric properties&#xD;
      will be measured. (reliability, internal consistency, construct validity and factor&#xD;
      analysis.)&#xD;

    <measure>Reliability of translated versions of CP QOL Child</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the reliability of cross-culturally adapted and translated CP-QOL Child in children having cerebral palsy of respective languages. Reliability or reproducibility refers to the ability of a measure to produce the same results when administered at two intervals between different visits of the patient. Thus this will be measured through test re-test reliability.</description>

    <description>To determine the validity of cross-culturally adapted and translated CP-QOL Child in children having cerebral palsy of respective languages. Validity is how accurate the results are. Thus this will be measured through various parameters to validate the translated versions as appropriate and applicable.</description>
