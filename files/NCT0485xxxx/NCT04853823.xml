    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study to assess&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability and dermal reactogenicity in subjects shown to be sensitive to&#xD;
      urushiol of PDC-APB by intramuscular (IM) injection compared to placebo. In this study, it is&#xD;
      anticipated that up to 4 dose levels (5.0 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg PDC-APB) will be&#xD;
      studied in sequential cohorts. Each cohort will enroll 8 subjects, 6 subjects randomized to&#xD;
      active treatment and 2 randomized to placebo, in a double-blind manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed in each cohort before starting treatment at the next higher dose&#xD;
      level. If the study treatment is tolerated and there are no findings that necessitate&#xD;
      stopping the study, the next cohort will be treated at the next higher dose level, in the&#xD;
      same manner. This process will continue until the highest intended dose is reached, or side&#xD;
      effects that limit further dose escalation are observed.&#xD;

    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Primary outcome measure for this study will be the overall safety profile observed during the post-treatment observation period in the study population. AEs will be classified by organ class using the coding system and by severity (Grades 1-4, Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials).&#xD;
The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of PDC-APB following single doses administered intramuscularly to healthy subjects between 18 and 65 years of age.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Urushiol Sensitivity [scored +/-, 0-4]</measure>
    <time_frame>15 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary assessments will evaluate the effect of PDC-APB injection on urushiol sensitivity (scored +/-, 0-4). Local reactogenicity to the second urushiol patch applied 6 weeks after IP injection will be compared to the reactogenicity scores following application of the first patch 6 weeks prior to injection of IP.</description>

    <description>Study duration for each subject is approximately 15 weeks (105 days) for Screening including patch testing, Treatment, and the initial 30-day post-treatment periods. Approximately 6 weeks after treatment, subjects will receive a second patch test. In addition, each subject will be followed from T1 for 6 months by monthly telephone follow-up to monitor adverse events. Subjects in Cohorts 2, 3 and 4 and, if applicable, additional cohorts, will not be dosed until all subjects from the prior cohort have completed the assessments after IP dosing and the Safety Review Committee has reviewed the results prior to Day T14. All subjects will be followed for 6 months after IP dosing for safety assessments, which will be carried out at monthly intervals via telephone.</description>
