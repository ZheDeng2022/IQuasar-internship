    <textblock>
      Primary IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common form of glomerulonephritis in China and the&#xD;
      world. It is the main reason for Chinese young people's renal failure. The main difficulties&#xD;
      in clinical IgAN and treatment are 1) high clinical and prognostic heterogeneity, the&#xD;
      prognosis cannot be accurately predicted; 2) no clinically available biomarkers, diagnosis is&#xD;
      established by kidney biopsy; 3) The lack of specific treatment methods. These lead 20-40% of&#xD;
      IgAN patients to develop end-stage renal failure (ESRD) after 10 to 20 years. Therefore, to&#xD;
      improve clinical diagnosis, treatment, and scientific research of IgAN, it is much-needed to&#xD;
      establish high-quality long-term cohort study, multi-center database, biobank, and conduct&#xD;
      high-quality clinical research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of IgAN in the Asia Pacific region is higher than in other regions, and China&#xD;
      is one of the countries with the highest incidence of IgAN in the world. Although the number&#xD;
      of IgAN patients in our country is vast and the clinical data and patient sample resources&#xD;
      are abundant, the clinical diagnosis and treatment are not standardized, the follow-up rate&#xD;
      is low, and the quality of clinical data is poor, which seriously affect the development of&#xD;
      related clinical research. Therefore, optimization and integration of health care big data&#xD;
      under careful top-level design is urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding IgAN, the Nephrology Department of Ruijin Hospital has been active in clinical&#xD;
      database construction and clinical biobank management and has carried out several clinical&#xD;
      and basic research. The world's largest IgAN cohort-CRPIGA cohort has been established, all&#xD;
      patients in the cohort are followed up in a standardized manner by special personnel, and the&#xD;
      data is recorded in a clinical database in real-time. However, optimization and integration&#xD;
      of health care big data under careful top-level design is urgently needed. It is to establish&#xD;
      IgAN specific disease structured data set standard in a multi-center linkage mode, formulate&#xD;
      IgAN diagnosis and treatment specifications and clinical pathway standards, develop&#xD;
      structured clinical case diagnosis and treatment information collection template, real-time&#xD;
      scrape the actual clinical IgAN diagnosis and treatment data of various hospitals through the&#xD;
      big data platform of health care consortium, clean and structure the acquired data, establish&#xD;
      a multi-center structured database, integrate resources, strengthen advantages, and provide a&#xD;
      qualified database for clinical research in the real world. All diagnosis and treatment data&#xD;
      for the same patient are linked and integrated to offer individual patient-based longitudinal&#xD;
      tracking records and support evidence-based medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to improve the scale and quality of the IgAN multi-center cohort database,&#xD;
      advance the clinical and basic research of IgAN, standardize and optimize the clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment path of IgAN, provide more effective and safe treatment options for&#xD;
      more IgAN patients and also provide evidence-based medicine evidence support.&#xD;
