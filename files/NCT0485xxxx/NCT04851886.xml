  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to assess whether robot-assisted upper-limb group&#xD;
      rehabilitation can be effectively delivered by using a camera-based system equipped with&#xD;
      machine learning algorithms to track the quality of the exercise performance and provide&#xD;
      feedback accordingly. To address this question, we plan to carry out a randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial to compare outcomes in subjects receiving robot-assisted upper-limb rehabilitation&#xD;
      during individual (i.e., one-on-one) sessions and in subjects receiving robot-assisted&#xD;
      upper-limb rehabilitation during group (i.e., up to three subjects) sessions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a single-blinded randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      using the PostureCheck (a camera-based system equipped with machine learning algorithms to&#xD;
      track the quality of the exercise performance) on motor gains in group and individual&#xD;
      robot-assisted upper-limb. Study participants (stroke survivors) will be recruited at the&#xD;
      Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital - Boston. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the&#xD;
      two different groups: individual- or group-therapy using a covariate-adaptive allocation&#xD;
      procedure to ensure important covariates, such as baseline Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the Upper&#xD;
      Extremity (FMA-UE) scores and proprioceptive deficits, are balanced between groups.&#xD;

    <description>Participants randomized to this arm of the study will also undergo 18 sessions of robot-assisted upper-limb rehabilitation. However, a therapist will administer the intervention as group therapy with up to three subjects participating in the session at the same time. To facilitate the deliver of the therapeutic intervention, the robot will be equipped with a camera system (called PostureCheck) designed to track the quality of the exercises.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Severely impaired trunk control (&lt;4)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who present with the following on the intended limb:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Open wounds&#xD;
&#xD;

             eventuality of the arm of the BURT accidentally impacting the woman's belly. The&#xD;

             away from the patient's body) but we are taking this as an extra precaution against&#xD;
