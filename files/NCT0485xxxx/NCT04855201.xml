    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to to evaluate the effect of ASP0367 on improvement of aerobic&#xD;
      capacity relative to placebo, as well as evaluate the safety and tolerability of ASP0367&#xD;
      relative to placebo. This study will also evaluate the effect of ASP0367 on improvement of&#xD;
      other aerobic capacity parameters relative to placebo, as well as evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      ASP0367 on improvement of functional capacity relative to placebo.&#xD;

      The study will consist of a screening period (up to 27 days [approximately 4 weeks]),&#xD;
      treatment period (up to 44 days [6 weeks]) and follow-up period (7 days [1 week]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be completed with an end-of-study visit (ESV). The ESV will take place 7 days&#xD;
      (1 week) after the end-of-treatment on day 44 (week 6) or 7 days (1 week) after early&#xD;
      discontinuation from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anticipated total duration of the study for each participant, including screening and&#xD;
      follow-up, is approximately 75 days (11 week).&#xD;

An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of investigational product (IP), whether or not considered related to the IP. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of IP.
