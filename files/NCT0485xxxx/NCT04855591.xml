  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single dose escalation phase 1 study.&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity of subcutaneous administered SHR-1703 in healthy&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of one dose esclation part with a total of 3 dose levels. The Subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive SHR-1703 as reflected by the guiding principle for the dose&#xD;
      esclation/expansion phase. Each dose group includes a screening period, a baseline period, an&#xD;
      observational period, and a safety follow-up period.&#xD;
