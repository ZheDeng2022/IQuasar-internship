  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the difference of safety and efficacy about&#xD;
      Capecitabine and S-1 for treatment of patients with low-risk of recurrence after BTC surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients received curative BTC surgery will be informed about the study. After being informed&#xD;
      about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written informed consent will&#xD;
      undergo a 1-week screening period to determine eligibility for study entry. At week 0,&#xD;
      patients who meet the eligibility requirements will be observed for recurrence of BTC.&#xD;
