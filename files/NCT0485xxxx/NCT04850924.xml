      Alex storm hits France from September 30, 2020 to October 3, 2020. On October 2, several&#xD;
      valley in the Nice hinterland were devastated by this natural disaster. Nine people died&#xD;
      during this storm and hundreds of families were affected (house washed away or&#xD;
      uninhabitable). This led to emergency evacuations on October 3 of several families. The&#xD;
      inhabitants of some villages have been subjected to prolonged stress (lack of water and&#xD;
      electricity, difficulty in supplying food, fear of another storm). These villages were&#xD;
      isolated for a period varying from fifteen days to over three months. These people are&#xD;
      particularly exposed to psychological consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between October 3 and October 30, the CUMP (medico-psychological emergency unit) was&#xD;
      mobilized to provide psychological first aid to these families. Among those seen in emergency&#xD;
      116 children were taken care of. In order to assess the immediate symptoms of the children,&#xD;
      the investigators used an assessment sheet specific to the developmental ages of the&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children seen in an emergency between October 3 and October 30, 2020 were assessed by&#xD;
      child psychiatrists or by psychologists trained in emergency and pediatric psychological&#xD;
      trauma.&#xD;
