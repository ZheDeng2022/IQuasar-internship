  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, it is known that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can modulate&#xD;
      cortical activity, being considered an important resource in the treatment of sequelae&#xD;
      resulting from stroke. However, evidence of the effects of tDCS in the acute post-stroke&#xD;
      period on lower limb motor recovery still remains scarce and inconclusive. Currently, a great&#xD;
      variability of results has been perceived, in this sense there is a need for studies that&#xD;
      perform dosage optimization, based on individual characteristics. Therefore, the present&#xD;
      study seeks to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the optimization of the measurement of&#xD;
      tDCS on the motor function of lower limbs in patients after ischemic stroke in a late&#xD;
      subacute stage (3 to 6 months after the injury), compared to individuals undergoing sham&#xD;
      tDCS. The study is a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial, with&#xD;
      individuals after a stroke, recruited at a referral hospital in the metropolitan region of&#xD;
      João Pessoa. After recruitment and initial screening, participants will be randomized into&#xD;
      two groups: Group 1 - active stimulation and group - 2 sham stimulation. Participants will&#xD;
      receive 10 sessions of tDCS, for 20 minutes, on alternate days (3 times a week), where the&#xD;
      electrodes will be positioned over the primary motor cortex. 3 minutes of EEG at rest will be&#xD;
      taken from each participant, and they will be instructed not to be actively involved in any&#xD;
      cognitive or mental activity. In the first and last meeting, the evaluations will be carried&#xD;
      out, the evaluated outcomes will be: motor function (Fugl-Meyer scale), functional&#xD;
      connectivity (EEG), quality of life (SF-36) and level of functional disability (Rankin scale)&#xD;
      . Statistical analyzes will be performed using the SPSS software (Version 20.0) and MATLAB&#xD;
      9.2.0 with a significance level of p &lt;0.05.&#xD;

      Participants will be divided into 02 groups: G1: Experimental - participants who will receive&#xD;
      real current; G2: Sham - participants who will receive simulated stimulation. Participants&#xD;
      will be included in the study using the eligibility criteria and will be randomly allocated,&#xD;
      with exchange in blocks at the rate of 1: 1. Participants will receive 10 tDCS sessions, for&#xD;
      20 minutes, on days alternate (3 times a week). The neurostimulator TCT-Research will be used&#xD;
      for stimulation. The electrodes will be positioned according to the international&#xD;
      classification system of the electroencephalogram 10/20, in which the anode will be applied&#xD;
      in the primary motor area (C3 / C4) ipsilateral to the lesion and the cathode in the&#xD;
      contralateral supra-orbital region. The current intensity will be defined based on&#xD;
      computational modeling, using the patient's magnetic resonance as a basis, in order to&#xD;
      estimate and individualize the dosage to be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SimNIBS software will be used for computational modeling, it is a free and open source&#xD;
      package for the simulation of the electric field induced individually by tDCS in the brain.&#xD;
      The modeling will be performed from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images in order to build a&#xD;
      high resolution head model for each individual. These images are segmented into the main&#xD;
      tissues of the head (white and gray substance, cerebrospinal fluid, skull and scalp). From&#xD;
      the segmentations, a volume conductor model is created and used to perform the electric field&#xD;
      simulations. The estimated distribution of the cerebral electric field is obtained by placing&#xD;
      simulated electrodes on the head model and defining the intensity of the electric current&#xD;
      according to the stimulation protocol.&#xD;
