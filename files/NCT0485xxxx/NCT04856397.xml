  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary focus of this study is to understand the anatomic and visual outcomes of patients&#xD;
      with refractory and suboptimal treatment response diabetic macular edema (DME) using&#xD;
      anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to Ozurdex, an intravitreal dexamethasone&#xD;
      implant. Secondly, investigators aim to understand the differences in cytokine profiles in&#xD;
      patients who respond differently to intravitreal anti-VEGF versus Ozurdex. The importance of&#xD;
      this study is to identify biomarkers that may help predict patients' response to different&#xD;
      treatment protocols. Currently, Ozurdex is not covered by provincial health benefit plans for&#xD;
      patients with DME. Our results may help improve access to care for those who have suboptimal&#xD;
      results with or refractory to intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic macular edema (DME) is the most common cause of vision loss in young patients with&#xD;
      diabetes. Its pathophysiology starts with decreased retinal oxygen tension that manifests as&#xD;
      retinal capillary hyperpermeability and increased intravascular pressure mediated by vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) upregulation and retinal vascular autoregulation,&#xD;
      respectively. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) is the cornerstone of&#xD;
      clinical assessment of DME. The foundation of treatment is metabolic control of hyperglycemia&#xD;
      and blood pressure. Specific ophthalmic treatments of DME include intravitreal anti-VEGF drug&#xD;
      injections, in the form of intravitreal Bevacizumab (Avastin), Ranibizumab (Lucentis), and&#xD;
      Aflibercept (Eylea). Intravitreal corticosteroid injections, focal laser photocoagulation,&#xD;
      and vitrectomy are other treatment options. A substantial fraction of eyes respond&#xD;
      incompletely to all of these modalities resulting in visual loss and disordered retinal&#xD;
      structure and vasculature visible on SD-OCT and OCT angiography. There is currently no&#xD;
      consensus on when to switch from one treatment to another in the context of a suboptimal&#xD;
      response. Our hypothesis is that patients who are switched early to Ozurdex and achieve an&#xD;
      OCT proven dry state, achieve better functional outcomes than those patients who are switched&#xD;
      late or not at all, by limiting exposure of the retina to potentially damaging inflammatory&#xD;
      markers, and the merits associated with less frequent injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suboptimal DME is defined as a central subfoveal retinal thickness of &gt; 300 and the presence&#xD;
      of intra or sub-retinal fluid with a minimum BCVA of 20/25 or worse after 3 injections of&#xD;
      intravitreal aflibercept, from here on referred to as Eylea. Furthermore, there is some&#xD;
      evidence that a subset of patients with refractory DME respond well to intravitreal&#xD;
      corticosteroids, specifically, Ozurdex, which is a biodegradable, sustained-release&#xD;
      intravitreal dexamethasone implant, designed to be potentially injected between 2-6 months.&#xD;
      This medication is currently not covered by the Ontario health benefits plan for patients&#xD;
      with DME and comes at a significant cost to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, recent studies have confirmed the important role of inflammatory ocular cytokines&#xD;
      in patients' response to intravitreal treatments in DME, much the same as neovascular&#xD;
      age-related macular degeneration. However, it is not known which ocular cytokines determine&#xD;
      the degree of response to various treatment modalities for DME.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, investigators aim to study the anatomic and visual outcomes, as well as the cytokine&#xD;
      profile of patients with suboptimal DME in response to early vs. late switch to intravitreal&#xD;
      Ozurdex treatment.&#xD;
