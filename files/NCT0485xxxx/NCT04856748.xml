      Rationale: Histological inflammation of the prostate is a common finding in the results of&#xD;
      the histopathological examinations after a prostate biopsy or a transurethral or open&#xD;
      prostatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have investigated the role of prostatic inflammation in the development of&#xD;
      prostatic enlargement and pathogenesis of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS). Therefore,&#xD;
      prostatic inflammation could be a potential treatment target for men with LUTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The aim of the study is the development and the validation of a nomogram based on&#xD;
      clinical parameters that could predict the presence of prostatic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Non-interventional, multicentric, cross-sectional, observational prospective&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Men, age ≥ 40 yrs, with LUTS who will undergo any prostatic surgery for BPH&#xD;
      (Open, laparoscopic, robotic, transurethral resection/enucleation, laser prostatectomy) or&#xD;
      TRUS-biopsy according to the standard clinical practice of the participating urologists&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: All included males receive standard care for their symptoms according to the&#xD;
      physician's practice. For this study, baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of&#xD;
      the patients are recorded and correlated with the histological outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Development and validation of the Prostatic Inflammation&#xD;
      Nomogram&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: No additional treatment or intervention related to the study is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore no negative outcomes are expected as the standard treatment is unchanged. There is&#xD;
      no additional burden for the patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) are common in men over 45 years of age and have been&#xD;
      traditionally attributed to bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) as a result of benign prostatic&#xD;
      obstruction (BPO), which is often associated with benign prostatic enlargement (BPE)&#xD;
      resulting from the histologic condition of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, more recent research focuses on the role of prostatic inflammation in the&#xD;
      development of prostatic enlargement and consequently the severity of LUTS and the natural&#xD;
      history of these symptoms. Several models and hypotheses have been suggested for the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of this condition. Also, the relationship of the inflammation pattern with the&#xD;
      progression of BPH is currently investigated through the molecular and metabolic pathways,&#xD;
      which can be responsible for this connection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason, the present study aims to develop a nomogram based on clinical parameters&#xD;
      that will diagnose the presence of prostatic inflammation. Should the nomogram prove valid&#xD;
      (that is: it can make reliable estimations of prostatic inflammation presence in men with&#xD;
      LUTS), it will allow physicians to use patient characteristics to identify patients with&#xD;
      increased risk of prostatic inflammation in order to optimise medical strategies for the&#xD;
      management of LUTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To build a predictive nomogram that will estimate the personalised risk of the presence of&#xD;
      prostatic inflammation in patients with LUTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To validate the nomogram&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a non-interventional, multicentric, cross-sectional, observational, prospective&#xD;
      study. Patients with LUTS/BPH symptoms who have been scheduled for either prostatectomy&#xD;
      (Transurethral surgery - open) or Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS)-biopsy as indicated by the&#xD;
      standard care for their condition according to the physician's practice, are eligible for the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to participate in the study. The following parameters will be&#xD;
      recorded: Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Prostate Volume (PV) (either with transrectal or&#xD;
      abdominal ultrasound), total IPSS, voiding IPSS, storage IPSS, Maximum flow rate (Qmax), each&#xD;
      component of Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) (waist circumference, triglycerides, blood pressure,&#xD;
      fasting glucose, HDL cholesterol or any treatment for these components), serum Prostate&#xD;
      Specific Antigen (PSA), presence (Yes or No) of calcifications (either with transrectal or&#xD;
      abdominal ultrasound), dipstick urine, previous or current medication for LUTS/BPH, and&#xD;
      history of confirmed (Yes or No) Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specimen will be examined for inflammation according to Irani's score (total and histologic&#xD;
      inflammation grading and aggressiveness grading subscores).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted by six centers (or more if needed) in five countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study is estimated to be six months depending on the enrollment pace. As&#xD;
      per the design of the study, no additional treatment/intervention related to the objectives&#xD;
      of the study will be required and no follow-up visits will be needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of study is the date of the last patient histology report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population (base) The population will be men, age ≥ 40 yrs, with LUTS who will undergo any&#xD;
      prostatic surgery for BPH (Open, laparoscopic, robotic, transurethral resection/enucleation,&#xD;
      laser prostatectomy) or TRUS-biopsy according to the standard clinical practice of the&#xD;
      participating urologists&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation A sample size of 375 patients for the development of the nomogram&#xD;
      will be needed. It is generally accepted that for the calculation of the sample size required&#xD;
      for the development of a nomogram: the minimum value of the frequencies of the two response&#xD;
      levels should be greater than 10 times the number of predictors when the outcome is binary&#xD;
      (presence of inflammation yes or no).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plan of the present study is to include the following 15 parameters (predictors): BMI,&#xD;
      Age, PV, IPSS, voiding IPSS, storage IPSS, Qmax, each component of MetS, PSA, presence of&#xD;
      calcifications, and history of UTIs. Taking into account that the incidence of prostatic&#xD;
      inflammation in the biopsies is around 60%. Therefore, the sample size needed is 10 x 15 =&#xD;
      150 patients for the non-inflammation group and 225 patients for the inflammation group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of Subjects Not applicable. Any treatment will be offered according to the standard&#xD;
      treatment practice of the physicians. Treatment will not be influenced by this study, as this&#xD;
      is an observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Safety Information will be recorded in the Case Report Form (CRF). A code number will be&#xD;
      given to each patient in order to prevent patients' identification. Only the local Primary&#xD;
      Investigator will have access to all the names of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the CRFs will be stored under the responsibility of the participating centers. The CRFs&#xD;
      (without any patient's identification info) will be sent to the Project Leader for the&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of Prostatic Inflammation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostatic inflammation will be determined according to the total Irani's score, histologic&#xD;
      inflammation grading and aggressiveness grading subscores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Irani's score classifies prostatic inflammation on the basis of the extension of&#xD;
      inflammatory cells and their effect on prostate tissue. A 4-point scale is used for&#xD;
      inflammation (0-no inflammatory cells, 1-scattered inflammatory cell infiltrate,&#xD;
      2-nonconfluent lymphoid nodules and 3-large inflammatory areas with confluence of infiltrate)&#xD;
      and aggressiveness (0 -no contact between inflammatory cells and glandular epithelium;&#xD;
      1-contact between inflammatory cell infiltrate and glandular epithelium; 2-clear but limited,&#xD;
      that is less than 25% of the examined material, glandular epithelium disruption, and&#xD;
      3-glandular epithelium disruption on more than 25% of the examined material).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of Metabolic Syndrome (MetS):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The USA National Cholesterol Education Program - Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATPIII)&#xD;
      definition for MetS will be used. It requires at least three of the following five&#xD;
      components: central obesity (waist circumference of &gt;102 cm), elevated triglycerides (≥1.7&#xD;
      mmol/L or 150 mg/dL), elevated blood pressure (≥130/85 mmHg), elevated fasting glucose (≥6.1&#xD;
      mmol/L or 110 mg/dL) and reduced HDL cholesterol (&lt;1.03 mmol/L or 40 mg/dL). Patients with&#xD;
      known diabetes mellitus and/or hypercholesteremia and/or arterial hypertension under&#xD;
      treatment will be considered as positive for the specific component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal and replacement of individual subjects Subjects can leave the study at any time&#xD;
      for any reason if they wish to do so without any consequences. The investigator can decide to&#xD;
      withdraw a subject if a violation of the protocol occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be replaced after the withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Reporting The physicians are asked to apply treatment conform their standard practice&#xD;
      in medication type and follow-up frequency; therefore the quality of care is equal and there&#xD;
      are no additional risks, therefore no safety issues are expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events (AEs) or Serious adverse events (SAEs) This study has no interventional&#xD;
      product. Patients will receive established, standard medical treatment, management of AEs&#xD;
      will be done according to the national protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) / Safety Committee] As this study is an observational&#xD;
      study, and patients are treated according to the physician's standard practice, no safety&#xD;
      problems are expected. Therefore no DSMB will be used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Primary study parameter(s) The development of a multivariable diagnostic&#xD;
      model generally requires identification of the important predictors out of a set of&#xD;
      preselected candidate predictors; assigning the relative weights for each predictor in a&#xD;
      combined risk score; estimating the model's predictive performance including its calibration,&#xD;
      discrimination and (re)classification properties; assessing its potential for optimism using&#xD;
      so-called internal validation techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of predictor will be based on the multivariable analyses. Candidate predictors that&#xD;
      will not contribute usefully in the multivariable model will be removed. Backward elimination&#xD;
      will be used to examine all candidate predictors in the multivariable model and run a&#xD;
      sequence of tests to remove or keep variables in the model based on predefined nominal&#xD;
      significance level for variable exclusion, using the log likelihood ratio test for comparing&#xD;
      two models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multivariable analysis estimates regression coefficients of each predictor included in&#xD;
      the final model, which are mutually adjusted for the other predictors in the model. The&#xD;
      coefficients thus quantify the contribution of each predictor to the outcome probability or&#xD;
      risk estimation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study parameter(s) Internal validation will be performed. Bootstrapping is the&#xD;
      preferred method for internal validation, certainly when the development sample is relatively&#xD;
      small and/or a high number of candidate predictors is studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bootstrapping is a statistical method that aims to mimic this sampling process using only the&#xD;
      data at hand by sampling with replacement a study sample of the same size (to preserve the&#xD;
      precision) from the original study sample in which the model was developed. With&#xD;
      bootstrapping, all data are thus used for model development and it provides insight into the&#xD;
      extent to which the developed model (in the original study sample) is overfitted and too&#xD;
      optimistic. Drawing with replacement mimics that random component, making bootstrap samples&#xD;
      similar but not identical to the original study sample. This may yield a different model&#xD;
      developed from each bootstrap sample with corresponding c-index. Subsequently, each boot-&#xD;
      strap model is applied to the original study sample (mimicking the source population),&#xD;
      yielding a difference in c-index. The average of all these 'c-index differences' indicates&#xD;
      the optimism in the apparent c-index of the prediction model that was initially developed in&#xD;
      the original study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and consent Eligible subjects will be selected by participating physicians.&#xD;
      During consultation, the physician takes the history, examines the patient and reviews his&#xD;
      examinations. Based on the findings, the physician discusses with patient and sets the&#xD;
      indication for TRUS-biopsy or prostatectomy. If the patient meets the inclusion criteria, the&#xD;
      physician informs the patient about the study and the information subject form is given. The&#xD;
      patient who agrees to participate in the study, fills the informed consent (IC) form when the&#xD;
      participant comes for the scheduled procedure (biopsy or prostatectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handling and storage of data and documents A code number will be given to each patient in&#xD;
      order to prevent patients' identification. Only the local Primary Investigator will have&#xD;
      access to all the names of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring, Auditing and Quality Assurance Electronic audit will be performed at the end of&#xD;
      the study: Database will be closed and centers will be asked to send specific information&#xD;
      from randomly selected patient's file (e.g. baseline PSA, prostate volume, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no centralization (a central Pathology Lab) for the examination of the&#xD;
      specimen. For consistency reasons across the Pathology Labs and control of Quality, photos of&#xD;
      specimen will be randomly sent from one Lab to another to investigate agreement between the&#xD;
      Labs in the grading of the inflammation.&#xD;
