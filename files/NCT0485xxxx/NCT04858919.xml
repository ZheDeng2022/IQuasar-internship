      This study is to compare the feasibility and test performance of different 3D pelvic&#xD;
      ultrasound and Transrectal ultrasound in the detection of local lesions in the uterus ,&#xD;
      cervix and vagina compared to the final diagnosis confirmed by vaginoscopy as a golden&#xD;
      standard modality of diagnosis in Virgin Patients&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Virginity is a very private issue; saving or losing it is a matter of choice depending on&#xD;
      age, ethnicity, religion, or simply personal decision. Post-pubertal teenage girls, religious&#xD;
      women such as nuns, and women in some countries tend to be virgin. This situation must be&#xD;
      respected by medical professionals. But when a vaginal examination is necessary, virginity&#xD;
      might be a limiting factor for the gynecologist in diagnosis and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaginal discharge or bleeding is the symptom most commonly reported by adolescent girls that&#xD;
      are referred for gynecologic problems. The most common cause of vaginal discharge at these&#xD;
      ages is infection due to a hypo-estrogenized vagina, although other potential causes, such as&#xD;
      congenital anomalies of the genitalia, trauma, foreign bodies, sexual abuse, and malignant&#xD;
      disease, must also be excluded. With regard to virginity and childbearing possibility in the&#xD;
      future, a careful approach is of paramount importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hymenal tissue does not easily tolerate vigorous manipulation and wide movements. When&#xD;
      needed, potential hymeneal disruption may be discussed with mature women or with the parents&#xD;
      of adolescent girls for the sake of correct diagnosis and treatment; but in general, they are&#xD;
      highly resistant to that.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a reproductive tract examination or transvaginal operation must be arranged for a&#xD;
      virgin, the operator faces a challenge and may hesitate to utilize hysteroscopy, which can&#xD;
      result in a delayed diagnosis or improper treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common indication for hysteroscopy is abnormal vaginal bleeding in virginal patients&#xD;
      and has been widely used for uterine cavity examination and management. Although the&#xD;
      possibility of hymen preservation is high, virgins are highly resistant to this procedure.&#xD;
      This may be due to a belief that the procedure causes disruption of virginity and worries&#xD;
      associated with their future partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The approach by vaginoscopy and hysteroscopy via a hysteroscope provides a safe and&#xD;
      non-traumatic method in assessing the reproductive organs because the scope of the&#xD;
      hysteroscope is advanced into the vagina without a speculum or tenaculum. Distension of the&#xD;
      vaginal wall by distension medium can in turn provide a clear endoscopic view.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These considerations have made clinicians opt for these procedures in assessing pathologies&#xD;
      of the vagina, the surface of the cervix, the cervical canal, and the intrauterine cavity and&#xD;
      other developmental anomalies of the sex organs in patients. Furthermore, the entire&#xD;
      procedure can be undertaken without disrupting integrity of the hymen, whereas the&#xD;
      traditional method requires the use of retractors and, therefore, disrupts this integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although hysteroscopy can improve diagnosis and thereby improve quality of life, virgins may&#xD;
      decline this procedure. Patients with delayed diagnosis and management in some uncommon but&#xD;
      serious situations, such as endometrial malignancy, are life-threatening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, only a few reports have discussed the protection of hymen integrity in hysteroscopy,&#xD;
      and the physical and psychological impacts of this surgery in virgins are not conclusive&#xD;
      .This is an important issue that gynecologists encounter, but which has seldom been&#xD;
      discussed. Intravenous sedation is recommended to reduce the patient's anxiety and pain,&#xD;
      avoid vasovagal reaction, relax the buttock muscles and reduce the risk of hymenal trauma .&#xD;
      Unlike operative hysteroscope, loop electrode cannot be employed in mini-hysteroscope;&#xD;
      therefore, for some diseases like submucous leiomyoma or uterine septum, mini-hysteroscopy is&#xD;
      not therapeutically beneficial, and this should be explained to the patients in advance.&#xD;
      Adequate preoperative counseling is also necessary to emphasize the importance of the&#xD;
      procedure and to lessen their anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In virgin patients when vaginal examination cannot be done ultrasonography is a useful&#xD;
      adjunct to inspection of the external genital organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there are three accepted and more or less widely used modalities to image the&#xD;
      contents of the female pelvis. Transabdominal sonography (TAS) was the first to be used and&#xD;
      is still the most widespread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By using a full urinary bladder as an acoustic window, ovaries, uterus, and superior vagina&#xD;
      can be clearly examined using transabdominal (TA) ultrasonography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transvaginal sonography provides clear images of the region of interest, provided that the&#xD;
      targeted organ is within the focal range of the probe, and that the probe is placed in&#xD;
      proximity to the organ in question .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Agenesis of the vagina, a virginal introitus and the fear of introducing infection such as in&#xD;
      the case of premature rupture of the membranes are some of the more common situations in&#xD;
      which Transvaginal ultrasound is not possible or is relatively contraindicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In such cases introducing a commercially available vaginal probe through the anal sphincter&#xD;
      into the rectum seems to be a reasonable alternative to image the female pelvic structures&#xD;
      within 'reach' of the probe. We present a study to compare TAS and transrectal sonography&#xD;
      (TRS) in a group of patients in whom Transvaginal ultrasound was not possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transrectal sonography (TRUS) has been widely used in men as a diagnostic tool for prostate&#xD;
      cancer. Its value in the management of disorders of the lower urinary tract in women and as&#xD;
      an alternative to intraoperative gynecologic sonography has also been documented . Case&#xD;
      reports in the radiological literature attest to the fact that it has been used to guide&#xD;
      drainage of inflammatory pelvic collections.&#xD;

The pressure will be kept at 100-120 mmHg using a pressure adjustable cuff system with the aim of maintaining the lowest pressure required to distend the uterine cavity.</description>
