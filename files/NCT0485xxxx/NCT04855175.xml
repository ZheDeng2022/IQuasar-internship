    <textblock>
      Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is a common neurosurgical emergency that may arise from&#xD;
      several conditions, which cause an intracranial mass effect. In the case of conservatively&#xD;
      refractory ICP elevation, one viable treatment option is ICP-lowering surgery, i.e.,&#xD;
      decompressive craniectomy (DC) in which a large portion of the skull bone is removed and the&#xD;
      dura mater opened, creating more room for the brain tissue to expand and thus reducing the&#xD;
      ICP. A successful CP will restore the contour of the cranium, protect the brain, and ensure a&#xD;
      natural ICP, and some patients also show neurological improvement post-CP. Thus, CP has a&#xD;
      great potential for improving the patient's quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone flap resorption (BFR) implies weakening and loosening of the autologous bone flap after&#xD;
      reimplantation and is regarded as a late CP complication involving nonunion of the bone flap&#xD;
      with the surrounding bone margins and cavity formation in the flap itself, which eventually&#xD;
      necessitates removal of the bone flap and a new CP using a synthetic implant. These&#xD;
      additional operations increase costs and necessitate further hospital stays, while rendering&#xD;
      the patient vulnerable to additional complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior research performed as part of the FDA approval process has shown the ASPCI's to be a&#xD;
      safe and effective means of performing cranial reconstruction, the anticipated risks do not&#xD;
      differ from the risks faced by a patient undergoing either option as they are both currently&#xD;
      considered standards of care.&#xD;

      Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is a common neurosurgical emergency that may arise from&#xD;
      several conditions, which cause an intracranial mass effect. In the case of conservatively&#xD;
      refractory ICP elevation, one viable treatment option is ICP-lowering surgery, i.e.,&#xD;
      decompressive craniectomy (DC) in which a large portion of the skull bone is removed and the&#xD;
      dura mater opened, creating more room for the brain tissue to expand and thus reducing the&#xD;
      ICP. In many centers, the bone flap removed in DC is customarily kept deep frozen at -70°C&#xD;
      until reimplantation during cranioplasty (CP). The cranium is repaired during CP by returning&#xD;
      the previously removed autologous bone flap or by placing an artificial implant in the defect&#xD;
      area. A successful CP will restore the contour of the cranium, protect the brain, and ensure&#xD;
      a natural ICP, and some patients also show neurological improvement post-CP1-4. Thus, CP has&#xD;
      a great potential for improving the patient's quality of life. Although widely regarded as a&#xD;
      routine operation, CP often involves serious complications, such as postoperative&#xD;
      hemorrhages, surgical site infection (SSI), and, most importantly, resorption of the&#xD;
      autologous bone flap5-8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone flap resorption (BFR) implies weakening and loosening of the autologous bone flap after&#xD;
      reimplantation and is regarded as a late CP complication involving nonunion of the bone flap&#xD;
      with the surrounding bone margins and cavity formation in the flap itself, which eventually&#xD;
      necessitates removal of the bone flap and a new CP using a synthetic implant. These&#xD;
      additional operations increase costs and necessitate further hospital stays, while rendering&#xD;
      the patient vulnerable to additional complications. The reported prevalence of BFR with&#xD;
      autologous CPs has varied significantly, from 1.4% to 32.0%, with infection rates ranging&#xD;
      from 4.6% to 16.4%9-12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CP is a common procedure for cranial reconstruction in the setting of trauma, stroke, skull&#xD;
      neoplasm, osteomyelitis, or after procedures that are approached via craniectomy such as&#xD;
      microvascular decompression or acoustic neuroma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently there have been two major areas of interest presenting in the literature. First,&#xD;
      there have been at least 6 manuscripts published on retrospective data comparing autologous&#xD;
      bone versus synthetic prosthetic for CP13-18. Each has shown benefit for synthetic&#xD;
      prosthetics. However, the community is resistant to implement a treatment pattern where&#xD;
      synthetic bone is a &quot;first line&quot; choice for CP. Therefore, a prospective randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial is needed to understand with high confidence the option that is most&#xD;
      beneficial for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior research performed as part of the FDA approval process has shown the ASPCI's to be a&#xD;
      safe and effective means of performing cranial reconstruction, the anticipated risks do not&#xD;
      differ from the risks faced by a patient undergoing either option as they are both currently&#xD;
      considered standards of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the overall patient outcomes of cranial reconstruction surgery using&#xD;
      native bone autograft as compared to using synthetic bone allograft.&#xD;
