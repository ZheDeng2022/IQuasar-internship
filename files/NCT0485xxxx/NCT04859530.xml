  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer remains a major public health challenge in low- and middle-income countries&#xD;
      (LMICs) due to financial and logistical issues. The World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
      recommendation for cervical cancer screening in LMICs includes Human Papillomavirus (HPV)&#xD;
      testing as primary screening followed by visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and&#xD;
      treatment. However, VIA is a subjective procedure dependent on the healthcare provider's&#xD;
      experience. Therefore, an objective approach based on quantitative diagnostic algorithms is&#xD;
      desirable to improve performance of VIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this objective and in a collaboration between the Gynecology and Obstetrics Department&#xD;
      of the Geneva University Hospital (HUG) and the Swiss Institute of Technology (EPFL), our&#xD;
      group started the development of an automated smartphone-based image classification device&#xD;
      called AVC (for Automatic VIA Classifier). Two-minute videos of the cervix are recorded&#xD;
      during VIA and classified using an artificial neural network (ANN) and image processing&#xD;
      techniques to differentiate precancer and cancer from non-neoplastic cervical tissue. The&#xD;
      result is displayed on the smartphone screen with a delimitation map of the lesions when&#xD;
      appropriate. The key feature used for classification is the dynamic of cervical&#xD;
      acetowhitening during the 120 second following the application of acetic acid. Precancerous&#xD;
      and cancerous cells whiten more rapidly than non-cancerous ones and their whiteness persists&#xD;
      stronger overtime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim is to assess the diagnostic performance of the AVC and to compare it with the&#xD;
      performance of current triage tests (VIA and cytology). Histopathological examination will&#xD;
      serve as reference standard. Participants' and providers' acceptability will also be&#xD;
      considered as part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be nested in an ongoing cervical cancer screening program called &quot;3T-approach&quot;&#xD;
      (for Test, Triage and Treat) which includes HPV self-sampling for women aged 30 to 49 years,&#xD;
      followed by VIA triage and treatment if needed. The AVC will be evaluated in this context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study's risk category is A according to swiss ethical guidelines. This decision is based&#xD;
      on the fact that the planned measures for sampling biological material or collecting personal&#xD;
      data entail only minimal risks and burdens.&#xD;
