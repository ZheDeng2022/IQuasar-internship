  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been reported that better local control is achieved and sphincters are preserved at a&#xD;
      higher rate with curative resections performed after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced rectal cancers. In addition, it has been reported that local&#xD;
      recurrence is reduced and survival is prolonged in patients with complete pathological&#xD;
      response to neoadjuvant therapy. Therefore, the importance of predicting patients with&#xD;
      pathological complete response has increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been reported that data obtained from PET-CT scans and clinical information such as&#xD;
      tumor size, T stage, and N stage may be useful in predicting the response to neoadjuvant&#xD;
      therapy in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consideration of blood biomarkers in predicting neoadjuvant response can be a very attractive&#xD;
      option. Because samples are easily collected, relatively inexpensive to measure, and contain&#xD;
      information about different aspects of tumor biology. There are a limited number of blood&#xD;
      biomarkers such as CEA and IL-6 that have been studied in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental studies show that vitamin D suppresses inflammation and protects against cancer&#xD;
      by triggering differentiation. In 1980, Cedric and Frank Garland stated for the first time&#xD;
      that vitamin D may affect the survival of the patient after the diagnosis of colorectal&#xD;
      cancer. In later studies, a positive relationship was reported between the serum level of&#xD;
      25-hydroxyvitamin D - 25 (OH) D and survival rates for colorectal cancer, breast and prostate&#xD;
      cancer. In addition, 25 (OH) D serum concentration has been shown to be inversely related to&#xD;
      colorectal cancer progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the light of all these information, the role of serum vitamin D levels before neoadjuvant&#xD;
      treatment in predicting pathological response in patients with rectal cancer is investigated&#xD;
      in this study.&#xD;
