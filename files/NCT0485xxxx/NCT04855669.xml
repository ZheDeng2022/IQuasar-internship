      The investigators aimed to evaluate the impact of embryo distance from fundal endometrium,&#xD;
      measured 60 minutes after transabdominal ultrasound guided embryo transfer(ET), on clinical&#xD;
      pregnancy rates(CPR) and live birth rates(LBR) in fresh oocyte donation(OD) cycles.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Embryos were considered to be staying at the initial expulsion site for long years. However,&#xD;
      in 1976 Edwards and Steptoe reported a tubal ectopic pregnancy after in vitro fertilization&#xD;
      (IVF) with a day-3 embryo transfer, which may be accepted as the earliest evidence for&#xD;
      migration of embryos from the cavity. The migration concept is very recently taken into&#xD;
      consideration by few authors, with studies on fresh IVF and frozen ET cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oocyte donation (OD) is a method of ART, in which by using young oocytes from donors the&#xD;
      embryo quality is optimized. OD cycles have high LBRs, and are the choice of treatment in&#xD;
      advanced reproductive age, repeated IVF failure, premature ovarian insufficiency(POI) and&#xD;
      particular heritable genetic diseases. Donor oocytes can be used as fresh or&#xD;
      cryoprotected-thawed, where fresh oocytes have higher LBRs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, there are no studies performed in fresh OD cycles about air bubble and&#xD;
      fundus distance after ET, and there are no studies performed whether there is any embryo&#xD;
      migration after 60 minutes of ET and its effects on CPR and LBR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators conducted this study to evaluate the impact of embryo distance&#xD;
      from fundal endometrium, measured 60 minutes after transabdominal USG guided ET, on CPR and&#xD;
      LBR in fresh OD cycles. In literature, this study is first to focus on embryo migration and&#xD;
      LBR in fresh OD cycles.&#xD;
