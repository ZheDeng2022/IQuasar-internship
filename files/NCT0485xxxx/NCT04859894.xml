    <textblock>
      The physiological derangements in subjects suffering from long-term symptoms following a&#xD;
      Covid-19 infection (Post-COVID-19 Syndrome) are poorly understood and evaluated. This study&#xD;
      will recruit subjects with a clinical diagnosis of Post-Covid-19-syndrome) who are scheduled&#xD;
      for either of lung function testing, cardiopulmonary exercise testing or cardiac ultrasound.&#xD;
      Patients' symptoms will be correlated to physiological measures and compared to predicted&#xD;
      values. In addition, in 20 patients, symptoms and physiological measures will be correlated&#xD;
      to epigenetical alterations, or DNA-methylation patterns. In addition, a subset of patients&#xD;
      will be examined a year after the baseline testing in order to follow the progress of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

      The physiological derangements in subjects suffering from long-term symptoms following a&#xD;
      Covid-19 infection (Post-COVID-19 Syndrome) are poorly understood and evaluated. For example,&#xD;
      the extent to which subjective symptoms correlate with physiological impairments are not&#xD;
      known.&#xD;
