  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Phase I trial is planned to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of MBS8(1V270) in subjects with advanced solid tumours. The trial is&#xD;
      designed to provide data for further clinical development of MBS8(1V270)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, single arm, multinational, multicenter Phase I trial in&#xD;
      subjects with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial consists of two stages: Stage I is a dose escalation stage which will include up to&#xD;
      eight cohorts with escalating doses of MBS8(1V270) to establish the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Stage II is an expansion phase in which safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of MBS8(1V270) will be assessed at the recommended phase 2 dose established&#xD;
      in Stage I of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose-escalation in stage 1 is based on the 1+2 design for the first cohort and on the 3+3&#xD;
      design for the following cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational medicinal product is a TLR7 agonist and will be administered&#xD;
      intravenously by infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be treated in cycles of 42 days. A treatment cycle consists of four MBS8(1V270)&#xD;
      infusions administered Days 1, 8, 15, and 22, followed by a treatment pause of 21 days. The&#xD;
      time period covering the first 4 doses of MBS8(1V270) plus one day will represent the&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period (23 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma cytokine levels will be assessed, and tumor biopsies will be taken and evaluated.&#xD;
      Radiological tumor assessment by MRI or CT will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be evaluated by the incidence of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events&#xD;
      (SAEs), DLTs, and use of concomitant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-tumor activity of MBS8(1V270) will be evaluated via imaging using RECIST and iRECIST&#xD;
      criteria, with iRECIST being the leading tumor evaluation criteria.&#xD;
