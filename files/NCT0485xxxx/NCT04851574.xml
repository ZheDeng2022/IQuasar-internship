  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of&#xD;
      rocuronium and sugammadex and their clinical effect in the terms of both the relaxation of&#xD;
      paralysed muscles (rocuronium) and the reversal of neuromuscular blockade (sugammadex) in&#xD;
      children over 2 years of age undergoing general anesthesia for surgical procedures needing&#xD;
      muscle relaxation for more than 30 minutes.&#xD;

      The study group was divided into three subgroups depending on the different doses of&#xD;
      sugammadex. Group I received dose of 0.5 Mg/kg, Group II - 1.0 Mg/kg and Group III received&#xD;
      dose of 2 Mg/kg of sugammadex. General anesthesia was performed among all included patients&#xD;
      at the same way. During general anesthesia monitoring of TOF - Train-of-four, was used to&#xD;
      assess the muscle relaxation force of rocuronium as well as the reversal of neuromuscular&#xD;
      blockade by sugammadex. For this purpose, 1.5 ml of blood samples taken 8 times, were&#xD;
      collected to determine the PKPD of the tested drugs, according to own protocol.&#xD;
