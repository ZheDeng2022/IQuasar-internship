  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vestibular schwannomas are benign lesions of the ponto-cerebellar angle that are potentially&#xD;
      dangerous because of their growth in a cramped space and the compressive phenomena they can&#xD;
      cause. Stereotactic Gammaknife radiosurgery is a treatment option that can be offered for&#xD;
      evolutive schwannomas smaller than 2.5-3 cm in size. It allows tumor stabilisation in 85% of&#xD;
      cases with less than 1% facial nerve damage risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are controversial results regarding hearing preservation : percentages vary between 25&#xD;
      and 80% in the literature, depending on the criteria used and the post-treatment delay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies have investigated changes in vestibular function and the impact on balance of&#xD;
      radiosurgery, and their results are variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These controversial results lead us to comprehensively assess the vestibular function and&#xD;
      balance of these patients using a balance-specific quality of life questionnaire, in addition&#xD;
      to objective overall vestibular assessments of vestibular function.&#xD;

      Vestibular schwannomas are benign lesions of the ponto-cerebellar angle that are potentially&#xD;
      dangerous because of their growth in a cramped space and the compressive phenomena they can&#xD;
      cause. Stereotactic Gammaknife radiosurgery is a treatment option that can be offered for&#xD;
      evolutive schwannomas smaller than 2.5-3 cm in size. It allows tumor stabilisation in 85% of&#xD;
      cases with less than 1% facial nerve damage risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are controversial results regarding hearing preservation : percentages vary between 25&#xD;
      and 80% in the literature, depending on the criteria used and the post-treatment delay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies have investigated changes in vestibular function and the impact on balance of&#xD;
      radiosurgery.Their results are heterogeneous, on one hand, indicating little worsening of&#xD;
      symptoms, or even improvement in some studies. On the other hand, a 2017 study reported&#xD;
      symptomatic worsening of caloric response deficits in 17.6% of cases. Vestibular function at&#xD;
      high frequencies or for otolithic organs (utricle and saccule) has hardly ever been explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The largest cohort, reported in &quot;gammaknife radiosurgery for vestibular schwannomas a quality&#xD;
      of life evaluation&quot; concerns 353 patients and shows that the overall quality of life of the&#xD;
      patients treated is on average comparable to that of the general population but that the&#xD;
      vertigo is more frequent in this population, with a more marked impact on the overall quality&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These controversial results lead us to comprehensively assess the vestibular function and&#xD;
      balance of these patients using a balance-specific quality of life questionnaire, in addition&#xD;
      to objective overall vestibular assessments of vestibular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the present study aims to assess the quality of balance of patients treated with&#xD;
      Gammaknife radiosurgery for vestibular schwannoma at 1 year and 3 years after treatment.&#xD;
