      The research objective of the UNITE Study is to assess the potential efficacy of ultrasound&#xD;
      application to the spleen using a small wearable ultrasound system in the treatment of&#xD;
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the efficacy of splenic ultrasound with a new wearable device in affecting&#xD;
           markers of systemic inflammation in COVID-19 infection between an ultrasound group&#xD;
           versus a control group; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the potential efficacy of splenic ultrasound with this new wearable device in&#xD;
           affecting clinical outcomes in COVID-19 infection in the ultrasound group compared to a&#xD;
           control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound is widely used in human medicine because it is safe, non-invasive, and painless.&#xD;
      The same kind of ultrasound that is used for imaging (for example, to visualize babies in&#xD;
      utero) may be able to treat inflammatory diseases including COVID-19. COVID-19 is a disease&#xD;
      caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Some COVID-19 patients develop a severe&#xD;
      respiratory disease called acute respiratory distress syndrome and this disease is caused, in&#xD;
      part, by a significant increase in inflammatory factors. Clinical therapies that reduce this&#xD;
      elevated inflammation in the body (e.g., inflammation molecules in your body called&#xD;
      cytokines) may be capable of diminishing symptoms in severe cases of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple studies in animals with hyper-inflammation conditions (e.g., inflammatory arthritis&#xD;
      and sepsis/LPS injections) and recent human studies (e.g., for the treatment of joint&#xD;
      inflammation in Rheumatoid Arthritis) have shown that ultrasound applied to the spleen can&#xD;
      suppress blood/genetic markers of inflammation. Similar inflammatory markers, or cytokines,&#xD;
      are elevated in the lungs of COVID-19 patients and believed to cause severe symptoms. Splenic&#xD;
      ultrasound can potentially lower these inflammatory cytokines without hindering antibody&#xD;
      production, leading to clinical improvements in COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will employ investigational ultrasound devices produced by SecondWave Systems&#xD;
      called the MINI (Miniature Immunotherapy and Neuromodulation Instrument).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two groups in this study with 29 participants in each group. One group will&#xD;
      receive ultrasound application to the spleen, in addition to the standard clinical care. A&#xD;
      control group will receive standard clinical care without splenic ultrasound. Each ultrasound&#xD;
      application session will last about 30 minutes per day for 7 days, unless the participant is&#xD;
      discharged sooner. For ultrasound stimulation, a small wearable ultrasound device is&#xD;
      positioned on the upper left abdomen area over the ribs. The ultrasound session on the first&#xD;
      study day includes a period of 5-10 minutes when study personnel use an ultrasound imaging&#xD;
      device to locate the spleen and to position the wearable MINI device in a proper location&#xD;
      around the ribs area. Daily stimulation consists of an approximately 18-minute period for&#xD;
      application of ultrasound to the spleen. Collection of clinical outcome data and daily blood&#xD;
      draws will be performed in each participant throughout the study through Day 8. Additional&#xD;
      data collected from each participant during their routine clinical care beyond their study&#xD;
      involvement will also be analyzed together with the study data to evaluate the specific aims&#xD;
      of the clinical trial.&#xD;
