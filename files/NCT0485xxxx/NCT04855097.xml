  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diuretic therapy is first-line treatment for acute decompensated heart failure. However,&#xD;
      accurate assessment and management of patient blood volume is challenged by the limitations&#xD;
      of physical exam and surrogate markers for blood volume. The study primary objective is to&#xD;
      determine if goal-directed care as quantified by direct Blood Volume Analysis (Daxor&#xD;
      BVA-100â„¢) in addition to usual care results in more appropriate treatment and consistent&#xD;
      achievement of euvolemia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 6 million Americans suffer from heart failure, one of the most prevalent and deadly&#xD;
      diseases in the United States. High rates of rehospitalization and mortality and treatment&#xD;
      costs have persisted for decades despite advances in care. Clinical guidelines recommend&#xD;
      assessment of blood volume and clinical management to euvolemia or normal blood volume, but&#xD;
      standard methods of diagnosing blood volume status have been shown to be unreliable. Blood&#xD;
      Volume Analysis (Daxor BVA-100) is based on the gold standard indicator dilution technique.&#xD;
      BVA has been used to quantify otherwise undiagnosed blood volume derangements and guide&#xD;
      treatment in heart failure and other indications. Also, retrospective analyses have shown&#xD;
      that care of heart failure patients guided by BVA is associated with improved rates of&#xD;
      rehospitalization and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is a prospective, two-center, parallel design, interventional,&#xD;
      single-blinded pilot study of the potential for BVA to positively impact the treatment&#xD;
      decisions of ADHF clinicians.&#xD;

    <description>The BVA-100 is a medical device that calculates human blood volume using the method of tracer dilution. The device utilizes a tracer of human serum albumin tagged with iodine-131 to measure injected intravascularly and a series of timed blood draws. The amount of tracer in each blood draw is used to calculate the unknown blood volume. Data inputs come from the measured characteristics of subject blood samples (hematocrit and tracer concentration) and tracer calibration standards. The package also calculates the subject expected (or ideal) blood volume from physical parameters. Hyper- or hypovolemia, associated red blood cell volumes, and tracer transudation rate are reported, with statistics showing the quality of the results.</description>
