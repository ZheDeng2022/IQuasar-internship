  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A school-based, prospective, cohort study was conducted to evaluate the epidemiology of P.&#xD;
      falciparum (Pf) infections in school-age children and determine the impact of the&#xD;
      screen-and-treat approach on Pf infection and anemia prevalence among students in two&#xD;
      different transmission settings. Investigators aimed to evaluate how frequently malaria rapid&#xD;
      diagnostic tests (mRDTs) fail to detect low-parasite-density infections as well as whether&#xD;
      low-density infections contribute to the burden and health consequences of Pf infection in&#xD;
      school-age children and whether they contain gametocytes, the parasite stage required for&#xD;
      transmission from humans to mosquitos.&#xD;

      Students were enrolled in four schools in southern Malawi in the rainy (March-May) and dry&#xD;
      season (Sept-Nov) of 2015. 15 students per grade-level (grades 1-8), were invited to&#xD;
      participate. Following enrollment, students were evaluated at baseline for&#xD;
      screening-and-treatment, and followed-up 1, 2 and 6 weeks later. At each follow-up visit, a&#xD;
      blood sample was obtained for microscopy and molecular detection of parasites and students&#xD;
      were interviewed about bed net use the night prior, current or recent illness, and use of&#xD;
      antimalarial treatment. At the final visit, a mRDT and hemoglobin test were repeated, and&#xD;
      parents were interviewed and portable medical records (&quot;health passports&quot;) were reviewed to&#xD;
      identify intercurrent fever or malaria treatment.&#xD;
