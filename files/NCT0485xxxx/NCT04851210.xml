      The biological study involves the collection of samples from male and female patients&#xD;
      (intraoperative waste tissue, blood and synovial fluid), suffering from mild and&#xD;
      moderate-severe OA, who undergo endo or arthro-prosthesis surgery, or arthroplasty, for the&#xD;
      identification and characterization of a panel of &quot;gender-specific&quot; miRNAs. MicroRNAs will be&#xD;
      extracted from the samples (chondrocytes, synoviocytes, osteoblasts and plasma) and will be&#xD;
      molecularly characterized in order to identify a panel of miRNAs differently expressed&#xD;
      according to the gender and severity of OA. The lymphocyte and phenotypically and&#xD;
      functionally characterized populations will be isolated from the corpuscular component and&#xD;
      the synovial fluid, in order to evaluate a possible gender-specific difference in the&#xD;
      progression of OA-dependent inflammation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative joint disease of considerable socio-economic&#xD;
      impact, of which a primary and a secondary form are distinguished. Primary OA is a mild form&#xD;
      that occurs mainly in the joints of the hands, feet, knee, and hip, and appears in young&#xD;
      subjects. Secondary OA derives from different factors that modify the microenvironment of the&#xD;
      cartilage such as trauma, congenital joint deformities, metabolic defects, infections that&#xD;
      cause post-infectious arthritis, endocrine and neuropathic diseases and disorders that alter&#xD;
      the normal structure and function of hyaline cartilage (eg . rheumatoid arthritis, gout,&#xD;
      chondrocalcinosis), and is more prevalent in old age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As regards the secondary form of OA, correlated with advancing age due to the natural aging&#xD;
      process of the joint and to events of a traumatic nature, it is hypothesized that a key role&#xD;
      in the etiology and progression of the disease may be played by the genre. Immune responses&#xD;
      are known to differ in males and females. Some meta-analyzes reveal how the presence of some&#xD;
      polymorphisms (ADAM12) in male patients predispose to the development of OA more than in&#xD;
      women, especially in the knee joint. Furthermore, new molecular evidence suggests that in&#xD;
      patients with OA there is a gender-specific activation of PI3K-AKT and hypoxia signaling,&#xD;
      suggesting the presence of possible gender-specific protein factors that may modulate bone&#xD;
      metabolism and disease progression. In this regard, studies evaluating the responses of joint&#xD;
      chondrocytes to systemic factors suggest that there are differences in the biochemical and&#xD;
      molecular characteristics of male and female cells, without prejudice to the fundamental role&#xD;
      of hormones in the different gender-specific response to the development and progression of&#xD;
      pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is widely known that the regulation of bone remodeling processes is entrusted to a&#xD;
      hormonal mechanism, which mainly involves parathyroid hormone, vitamin D and calcitonin.&#xD;
      Other hormone regulators involved are sex hormones (estrogen, testosterone), thyroid&#xD;
      hormones, corticosteroids (including cortisone), insulin, and growth factors (including&#xD;
      growth hormone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the development of OA it is thought that sex hormones may act in a prevalent way. In women&#xD;
      of childbearing age, estrogen has a protective action on the bone, inhibiting bone&#xD;
      remodeling, especially bone resorption; while in the post-menopausal period, circulating&#xD;
      estrogens are reduced compared to testosterone, strongly contributing to an imbalance in bone&#xD;
      remodeling, favoring the stiffening of the subchondral bone and the development of&#xD;
      osteophytes at the joint margins. The osteophytes seem to be developed in an attempt to&#xD;
      stabilize the joint damage. Consequently, the synovial membrane becomes inflamed and&#xD;
      thickened, producing synovial fluid with less viscosity and in greater quantities and&#xD;
      favoring the development of an inflammatory process on site. Obviously, the entire joint will&#xD;
      be damaged up to the reduction of joint mobility and ankylosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly men, even if they do not undergo a real andropause, starting from 45 years of age&#xD;
      they suffer a progressive decline in the production and release of testosterone, whose levels&#xD;
      after the age of 65 are no longer sufficient to maintain good efficiency of the bone tissue&#xD;
      favoring its resorption and the possible onset of the pathology. However, it is not known&#xD;
      whether the potential differences related to gender, in terms of hormonal release and&#xD;
      alteration of bone homeostasis, may be related to the severity of the disease, that is to the&#xD;
      development of the inflammatory condition associated with it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore necessary to highlight another characteristic of OA, both in terms of&#xD;
      development and progression, namely the different inflammatory response based on the&#xD;
      patient's gender. In OA, as with other inflammatory diseases, the response of the male immune&#xD;
      system induced by inflammation of the synovium and synovial fluid is different than in the&#xD;
      female counterpart, suggesting that there could be differences between the two sexes in the&#xD;
      levels of immunomodulators in joint tissues, including the synovial membrane, synovial fluid&#xD;
      and cartilage itself. Recent studies attribute to the inflammatory microenvironment a key&#xD;
      role in the prognosis of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the investigators obtained evidences regarding the role of microRNAs and lncRNAs as&#xD;
      biomarkers of bone regeneration, directly involving specific cellular signalings (hypoxia,&#xD;
      epithelium-mesenchyma transition and mechano-transduction), and representing, in some cases,&#xD;
      a crucial point for the development of orthopedic diseases, such as osteoporosis, OA and&#xD;
      forms of degeneration of the intervertebral discs. From an ongoing screening on tissue&#xD;
      (joint) miRNA and lncRNA differently expressed and which could play a key role in the process&#xD;
      of osseointegration of the prosthetic implant, miR-31-5p, miR-33a-5p, miR-133a, miR-675-5p&#xD;
      and lncH19 were also evaluated. The correlation analysis between their expression profile and&#xD;
      the patient's gender show a different expression of some of them and a gender-specific&#xD;
      response on target genes and signaling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is that there are gender differences that contribute to the&#xD;
      increase in the incidence and severity of OA, both in molecular terms (qualitative and&#xD;
      quantitative differences in miRNAs involved in transcriptional and translational gene&#xD;
      regulation) and inflammatory, such as differences in the development and progression of the&#xD;
      lymphocyte population, involved in the OA-related inflammatory response. Therefore, the study&#xD;
      aims to identify, characterize and evaluate an expression panel of tissue and circulating&#xD;
      miRNAs isolated from patients with both mild and moderate-severe OA, who undergo prosthetic&#xD;
      surgery, so as to be able to define possible gender-specific biomarkers of disease&#xD;
      progression useful for controlling the osteointegration process of the prosthetic implant,&#xD;
      and to be correlated with the pre- and post-operative inflammatory response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biological study involves the collection of samples from patients of both sexes suffering&#xD;
      from OA, be it mild or moderate-severe, who undergo endo or arthro-prosthesis surgery, or&#xD;
      arthroscopy. In particular, the following samples will be collected: 1) cells, such as&#xD;
      synoviocytes, osteoblasts and chondrocytes deriving from operating waste tissues; 2) synovial&#xD;
      fluid isolated during the operation; and 3) peripheral blood, from which to isolate the&#xD;
      plasma and the lymphocyte component, taken 24 hours before surgery, and 72 hours and 1 month&#xD;
      after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The miRNAs will be isolated from the samples isolated from tissues and plasma and will be&#xD;
      molecularly characterized in order to identify a panel (also built starting from information&#xD;
      obtained from the literature) expressed on the basis of the gender and severity of OA. The&#xD;
      identified miRNAs will be validated, in vitro, using a specific molecular approach. The&#xD;
      lymphocyte component of the blood and, isolated by means of special separation protocols&#xD;
      through cell-specific magnetic beads, will be phenotypically characterized by a flow&#xD;
      cytometric approach. The lymphocyte populations that will show a different phenotype between&#xD;
      the male and female gender in correlation with the aggressiveness of the disease, will be&#xD;
      analyzed and monitored over time up to 1 month of follow-up together with the analysis of&#xD;
      synovial fluids, through in vitro studies of cytokine release and ELISA assays.&#xD;
