      Aim to investigate the efficacy of follitropin alpha biosimilar therapy (Primapur速) in&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A retrospective observational anonymized cohort study of follitropin alpha biosimilar&#xD;
      (Primapur速) as a pre-filled pen injector with a dose adjustment of 5 IU, aimed to investigate&#xD;
      its efficacy and safety in a nonselected population with indications to assisted reproductive&#xD;
      technologies (ART) was carried out. The ovarian stimulation (OS) protocols included:&#xD;
&#xD;
      monotherapy protocols with using only Primapur速; mixed protocols (recombinant and&#xD;
      urinary-derived gonadotropins); short protocols with using antagonists of&#xD;
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and long protocols with GnRH agonists. The stimulation&#xD;
      protocols were analyzed with Primapur速 application for at least 5 days.&#xD;

    <limitations_and_caveats>The real-world patient data analysed in this study were representative, showing the ability of follitropin biosimilars to develop both folliculogenesis and clinical pregnancy in a nonselected population. Additional comparative studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of the biosimilars in patients with classified types of infertility causes, including unexplained infertility.</limitations_and_caveats>
