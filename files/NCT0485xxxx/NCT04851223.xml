  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are an estimate 7 million people in the United Kingdom living with pre-diabetes. The&#xD;
      increasing number of new cases of pre-diabetes presents a global health concern due to&#xD;
      funding implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The progression from pre-diabetes to overt type 2 diabetes is often characterised by a&#xD;
      reduction in insulin secretion (or β-cell dysfunction). Whilst inflammation may contribute to&#xD;
      β-cell dysfunction, a complete picture is still lacking. The proposed research will help&#xD;
      develop a more complete understanding of the molecules that may trigger β-cell failure, a&#xD;
      process that often connects pre-diabetes to overt diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this project are;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Run large-scale proteomics and metabolomics analysis in pre-diabetic individuals to&#xD;
           determine possible biomarker molecules.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Use measures and / or classifications of insulin resistance and diabetes (i.e. β-cell&#xD;
           function and Disposition Index) to establish whether particular metabolic and / or&#xD;
           proteomic signatures (aim 1) are associated with the development of pre-diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine if the possible metabolite or protein profile changes are associated with&#xD;
           the progression or regression of pre-diabetes from baseline (0 month) to the end of the&#xD;
           National Diabetes Prevention Programme (NDPP) (9 month).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex metabolic disease characterised by elevated&#xD;
      blood sugar. This represents a worldwide concern due to the secondary complications&#xD;
      associated with type 2 diabetes, which are considered an important cause of early death;&#xD;
      particularly, given the predicted increase. The cost associated with the treatment and the&#xD;
      complications associated with diabetes reaches £10 billion every year and it is expected to&#xD;
      increase. From approximately 425 million (2017) it is projected that 629 million adults will&#xD;
      be living with diabetes by 2045. Therefore, this matter requires effective interventions&#xD;
      aimed at improving blood sugar control, reducing the burden on the economy while improving&#xD;
      the quality of life among T2DMs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin, a hormone that is allowing the body to use or store sugar derived from food, is&#xD;
      manufactured by the β-cells in the pancreas. The progression from pre-diabetes to overt type&#xD;
      2 diabetes is typically diagnosed at the point of β-cell failure. Several factors are known&#xD;
      to contribute to β-cell dysfunction such as: obesity (especially abdominal obesity), high&#xD;
      blood pressure and elevated fats in the blood. Around 80% of the people who have been&#xD;
      diagnosed with T2DM are either obese or overweight and they have been observed to have&#xD;
      increased levels of fatty acids in the blood following a meal, which can induce insulin&#xD;
      resistance. High levels of fatty acids have also been associated with an increased production&#xD;
      of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are small proteins that have an effect on organs or&#xD;
      other cells, contributing to chronic inflammation. High levels of chronic inflammation&#xD;
      increase the chances of developing metabolic disorders such as T2DM. However, a complete&#xD;
      picture of this process is still lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will help develop a more complete understanding of the molecules that may&#xD;
      trigger β-cell failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The identification of these molecules that are implicated in β-cell failure, can lead to the&#xD;
      development of targeted interventions for those at risk of developing type 2 diabetes and&#xD;
      potentially preventing habitual hyperglycaemia and type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
