  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vaginal dysbiosis is a common condition among women. Vaginal dysbiosis covers imbalances in&#xD;
      the vaginal flora, caused by the composition of microbes, bacteria, viruses and fungi.&#xD;
      Dysbiosis occurs in about 16% of all women in Denmark. A large proportion of women who have&#xD;
      vaginal dysbiosis do not experience any symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, vaginal dysbiosis can present challenges in several contexts, including a higher&#xD;
      tendency for bacterial infections in the female genitals, lower chances of pregnancy in women&#xD;
      undergoing fertility treatment, just as it can predispose to premature birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is aimed at women aged 18-40, who wants to participate in a study to investigate&#xD;
      whether, by transplanting vaginal secretion from one woman with a normal vaginal bacterial&#xD;
      flora to another woman with an imbalance in the vaginal bacterial flora (called vaginal&#xD;
      dysbiosis), can establish a normal vaginal bacterial flora in the recipient of the&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also explore weather genetic, immunological, hormonal, metabolic, health&#xD;
      behaviors and clinical factors have significance on whether a normal vaginal flora is&#xD;
      achieved after transplantation.&#xD;
