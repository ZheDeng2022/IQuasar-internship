  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is the pimary surgical treatment of CRS,&#xD;
      characterized with the preservation of nasal structure and function.But the control of&#xD;
      disease by surgery has been unsatisfactory. Recent studies have shown that patients with&#xD;
      recurrent CRSwNP (usually with severe eosinophilic inflammation), more radical surgery may be&#xD;
      more effective. The purpose of this prospective and randomized study is to determine the&#xD;
      effect of endoscopic sinus surgery for extensive mucosal removal in patients with&#xD;
      eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitus with nasal polyps.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is a multifactorial inflammatory disorder&#xD;
      that causes various symptoms including nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, olfactory dysfunction,&#xD;
      facial pain, and headache. Patients with significant eosinophilic inflammation usually&#xD;
      accompanied with a higher recurrence rate and more severe clinical symptoms. Endoscopic sinus&#xD;
      surgery (ESS) is recommended to patients who do not response well to conservative treatments.&#xD;
      A retrospective study showed that postoperative polyp recurrence rate of patients with severe&#xD;
      eosinophilic inflammation was significantly reduced by rebooting sinus mucosa. In this study,&#xD;
      the experimental group intends to adopt a modified radical surger to remove the mucosa&#xD;
      including ethmoid sinus and maxillary sinus, as well as a completly middle turbinate&#xD;
      resection to achieve a extensive treatment of ethmoid sinus. Antrostomies of frontal and&#xD;
      sphenoid sinuses were then performed with meticulous operation and preserve the mucosa&#xD;
      intactly.&#xD;

    <description>The SNOT-22 is a validated questionnaire that was used to assess the impact of chronic rhinosinusitis on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). It is a 22 item questionnaire with each item assigned a score ranging from 0 (no problem) to 5 (problem as bad as it can be). The total score may range from 0 (no disease) to 110 (worst disease), lower scores representing better health related quality of life.</description>

    <description>Recurrence was defined if the patient had symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis after surgery, and nasal endoscopy found nasal polyps recurrence, obvious edema of mucosa, or purulent secretion, and above of symptoms or physical signs existed, which can't be alleviated by maximum medicine treatment at least 1 month</description>

    <time_frame>1month, 3month, 6month, 12month</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS for rhinosinusitis was used to evaluate the total disease severity. The participants were asked to indicate on a 10 centimeters (cm) VAS the answer to the question, &quot;How troublesome are your symptoms of your rhinosinusitis?&quot; The range of the VAS was from 0 (not troublesome) to 10 (worse thinkable troublesome), where higher score indicated worse thinkable troublesome.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline at months 1, 3, 6 and 12 in nasal endoscopic score after surgical intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>1month, 3month, 6month, 12month</time_frame>
    <description>Endoscopic result is scored according to Lund-Kennedy system, with the assessment of nasal polyp (NP), edema, nasal discharge, scarring and crusting. Items including edema, nasal discharge, scarring and crusting score 0 for no problem, 1 for mild abnormalities and 2 for severe abnormalities. NP score is graded and based on NP size recorded as the sum of the right and left nostril scores with a range of 0-8; higher scores indicate worse status. Individual score ranges from 0 (no polyps) to 4 (large polyps causing almost complete congestion/ obstruction of the inferior meatus) within each nostril.</description>

    <description>Investigate the change of inflammation molecular biomarkers using sample of nasal lavage fluid or mucosal lesion tissue. Biomarkers including interleukin 9, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1β, macrophage inflammatory protein-1α, chemokine (C-C motif ) ligand 17 and IgE in nasal lavage fluid at months 1, 3, 6 and 12 were detected to compare the changes of molecular indices relative to baseline.</description>
