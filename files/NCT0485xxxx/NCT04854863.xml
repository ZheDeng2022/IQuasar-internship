  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue and exercise intolerance after survived COVID-19-infection might be related to&#xD;
      weakness of the respiratory muscles especially following invasive mechanical ventilation in&#xD;
      the Intensive Care Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the project is to measure respiratory muscle function and strength in our&#xD;
      respiratory physiology laboratory (Respiratory Physiology Laboratory, Department of&#xD;
      Pneumology and Intensive Care Medicine, Head: Professor Michael Dreher) in patients who&#xD;
      survived a severe COVID-19-infection (25 with a severe course requiring mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation in the intensive care unit, 25 with a moderate-severe course requiring&#xD;
      administration of supplemental oxygen only, respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this data the aim is to develop a model which determines the severity,&#xD;
      pathophysiology and clinical consequences of respiratory muscle dysfunction in patients who&#xD;
      had been hospitalised for COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will potentially prove the importance of a dedicated pulmonologic rehabilitation with&#xD;
      respiratory muscle strength training in patients who had been hospitalised for COVID-19.&#xD;

      The aim of the present project is to comprehensively measure respiratory muscle function and&#xD;
      strength in patients who survived a hospitalisation for a severe COVID-19-infection (25 with&#xD;
      a severe course requiring mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit, 25 with a&#xD;
      moderate-severe course requiring administration of supplemental oxygen only, respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to recruit 50 patients during their regular follow up appointments (12 months and&#xD;
      24 months after their discharge from the hospital) in our pulmonology outpatient-clinic.&#xD;
      Patients fulfilling the criterions of inclusion and exclusion will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo a series of measurements on one day in our respiratory physiology&#xD;
      laboratory (Respiratory Physiology Laboratory, Department of Pneumology and Intensive Care&#xD;
      Medicine, Head: Professor Michael Dreher). Patients will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      questionnaire, followed by some examinations comprising spirometry by bodyplethysmography,&#xD;
      exercise endurance, capillary blood gas analyses, measurement of maximum inspiratory and&#xD;
      expiratory mouth pressures, dynamometric measurement of arm and leg strength, diaphragm&#xD;
      ultrasound, magnetic stimulation of the phrenic and lower thoracic nerves with invasive&#xD;
      recording of twitch transdiaphragmatic pressure and markers of systemic inflammation based on&#xD;
      in depth analyses of blood samples that will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this data the aim is to develop a model which determines the severity,&#xD;
      pathophysiology and clinical consequences of respiratory muscle dysfunction in patients who&#xD;
      had been hospitalised for COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will potentially prove the importance of a dedicated pulmonologic rehabilitation with&#xD;
      respiratory muscle strength training in patients who had been hospitalised for COVID-19.&#xD;
