  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is an opportunistic fungal infection of&#xD;
      immunocompromised hosts which causes in significant morbidity and mortality. The current&#xD;
      standard of care, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) at a dose of 15-20 mg/kg/day of&#xD;
      TMP, is associated with serious adverse events, including hypersensitivity reactions,&#xD;
      drug-induced liver injury, cytopenia, and renal failure occurring among 20-60% of patients.&#xD;
      The frequency of adverse events increases in a dose dependent manner and commonly limits the&#xD;
      use of TMP-SMX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduced treatment doses of TMP-SMX for PJP reduced ADEs without mortality differences in a&#xD;
      recent meta-analysis of observational studies. We therefore propose a Phase III randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial to directly compare the efficacy and safety of low dose (10&#xD;
      mg/kg/day of TMP) compared to the standard-of-care (15 mg/kg/day) among patients with PJP for&#xD;
      the primary outcome of death, new mechanical ventilation, and change of treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is an opportunistic fungal infection primarily&#xD;
      affecting immunocompromised patients. Adults with HIV (particularly CD4 ≤200 cells/µL), solid&#xD;
      organ and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, as well as patients on&#xD;
      certain chemotherapies, immunosuppressant drugs, and systemic corticosteroids are at a&#xD;
      highest risk. Although routine primary prophylaxis has diminished its prevalence, PJP still&#xD;
      results in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Retrospective cohort studies have&#xD;
      reported mortality rates between 20-50% among non-HIV populations and 10-20% for patients&#xD;
      with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current guidelines from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the HIV Medicine Association&#xD;
      of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the American Society of&#xD;
      Transplantation (AST) all recommend weight-based trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) at a&#xD;
      dose of 15-20 mg/kg/day of the trimethoprim component as the standard of care. Yet, higher&#xD;
      doses of TMP-SMX are associated with serious adverse events, including hypersensitivity&#xD;
      reactions, drug-induced liver injury, cytopenia, and renal failure with adverse drug events&#xD;
      (ADEs) reported among 20-60% of patients on treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better inform the optimal dosing strategy for PJP therapy, we recently performed a&#xD;
      systematic review and meta-analysis of reduced dose regimens of TMP-SMX in the treatment of&#xD;
      PJP among immunocompromised adult patients with and without HIV. When comparing standard&#xD;
      doses to reduced doses (≤10mg/kg/day of the TMP component), there was no statistically&#xD;
      significant difference in mortality (absolute risk difference: -9% in favor of reduced dose,&#xD;
      95% CI: -27% to 8%) with a corresponding 18% (95% CI: -31% to -5%) absolute risk reduction of&#xD;
      Grade III or higher adverse events. These data provide the best available evidence for&#xD;
      treatment equipoise and highlight the need for a randomized controlled trial to directly&#xD;
      compare dosing strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this trial is to determine whether treatment with reduced-dose&#xD;
      TMP-SMX (10mg/kg/day) is superior to standard dose (15mg/kg/day) among immunocompromised&#xD;
      HIV-infected and uninfected patients with PJP for the composite primary outcome of death, new&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, or change in treatment by Day 21.&#xD;
