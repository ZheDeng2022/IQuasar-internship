  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Q-1802 is a bispecific antibody targeting both the tumor-specific antigen Claudin 18.2 and&#xD;
      the immune checkpoint PD-L1. This is a multi-center, single-arm, open-label design to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and tolerance of Q-1802 in patients with advanced solid tumors, together&#xD;
      with an assessment of pharmacokinetic characteristics and efficacy. The study consisted of&#xD;
      two compartments: the dose-exploration stage and the dose-extension stage.&#xD;
