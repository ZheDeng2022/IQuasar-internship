  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational, study across robotic-assisted and laparoscopic primary&#xD;
      (non-recurrent) umbilical and incisional hernia repair. The study aims to evaluate pain and&#xD;
      QOL outcomes through 30 days. During the post-operative period through 30 days, pain&#xD;
      medication intake, subject reported pain and quality of life and incidence of intra-operative&#xD;
      and post-operative adverse events related to the ventral hernia repair will be collected.&#xD;

The retrorectus space is developed for mesh placement to repair the defect. The repair technique will be per the surgeon's standard of care.&#xD;
Robotic-assisted ventral hernia repair With the patient under general anesthesia, several small incisions are made in the abdomen. Ports are placed, the abdomen is insufflated, and the da Vinci Robotic Surgical System (Intuitive) is docked to the subject and used to complete the procedure.
