      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - to investigate the effect of food on the bioavailability of DF 2156Y after single dose&#xD;
      administration of 400 mg of ladarixin to healthy male and female volunteers under fed and&#xD;
      fasting conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to investigate the effect of gender on the bioavailability of DF 2156Y and its&#xD;
           metabolites (DF 2108Y and DF 2227Y) after single dose administration of 400 mg of&#xD;
           ladarixin to healthy male and female volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate safety and tolerability of a single dose administration of ladarixin 400 mg&#xD;
           to healthy male and female volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Single center, single dose, open label, randomized, two-way, crossover, food effect&#xD;
      on bioavailability study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More precisely, a single oral dose of 400 mg of ladarixin (two 200 mg capsules) was&#xD;
      administered to healthy male and female volunteers under fed (Test treatment) and fasting&#xD;
      (Reference treatment) conditions in two consecutive study periods, according to a two-way&#xD;
      crossover design, with a wash-out interval of at least 14 days between the two&#xD;
      administrations.&#xD;
