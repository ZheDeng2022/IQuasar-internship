  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of virtual postoperative visits as&#xD;
      compared to in-office postoperative visits for patients undergoing minimally invasive&#xD;
      hysterectomy. The investigators hypothesize that virtual visits will be non-inferior to&#xD;
      in-person visits in terms of patient satisfaction. The primary objective for this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate patient satisfaction of the postoperative visit experience, as measured by the Press&#xD;
      Ganey Medical Practice Survey and Medical Practice Telemedicine Survey. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives include evaluating the incidence of a new diagnosis of a postoperative&#xD;
      complication requiring medical treatment (e.g. calling in of a prescription), an office visit&#xD;
      with CNP or MIGS surgeon, or an urgent care or ER visit. Post-operative complications include&#xD;
      infection (urinary, pulmonary, wound, pelvic abscess, and bloodstream), thromboembolic&#xD;
      events, bleeding; and issues with wound healing, such as dehiscence. The investigators will&#xD;
      record no-show rates, visit times, and estimated travel distance as measured by distance of&#xD;
      home to clinic site.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two arm, randomized non-inferiority clinical trial that will take place within the&#xD;
      Minimally Invasive Gynecologic Surgery division in the Women's Health Institute of the&#xD;
      Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population - The Investigators will recruit patients undergoing benign minimally invasive&#xD;
      hysterectomy (laparoscopic, robotic, and vaginal). Inclusion criteria include patients &gt;18&#xD;
      years of age who are able to provide informed consent without assistance, speak English, and&#xD;
      who have access to a phone or device equipped for virtual visits. Patients will be excluded&#xD;
      if the staff surgeon determines they are inappropriate for virtual follow-up, if there is&#xD;
      suspicion of malignancy, if they are unable to provide consent, or if they do not have access&#xD;
      to technology that enables virtual visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment - Enrolled participants will be randomized to either a two-week virtual&#xD;
      postoperative visit with a certified nurse practitioner (CNP) or a two-week in-office&#xD;
      postoperative visit with a certified nurse practitioner (CNP) in a 1:1 allocation ratio.&#xD;
      Block randomizations with block size of 4 will be assigned to nurse providers independently.&#xD;
      Randomization schedules will be implemented by Redcap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection - The primary outcome of this study is patient satisfaction, as measured by&#xD;
      the Press Ganey Medical Practice Survey and Medical Practice Telemedicine Survey. These&#xD;
      questionnaires are currently sent to all patients by the Office of Patient Experience at our&#xD;
      institution four days after their postoperative appointment. The investigators will provide&#xD;
      verbal reminders about study participation and survey administration at the visit. Survey&#xD;
      data will be obtained through the Office of Patient Experience and imported into RedCap. The&#xD;
      secondary outcome is a new diagnosis of a postoperative complication requiring medical&#xD;
      treatment (e.g. calling in of a prescription), an office visit with a CNP or MIGS surgeon, or&#xD;
      an urgent care or ER visit. Complications include infection (urinary, pulmonary, wound,&#xD;
      pelvic abscess, and bloodstream); thromboembolic events; bleeding; and issues with wound&#xD;
      healing, such as dehiscence. Calvien-Dindo classification system for postoperative&#xD;
      complications will be used. The Investigators will also look at no-show rates, visit times,&#xD;
      and travel distance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect basic demographic information from the EMR, including age,&#xD;
      BMI, parity, and prior surgical history. Surgical indication, procedure performed, length of&#xD;
      hospital stay, and perioperative outcomes (reoperation, readmission, unscheduled office or&#xD;
      virtual visits (i.e. earlier than the scheduled 2 week visit), ED/urgent care visits,&#xD;
      infection rates) will also be obtained. No-show rates will be obtained through the EMR. The&#xD;
      investigators will also note if a planned virtual visit is unable to be completed due to&#xD;
      technical difficulties, or is converted to a telephone visit. Travel distance from home to&#xD;
      clinic site will be calculated using average travel time with minimal traffic based on&#xD;
      participant's zip code using Google Maps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect the reason for ineligibility for all patients deemed such by&#xD;
      staff surgeons. All participants will be assigned a study number to facilitate&#xD;
      de-identification of data. Data will be compiled in RedCap and securely stored on an&#xD;
      encrypted server.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators hypothesized that patient satisfaction would be non-inferior for patients&#xD;
      randomized to the postoperative virtual visit compared to those randomized to in-person&#xD;
      virtual visit. Sample size of 70 patients in each arm is needed to achieve 90% power to&#xD;
      detect a non-inferiority margin of -0.20. Allowing for a dropout rate of 20%, 88 patients&#xD;
      will be recruited in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary outcome, the Farrington-Manning score test for non-inferiority will be&#xD;
      performed, for both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. Approximately&#xD;
      normally-distributed continuous measures will be summarized using means and standard&#xD;
      deviations and will be compared using two-sample t-tests. Continuous measures that show&#xD;
      departure from normality and ordinal measures will be summarized using medians and quartiles&#xD;
      and will be compared using Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Categorical factors will be summarized&#xD;
      using frequencies and percentages and will be compared using Pearson's chi-square tests or&#xD;
      Fisher's exact tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses will be done using SAS (version 9.4, The SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and a p &lt; 0.05&#xD;
      will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Timeline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MIGS division performs at least 20-30 hysterectomies per month. The Investigators&#xD;
      estimate to achieve our target recruitment in 7-8 months.&#xD;
