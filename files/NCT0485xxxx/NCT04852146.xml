  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ST+ Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) is a major cause of mortality, morbidity and healthcare&#xD;
      costs in Europe and France. Emergency trans-luminal angioplasty (TLA), the gold standard&#xD;
      treatment, is the major determinant of vital prognosis and functional recovery of patients&#xD;
      with ST+ ACS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, data from surveys and French practice registers highlight frequent deviations from&#xD;
      the recommendations at different stages of the procedure; in the pre-hospital phase these&#xD;
      malfunctions result in longer delays. Improving the quality of care for patients with ST+&#xD;
      ACS, and in particular improving compliance with recommended delays in the acute phase, is a&#xD;
      public health priority in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feedback has been identified as one of the most effective interventions to improve practices&#xD;
      and organisations in healthcare institutions. Feedbacks are defined as &quot;any summary of a care&#xD;
      performance over a given period of time that can be transmitted a posteriori to the health&#xD;
      professional in any form, whether written, oral or by computer (in this case called&#xD;
      e-feedbacks)&quot;. Feedbacks, by objectifying the level of individual and collective performance,&#xD;
      encourage recipients to modify their practices and organisations to improve their&#xD;
      performance. It also acts as a social pressure mechanism. While the minimum elements of&#xD;
      feedback have been identified in the literature, there is a lack of information about the&#xD;
      optimal operational modalities for their deployment, which limits the system's capacity to&#xD;
      implement them. To overcome this lack of information, there is a consensus in the scientific&#xD;
      community that research on feedback should focus not only on analysing its effectiveness, but&#xD;
      above all on the determinants of its effectiveness. With regard to the quality of management&#xD;
      of patients with ST+ ACS, only four trials were found in the literature that studied the&#xD;
      effectiveness of feedbacks; none of them defined the optimal intervention for deploying&#xD;
      feedbacks in the emergency department setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practice registers, particularly in the cardiovascular field, have shown their effectiveness&#xD;
      in improving practices, particularly through the implementation of feedback to practitioners,&#xD;
      who produce data. In 2012, the ARS Aquitaine set up two regional cardiovascular registers&#xD;
      constituting permanent, nominative, continuous and exhaustive records of the management of&#xD;
      patients suffering from coronary pathologies: the Aquitaine Interventional Cardiology&#xD;
      Register (ACIRA) and the Aquitaine Register of Initial Management of Myocardial Infarction&#xD;
      (REANIM). The cross-referencing of the REANIM and ACIRA registers constitutes an exhaustive&#xD;
      cohort of patients with ST+ ACS containing information on the management of the entire care&#xD;
      pathway, from the onset of symptoms to the end of the hospitalization for the management of&#xD;
      the acute episode. This cohort, which is unique in France in the field of coronary&#xD;
      pathologies, makes it possible to produce unprecedented and highly accurate information,&#xD;
      particularly concerning the time taken to provide care. Wishing to actively engage in a&#xD;
      process of changing practices, the Aquitaine Cardiovascular Registries team has developed an&#xD;
      e-feedback tool for emergency, EMS and cardiology teams. This tool alone cannot contribute to&#xD;
      effectively improving patient care. It is necessary to build an intervention for the&#xD;
      deployment of this tool that takes into account the scientific data and the organisational&#xD;
      constraints of care. Secondly, the evaluation of the effectiveness and economic impact of&#xD;
      this e-feedbacks tool deployment intervention will allow us to know its real added value on&#xD;
      practices, organisations and health care expenditure.&#xD;

      The study has two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A phase of construction of the intervention based on qualitative analyses of the focus&#xD;
           groups near the professionals of the establishments of the 7 zones SAMU concerned and&#xD;
           semi-directive interviews near the directions of the establishments of the 7 zones SAMU&#xD;
           concerned;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A phase of evaluation of the impact of the intervention which is based on a mixed method&#xD;
           mixing quantitative and qualitative analyses. The qualitative analyses are based on&#xD;
           semi-directive interviews with the professionals concerned in the establishments of the&#xD;
           7 participating UAS zones. The study design of the quantitative part is a cluster&#xD;
           randomised controlled trial in a transverse stepped wedge design. The clusters are&#xD;
           represented by 7 UAS zones of the ex-Aquitaine region.&#xD;
