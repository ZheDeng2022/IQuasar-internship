  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of treatment&#xD;
      with EDIT-301 in adult subjects with severe sickle cell disease (SCD).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2 single-arm, open-label, multicenter study evaluating the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of a single unit dose of EDIT-301 for autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant&#xD;
      (HSCT) in subjects with severe SCD. Planned study subjects will be comprised of male and&#xD;
      female adult subjects with severe SCD, from 18 to 50 years of age, inclusive.&#xD;
