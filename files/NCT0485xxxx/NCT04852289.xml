      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immune response is how the body recognizes and defends itself against foreign and harmful&#xD;
      substances. Researchers want to compare the immune responses between young and older healthy&#xD;
      adults after they receive vaccine doses for COVID-19. This research may help to determine&#xD;
      whether age impacts cell response to COVID-19 vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the immune response of people who receive Pizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People aged 18 and older who have not had COVID-19 and who either plan to receive the first&#xD;
      dose of a COVID-19 vaccine within the next month or have received at least the first of 2&#xD;
      doses of the vaccine within the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened by telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will not get the COVID-19 vaccine in this study. They must get it through a&#xD;
      vaccine location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have not yet been vaccinated will have 7 visits. The first 4 visits will&#xD;
      occur in the first month before and after each vaccination. The last 3 visits will occur 6&#xD;
      months, 1 year, and 2 years after completed vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have received at least 1 of 2 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine within the last&#xD;
      6 months will have 3 visits. The first visit will occur within 6 months of receiving the&#xD;
      first vaccine dose. The last 2 visits will occur 1 year and 2 years after the first vaccine&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visits, participant will review their medical history. Their height, weight, and/or vital&#xD;
      signs will be measured. They will give blood samples after fasting. They may give urine&#xD;
      samples. They may have a nasal swab test for COVID-19.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is to identify SARS-CoV-2 S protein specific CD8 T cells in the blood of COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccinated participants. Pfizer and Moderna made vaccines will be used in this study. As both&#xD;
      vaccines are mRNA based encoding S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and require two doses, the CD8 T&#xD;
      cell response is expected to be comparable. We will also measure general health factors using&#xD;
      blood samples. By analyzing the frequency, differentiation, and expansion of these SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      S protein specific CD8 T cells, we hope to shed light into the CD8 T cell response to&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccine and its change with age.&#xD;

        The participants will consist of healthy men and women over 18 years of age who plan to&#xD;
        have a COVID-19 vaccination within 30 days. An accrual ceiling of 160 participants will be&#xD;
        recruited and screened until 140 eligible participants are enrolled, which are calculated&#xD;
        based on four groups: young females (18-64), young males (18-64), old females (&gt;=65), old&#xD;
        males (&gt;=65). Each group with 35 people to account for HLA-A2+, variations in HLA-A2&#xD;
        genotype percentage, and possible dropout. We will include both genders, 18 years of age&#xD;
        and older, all races, and residents of the state of Maryland.&#xD;
