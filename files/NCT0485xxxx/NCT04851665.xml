      From manuscript draft Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Setting, Participants and Data Collection In this qualitative study the investigators&#xD;
      examined authentic examples of intraoperative teaching exchanges between attending and&#xD;
      resident surgeons. These examples were taken from two previous studies conducted at a large&#xD;
      women's hospital: the objectives of those studies were to compare attending and resident&#xD;
      responses regarding avoiding intraoperative errors[31] and to develop the previously&#xD;
      mentioned Intelligent Cooperation framework.[10] The 10 surgical cases were gynecologic,&#xD;
      representing open abdominal, laparoscopic, and vaginal approaches. Surgical cases were chosen&#xD;
      by convenience, according to the schedule of the filmographer. Participants included ten&#xD;
      surgical attendings, four fellows, and eleven Obstetrics and Gynecology residents, ranging&#xD;
      from PGY1 to PGY4. the investigators conducted interviews with all ten attending surgeons and&#xD;
      five of the residents. The data for this study included the case video, deidentified&#xD;
      transcripts of the cases, and deidentified transcripts of the interviews. Our qualitative&#xD;
      approach was most informed by Sandelowski's concept of developing rich qualitative&#xD;
      descriptions.[32]&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Research Team the investigators' interdisciplinary research team consisted of a female&#xD;
      pelvic surgeon with twenty years of surgical teaching experience (GS), a medical education&#xD;
      researcher and educational sociologist (LA), a neurosurgeon and administrator with 30 years&#xD;
      of experience across the continuum of medical education (SK), and a cognitive psychologist&#xD;
      with expertise in surgical education research (EBL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Data Analysis the investigators reviewed and discussed the works of key sociocultural&#xD;
      learning scholars, as described in our Introduction. The discussions were converted into a&#xD;
      list of &quot;key tenets&quot; of the SCLTs, with associated examples from K-12 and Higher Education.&#xD;
      (see Table 1) the investigators then independently coded all transcripts according to the key&#xD;
      tenets and examples from our list, noting which exchanges reflected various sociocultural&#xD;
      theories. Counting themes was not part of the methodological approach in this study because&#xD;
      it was inconsistent with the intent of the study to develop deep, rich, and comprehensive&#xD;
      insights about teaching in the OR.[33] the investigators subsequently met as a group to&#xD;
      review coding, convert them into themes of teaching and learning advanced surgical skills,&#xD;
      and select notable examples from our data. (see Table 2) These themes were then transformed&#xD;
      into instructional strategies to improve surgical teaching, based on the sociocultural&#xD;
      theories. (see Table 3) Disagreements were settled by group discussion. Data saturation was&#xD;
      determined according to our study objective[34], to identify intraoperative instructional&#xD;
      strategies related to the social cultural learning theories. the investigators stopped&#xD;
      analyzing transcripts when the investigators had generated no new instructional strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 Reflexivity and Ethics During the meetings, the investigators maintained a reflexive&#xD;
      atmosphere, reflecting on their backgrounds, experience, and biases and how those might&#xD;
      affect their interpretation of the data. the investigators challenged those biases often. the&#xD;
      investigators reached consensus regarding differences in data interpretation through group&#xD;
      discussion. The University IRB approved this study as exempt.&#xD;
