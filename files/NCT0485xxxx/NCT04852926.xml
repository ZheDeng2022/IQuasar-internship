    <textblock>
      Study of sexual health by repeated anonymous self-administered questionnaires in patients&#xD;
      treated for non-metastatic breast cancer and referred to Jeanne de Flandre hospital for&#xD;
      possible preservation of their fertility. Sexual health is affected by treatments and&#xD;
      improves after the treatments. Sexual health is influenced by multiple factors : oncology&#xD;

    <time_frame>At 1 year after the start of chemotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>The FSFI score assesses female sexual functioning over the past four weeks. It is a self-evaluation by questionnaire. It consists of 19 questions with 5 or 6 possible answers per question, scored respectively from 1 to 5 and from 0 To evaluate, in women with non-metallic breast cancer followed in the Fertility Observatory at the Jeanne de Flandre Hospital, 1-year sexual health progression from chemotherapy initiation to sexual health assessment prior to cancer diagnosis announcement.</description>

    <time_frame>At inclusion, at chemotherapy course n°4, at chemotherapy course n°6, at 3 months and at 6 months after chemotherapy, at 1 year and 2 years after chemotherapy,</time_frame>
    <description>MSHQ (Male Sexual Health Questionnaire) consists of 25 questions. It is a self-evaluation by the partner. A total score out of 125 is calculated. A high score corresponds to a good quality of male sexual life.</description>

    <description>The PEP (Premature ejaculation profile) score explores premature ejaculation by self-questionnaire. It consists of 4 questions scored from 1 to 5. A high score corresponds to good male sexual health. A low score indicates premature ejaculation with repercussions on male sexual health.</description>
