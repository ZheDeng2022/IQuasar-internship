      The frequency of obese postoperative rhabdomyolized acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and renal&#xD;
      failure is also increasing. It is simply important to manage fluid. The fluid requirement&#xD;
      should be higher than planned. In order to learn the postoperative ATN and the development of&#xD;
      renal failure, 4-5 lt crystalloid fluid should be given in 2-3 times or 1.5 ml / kg / h&#xD;
      should be provided in the upper outlet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to TVA, there are no good guidelines for intraoperative fluid management in&#xD;
      bariatric surgery. Different intraoperative fluid management communications are used. The key&#xD;
      to improving outcomes from post-operative treatment is &quot;patient directed fluid management&quot; or&#xD;
      &quot;targeted fluid management&quot;. The use of Perioperative Goal-Directed Fluid Therapy&#xD;
      Technologies helps the anesthesiologist closely monitor the patient and strike the delicate&#xD;
      balance between benefit and risk. Plethysmographic variability index monitoring (PVI-Pleth&#xD;
      Variability Index) is a non-invasive, automatic and continuous monitor that displays patient&#xD;
      fluid response, it is one of the easily applicable and easily interpreted monitoring methods.&#xD;
      With PVI monitoring, intraoperative hypotension and fluid need can be predicted in advance.&#xD;

      Plethysmographic Variability Index (PVI) is the determination of the importance of monitoring&#xD;
      of intraoperative volume replacement and its effect on postoperative operations.&#xD;

      Obesity is defined as an increase in body weight beyond requirements as a result of excessive&#xD;
      fat accumulation in the body and is common Obesity leads to an increase in health problems&#xD;
      and morbidity and mortality, as well as individual and social problems and a decrease in the&#xD;
      workforce. Despite sports, diet, lifestyle changes and medical treatments, the rate of&#xD;
      obesity continues to increase in the population. The most effective and durable treatment&#xD;
      option for morbid obesity is bariatric surgery. Video laparoscopic bariatric surgery (VLBS)&#xD;
      is recognized as the best surgical technique for morbidly obese individuals with health&#xD;
      complications associated with excess body fat. Despite the proven benefits of VLBS, it can&#xD;
      model a systemic inflammatory response. VLBS also poses an inherent risk of pneumoperitoneum&#xD;
      for the kidneys due to high intra-abdominal pressure, which reduces cortical capillary blood&#xD;
      flow by increasing renal vascular resistance. As a result, the glomerular filtration rate&#xD;
      (GFR) decreases and transient oliguria occurs. Acute renal failure manifested as a large&#xD;
      increase in creatinine levels with oliguria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a preventable complication with intraoperative anesthesia management.Glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate (GFR) and increased renal plasma flow cause hyperfiltration syndrome in&#xD;
      obesity. Adinopectin, proinflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress and pharmacological&#xD;
      nephrotoxicity are the mechanisms affecting acute kidney injury in obesity. Chronic renal&#xD;
      failure occurs as a result of a decrease in albiminuria and GFR. They are the causes of&#xD;
      postoperative renal failure in patients with diabetes, a history of kidney disease, using&#xD;
      antihypertensive drugs containing diuretics, and obese patients with a BMI greater than 50 kg&#xD;
      / m2, prolonged operation time, and intraoperative hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frequency of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and renal failure due to postoperative&#xD;
      rhabdomyolysis is also increased in obese patients. Fluid management is important to prevent&#xD;
      this. The fluid requirement should be higher than planned. In order to prevent the&#xD;
      development of postoperative ATN and renal failure, 4-5 liters of crystalloid fluid should be&#xD;
      given in 2-3 hours or urine output above 1.5 ml / kg / h should be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to TVA, there are studies performing crystalloid fluid replacement in a wide range&#xD;
      of 15-40 ml / kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In obese patients, changes in distribution volume such as decreased hepatic blood flow,&#xD;
      increase in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate and increase in the amount of&#xD;
      free-flowing drug are the most important factors affecting the pharmacokinetics of drugs.&#xD;
      Drug doses used in these patients are recommended to be calculated according to total body&#xD;
      weight (TVA), ideal body weight (IVA), and lean body weight (HVA = IVA + 20%), taking into&#xD;
      account the lipophilic nature of the drug. For example in induction; when using high&#xD;
      lipophilic drugs according to YVA or IVA; moderately lipophilic For drugs, the dosage can be&#xD;
      increased by 20-40% and used according to the YVA.Propofol's high lipophilic properties cause&#xD;
      its effect to start very quickly and to be short-lived. It has been shown in many studies&#xD;
      that there is no usable accumulation or prolongation of propofol compared to TVA in obese&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short-acting remifentanil, one of the lipophilic synthetic opioids, can be administered&#xD;
      according to IVA .&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no well-known guidelines for intraoperative fluid management in bariatric surgery.&#xD;
      Different intraoperative fluid management protocols are used. The key to improving outcomes&#xD;
      from treatment in the post-operative period is &quot;patient directed fluid management&quot; or&#xD;
      &quot;targeted fluid management&quot;. The use of Perioperative Goal-Directed Fluid Therapy&#xD;
      Technologies helps the anesthesiologist to closely monitor the patient and establish the&#xD;
      delicate balance between benefit and risk. Plethysmographic variability index monitoring&#xD;
      (PVI-Pleth Variability Index) is a non-invasive, automatic and continuous monitor that&#xD;
      displays the fluid response of patients, and is one of the easy-to-apply and easily&#xD;
      interpreted monitoring methods. It has been shown that intraoperative hypotension and fluid&#xD;
      need can be predicted with PVI monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the effect of Pleth Variability Index (PVI) monitoring&#xD;
      on intraoperative volume replacement amount and postoperative complications in obese patients&#xD;
      who underwent bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients A total of 60 obese patients who scheduled for elective bariatric surgery were&#xD;
      included in this single-blind prospective randomized study. Patients were required to have an&#xD;
      ASA physical status class 2 or 3. Exclusion criteria were as follows: severe cardiac&#xD;
      arrhythmia, peripheral artery disease, an ejection fraction &lt;30%, any pulmonary pathology&#xD;
      preventing a respiratory volume &gt;6 ml/kg/min on mechanical ventilation, and hepatic or renal&#xD;
      impairment. The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee of Marmara&#xD;
      University Medical Faculty (03.01.2020- 09.2020.158). All patients provided informed consent&#xD;
      prior to study entry and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study groups Patients were randomly assigned to the PVI group or control group using sealed&#xD;
      envelope method. Fluid management was based on PVI values in the PVI group, where a PVI value&#xD;
      &lt;13% was targeted throughout the operation. Standard fluid management regimen was used for&#xD;
      the controls. All patients fasted for eight hours before the operation. In the operating&#xD;
      room, all patients were monitored for PVI; however, anesthesia team was able to see only the&#xD;
      PVI values of the PVI groups that would aid fluid management; whereas team was blinded to the&#xD;
      PVI values of the controls in whom the fluid management was done using standard approach. On&#xD;
      the other hand, PVI values of the controls were also recorded by another anesthesiologist&#xD;
      every 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia management For anesthesia induction, 2 mg/kg propofol and 1μgr/kg remifentanil&#xD;
      were used in all patients and 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium (Esmeron vial, Schering -Plough, Istanbul,&#xD;
      Turkey) was used for muscle relaxation. Following endotracheal intubation, total intravenous&#xD;
      anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil was used. In addition to PVI, both groups were&#xD;
      monitored for other parameters such as heart rate (HR), noninvasive mean blood pressure&#xD;
      (MAB), and perfusion index (PI), and bispectral index scale (BIS). Propofol dose was adjusted&#xD;
      to keep BIS between 40 and 45 throughout the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluid management Controls Following anesthesia induction, controls received crystalloid&#xD;
      solution at an infusion rate of 4-8 ml/kg/h for fluid maintenance. Infusion rate was adjusted&#xD;
      by the same anesthesiologist based on routine approach based on intraoperative assessments&#xD;
      such as heart rate, mean arterial pressure and urine output. In case of hypotension, which&#xD;
      was defined as mean arterial blood pressure &lt;65 mmHg, crystalloid infusion was increased and&#xD;
      colloid infusion (Gelofusine® Melsungen, Germany) was started. In case hypotension persists,&#xD;
      5 mg of ephedrine was administered intravenously, and it was repeated every 5 minutes until&#xD;
      mean arterial blood pressure is above 65 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PVI group Crystalloid replacement was adjusted according the PVI values, which were targeted&#xD;
      to be kept below 13% above 5%. Fluid maintenance was started with 2ml/kg/hour crystalloid&#xD;
      dose. If PVI is &gt;13% for more than 5 minutes, a 250 ml bolus Gelofusine® was administered. If&#xD;
      PVI was still &gt;13% following this, it was repeated every 5 minutes until PVI&lt;13%. Meanwhile,&#xD;
      5 mg bolus ephedrine was administered to keep mean blood pressure over 65 mmHg, when&#xD;
      necessary. In case mean blood pressure is &lt;65 mmHg, intravenous 5 mg ephedrine was repeated&#xD;
      every 5 minutes until mean blood pressure is over 65 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments Following parameters were recorded intraoperatively at 15 minutes intervals: PVI&#xD;
      value, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, perfusion index value. In addition, preoperative&#xD;
      bun, creatinine, and lactate values, perioperative use of crystalloids, colloids, blood/blood&#xD;
      products, and bleeding amounts, intra- and postoperative urine outputs, as well as&#xD;
      postoperative bun, creatinine, lactate values were recorded.&#xD;
