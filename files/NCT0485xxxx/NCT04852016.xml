  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Canadian Medical Protective Association (CMPA) defines informed consent (IC) as a&#xD;
      voluntary process where important elements include details of the procedure, complications,&#xD;
      and proposed alternatives. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) was the most common laparoscopic&#xD;
      procedure cited in 423 medical-legal cases reported by CMPA in 2017, with 29% of cases citing&#xD;
      issues in pre-operative care including inadequacy of the consent process. The investigators&#xD;
      recently demonstrated that technology can help improve the IC process in an outpatient&#xD;
      setting by conducting a prospective randomized controlled trial to examine the effects of&#xD;
      adding a digital educational platform (DEP) module to a standard verbal consent (SVC) for an&#xD;
      elective laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure. The investigators demonstrated a&#xD;
      significant improvement in immediate post-consent knowledge of the risks, benefits and&#xD;
      alternatives in patients who viewed the DEP module with equivalent patient satisfaction as&#xD;
      compared to a SVC. With the proposed study the investigators plan to gather evidence to&#xD;
      support implementing a digital education platform for emergent surgical procedures performed&#xD;
      in an in-patient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial to explore the benefits of&#xD;
      adding a DEP module to a SVC for patients presenting with acute cholecystitis requiring an&#xD;
      emergent LC as an in-patient. Participants will be randomly allocated (1:1) to either a&#xD;
      control group (SVC) or an intervention group (SVC + DEP). Primary outcome of interest will be&#xD;
      immediate post-consent knowledge of the risks, benefits, alternatives and expected outcomes&#xD;
      for a LC. Secondary outcomes will include satisfaction with the consent discussion and&#xD;
      delayed retention of knowledge of the risks, benefits, alternatives and expected outcomes for&#xD;
      a LC .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that completion of the DEP module in addition to SVC will&#xD;
      result in superior immediate and delayed post-consent knowledge of risks and benefits of LC&#xD;
      with equivalent patients satisfaction as compared to SVC alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will provide evidence supporting the addition of DEP to SVC for&#xD;
      urgent and emergent surgical procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Required elements for an informed consent (IC) in surgery have been well established. The&#xD;
      Canadian Medical Protective Association (CMPA) defines IC as a voluntary process where&#xD;
      important elements include details of the procedure, complications, and proposed&#xD;
      alternatives. The individual should also be given ample time to ask questions to ensure best&#xD;
      understanding of the procedure. Shortcomings in the process can lead to patient complaints,&#xD;
      unmet expectations and have significant legal ramifications. Of all medical-legal cases&#xD;
      involving inadequacy of informed consent reported by CMPA in 2016, 65% involved surgical&#xD;
      procedures and 79% had unfavorable outcomes. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) was the most&#xD;
      common laparoscopic procedure cited in 423 medical-legal cases reported by CMPA in 2017, with&#xD;
      29% of cases citing issues in pre-operative care including inadequacy of the informed consent&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators conducted a retrospective chart review of 270 patients who underwent&#xD;
      71(26%) elective and 199(74%) emergent LC at our tertiary academic centre and demonstrated&#xD;
      poor documentation of IC with only 5(2%) patients' charts having complete documentation of&#xD;
      all three elements of IC. For emergent cases, discussion of possible complications of LC was&#xD;
      documented 174(64%) of cases; details of the LC were documented in 7(2.6%) of cases; and&#xD;
      alternatives to LC were documented in 3(1.1%) of cases. Emergent LC was associated with worse&#xD;
      documentation of IC as compared to elective LC. It is difficult to ascertain whether poor&#xD;
      documentation is associated with poor informed consent discussions; however, use of digital&#xD;
      education platforms (DEP) can enhance a patient's understanding of the risks, benefits and&#xD;
      alternatives to a proposed operative procedure and can ensure the comprehensiveness of the&#xD;
      consent discussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators recently conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial of 51 patients&#xD;
      with severe obesity to examine the effects of adding a digital educational platform (DEP) to&#xD;
      a standard verbal consent (SVC) for a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure. In&#xD;
      this study the investigators demonstrated that addition of DEP to SVC resulted in improved&#xD;
      knowledge of the risks, benefits and alternatives to the procedure vs SVC alone (85.0±8.8% vs&#xD;
      78.7±8.7%; p=0.01; Effect Size=0.72), equivalent patient satisfaction (31.5±1.1 vs 31±2.7;&#xD;
      p=0.10), and significantly shorter face-to-face time between patient and surgeon to obtain&#xD;
      informed consent (358±198sec vs 751±212sec; p&lt;0.01; Effect Size=1.92). However, the&#xD;
      generalizability and transferability of our findings to an inpatient setting and to emergent&#xD;
      operations is currently unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will be conducting a randomized controlled trial to explore the benefits of&#xD;
      adding a DEP module to a SVC for patients presenting with acute biliary pathology requiring&#xD;
      an emergent LC in an in-patient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although addition of the DEP to SVC has been shown to result in improved patient&#xD;
      understanding of risks, benefits and alternatives of a proposed operation in an elective&#xD;
      setting, there is a paucity of data in an emergent acute care setting where the environment&#xD;
      can be chaotic with shortened time for comprehensive informed consent discussions. The&#xD;
      investigators hope that the results of this study will not only provide the evidence to&#xD;
      support adding DEP to SVC for emergent surgical procedures, but will also improve informed&#xD;
      consent discussions and patients' comprehension of the risks and benefits of proposed&#xD;
      procedures in an acute care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants in the intervention (DEP + SVC) group will demonstrate greater immediate&#xD;
           and delayed (4-6 weeks) post-consent knowledge of the risks, benefits, alternatives and&#xD;
           expected outcomes for the LC operation as compared to participants in the control (SVC)&#xD;
           group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants in the intervention (DEP + SVC) group will demonstrate equivalent&#xD;
           satisfaction with the consent process as compared to participants in the control (SVC)&#xD;
           group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a prospective non-blinded randomized control trial conducted at Kingston&#xD;
      Health Sciences Centre (tertiary academic hospital in Kingston, Ontario, Canada). The&#xD;
      investigators will recruit patients who are admitted to hospital with biliary pathology to&#xD;
      undergo an emergent laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Study participants will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated in a 1:1 ratio to a control group (SVC) or an intervention group (DEP+SVC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients (potential study participants) will be invited to participate in the current study&#xD;
      once a clinical decision to recommend laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been made.&#xD;
      Randomization will occur 1:1 to either an intervention (DEP+SVC) or a control group (SVC)&#xD;
      using a sealed envelope technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use the online Qualtrics platform to collect all of the demographic&#xD;
      and outcomes data for this study. For baseline data, the investigators will collect&#xD;
      participant data including age, sex, level of education (&quot;did not complete high school&quot;,&#xD;
      &quot;high school&quot;, &quot;college&quot;, &quot;university&quot;), background in a medical field (yes/no), previous&#xD;
      consultation with a surgeon regarding laparoscopic cholecystectomy (yes/no). The&#xD;
      investigators will also document the setting in which the consent discussion took place&#xD;
      (emergency room or surgery ward), as well as admission diagnosis (biliary colic, acute&#xD;
      cholecystitis, gallstone pancreatitis, choledocholithiasis, cholangitis) (Appendix 1) The&#xD;
      investigators will ask study participants to complete a baseline basic English literacy&#xD;
      reading test (Appendix 2), a self-reported rating of their understanding of the LC operation&#xD;
      (scale of 1 to 10), and a multiple-choice knowledge test (MCQ, 20 questions, maximum score&#xD;
      20) assessing baseline knowledge of LC, indications for surgery, alternatives, risk,&#xD;
      complications, and anticipated recovery. The knowledge test will be piloted with relevant&#xD;
      stakeholders including general surgeons and patients who have undergone a LC prior to its use&#xD;
      in the study. Participants will not be made aware of the correct answers to the questions on&#xD;
      the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Verbal Consent (control group):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants who are randomized to the control (SVC) group will discuss the LC&#xD;
      procedure, indications for surgery, alternatives, risks, complications, expectations and&#xD;
      anticipated recovery with a member of the surgery team. The study participant will be given&#xD;
      the opportunity to ask questions and once all of the questions have been answered, a standard&#xD;
      informed consent form for LC will be signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital Education Platform (intervention group):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants who are randomized to the intervention (DEP+SVC) group will be presented&#xD;
      with an iPad an interactive DEP module discussing the indications for LC, alternatives,&#xD;
      risks, complications, expectations and anticipated recovery. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      review the DEP module at their own pace and will be required to confirm understanding of all&#xD;
      of the material presented on the DEP. They will have the opportunity to move back and forth&#xD;
      within the module until they are satisfied. Upon completion of the module, a member of the&#xD;
      surgery team will ask the patient if they have any additional questions or require further&#xD;
      clarification regarding the LC procedure, indications for surgery, alternatives, risks,&#xD;
      complications, expectations and anticipated recovery. Once all of participant's questions are&#xD;
      answered, a standard informed consent form for LC will be signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge of LC procedure, indications for surgery, alternatives, risks, complications,&#xD;
      expectations and anticipated recovery will be measured using the same knowledge test (20&#xD;
      questions, maximum score 20) as for baseline knowledge assessment. The knowledge test will be&#xD;
      completed right after the informed consent form is signed for LC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-reported understanding of the LC operation after signing of the informed consent will be&#xD;
      assessed by asking study participants to rate their understanding on a scale of 1 to 10.&#xD;
      Retention of knowledge about the LC procedure, indications for surgery, alternatives, risks,&#xD;
      complications, expectations and anticipated recovery will be assessed in 4-6 weeks using the&#xD;
      same knowledge test (20 MCQ questions, maximum score 20) as for baseline assessment. This&#xD;
      delayed knowledge test will be administered on the day of patient's follow-up appointment&#xD;
      with the surgeon, which is usually 4-6 weeks after their discharge from hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant's satisfaction with the clinical encounter will be assessed using a modified&#xD;
      Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8, maximum score 32) - a validated assessment tool of&#xD;
      patient satisfaction[6] - at the end of the consent discussion after signing the informed&#xD;
      consent form for LC (Appendix 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the results from the investigator's previous study, assuming a standard deviation of&#xD;
      9.0 and medium Cohen's d effect size of 0.66 for the MCQ knowledge test, the investigators&#xD;
      will plan to recruit 36 patients per group to detect a 1.2 point difference in MCQ score (6%)&#xD;
      change between two groups, with 80% power for the two sample t test (α = 0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data will be compared between groups using the Student's t test (continuous&#xD;
      variables) and Chi squared test (categorical variables). Participant satisfaction scores and&#xD;
      knowledge test scores will be compared between groups using a Student's t test. Within group&#xD;
      changes (eg. baseline vs immediate post test) in knowledge test scores with be compared using&#xD;
      a paired t-test. Effect sizes will be calculated using Cohen's d. Statistical significance&#xD;
      will be set to α = 0.05.&#xD;
