  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, phase 1a (dose escalation) and 1b (dose expansion) study to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of oral Selinexor in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab in&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid malignancies.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of selinexor in combination with nivolumab and&#xD;
           ipilimumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and&#xD;
           recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of selinexor in combination with nivolumab and&#xD;
           ipilimumab in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumor malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine Selinexor pharmacokinetics (PK) in Asian patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe anti-tumor responses with the combination in patients with advanced or&#xD;
           metastatic solid tumor malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the immunomodulatory effects of selinexor in solid tumour malignancies and&#xD;
           circulating immune cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify biomarkers of response to the combination of selinexor and nivolumab +&#xD;
           ipilimumab. We will explore changes in PDL1 expression, T cell infiltration (including&#xD;
           CD4 and CD8 positive cells), gene expression profiles on serial tumor biopsies&#xD;
           pre-selinexor, post-selinexor alone, and after the combination of selinexor and&#xD;
           ipilimumab + nivolumab where feasible.&#xD;
