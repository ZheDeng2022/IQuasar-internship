  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Selective exercise programs specific to muscle groups, with the workload to be done in line&#xD;
      with the muscle's own structure, can enable more strength to be released with less fatigue in&#xD;
      MS, and this increase in strength can increase balance and functional activities. to&#xD;
      determine the effects of type training (selective exercise training), eccentric and&#xD;
      concentric training on function, balance, fatigue and muscle architecture.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recovery and enhancement of muscle function in MS is one of the main goals in physiotherapy&#xD;
      and rehabilitation. In literature studies, it is stated that eccentric and concentric&#xD;
      exercises are effective exercise approaches in increasing strength and reducing fatigue.&#xD;
      However, the best exercise method is not yet clear in terms of providing better performance&#xD;
      adaptation with less fatigue. Considering the architectural features of the lower extremity&#xD;
      muscles, it is aimed to increase the angle of pennation with programs that include concentric&#xD;
      strengthening of the quadriceps, gastro-soleus and gastrocnemius muscles, which are suitable&#xD;
      muscle groups to produce large forces by design. With programs that include eccentric&#xD;
      strengthening of the hamstring and tibialis anterior muscles that function in a wide range of&#xD;
      motion and have high excursion ability, it is aimed to increase fiber length.&#xD;
