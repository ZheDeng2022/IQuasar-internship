      -  To find out the gap between real-world clinical practice and guideline recommendations&#xD;
           in initial management of DTC patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To observe the characteristics of patients who achieved and did not achieve TSH target&#xD;
           value after five year follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess response to initial therapy in patients who undergo total or neartotal&#xD;
           thyroidectomy and RAI remnant ablation after five year follow-up (according to an&#xD;
           modified dynamic risk stratification system)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To observe the recurrence status after five year follow-up&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The DTCC 2nd will follow DTCC 1st and observe the long-term efficacy of initial management&#xD;
      including surgery treatment, 131I therapy and TSH suppression therapy. It will involve nine&#xD;
      hospitals which have participated in the first stage, and continually to observe the DTC&#xD;
      patients who were recruited. The patients with more than 5 years long-term follow-up from the&#xD;
      date of signing the informed consent form (ICF) in DTCC 1st to signing ICF in DTCC 2nd will&#xD;
      be collected data retrospectively. For those follow-up less than 5 years, in addition to the&#xD;
      retrospective data collection, one prospective visit will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.Five-year accumulated recurrence rate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Disease-free survival (DFS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Overall survival (OS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Response to therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Re-operation rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Time weighted TSH level (TW-TSH)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Adverse events related to L-T4 therapy (ADRs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Median follow-up years&#xD;
