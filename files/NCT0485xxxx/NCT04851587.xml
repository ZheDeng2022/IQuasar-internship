  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The central objective of research is to examine the feasibility and acceptability of an&#xD;
      8-month single-arm behavioral intervention (i.e., EMPOWER) among overweight/obese middle-aged&#xD;
      and older adults with moderate-to-high impact low back pain. Intervention content will focus&#xD;
      on standard behavioral weight loss treatment and cognitive-behavioral pain coping therapy&#xD;
      with a focus on environmental reward and positive affect.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain (cLBP) is the leading cause of disability worldwide and is one of the&#xD;
      top reasons for seeking healthcare. High-impact low back pain is particularly problematic,&#xD;
      defined as chronic pain accompanied by significant restrictions in work, social, and/or&#xD;
      self-care activities for six months or more. High-impact pain is associated with greater&#xD;
      pain-related disability, opioid use, and healthcare costs compared to pain of lower impact.&#xD;
      Thus, efforts to reduce chronic pain impact have become a public health initiative. Low back&#xD;
      pain and overweight/obesity are highly comorbid; overweight and obese individuals are up to&#xD;
      43% more likely to have cLBP compared to normal weight individuals. Together, the additive&#xD;
      effects of overweight/obesity and chronic pain may play a larger role in increasing the risk&#xD;
      for other adverse health-related comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this exploratory study is to examine the feasibility and acceptability of an&#xD;
      integrated pain and weight management intervention (EMPOWER) for middle-aged and older adults&#xD;
      with moderate-to-high impact low back pain by addressing mechanisms of environmental reward&#xD;
      and positive affect. Forty adults (ages 45-80 years) with comorbid overweight/obesity (BMI≥25&#xD;
      kg/m2) and moderate-to-high impact cLBP will be assigned to an 8-month intervention, whereby&#xD;
      they will receive a group- and telephone-based program featuring integrated behavioral weight&#xD;
      loss treatment and cognitive-behavioral pain coping therapy. To address the key mechanisms of&#xD;
      environmental reward and positive affect, the proposed intervention will incorporate&#xD;
      systematic pleasant activity scheduling and values-clarification techniques. Assessments will&#xD;
      be conducted at baseline and at the 4- and 8-month time points.&#xD;
