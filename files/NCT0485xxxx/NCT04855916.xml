  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized crossover study will compare walking with KAFO type orthoses (current&#xD;
      standard of care) versus the ABLE Exoskeleton device, during walking in patients with spinal&#xD;
      cord injury in a hospital setting. The ABLE Exoskeleton is a robotic exoskeleton that&#xD;
      actively assists individuals with mobility problems to stand up, walk and sit down.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to compare the energy efficiency during gait with both&#xD;
      devices. Secondary objectives are: compare gait kinematics, usability, user's satisfaction,&#xD;
      physical activity and psychosocial impact. The study will also serve to evaluate the&#xD;
      usability and safety of the ABLE Exoskeleton in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete 10 gait training sessions during a 5-week period with 1 of the 2&#xD;
      devices randomly selected, followed by a post-training assessment consisting of 1 session.&#xD;
      Once the test is completed, subjects will have a 2-week rest period after which they will&#xD;
      repeat the process with the other device for 5 weeks (followed by 1 post-training assessment&#xD;
      session). The study will be conducted at Hospital Asepeyo Barcelona in Spain, where a total&#xD;
      of 10 patients will be recruited.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is determining the energy efficiency through gases&#xD;
      exchange and kinematic gait analysis to compare the standard of assistance (KAFO type&#xD;
      orthoses) and the ABLE Exoskeleton, a robotic gait assistance device, in patients with spinal&#xD;
      cord injury (SCI) in a hospital setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to compare the performance of KAFO-type orthoses with that of&#xD;
      the ABLE Exoskeleton device by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kinematic analysis of gait and spatiotemporal gait parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the time and effort required to learn to use the device (usability).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the impact that physical activity has on participants after gait training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the level of satisfaction of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to these objectives, the safety of the ABLE Exoskeleton as an assistive device&#xD;
      for gait rehabilitation in SCI patients will be evaluated throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will perform 2 training sessions per week of approximately 90 minutes duration&#xD;
      for 5 weeks with each of the devices, completing a total of 10 sessions with KAFO type&#xD;
      orthoses and 10 sessions with the ABLE Exoskeleton. Before starting the training period, the&#xD;
      physical capacity of the participants will be measured. During the training period sessions,&#xD;
      different measurements of the level of assistance, spatiotemporal gait variables and&#xD;
      usability will be taken. Standardized clinical assessments will also be performed during&#xD;
      sessions 5 and 10 (assessment sessions). At the end of the training period, a post-training&#xD;
      assessment will be performed, consisting of 1 session where the physical capacity of the&#xD;
      participants will be measured. After finishing the training period with one of the devices,&#xD;
      participants will have a rest period of 2 weeks, after which they will change devices and&#xD;
      repeat the whole process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis of the study is that gait efficiency in patients with SCI is improved&#xD;
      (lower energy consumption) when using the ABLE Exoskeleton device in comparison with&#xD;
      KAFO-type orthoses. The increase in gait efficiency encourages patients to stand and walk for&#xD;
      longer periods instead of using the wheelchair, which boosts their rehabilitation and&#xD;
      improves their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ABLE Exoskeleton device will improve the kinematics and spatiotemporal parameters of&#xD;
           gait (more closely resemble the gait pattern of a healthy individual), relative to&#xD;
           KAFO-type orthoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ABLE Exoskeleton device will have a more positive impact on the mobility and&#xD;
           psychosocial health of participants with SCI in the study, with respect to KAFO-type&#xD;
           orthoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ABLE Exoskeleton device is a safe device to use in a hospital setting as an&#xD;
           assistive device during gait rehabilitation in SCI patients.&#xD;

    <measure>Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) III</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 days before first session and up to 10 days after first session</time_frame>
    <description>Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM III) scale focuses on the ability to perform activities of daily living in persons with SCI. The SCIM III consists of three subscales: Self-Care, Respiratory and Sphincter Management, Mobility (room and toilet) and Mobility (indoors and outdoors, on even surface). A total score of 0 (totally dependent) to 100 (totally independent) points can be achieved.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with assistive Technology (QUEST 2.0)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>QUEST 2.0 is designed to measure the level of satisfaction and the value people attribute to assistive technologies. It does so using 12 variables which are scored on a 5 point scale in terms of perceived importance and satisfaction. While items 1-8 rate the satisfaction with the device, items 9-12 are for assessing the satisfaction with the service. If the users are not very satisfied with a feature, they are asked to provide specific feedback. The final score is the mean sum scores of all valid responses with a range of 1 (not satisfied at all) to 5 (very satisfied).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Psychosocial Impact of Assistive Devices Scales (PIADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks and followup (4 weeks after study completion).</time_frame>
    <description>PIADS is a 26-item (7-point Likert-Scale), self-report questionnaire designed to assess the effects of an assistive device on functional independence, well-being, and quality of life. It is divided into three subscales: Competence, adaptability and self-esteem. For each of the subscales, typically means are calculated that range from -3 (maximum negative impact) to +3 (maximum positive impact). To have only positive sum scores, the range of the individual scores are shifted to 1 to 7, meaning that the sum scores range from 1 *26 (26, maximum negative impact) to 7 *26 (182, maximum positive impact). The PIADS is a responsive measure and sensitive to important variables such as the user's clinical condition, device stigma, and functional features of the device. It has been shown to accurately reflect the self-described experiences of people who use assistive devices.</description>
