  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-institution pilot study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      radiation therapy (RT) for the treatment of unresected keloids. The primary endpoint will be&#xD;
      toxicity within 10 weeks of follow-up. Secondary endpoints will include cessation of growth&#xD;
      or shrinkage of keloids, symptomatic response, and impact on quality of life.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Risks of radiation therapy include acute and later toxicities. Acute toxicities of radiation&#xD;
      therapy include radiation dermatitis (skin pain, itching, erythema, desquamation). Late&#xD;
      toxicities include skin fibrosis, ulceration, telangiectasia, altered skin pigmentation,&#xD;
      delayed wound healing for potential future wounds in the irradiated field, and radiation&#xD;
      induced malignancy in the irradiated field (lifetime risk estimated to be 1% or less)&#xD;
      Additionally, efficacy of the treatment is not known and there is a risk that the keloid will&#xD;
      continue to grow immediately or in the future resulting in treatment providing patients with&#xD;
      no benefit but with the included aforementioned acute and late toxicities of the RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential benefits of this study include prevention of keloid progression, keloid&#xD;
      improvement or resolution with symptomatic relief and cosmetic. This therapeutic option&#xD;
      uniquely provides these benefits for patients who are otherwise lacking efficacious treatment&#xD;
      options for their keloids. Previous published studies of similar regimens suggest that rates&#xD;
      of symptom control and/or stable to reduced keloid size of 75% or higher may be achieved with&#xD;
      our regimen.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically diagnosed keloid&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surgical excision of keloid is either contraindicated or patient has declined&#xD;
             treatment with surgical excision&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Note: patients with keloids that recurred after previous resection are eligible, as&#xD;
             long as the current keloid is either unresectable or patient has decline resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age â‰¥18&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study specific informed consent provided&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior RT to the area of interest that would result in overlap of radiation therapy&#xD;
             fields&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of child bearing age without a negative serum pregnancy test prior to&#xD;
             initiation of RT or unwilling to use contraception prior to and during the radiation&#xD;
             course&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Keloids in areas where radiation therapy introduces unacceptable high risk of toxicity&#xD;
             as determined by the treating radiation oncologist&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness (e.g. symptomatic congestive heart failure,&#xD;
             uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric situation) that would limit compliance&#xD;
             with study requirements as judged by the treatment physicians&#xD;
