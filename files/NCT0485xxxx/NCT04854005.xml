  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out how often the researchers can avoid an ALND in women&#xD;
      with early-stage, node-positive HR+/HER2- breast cancer who are having breast-conserving&#xD;
      treatment. The study researchers think that, if AUS before surgery can help identify people&#xD;
      who may have only 1 or 2 affected lymph nodes, it will be possible to perform the less&#xD;
      radical standard SLNB during breast-conserving surgery.&#xD;
