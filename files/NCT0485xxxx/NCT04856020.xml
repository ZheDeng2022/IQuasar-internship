      Our aim is to assess the role of the gray scale and color Doppler ultrasound in diagnosis of&#xD;
      the different pediatric neck masses .&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neck masses are a common occurrence in the pediatric population and often represent a&#xD;
      diagnostic challenge for the clinician involved . fortunately , the vast majority of these&#xD;
      lesions are ultimately proven to be benign in nature (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though clinical examination and patient's history are the first and indispensable steps&#xD;
      in the initial diagnosis, the role of imaging is crucial, not only to determine whether a&#xD;
      mass represents a true tumour or not , but also to achieve a more correct diagnosis and&#xD;
      determine the extension of the lesion and its relation with the nearby anatomic structures&#xD;
      (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound (US) should serve as the primary initial imaging modality in children for palpable&#xD;
      masses and assessment of superficial glandular structures. Because of the smaller neck size&#xD;
      and less subcutaneous fat, sonographic penetration and resolution is generally improved as&#xD;
      compared with adults (3 ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doppler imaging can also elucidate how flow is distributed within a mass may have diagnostic&#xD;
      significance and help us in determining the nature of the lesion as well as it is of great&#xD;
      importance in assessment of vascular lesions (4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though ultrasound is most common method used for evaluation of pediatric neck masses , and CT&#xD;
      as well as MRI are used as an additional tool when necessary ( 3 ) , few studies have looked&#xD;
      at the sensitivity and specificity of the different imaging modalities of the pediatric neck&#xD;
      masses and most studies have investigated the epidemiology of the pediatric neck masses (5)&#xD;
      which make histopathological diagnosis still the gold standard in distinguishing the etiology&#xD;
      of pediatric neck masses and ruling out malignant disease (6)&#xD;
