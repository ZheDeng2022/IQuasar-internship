  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial evaluates whether engineering gut microbiome using probiotics will alter&#xD;
      the body's immune system to react to stage I-III breast or lung cancers that can be removed&#xD;
      by surgery (operable). Having diverse species of bacteria inside the bowel may help improve&#xD;
      the immune system, particularly the ability of the immune system to recognize cancer. Taking&#xD;
      probiotics may change the diversity and make up of the bacteria in the bowels, and change how&#xD;
      the immune system reacts to breast or lung cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To conduct a pilot study of probiotics prior to surgery in operable breast and lung cancer&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate systemic and intratumoral immunomodulatory effects of probiotics in operable&#xD;
      breast and lung cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo collection of blood samples at baseline and time of surgery, and collection&#xD;
      of stool samples at baseline and after completion of probiotic regimen. Patients receive&#xD;
      probiotics orally (PO) once on day 1, and then twice daily (BID) or three times daily (TID)&#xD;
      for 2-4 weeks before standard of care surgery. Patients also undergo collection of tissue&#xD;
      samples during standard of care surgery.&#xD;
