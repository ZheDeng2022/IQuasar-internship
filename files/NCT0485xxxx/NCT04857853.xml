  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study examines the effects of exercise, ergonomic modifications, and rest breaks&#xD;
      on fatigue and musculoskeletal discomfort during computer tasks. For the purpose of this&#xD;
      project, musculoskeletal discomfort is defined as a constellation of signs and symptoms that&#xD;
      include muscle tension, paresthesia, pain, and/or physical strain in soft tissues and bones.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Static workstation workers frequently experience musculoskeletal discomfort which, according&#xD;
      to a survey of the literature, may include muscle tension, muscle fatigue, paresthesia, pain,&#xD;
      and/or physical strain in soft tissues and bones. The incidence of musculoskeletal discomfort&#xD;
      in office workers like computer users is as high as 50%. In various studies on static&#xD;
      workstation workers, musculoskeletal discomfort has been reported, either separately or in&#xD;
      aggregate, in the neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hands, back, legs, buttocks, ankles, feet,&#xD;
      and chest.&#xD;
