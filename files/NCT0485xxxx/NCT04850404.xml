  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The situation of demand for surgical conditions is quite high when lymph node resection&#xD;
      involved in the surgery type, especially abdominal aortic lymph node dissection, and&#xD;
      commonly, the surgeons complained about the interference from the intestine which pushed the&#xD;
      investigators to increase the level of neuromuscular blockade close to deep NMB. To avoid the&#xD;
      application of deep NMB and promote good surgical conditions for laparoscopic gynecological&#xD;
      surgery with lymph nodes resection, the investigators explored other preoperative ways to&#xD;
      cooperate with surgeons more harmoniously. It's well known that epidural anesthesia and&#xD;
      epidural anesthesia combined with spinal anesthesia have the effect of muscle relaxation&#xD;
      which has been applied in clinical practice widely. One study indicated that the Transverse&#xD;
      Abdominal Plane (TAP) block could change muscle thickness and achieve the effect of muscle&#xD;
      relaxation. It leads investigators to a hypothesis that the sheath of rectus abdominis block&#xD;
      combined with transverse abdominal plane block may suppress the signal transmission of&#xD;
      abdominal nerve, and may be beneficial to improve surgical conditions.&#xD;

      The investigators conducted this study to test the hypothesis that compared with moderate&#xD;
      NMB， the sheath of rectus abdominis block combined with transverse abdominal plane block may&#xD;
      reduce the frequency of additional ask for muscle relaxants to optimize surgical conditions,&#xD;
      and also provide postoperative analgesia on the premise of moderate NMB.&#xD;

    <description>All Patients of group A-M will be administered with rectus abdominis block combined with TAPB after anesthesia. Rocuronium was infused continuously (concentration: 1 mg/ml) when TOF recovered to 1. The starting rate was 0.3mg/kg/h, and the TOF count was maintained between 1~3 (moderate NMB) and recorded during the operation. Whether and how to add rocuronium was based on TOF count and request of surgeons. When TOF Watch- SX showed 4 or ratio, the investigators increased the speed of rocuronium pump infusion and record the score at the time of shallow NMB. When the chief surgeon thought the vision could not satisfy the needs of the operation, rocuronium 0.1mg/kg in bolus was added as a rescue. Then, the pump speed was lowered or even decreased to 0 to make the TOF count recover to 1~3 as soon as possible.</description>
