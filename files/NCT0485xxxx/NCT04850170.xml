  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The subjects in this study are the patients with head and neck cancer after completion of the&#xD;
      radiotherapy. Radiation-induced fibrosis is inevitable and there is no effective treatment to&#xD;
      prevent it. Therefore, there are two parts in this study :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first part is a pilot study. There will be 10 subjects included and manual therapy and&#xD;
      rehabilitation will be arranged for 6 months. The manual therapy would be once a week at&#xD;
      most, and the rehabilitation would be twice a week at most.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part is a randomized controlled study. 60 patients would be randomized divided&#xD;
      into two groups. The group 1 is manual therapy(once a week at most) and rehabilitation(twice&#xD;
      a week at most), and the group 2 is rehabilitation only(twice a week at most). Patients would&#xD;
      be evaluated at baseline, 3rd, 6th, and 12th month. The evaluation is including the degree of&#xD;
      superficial soft tissue fibrosis, numerical rating scale of pain, range of motion(neck),&#xD;
      range of motion(shoulder), width of mouth opening, EORTC QLQ C30, EORTC QLQ H&amp;N 35, and&#xD;
      functional oral intake scale. Besides, swallowing video fluoroscopy would be done at&#xD;
      baseline, 6th, and 12th month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the subject completes the evaluation in the 12th month, the study is ended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the radiation-induced fibrosis is progressed with time, we will follow up the&#xD;
      condition of subjects at the next year and the following third year.&#xD;
