      This is an open-label, two arm interventional exploratory study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of 5-ALA-Phosphate-SFC during the vaccination of subjects against SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      (COVID-19) virus infection to define the safety and to activate the immune system during&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: 100 subjects that were vaccinated with the first dose of a COVID-19 Vaccine (any brand&#xD;
      approved in Bahrain is permitted) and that will be treated with 150mg 5-ALA Phosphate/SFC for&#xD;
      28 days and&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2: 100 subjects that were vaccinated with the first dose of a COVID-19 Vaccine (any brand&#xD;
      approved in Bahrain is permitted) only (Control)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of this clinical study will depend on the type of the vaccine, the subject was&#xD;
      administered with.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoints: All treatment emergent AEs and SAEs Grade III and IV (CTC) with reasonable&#xD;
      possibility of causal relationship to 5-ALA-Phosphate + SFC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum levels of biomarkers (CD4+/- and CD8+/- ) before and after vaccination with and&#xD;
           without ALA/SFC administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total antibody level and neutralizing antibody level&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Measurement of total IgA, IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measurement of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following safety endpoints will be assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical laboratory assessments (hepatic function,)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All reports of AEs and SAEs Grade III and IV (CTC) with reasonable possibility of causal&#xD;
           relationship to 5-ALA-Phosphate + SFC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be assessing the immune system related T-helper cells and antibodies after&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 vaccination for each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From day 0 onwards, all subjects keep a subject diary, which they fill out daily in order to&#xD;
      record the dosage with the study treatment. Patients must meet the testing requirements on&#xD;
      the day of the first vaccination (Day 0) and on the Day of the second vaccination and on Day&#xD;
      28 and on Follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The food supplement 5-Aminolevulinic acid phosphate and Sodium ferrous citrate&#xD;
      (5-ALA-Phosphate + SFC) will be administered orally daily for 4 weeks at the following TOTAL&#xD;
      daily doses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the vaccination + ALA/SFC arm (Arm 1) will receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ In total 3 capsules of 50 mg 5-ALA-Phosphate and 28.68 mg SFC (3.04 mg as Fe) per day, 2&#xD;
      capsules in the morning and 1 capsule in the evening resulting in 150 mg 5-ALA-Phosphate and&#xD;
      86.04 mg SFC ( 9.12 mg as Fe) total daily dose for 28 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heme is critical for appropriate oxygen binding and delivery to remote site and without the&#xD;
      heme contained within the hemoglobin tetramer, multicellular organisms would be unable to&#xD;
      survive. Furthermore HO-1 degrades heme into biliverdin, carbon monoxide (CO), and iron, and&#xD;
      biliverdin is immediately reduced and turned into bilirubin by biliverdin reductase.&#xD;
      Biliverdin/bilirubin and CO both have anti-oxidative functions and they regulate important&#xD;
      biological processes like inflammation, apoptosis, cell proliferation, fibrosis, and&#xD;
      angiogenesis. Therefore, HO-1 is deemed to be a promising drug target (Ryter 2006). HO-1 is a&#xD;
      major anti-inflammatory enzyme and a key regulator that induces immune tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5-ALA-Phosphate + SFC increases heme metabolism and HO-1 via enhancement of porphyrin biology&#xD;
      and utilizes the HO-1 for endothelial pacification strategy. Nishio reported 2014 that&#xD;
      5-aminolevulinic acid, a precursor of heme, in combination with divalent iron (SFC) is also&#xD;
      able to induce HO-1 in vitro (Nishio 2014). This was attributed to the upregulation of heme&#xD;
      synthesis and that 5-ALA+SFC transiently increased the intracellular heme amount through the&#xD;
      phosphorylation of ERK / p38 and the nuclear translocation of a transcription factor Nrf2, as&#xD;
      well as the depletion of a repressor protein BACH1 binding to the promoter site of HO-1.&#xD;
      Similarly, Nakaso et al., 2003, Nishio et al., 2014, Ogawa et al., 2001, Saito et al., 2017&#xD;
      found that hemin administration promoted Nrf2 nuclear translocation and BACH1 dissociation&#xD;
      leading to HO-1 induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ito found in 2018 that the combination of 5-ALA 600 mg and sodium ferrous citrate (SFC) 942&#xD;
      mg upregulated HO-1 in PBMC at 8 h after administration while sole administration of 5-ALA or&#xD;
      SFC was unable to induce HO-1. HO-1 in blood myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells was&#xD;
      also upregulated by the combination of 5-ALA + SFC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary the versatility of the administration of 5-ALA plus iron citrate (SFC) enables the&#xD;
      body to counteract the inflammatory reactions that the virus induces in the endothelial&#xD;
      system and multiple organs in the event of a virus attack by increasing the formation of&#xD;
      HO-1.&#xD;
