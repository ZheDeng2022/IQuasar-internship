      This is a single-center, sequential, open-label, food effect study to determine the&#xD;
      comparative bioavailability of ZN-d5 under fasting and fed conditions, following single-dose&#xD;
      oral administration of ZN-d5. The study will be comprised of a pre-study screening, followed&#xD;
      by administration of a single dose of ZN-d5 under fasted conditions, a washout period,&#xD;
      administration of a single dose of ZN-d5 under fed conditions, and a follow-up period.&#xD;
