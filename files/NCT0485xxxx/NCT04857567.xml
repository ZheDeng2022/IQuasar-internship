  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are few systematic studies on the working environment and mental health of residents&#xD;
      who are at the forefront of Korean medical care. In particular, there is no scientific&#xD;
      research on burnout prevention. Since preventing burnout of surgical residents is directly&#xD;
      related not only to personal well-being but the health of the patients, it is necessary to&#xD;
      care for the individual's psychological state at a social level. This psychological&#xD;
      intervention program that is expected to improve recovery resilience in stressful situations&#xD;
      of residents and prevent burnout is implemented, and its effectiveness is to be verified.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change from baseline at right after 6 cycles of TSC program (up to 24 weeks from baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>As a test developed by Maslach and Jackson (1981), MBI is a tool that measures the sub-concepts of burnout, such as emotional burnout, dehumanization, and personal sense of accomplishment.&#xD;
MBI is a measurement tool used in more than 90% of empirical exhaustion research worldwide, and a test developed to measure the exhaustion of personnel providing interpersonal services including medical workers.&#xD;
In this study, MBI adapted and validated by Kang Jeong-hee and Kim Cheol-woong (2012) is used. Participate in the program according to the type of burnout of the client and measure the change in the burnout level of the participants before and after.</description>
