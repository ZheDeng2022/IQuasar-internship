      INTRODUCTION Non-specific chronic neck pain is one of the most common musculoskeletal&#xD;
      disorders today. Factors related to neck pain are diverse and can affect the person in&#xD;
      different ways. In order to determine the appropriate physical therapy and rehabilitation&#xD;
      program for patients, the functional status of the patients should be evaluated carefully and&#xD;
      the factors affecting this situation and the relationships between them should be taken into&#xD;
      account. Parameters such as pain, balance, disability, muscular performance are associated&#xD;
      with neck pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to examine the relationship between pain and kinesophobia and muscle&#xD;
      performance, balance and dual task in individuals with nonspecific chronic neck pain and to&#xD;
      compare them with asymptomatic individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study included 44 individuals aged 18-65 who applied to Kırıkkale University Faculty of&#xD;
      Medicine Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinic and were diagnosed with non-specific&#xD;
      chronic neck pain by a specialist, and 44 asymptomatic individuals between the ages of 18-65&#xD;
      who did not experience neck pain for the last 1 year for the control group. will be. A total&#xD;
      of 88 individuals will be included. We will evaluate kinesiophobia, pain density, muscles&#xD;
      performance, dual task etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION: Data acquired at the end of this study will be compared by using&#xD;
      appropriate statistical methods and then it will be discussed in comparison with national and&#xD;
      international literature.&#xD;

      METHOD DETAIL&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pain Severity Assessment Pain assessment is a complex task with a number of goals,&#xD;
           including determining the meaning of pain for the patient, understanding the causes as&#xD;
           well as consequences of pain, and determining the effectiveness of pain management. The&#xD;
           Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is one of the most widely used measurement methods in pain&#xD;
           measurement. GAS is a one-dimensional linear scale. It is easy to use, the results are&#xD;
           reproducible, and it can be used in a wide variety of environments. VAS is a continuous&#xD;
           scale consisting of a 10 cm (100 mm) horizontal or vertical line. While determining the&#xD;
           pain intensity; (0 points) qualifies as &quot;no pain&quot; and (100 points on a 100 mm scale)&#xD;
           &quot;pain as bad as possible&quot; or &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;. While calculating the pain&#xD;
           severity score, the patient chooses the appropriate point from the 10 cm line. It&#xD;
           indicates the presence of no pain on a scale of 100 mm (0-4 mm), mild pain (5-44 mm),&#xD;
           moderate pain (45-74 mm), severe pain (75-100 mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Posture Evaluation The postures of the subjects participating in the study will be&#xD;
           evaluated by the standard posture analysis method. Round shoulder, anterior tilt,&#xD;
           kyphosis, etc. postural disturbances will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Joint Range of Motion Assessment (ARA) Normal range of motion will be evaluated using an&#xD;
           Electrogoniometer. In the sitting position, the flexion, extension, lateral flexion and&#xD;
           rotation movements of the relevant region will be measured and recorded. Evaluations of&#xD;
           joint movements will be made in 3 repetitions and the average value of these 3&#xD;
           measurements will be determined by calculating.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Muscular Strength Assessment Muscle strength of the neck flexor and extensor muscles&#xD;
           will be measured using the Stabilizer (Chattanooga Stabilizer Group Inc., Hixson, TN),&#xD;
           and Hand-Held Dynamometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Assessment of Muscular Endurance Resistance measurements will be made on the extensor&#xD;
           and flexor muscles of the neck in a stable position, in the supine and prone positions,&#xD;
           respectively. While measuring the endurance of the extensor neck muscles, the patient's&#xD;
           legs will be straight and his arms will be positioned around the head. Loads of 2 and 4&#xD;
           kilograms will be applied for women and men, respectively. The test will be done by&#xD;
           stretching the head just above the bed and lifting it up for as long (seconds) as&#xD;
           possible. Endurance evaluation of the deep cervical flexor muscles will be started with&#xD;
           the subject in the hooked position on the back and the hands in the free position on the&#xD;
           abdomen. The case will be asked to raise his head slightly high enough for the index and&#xD;
           middle finger of a hand to pass along with the instruction. After the patient is taught&#xD;
           this position, a slight amount (30%) of craniocervical flexion will be requested from&#xD;
           the beginning as if yes. While the subject is in this position, the hand support will be&#xD;
           pulled slightly and the test will be started in this position. The time in which the&#xD;
           craniocervical maintains the position while maintaining flexion will be recorded in&#xD;
           seconds. The test will be terminated when the patient does one of the four situations&#xD;
           stated below;&#xD;
&#xD;
      1- In cases where the patient feels a lot of pain and states that he cannot continue 2- In&#xD;
      cases where the patient does not feel any pain but endurance ends 3- If the physiotherapist&#xD;
      determines that the patient has lost the craniocervical flexion position despite maintaining&#xD;
      the position 4- If the physiotherapist observes that the subject lifts his head higher than&#xD;
      it should be, the endurance test ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resistance of the case for 60 seconds will be considered sufficient for the termination&#xD;
      of the endurance test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.Muscular Shortness Assessment In order to determine the muscle shortness of individuals;&#xD;
      Standard shortness will be assessed for the pectoral muscles and the adductor and internal&#xD;
      rotator muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Kinesiophobia Assessment In evaluating the level of kinesiophobia, the 17-question &quot;Tampa&#xD;
      Kinesophobia Scale (TSI)&quot; developed by Vlaeyen et al. and validated in Turkish by Tunca&#xD;
      Yılmaz and her colleagues will be used. The higher the calculated score, the higher the&#xD;
      person's fear of movement will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Spouse Apology Assessment The Neck Disability Index (NDI) is the most widely used tool to&#xD;
      measure perceived disability associated with neck pain. The Turkish version of the scale,&#xD;
      made by Aslan et al. consists of 10 parts. The questionnaire includes parameters of pain&#xD;
      intensity, self-care, lifting, reading, headaches, concentration, work, driving, sleep and&#xD;
      activities of daily living. As a result of scoring; (0-4 points) means no disability, (5-14&#xD;
      points) mild disability, (15-24 points) moderate disability, (25-34 points) severe disability&#xD;
      and (35 points and above) total disability .&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.Dynamic Balance Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Star Balance Test (YDT) will be used in dynamic balance assessment. Participants stand in the&#xD;
      middle of a platform consisting of eight lines that extend at an angle of 45 ° to each other.&#xD;
      During the test, the person should rest on one lower limb while reaching as far as possible&#xD;
      along each of the eight lines with the other. 8 directions anterior (A), anterolateral (AL),&#xD;
      lateral (L), posterolateral (PL), posterior (P), posteromedial (PM), medial (M) and&#xD;
      anteromedial (AM). The person is asked to make a light touch on the determined lines and&#xD;
      return the reaching leg to the center, and to stand with one leg in the center. Then the&#xD;
      maximum distance reached is recorded. If it will be done with the left foot, it is requested&#xD;
      to lie counterclockwise, if it will be done with the right foot, it is desired to lie in a&#xD;
      clockwise direction. The following formula is used to calculate the star balance test score:&#xD;
&#xD;
      YDT score = (Reaching distance / Leg length) * 100 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      10. Static Balance Evaluation Static balance will be evaluated with the &quot;One Leg Standing&#xD;
      Test (TBÜD)&quot;. This test measures static balance and static standing ability. It also provides&#xD;
      information about the fall risk of the person. The time starts when the person lifts one leg&#xD;
      from the ground, and ends when he puts it on the ground. The total time is recorded by the&#xD;
      clinician. If the person can keep one leg up for 30 seconds, the test is terminated. If the&#xD;
      position can be maintained for less than 10 seconds, the person has an imbalance, and if it&#xD;
      is maintained for less than 5 seconds, it can be interpreted that there is a risk of falling&#xD;
      for the person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11. Dynamic Balance and Physical Performance Evaluation The &quot;Timed Get Up and Go Test&quot; will&#xD;
      be used for dynamic balance and physical performance evaluation. In this test, the&#xD;
      participant should get up without holding the arms of the standard chair in which he or she&#xD;
      sits, and after 3 meters of walking, he must return to the chair without touching anything.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12. Walking Speed Assessment The 10 meter walking test will be used to evaluate the walking&#xD;
      speed. The person will be asked to walk 14 meters, but the first 2 and the last 2 meters will&#xD;
      not be evaluated. It will be calculated in seconds in how long a person takes this distance&#xD;
      while walking normally. The time will be recorded in meters / second (m / s), provided that&#xD;
      the time starts when the person's foot is at the starting line of the 2nd meter and ends when&#xD;
      the 12 meter line is crossed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      13. Dual-Task Assessment The dual task will be evaluated motor-motor and motor-cognitively&#xD;
      during walking. Participants will be subjected to 6 different walks. Participants will be&#xD;
      given a clear explanation about the tests before the tests and will be informed about their&#xD;
      comfort. Participants will be given a trial test only once before the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 m Walking Test (single duty)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 m Walking Test + The task of carrying 2 glasses of water on a standard tray without&#xD;

           the clinician during the test (motor-cognitive dual task)&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the tests, single tasks will be included for reference. The completion times of the&#xD;
      motor-motor and motor-cognitive dual tasks, which are evaluated 2 in 2 each with 4 different&#xD;
      walking forms, will be recorded and the result will be reached. The following calculation&#xD;
      method will be used for the result:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dual Mission Effect = (Single Mission Performance - Dual Mission Performance) / Single&#xD;
      Mission Performance x 100&#xD;
