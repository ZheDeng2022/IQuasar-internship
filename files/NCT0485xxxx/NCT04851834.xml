  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, dose-exploration, combination/expansion study, which will&#xD;
      start by evaluating the safety and tolerability of NTX-301, an oral DNMT1 inhibitor, as a&#xD;
      monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumours, who have failed treatment with available&#xD;
      therapies known to be active for treatment of their corresponding disease. It will then&#xD;
      explore the safety and tolerability of NTX-301 in combination with platinum-based therapy in&#xD;
      patients with ovarian and bladder cancer. Optionally, the safety and tolerability of NTX-301&#xD;
      in combination with Temozolomide (TMZ) in patients with Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1)&#xD;
      mutated high-grade glioma will also be assessed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Dose Exploration (Phase 1a, n~25): This part of the study will assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of NTX-301 and to identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended&#xD;
      Phase 2 Dose (RP2D). It will initiate with a dose escalation using a 3+3 design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combination Dose and Disease Expansion (Phase 1b-2a, n~60): The study will be expanded in&#xD;
      specific subsets of patients with solid tumours and with combination therapy as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 1 (Phase 1b, n~20): Dose Escalation, NTX-301 platinum-based doublet therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 2 (Phase 2a, n~40): Dose Expansion, NTX-301 platinum-based doublet therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with advanced ovarian &amp; bladder cancer considered to be incurable by the&#xD;
      investigator and for which available anti-cancer therapy has been exhausted will be enrolled&#xD;
      for this component. Patients will be given NTX-301 at the MTD determined in Phase 1a. This&#xD;
      will be combined with a platinum-based agent that will be administered by IV infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional Cohort -High-Grade Glioma Combination Dose &amp; Disease Expansion (Phase 1b-2a, n~40)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 3 (Phase 1b, n~20): Dose Escalation, NTX-301 combination therapy with TMZ&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 4 (Phase 2a, n~20): Dose Expansion, NTX-301 combination therapy with TMZ&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with IDH1 mutated high-grade glioma that have commenced initial chemoradiotherapy&#xD;
      with temozolomide and are yet to commence Temozolomide maintenance therapy will be enrolled&#xD;
      for this component. Patients will be given NTX-301 at the MTD determined in Phase 1a. This&#xD;
      will be combined with TMZ that will be administered orally.&#xD;

          1. Ability to understand and be willing to sign an informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female, ≥ 18 years old at the time of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Diagnosis of histologically or cytologically confirmed:&#xD;

               1. Locally advanced or metastatic cancer (all solid tumours). Patients must be&#xD;
                  considered refractory or intolerant to standard (SOC) therapies or have refused&#xD;
                  standard therapy (Phase 1a, Dose Escalation Monotherapy), OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Locally advanced or metastatic cancer (ovarian or bladder cancer). Patients must&#xD;
                  be considered refractory or intolerant to standard (SOC) therapies or have&#xD;
                  refused standard therapy (Phase 1b, Dose &amp; Disease Expansion Combination Arms,&#xD;
                  Arms 1 &amp; 2), OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. High-grade glioma, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) that are either: Newly&#xD;

                  care (SOC) chemoradiation therapy as per part 1 of the eviQ protocol 3364 v.1.&#xD;
                  Patients successfully enrolled will receive a subsequent combination of NTX-301&#xD;
                  and Temozolomide on day 1 of their first 28-day cycle of part 2 of the eviQ&#xD;
                  protocol 3364 v.1. This combination arm replaces the Temozolomide monotherapy SOC&#xD;
                  maintenance therapy as described in Part 2 of the eviQ protocol 3364 v.1. In&#xD;
                  order to prevent any potential delays after radiotherapy, patients can be&#xD;
                  enrolled at any time during Chemoradiation (eviQ Part 1). In order to commence&#xD;
                  the TMZ combination arms the patient is required to complete the full 42 days of&#xD;
                  eviQ part 1, and also receive their first dose of the TMZ combination arm within&#xD;
                  the screening window. This timing can be adjusted based on medical need on a&#xD;
                  patient-by-patient basis as per the discretion of the principal investigator&#xD;
