  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is conducted to record continuous electrophysiological signals from intact and&#xD;
      ischemic bowel tissue during colonic resection surgery, in order to train the Exero Medical&#xD;
      Leak Detection System classification algorithm on detection of ischemic conditions.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects with Exero's Smart Drain Device Attached This arm contains subjects which will have Exero's leak detection Device used: Exero Smart Drain is placed on their large bowel during colonic resection surgery (either open, laparoscopic or robotic). The study aims to demonstrate that the parameters measured by the device in in-vivo, non-disrupted tissue are different than parameters measured in ischemic tissue. Once this data is collected a detection algorithm can be trained. This procedure will add no more than 20 minutes to the existing procedure that is performed per hospital standard overall and will enable collection of control vs. ischemia induced clinical data, essential to developing the detection algorithms.</description>

    <description>the Exero Leak Detection System components used in this study are:&#xD;
Smart drain - a surgical drain with added sensing electrodes&#xD;
Transceiver /Recording Unit (TRU) - a wearable placed outside the body on intact skin and is connected to the implanted electrodes. The unit also acts as a wireless connection to the Monitoring Subsystem.&#xD;
Monitoring Subsystem - a tablet or a computer connected wirelessly to the transceiver providing logging, applying analysis algorithms on the logged signals and providing indication/alerts to the medical staff derived from the signals recorded by the electrodes.</description>
