      This study seeks to evaluate how secondary data retrieved from remote physiological&#xD;
      monitoring performed during routine outpatient/at-home care periods can allow for the&#xD;
      discovery of novel physiomarkers that predict acute deterioration or hospitalization among&#xD;
      people testing positive for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most recent research publications and clinical trials have exclusively focused on the&#xD;
      hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) care of COVID-19 patients. Few have focused on how to&#xD;
      direct care delivered at home, where the majority of coronavirus infected will recover, and&#xD;
      how and when to rescue those who are at immediate risk for poor outcomes. To standardize the&#xD;
      home monitoring process and offer guidance in this uncharted territory, the researchers have&#xD;
      created a method for outpatient management of COVID-19 patients and high suspicion&#xD;
      influenza-like illness (ILI) for Emory University Hospital. This includes the newly&#xD;
      implemented model of clinics including in-person ambulatory management in the Acute&#xD;
      Respiratory Clinic (ARC), the Virtual Outpatient Management Clinic (VOMC), and the Emory&#xD;
      COVID-19 Outpatient Remote Monitoring Registry (E-CORMR). Initial analysis of the management&#xD;
      system, particularly in risk tier assignment, has shown that assigning risk tiers early can&#xD;
      help to identify patients at risk for clinical deterioration. The researchers have also&#xD;
      demonstrated symptom profiles and durations of the &quot;typical&quot; outpatient disease course. The&#xD;
      E-CORMR was used to create a dashboard for improved management of these frequently complex&#xD;
      patients. It was determined after its creation that it could also be used for research&#xD;
      purposes to store data collected from physiologic parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to develop algorithms using secondary data abstracted from remote&#xD;
      monitoring devices that were collected within the E-CORMR. The researchers propose to derive&#xD;
      robust algorithms through the analysis of that data that identify a potential&#xD;
      hospitalization. The findings will not only improve the management of patients with known or&#xD;
      suspected COVID-19 but also provide information that allows early intervention on patients at&#xD;
      risk of decompensation. This information can then be used by other healthcare systems to care&#xD;
      for patients more safely at home, thus reducing the impact of COVID-19 on overburdened acute&#xD;
      care settings and preventing poor outcomes.&#xD;
