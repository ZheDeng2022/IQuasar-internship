  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is the pilot phase of a pragmatic randomized clinical trial comparing outcomes&#xD;
      among older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) receiving&#xD;
      home-delivered meals. This pilot will test and validate vital elements and procedures&#xD;
      including: 1) enrolling persons with ADRD on Meals on Wheels (MOW) programs' waiting lists to&#xD;
      receive one of the two types of meals; 2) recruiting a subsample of participants and&#xD;
      caregivers to participate in telephone interviews; 3) extracting and transferring program&#xD;
      data to Brown University; 4) linking participant data with Medicare and nursing home&#xD;
      assessment data. Persons with ADRD receiving meals and their caregivers will be recruited to&#xD;
      pilot interview guides. The interviews will provide important process and mechanistic&#xD;
      information about the experiences receiving meals and participants' outcomes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      235 individuals on the waiting list at three MOW programs (Neighborly Senior Services in&#xD;
      Clearwater, Florida; Visiting Nurse Association of Texas in Dallas, Texas; Meals on Wheels -&#xD;
      San Antonio in San Antonio, Texas) will be randomized to one of the following modes of&#xD;
      delivery: 1) meals that are delivered multiple times per week by a MOW program volunteer or&#xD;
      paid driver and includes socialization and a wellness check or 2) frozen meals that are&#xD;
      mailed to participants' homes every two weeks. Persons with ADRD receiving meals and their&#xD;
      caregivers will be recruited to pilot interview guides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to test and validate procedures to recruit participants with ADRD and&#xD;
      evaluate their outcomes in partnership with MOW programs. The study also aims to characterize&#xD;
      differences in the processes and potential mechanisms contributing to outcomes between the&#xD;
      two modes of meal delivery among older adults with ADRD. The qualitative interviews with&#xD;
      participants and their caregivers will provide important process and mechanistic information&#xD;
      about the experiences receiving meals and participants' outcomes.&#xD;
