  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Considering the important growing development of gaming in the world, this research area has&#xD;
      developed considerably over the last few years. Even if it seems to be well admitted that&#xD;
      video gamers showed better cognitive functions (e.g. visual selective attention, cognitive&#xD;
      flexibility, task switching) parameters compared to non video gamers there is a constant&#xD;
      concern for optimizing performance as for all other kind of athletes. However to our&#xD;
      knowledge, only one randomized controlled trial have investigated the potential benefits of&#xD;
      dietary supplementation on cognitive function and performance in video gamers. The use of&#xD;
      microalgea as molecule of interest sources is a recent promising approach also to meet&#xD;
      societal challenge as the maintain of biodiversity/landscape.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the purpose of this study is to examine whether acute (single-dose) and chronic (1&#xD;
      month) supplementation of Microphyt's phaeosol ingredients (BrainPhyt) ingested with or&#xD;
      without guarana extract (natural source of caffeine), would affect cognitive function and&#xD;
      gaming performance in experienced video gamers.&#xD;
