      Healthy adult participants will be challenged with the H1N1 Influenza virus and then treated&#xD;
      with either SAB-176 or placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 60 eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either SAB-176&#xD;
      (up to 25 mg/kg dose) or placebo. Healthy adult participants will be pre-screened for&#xD;
      serosuitability for Influenza A/California/2009 H1N1 challenge virus. Serosuitable&#xD;
      participants who sign the study specific informed consent form (ICF) will be challenged with&#xD;
      an intranasal administration of Influenza A/California/2009 H1N1 virus on Day 0. Participants&#xD;
      will be given intravenous (IV) infusion of SAB-176 or placebo on Day 1. Participants will be&#xD;
      held in quarantine until Day 8.&#xD;

             participant safety, as defined by medical history, physical examination, (including&#xD;
             vital signs), ECG, and routine laboratory tests as determined by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A documented medical history prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The following criteria are applicable to female participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to&#xD;
                  enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Females of non-childbearing potential:&#xD;
&#xD;
             A.) Post-menopausal females: defined as having a history of amenorrhea for &gt;12 months&#xD;
             with no alternative medical cause, and/or by follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level&#xD;
             &gt;40mIU/mL, confirmed by laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
             b.) Documented status as being surgically sterile (e.g. tubal ligation, hysterectomy,&#xD;
             bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The following criteria apply to female and male participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
             a.) Female participants of childbearing potential must use one form of highly&#xD;
             effective contraception. Hormonal methods must be in place from at least 2 weeks prior&#xD;
             to the first study visit. The contraception used must continue until 28 days after the&#xD;
             date of dosing with IMP&gt; Highly effective contraception is as described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -Established use of hormonal methods of contraception described below (for a minimum&#xD;
             of 2 weeks prior to the first study visit). When hormonal methods of contraception are&#xD;
             used, male partners are required to use a condom with a spermicide: i.) Combined&#xD;
             (oestrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with&#xD;
             inhibition of ovulation: Oral, Intravaginal, or Transdermal ii.) progestogen-only&#xD;
             hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: Oral, Injectable, or&#xD;
             Implantable&#xD;
&#xD;
             b.) Intrauterine device c.) Intrauterine hormone-releasing system d.) bilateral tubal&#xD;
             ligation e.) Male sterilization (with the appropriate post vasectomy documentation of&#xD;
             the absence of sperm in the ejaculate) where the vasectomised male is the sole partner&#xD;
             for that woman.&#xD;
&#xD;
             f.) True abstinence - sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only&#xD;
             if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of&#xD;
             risk associated with the study treatments. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs&#xD;
             to be in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual&#xD;
             lifestyle of the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
             B.) Male participants must agree to the contraceptive requirements below at entry to&#xD;
             quarantine and continuing until 28 days after the date of dosing with IMP:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Use a condom with a spermicide to prevent pregnancy in a female partner or to&#xD;
                  prevent exposure of any partner (male and female) to the IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Male sterilization with the appropriate post vasectomy documentation of the&#xD;
                  absence of sperm in in the ejaculate (please note that the use of condom with&#xD;
                  spermicide will still be required to prevent partner exposure).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. In addition, for female partners of childbearing potential, that partner must use&#xD;
                  another form of contraception such as one of the highly effective methods&#xD;
                  mentioned above for female participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. True abstinence - sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only&#xD;
                  if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period&#xD;
                  of risk associated with the study treatments. The reliability of sexual&#xD;
                  abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical&#xD;
                  trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
             C.) In addition to the contraceptive requirements above, male participants must agree&#xD;
             not to donate sperm following discharge from quarantine until 28 days after the date&#xD;
