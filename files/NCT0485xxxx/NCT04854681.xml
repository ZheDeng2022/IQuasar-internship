  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TQB2928 is a promising new molecular entity that mediates blockade of CD47 and SIRPα and&#xD;
      enhances the phagocytosis of cancer cells by macrophages. In preclinical in vivo models,&#xD;
      TQB2928 was active against a wide range of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. This is&#xD;
      the first-in-human phase 1 trial of TQB2928 in patients with advanced solid tumors and&#xD;
      hematological malignancies.&#xD;

             (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior, or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or&#xD;
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of&#xD;
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient&#xD;
