  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) GDM is the most common complication that affects the&#xD;
      health of the child and mother during pregnancy. Objectives was to determine the effects of&#xD;
      Antenatal exercises on glucose levels, mode of delivery and APGAR Score in females with&#xD;
      gestational diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Randomized controlled trial study was conducted on N= 72 pregnant females at department&#xD;
      of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Mian Munshi DHQ Hospital, Lahore after Ethical approval of&#xD;
      synopsis from institutional Review Board of the University of Lahore . The data was entered&#xD;
      and analyzed using SPSS Version 24. .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as glucose intolerance resulting in&#xD;
      hyperglycemia of variable severity with onset during pregnancy. During pregnancy, GDM is the&#xD;
      most common complication occurs and it affects the health of the child and mother.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aim was to investigate the effect of antenatal exercise on clinical outcomes in&#xD;
      pregnant females with gestational diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Randomized controlled trial. Settings: It was conducted at department of&#xD;
      Gynecology and Obstetrics, Mian Munshi DHQ Hospital, Lahore.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The calculated sample size is 30 in each group using APGAR scale as outcome measure. After&#xD;
      adding 20% drop out the sample size will become 30+6 = 36 in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling Technique: Purposive sampling technique&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measuring Tools -&#xD;
&#xD;
      • APGAR scale DATA COLLECTION PROCEDURE&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the participants visited from the gynecology department after the diagnosis of GDM was&#xD;
      considered after the initial screening test. Following the inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
      before adding them to the study. These patients were allotted in two groups i.e. group A and&#xD;
      group B via the lottery method. Informed consent were taken in written form showing that they&#xD;
      are willing to participate in the study. The therapist had assessed the patients before the&#xD;
      start of rehabilitation program:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A includes participants received the routine physical therapy only. Group B includes&#xD;
      participants were given exercise program from 20- 24 weeks of gestation to till the date of&#xD;
      delivery, with addition of the routine physical therapy plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Routine Physical Therapy (RPT) + Insulin therapy Group A- (n=36) participants&#xD;
      received only routine treatment for gestational diabetes mellitus which includes insulin&#xD;
      therapy and diet control programs guided by a gynecologist and routine physical therapy which&#xD;
      includes walk for 1 hr which includes proper warm up and cool down periods, three times in a&#xD;
      week from 20-24 weeks of gestation to till delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group -B-Antenatal + RPT + Insulin therapy+ Exercise Group B- (n=36) participants completed&#xD;
      routine therapy and antenatal exercises which includes Aerobic and strengthening Exercises&#xD;
      with workout 3 days a week, for 2 weeks (6 sessions under the supervision of physiotherapist&#xD;
      and remaining was performed at home along with routine treatment for gestational diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus which includes insulin therapy and diet control program as guided by gynecologist.&#xD;
      The exercise program was started with quarter-hour moderate-intensity aerobic activity and&#xD;
      slowly rising the duration to a maximum of half-hour each exercise session. A 10-15-minute&#xD;
      warm-up physical exercise, and a 10-15-minute cool-down period was included. The duration of&#xD;
      the exercise was assessed by using target pulse rate, the Borg scale (rate of perceived&#xD;
      exertion), or the 'talk test.' American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Guideline&#xD;
      corresponded to exercise of moderate-intensity were followed. Aerobic exercise includes a&#xD;
      brisk walk to train the main muscle groups which includes, chest muscles, deltoid,&#xD;
      quadriceps, and calf muscles were targeted the main muscle groups .In sitting position,&#xD;
      strengthening exercise were performed in which one end of the Thera band was placed under the&#xD;
      foot, hold for 5 seconds then released along with 10 repetitions. The movements were&#xD;
      involvement of wall push-ups, shoulder flexion, shoulder abduction, knee extension and ankle&#xD;
      plantar flexion. It was guided that pregnant women avoid exercise promptly if they experience&#xD;
      any signs such as dizziness, dyspnea, amniotic fluid leaking or vaginal bleeding. Besides,&#xD;
      group participant will wear loose-fitting clothing and keep hydrated while exercising in an&#xD;
      environment with adequate temperature and moisture. All sessions of the exercise under&#xD;
      supervision were fully documented on successful completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality of all the details were ensured. A blind study (to remove chance of bias), in&#xD;
      which random allocation of women between two categories, via the lottery system was executed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow Ups Total 3 sessions per week were given to the patients for 60 min., from 20- 24&#xD;
      weeks of gestation to till the time of delivery. Home plan was given to the participants and&#xD;
      follow up was done whenever participants came to gynecology department.&#xD;
