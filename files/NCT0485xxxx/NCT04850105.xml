    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-interventional, Long-term, multinational cohort safety study of&#xD;
      patients with Hereditary Transthyretin Amyloidosis with Polyneuropathy (hATTR-PN). The&#xD;
      overarching goal of this study is to further characterize the long-term safety of TEGSEDI&#xD;
      (inotersen) in patients with hATTR-PN under real-world conditions.&#xD;

      Study Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      hATTR-PN is an inherited, progressive, fatal disease caused by misfolded transthyretin (TTR)&#xD;
      proteins that accumulate as amyloid fibrils predominantly in the peripheral nerves, heart,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract, and other organs. hATTR-PN is a rare disease and there are no large&#xD;
      epidemiological studies that reliably provide an indication of its prevalence. The worldwide&#xD;
      distribution is unequal, with higher rates in Portugal, Japan, Brazil, Northern Sweden, and&#xD;
      the US. Current estimates suggest there may be 10,000 afflicted patients worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TEGSEDI (inotersen) is an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of human TTR protein synthesis.&#xD;
      In Europe and Canada, TEGSEDI is indicated for the treatment of Stage 1 or Stage 2&#xD;
      polyneuropathy in adult patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR). In the&#xD;
      US, TEGSEDI is indicated for treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary TTR-mediated&#xD;
      amyloidosis in adults. Efficacy has been demonstrated in patients with hATTR-PN, as reflected&#xD;
      by a slowing or reversal of disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching goal of this study is to further characterize the long-term safety of TEGSEDI&#xD;
      in patients with hATTR-PN under real-world conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in Europe, US, and Canada will be enrolled from centers that manage patients with&#xD;
      hATTR-PN. Physicians participating in the study will be instructed to invite all patients who&#xD;
      meet study eligibility criteria to enroll until the enrollment period is closed.&#xD;
