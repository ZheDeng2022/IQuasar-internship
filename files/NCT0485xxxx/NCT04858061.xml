  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol-related stimuli emerge as high-risk cues for individuals diagnosed with alcohol use&#xD;
      disorder (AUD). Relapse after treatment remains a challenge in AUD. Attentional bias (AB)&#xD;
      towards alcohol-related stimuli, alcohol craving and anxiety are factors contributing to&#xD;
      relapse, even after completion of treatment. The current study aims to test the efficacy of a&#xD;
      Virtual Reality Cue-Exposure Therapy (VR-CET) patients diagnosed with severe AUD, who made&#xD;
      several failed attempts to cease alcohol drinking. It is expected that VR-CET is more&#xD;
      efficient in reducing AUD symptomatology and preventing relapses than CBT. 80 participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to experimental or control group. Data regarding alcohol craving,&#xD;
      anxiety and AB will be assessed prior to, at the end of and 3, 6 and 12 months after&#xD;
      completion of the treatment. The experimental group will receive six VR-CET booster sessions&#xD;
      over the course of five weeks. VR-CET booster sessions consist of exposure to preferred&#xD;
      alcoholic beverages and alcohol-related contexts in a VR environment. Throughout the six&#xD;
      VR-CET sessions, momentary anxiety and alcohol craving levels will be assessed. The control&#xD;
      group will receive CBT.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The efficacy of VR Cue Exposure Therapy and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy will be investigated&#xD;
      on 80 primarly diagnosed by AUD. Participants will be recruited from Hospital Clínico de&#xD;
      Barcelona (Barcelona, Spain). They will be randomly assigned to two booster treatments: 6&#xD;
      sessions of cue exposure therapy (CET-VR) via virtual reality (VR) versus 6 sessions of&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each session will start with filling the questionnaires that will be mentioning below.&#xD;
      Secondly, visuo-tactile and visuo-motor stimulation will be induced to participants to get&#xD;
      illusory feelings of ownership over the virtual body. Then patients will be choosing their&#xD;
      favorite beverages and favorite places to have drinks. During exposure to a specific beverage&#xD;
      in VR, participants' olfactory sense will also be stimulated by pouring the beverage onto a&#xD;
      cotton and making the participant smell.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Virtual Reality-based Cue Exposure Therapy (CET-VR): the intervention will consist of 6&#xD;
           sessions (two per week) lasting approximately 50 minutes. Throughout the sessions, the&#xD;
           patient will be exposed to an individualized hierarchy of different VR environments that&#xD;
           simulate situations and stimuli related to alcohol consumption. During exposure, the&#xD;
           level of craving and anxiety experienced by patients will be assessed using visual&#xD;
           analog scales. Once the level of craving has decreased sufficiently (40% of the initial&#xD;
           level) in a given situation, it will move to another of greater difficulty to complete&#xD;
           the hierarchy. The objective of the intervention is to reduce the craving response of&#xD;
           patients in these situations through habituation and extinction processes, so that the&#xD;
           generalization of the responses learned during treatment to real situations reduces the&#xD;
           risk of relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT): the intervention will consist of 6 sessions (two per&#xD;
           week) of approximately 50 minutes duration. Throughout the six sessions, special work&#xD;
           will be done on motivation for change and maintenance of abstinence, as well as relapse&#xD;
           prevention (identification of risk situations, coping strategies, assertiveness,&#xD;
           drinking rejection skills and problem solving).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental evaluation consists of sitting in front of a computer, with an eye-tracking&#xD;
      instrument that records the visuo-motor activity. The experiment consists of exploring the&#xD;
      attentional bias towards images related to alcohol consumption through different variables&#xD;
      that the eye-tracker will provide, such as dwell time, the first fixation towards the images&#xD;
      or the total number of fixations towards an area of interest (the areas of interest are&#xD;
      either images related to alcohol consumption or neutral images such as office objects). The&#xD;
      experiment with eye-tracking technology has a few previous steps to equal in attentional bias&#xD;
      and make pairs of images related to alcohol consumption and neutral images. Attentional bias&#xD;
      is described in the literature as the physical property of a object to capture attention to&#xD;
      the detriment of other objects. The eye-tracking technology is a non-invasive technology, it&#xD;
      is a stable device that is placed in front of the computer, and the eye-tracker GazePoint.&#xD;
      This device will be used in studies 2 and 4 of this project. The device is placed&#xD;
      approximately 60 centimeters distance between the computer and the participant through&#xD;
      infrared light, records the visuo-motor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The previous steps of the attentional bias evaluation experiment towards images related to&#xD;
      alcohol consumption through eye-tracking technology have been developed in approximately 6&#xD;
      months, with collaboration between the Department of Clinical Psychology and Psychobiology&#xD;
      and the Department of Psychology of the University of Barcelona.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial evaluation session will be approximately one hour. The same evaluation&#xD;
      instruments with the same procedure will be implemented in the post-treatment session, once&#xD;
      finished either virtual reality or cognitive-behavioral therapy. The eye-tracking and&#xD;
      psychophysiological recording instruments will NOT be used during the treatment, but only in&#xD;
      the pre- and post-treatment evaluation sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate the effectiveness of both interventions in the medium and long term, all&#xD;
      participants in the study will be examined in follow-up sessions after 3, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
      Follow-up will consist of self-report evaluation of alcohol craving and anxiety, maintenance&#xD;
      of abstinence, and alcohol consumption (in case of relapse).&#xD;
