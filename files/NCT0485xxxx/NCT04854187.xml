  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate personal protective aids (air purifier and&#xD;
      N95) as a therapeutic measure in people with hypertension and diabetes exposed to high levels&#xD;
      of PM2.5 in India.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Air pollution is the largest environmental cause of disease and premature death in the world&#xD;
      today, disproportionally affecting low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) such as India.&#xD;
      Numerous studies have shown that exposure to particulate matter &lt;2.5 µm (PM2.5) can&#xD;
      contribute to cardiovascular disease and mortality, which is partially attributable to the&#xD;
      development of cardiometabolic conditions such as hypertension and diabetes. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that the use of personal protective aids (home air-purifier and N-95 mask) can decrease&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure (SBP) in people with hypertension and decrease fasting blood glucose&#xD;
      (FBG) in those with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective randomized cross-over study in Dalkhola, India- an area of high ambient&#xD;
      PM2.5 levels. Participants between 18 and 70 years of age with hypertension (n=130) and&#xD;
      diabetes (n=33) will be invited to participate in the study. They will be randomized to&#xD;
      either an intervention or control arm for 4 weeks, after which they will cross over to the&#xD;
      other arm following a 2-week washout period. The intervention period will consist of using an&#xD;
      indoor air-purifier at night and an N-95 mask when outdoors. Control period will involve&#xD;
      using an identical air purifier and facemask, with the filter removed (sham filtration).&#xD;
      Participants and outcome assessors will be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the study is the absolute reduction in SBP among people with&#xD;
      hypertension and absolute reduction in FBG among people with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first randomized controlled trial to evaluate personal protective aids as a&#xD;
      therapeutic measure in people with hypertension and diabetes exposed to high levels of PM2.5.&#xD;
      Given the high burden of air pollution in LMICs, there is an urgent need for adaptation&#xD;
      measures targeting people at high risk for mortality from this exposure. The results of our&#xD;
      study will demonstrate if personal protective aids can be a viable adaptation measure for&#xD;
      people living with hypertension and diabetes in areas with a high burden of air pollution.&#xD;

    <description>Intervention arm will be for 4 weeks. Blood pressure and/or blood glucose will be recorded on day 0; end of week 2 and end of the intervention. Participants in the intervention group will be asked to use an indoor air purifier (Atlanta Healthcare 7-Stage 43-Watt Air Purifier) daily for 4 weeks between the hours of ¬8 PM and 8 AM. The purifier will be placed in their bedroom or in the room where participants sleep at night. When the participants are outdoors (commuting, working outdoors, running errands, etc.), they will be asked to use a N95 mask (PureMe Reusable N95 Anti-Pollution Mask). It is a reusable mask which can be washed by the participants. Every 2 weeks, the filter of the mask will be replaced, and the filter of the indoor purifier will be washed.</description>

    <description>At the end of either control or intervention arm, participants will have a washout period of 2 weeks, after which participants will be crossed over to the other group for the subsequent 4 weeks. For example, after Participant AB is in intervention arm for 4 weeks, he/she will then have a wash out period of 2 weeks in which they will return to their usual state of living. At the end of the washout period, the participant AB will be put in the control arm for 4 weeks.</description>

    <description>Control arm will be for 4 weeks. Blood pressure, blood glucose and indoor air pollution level will be recorded similarly as in the intervention group on day 0, end of week 2 and week 4. The participant will be provided an air purifier and a N-95 mask (of the same manufacturer), with the filter removed. At the end of two weeks, the health worker will make dummy adjustments to the mask and indoor air purifier, to maintain blinding of the participant.</description>
