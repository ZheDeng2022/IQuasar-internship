  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, open-label, randomized, single-center study involving patients&#xD;
      with intermediate coronary lesions (50%-70% diameter stenosis) and who have elevated LDL-C&#xD;
      values (LDL-C≥100 mg/dL) despite stable statin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients are randomized to receive either alirocumab or standard-of-care (1:1). The&#xD;
      last dose of alirocumab will be given at week 34. Patients in the alirocumab arm will receive&#xD;
      alirocumab 75 mg Q2W added to statin therapy (atorvastatin 20 mg/day or rosuvastatin&#xD;
      10mg/day). Patients in the standard-of-care arm will continue to receive atorvastatin 20&#xD;
      mg/day or rosuvastatin 10 mg/day. OCT images will be acquired at the baseline and at week 36&#xD;
      ± 2 weeks follow-up.&#xD;

      The study is a prospective, open-label, randomized, single-center study involving patients&#xD;
      with intermediate coronary lesions (50%-70% diameter stenosis) and who have elevated LDL-C&#xD;
      values (LDL-C≥100 mg/dL) despite stable statin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients included those who are (I) at least 18 years of age, (II) diagnosed as&#xD;
      stable coronary artery disease or acute coronary syndrome during admission (III) undergoing&#xD;
      clinically indicated coronary angiography and identified with at least one intermediate&#xD;
      lesion (50%-70% diameter stenosis) on de novo coronary arteries, (IV) have an elevated LDL-C&#xD;
      values (LDL-C≥100 mg/dL) despite taken rosuvastatin 10 mg/day or atorvastatin 20 mg/day for&#xD;
      2-4 weeks after initiation or with maximally tolerated statin therapy, (V) able to provide&#xD;
      written, informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study included a 36-week open-label treatment period (including post-treatment OCT&#xD;
      imaging), starting within 4 weeks of baseline coronary angiogram. During the open-label&#xD;
      treatment period, patients are randomized to receive either alirocumab or standard-of-care&#xD;
      (1:1). The last dose of alirocumab will be given at week 34.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the alirocumab arm will receive alirocumab 75 mg Q2W added to statin therapy&#xD;
      (atorvastatin 20 mg/day or rosuvastatin 10mg/day). Patients in the standard-of-care arm will&#xD;
      continue to receive atorvastatin 20 mg/day or rosuvastatin 10 mg/day. Statin dose escalation&#xD;
      or adding concomitant non-statin lipid-lowering therapy would be considered by their&#xD;
      responsible physician to achieve an LDL-C target &lt;100 mg/dL. Antithrombotic therapy and other&#xD;
      concomitant medications are exclusively decided by the responsible physicians. Follow-up&#xD;
      coronary angiograms and OCT imaging analyses of the same vessels will be carried out at the&#xD;
      end of treatment period (at week 36 ± 2 weeks, depending on patient availability) in both&#xD;
      study arms. Regular medical examination and laboratory tests will be conducted at weeks 4,&#xD;
      12, 24, and 36. All enrolled patients are monitored and evaluated for safety and any other&#xD;
      adverse events during the study period.&#xD;
