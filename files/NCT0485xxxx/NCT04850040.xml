      This is a prospective, single-arm, single-center, clinical research.This trial will explore&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of Camrelizumab in combination with Apatinib Mesylate and Oxaliplatin&#xD;
      for neoadjuvant therapy in patients with potentially resectable hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is no high-level evidence on the efficacy of systemic therapy in neoadjuvant studies&#xD;
      for hepatocellular carcinoma, and guidelines recommend TACE as the treatment of choice. Given&#xD;
      that combination therapies such as immunotherapy in combination with targeted therapy and&#xD;
      immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy have achieved good efficacy in systemic&#xD;
      therapy for liver cancer, this study is intended to explore the efficacy of TACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we propose to explore the use of kareliozumab in combination with apatinib and&#xD;
      oxaliplatin for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we propose to investigate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant therapy with&#xD;
      kalilizumab in combination with apatinib and oxaliplatin in patients with potentially&#xD;
      resectable hepatocellular liver cancer.&#xD;
