  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the safety and efficacy of tenofovir alafenamide (orally 25 mg per day)&#xD;
      treated in inactive chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected pregnant women with high viral&#xD;
      load from the late pregnancy until the delivery date or postpartum 1 month.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators intend to include 240 inactive chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected&#xD;
      pregnant women who have an HBV DNA level higher than 200,000 IU per milliliter. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive tenofovir alafenamide (orally 25 mg per&#xD;
      day) from the late pregnancy until the delivery date or postpartum 1 month. All the infants&#xD;
      will receive standard immunoprophylaxis (100 IU of hepatitis B immunoglobulin and 10 μg of&#xD;
      hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth; the second injection of 10 μg of HBV vaccine&#xD;
      will inject at 1 month; and the third dose of 10 μg of HBV vaccine will give at 6 months).&#xD;
      The pregnant women and their infants will be followed until postpartum month 7. The primary&#xD;
      outcomes are the birth defects and rates of perinatal transmission of HBV. During the&#xD;
      prenatal period or the postnatal period up to 7 months of age, cases of a structural defect&#xD;
      in newborns or infants were reported as birth defects. The rate of perinatal transmission was&#xD;
      defined as the proportion of infants who are positive for hepatitis B surface antigen at 7&#xD;
      months of age. The secondary safety outcomes are the occurrence of maternal or infant adverse&#xD;
      events during the study period. Maternal safety evaluations mainly include any adverse events&#xD;
      and complications, hepatitis B virologic breakthrough, alanine aminotransferase flare, and so&#xD;
      on. Infant' safety profiles mainly included Apgar scores at 1 minute, any abnormal conditions&#xD;
      during the study period, and anthropometric indexes at birth and 7 months of age. The&#xD;
      secondary efficacy outcomes are the percentages of mothers with an HBV DNA level of less than&#xD;
      200,000 IU per milliliter just before or at delivery, and the hepatitis B e antigen and&#xD;
      surface antigen loss or seroconversion in mothers at postpartum month 7.&#xD;

    <description>Structural defect in newborns or infants were reported as birth defects. The monitoring of birth defects was conducted by a clinical examination during each visit, and further clinical imaging or other tests were performed if indicated. The birth defect rate represented the proportion of infants with a defect among all live births.</description>
