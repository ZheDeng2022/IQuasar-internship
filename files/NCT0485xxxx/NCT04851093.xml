    <textblock>
      This study aims to objectively evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Traditional&#xD;
      Chinese Medicine in the treatment of AECOPD Risk Window, providing a basis for the&#xD;
      formulation of TCM treatment plan with AECOPD.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence, mortality, and prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are&#xD;
      high, with a prevalence among people 40 years of age or older of 10.1% worldwide and 13.7% in&#xD;
      China. COPD has become the third leading cause of death worldwide. Acute exacerbations of&#xD;
      COPD (AECOPD) are important events in the management of COPD because they negatively impact&#xD;
      health status, readmission, and disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the non-random and non-accidental occurrence of AECOPDï¼Œwith acute exacerbations&#xD;
      occurring mainly in a centralized period after an acute exacerbation, and wide open to attack&#xD;
      easily in this period, we call this &quot;highly dangerous period&quot; as &quot;AECOPD Risk Window&quot;. The&#xD;
      AECOPD Risk Window has persistent systemic inflammation and unstable lung function, which&#xD;
      increases the risk of AECOPD recurrence and readmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, western medicine has relatively mature treatment measures for COPD at the acute&#xD;
      exacerbation stage and stable stage, however, there is no specific guidance on the medication&#xD;
      of AECOPD Risk Window. COPD have been effectively treated with Chinese medicine for a long&#xD;
      time. The study of syndrome regularity of &quot;AECOPD Risk Window&quot; provides a basis for the&#xD;
      formulation of syndrome differentiation plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial to compare the efficacy of&#xD;
      two therapies for patients with AECOPD Risk Window. 336 subjects will be randomly assigned in&#xD;
      a 1:1 ratio to experimental group or control group for 8 weeks treatment and 18 weeks&#xD;
      follow-up. On the basis of health education and conventional treatment, the experimental&#xD;
      group will receive TCM granule according to the TCM syndrome, while the control group will&#xD;
      receive TCM placebo granule according to the TCM syndrom. The primary outcomes are acute&#xD;
      exacerbation rate in the AECOPD Risk Window, COPD Assessment Test (CAT) in the AECOPD Risk&#xD;
      Window; and secondary outcomes are time to the first acute exacerbation, degree of acute&#xD;
      exacerbation in the AECOPD Risk Window, acute exacerbation rate in the follow-up period,&#xD;
      degree of acute exacerbation in the follow-up period, COPD Assessment Test (CAT) in the&#xD;
      follow-up period, lung function, clinical symptom scores, mMRC, quality of life and index of&#xD;
      security.&#xD;
