  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To collect and compare pilot data on the impact of a massage therapy intervention against&#xD;
      usual care on self-efficacy measures for patients with advanced heart failure immediately&#xD;
      discharged from hospital following left-ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators project is a randomized controlled pilot study that will take place at&#xD;
      MedStar Washington Hospital Center (MWHC), a 912-bed academic medical center in Washington,&#xD;
      D.C. MedStar Washington Hospital Center's patient population is predominantly African&#xD;
      American (66%); and the majority live in low-income areas of the District. Over 20% are from&#xD;
      the District's two most underserved areas -- Wards 7 and 8. Nearly 50% of the patients rely&#xD;
      on public insurance as their primary form of insurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consenting to participate, in addition to usual advanced heart failure medical therapy,&#xD;
      74 patients will be randomized with a 1:1 ratio to either a massage therapy experiment group&#xD;
      or a usual care control group. Subjects randomized to the massage therapy arm will receive&#xD;
      massages during post LVAD implant follow-up visits in the Advanced Heart Failure clinic at&#xD;
      predetermined intervals: every week for 4 consecutive weeks, then every other week for 4&#xD;
      consecutive weeks. The investigators chose these intervals for two reasons: first, current&#xD;
      massage therapy research indicates that massages administered every week or two weeks may&#xD;
      lead to successful clinical outcomes (CITE); second, these specific intervals coincide with&#xD;
      predetermined LVAD clinic visits for this patient group, facilitating subject participation&#xD;
      and decreasing extra clinic visits just for research purposes. Since this study is designed&#xD;
      to coincide with predetermined LVAD follow-up visits, the usual care control group will also&#xD;
      be making LVAD clinic visits at the same intervals: every week for 4 consecutive weeks, then&#xD;
      every other week for 4 consecutive weeks. After study completion, each subject randomized to&#xD;
      usual care will be offered a massage, if interested. The investigators believe this sample&#xD;
      size is easily achievable given current MHVI annual LVAD implants (see above). Because the&#xD;
      study will take place during scheduled LVAD clinic visits, the investigators expect a very&#xD;
      high study completion rate.&#xD;
