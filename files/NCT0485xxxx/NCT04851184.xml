      The purposes of this research are to 1) utilize virtual reality (VR) to evaluate the exercise&#xD;
      dose required to improve symptoms in those with vestibular (dizziness) disorders, 2) compare&#xD;
      VR vestibular exercises to standard exercises, and 3) compare exercise performance outcomes&#xD;
      to healthy controls without vestibular disorders. Even though more than 35% of those over 40,&#xD;
      and ~50% of those who have had concussion have such symptoms, the dose of specific exercises&#xD;
      targeted to improve symptoms is not well defined. In this study, the investigators will use a&#xD;
      wireless VR device to measure key parameters and response to exercise. Another advantage of&#xD;
      the VR device is the ability to control what the individual can see while performing the&#xD;
      exercise. In normal daily life, moving objects and distracting backgrounds can make&#xD;
      vestibular exercise too uncomfortable to perform. Using these methods, the investigators aim&#xD;
      to determine the appropriate type and amount of exercise required for symptom improvement.&#xD;
      This study will also compare the effectiveness of performing exercises in the virtual reality&#xD;
      environment to standard physical therapy and to healthy persons without history of vestibular&#xD;
      disorders. Three categories of vestibular disorders will be investigated with an instrumented&#xD;
      and usual therapy group of 1) Unilateral hypofunction, 2) bilateral hypofunction, and 3)&#xD;
      post-concussion.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disorders of vestibular function are prevalent disorders that result in dizziness, decreased&#xD;
      balance, and a 12-fold increased risk of falls.1 It has been determined that 20% of&#xD;
      community-dwelling adults over the age of 60 report vestibular symptoms prompting a medical&#xD;
      evaluation or intervention over a one year period.2 This equates to approximately $50.0&#xD;
      billion in annual healthcare costs.3 In the US alone, there are approximately 1.6-3.8 million&#xD;
      sport concussions each year,4,5 where 50% of concussed athletes have at least one vestibular&#xD;
      type symptom.6 Although the impact of cost has been demonstrated in older adults, the costs&#xD;
      of concussion-related dizziness is much more difficult to calculate due simultaneously&#xD;
      treating symptoms from multiple systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A common treatment for symptoms related to disorders of vestibular function is vestibular&#xD;
      rehabilitation, a sub-specialty of physical therapy. These exercises are performed daily by&#xD;
      Subjects at home and consist of visually fixating on a target while moving the head and/or&#xD;
      the object on which the subject is fixating. To alter exercise difficulty, exercise&#xD;
      parameters are altered including: visual background complexity (plain and dark, busy but&#xD;
      stationary, moving objects, rapidly moving objects), postural positioning (seated, standing&#xD;
      with a wide base of support, standing with a narrow base of support, standing on one leg),&#xD;
      and duration of exercise (from 5 seconds to approximately 2 minutes). Early evidence shows&#xD;
      that vestibular rehabilitation exercises provided by a physical therapist is an effective&#xD;
      method of ameliorating vestibular hypofunction. Further, effectiveness of vestibular&#xD;
      rehabilitation does not decline with increasing age of the patient,8 indicating benefit for&#xD;
      all ages that are affected. Unfortunately, many factors limit the ability to determine&#xD;
      efficiency and efficacy of treatment and have been highlighted in a recent clinical practice&#xD;
      guideline9 and systematic review5,10. Limitations include: poor measurement of prescribed&#xD;
      exercise compliance by depending on subjective report, inability to control for environmental&#xD;
      factors during home program execution, and the influence of noxious vestibular input&#xD;
      associated with traveling to attend scheduled physical therapy visits. These factors hinder&#xD;
      performing high quality efficacy studies, resulting in exercise prescription being largely&#xD;
      based on expert opinion, the lowest level on the hierarchy of evidence-based practice.11 In&#xD;
      fact, current opinion indicates that exercises should be performed 3 times a day for a total&#xD;
      of 12 minutes with each bout lasting approximately 2 minutes, all with no clear indication of&#xD;
      speed and amplitude of performance. In this study, the investigators aim to use a&#xD;
      commercially available virtual reality device to deliver usual vestibular rehabilitation&#xD;
      exercises, while using the device's inbuilt sensors to accurately measure head movement,&#xD;
      speed and duration. Using this device, the investigators will assess compliance and dose of&#xD;
      exercises required to reduce symptoms of dizziness and imbalance and to determine if&#xD;
      performing such exercises in a virtual reality environment will provide similar results to&#xD;
      that usual rehabilitation techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a potential subject is identified, the subject will be screened for appropriateness of&#xD;
      inclusion for this study. After informed consent has been obtained from a recruited subject,&#xD;
      those with Unilateral Vestibular Hypofunction (UVH) will be asked to perform a 4-week&#xD;
      intervention, while those with Bilateral Vestibular Hypofunction (BVH) or those&#xD;
      post-concussion will each be asked to perform a 12-week intervention. Those with UVH will&#xD;
      undergo a shorter intervention due to strong evidence that neural adaptation occurs much more&#xD;
      quickly (usually 4 weeks) than those with BVH and history of concussion.9,10,17-19 The&#xD;
      intervention will consist of physical therapy visits combined with a home program of specific&#xD;
      vestibular exercises. Each subject will be asked to attend physical therapy visits at least&#xD;
      one time per week throughout the 4- or 12-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will be performed on all groups and consist of a combination of vestibulo-ocular&#xD;
      assessment, balance and clinical functional outcome measures, and surveys of subject&#xD;
      satisfaction. Subjects are randomly assigned to the usual rehabilitation or intervention&#xD;
      group based on each of the following diagnostic categories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The compliance to exercises will be obtained from a log in the virtual reality device for the&#xD;
      VR group, and will be paper based for the usual physical therapy group. Subjects in the three&#xD;
      intervention groups will be asked to perform the same type of exercises as the usual&#xD;
      rehabilitation group, but using a virtual reality device that will be issued to the patient&#xD;
      for home use. Subjects will use a custom designed program to perform the exercises using a&#xD;
      commercially available virtual reality device (no specialized hardware or additions to the&#xD;
      commercially available device will be performed). Subjects will be instructed on the first&#xD;
      day in how to operate the Virtual Reality Vestibular Rehabilitation (VRVR) program and how to&#xD;
      properly perform the exercises. The VRVR device and software will simulate a virtual reality&#xD;
      'room' with an 'X' fixed in front of a wall. There are six different background complexities.&#xD;
      Exercise sessions will start seated upright in a chair and will progress to standing per the&#xD;
      home exercise protocol. The system will prompt the patient to begin the exercise and will&#xD;
      automatically log the frequency and duration of exercise performed. The system will ask the&#xD;
      patient to rate the severity of their symptoms on a 0-10 scale before and after each bout of&#xD;
      exercise. Subjects' instruction regarding initial dose and progression will be identical to&#xD;
      those given in the usual rehabilitation group. Subjects will be asked to bring their device&#xD;
      with them to their 4 week, 8 week, and 12 weeks appointment to transfer their de-identified&#xD;
      data and to insure integrity of the data and device. Subjects will be asked to return the&#xD;
      device at the end of the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Per patient and therapist discretion, additional physical therapy visits may be scheduled to&#xD;
      aid in patient understanding of exercise progression protocol, assess correct performance of&#xD;
      exercise (with or without virtual reality device). Non-study related physical therapy visits&#xD;
      may be scheduled between sessions in order to address impairments unrelated to&#xD;
      vestibulo-ocular deficits. These may include interventions to address musculoskeletal&#xD;
      deficits or other balance related impairments. Any additional sessions of physical therapy&#xD;
      will be reported in order to determine possible confounding information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be an additional group of healthy control subjects that will be tested for only&#xD;
      one day. Healthy subjects will be recruited through flyers, approved email lists, and word of&#xD;
      mouth in the general public. This healthy control group will perform the same tests as the&#xD;
      other groups perform on Day 1. This group will be used to compare outcomes of usual&#xD;
      rehabilitation and intervention groups, to the function of those without disorders of&#xD;
      vestibular function.&#xD;
