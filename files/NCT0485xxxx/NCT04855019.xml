  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative multimodal analgesia methods occupy an essential place in modern anesthesia.&#xD;
      The postoperative results of opioid analgesia are now at the bottom of the current problems&#xD;
      due to its side effects. Longer-acting local anesthetics are now effective agents of&#xD;
      analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators aimed to compare the two routine methods. Ultrasonic nerve blocks are the most&#xD;
      important of multimodal analgesia in modern anesthesia. Suprascapular and axillary nerve&#xD;
      blocks are routinely used as a safe method. It is a routine method used by periarticular&#xD;
      local anesthetic surgeons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      İnvestigators decided to compare which method effectively follows these two methods with the&#xD;
      postoperative 24 pain scale method.&#xD;

      This randomized trial aims to assess if a combined suprascapular-axillary nerve block (CSAB)&#xD;
      to periarticular injection (PI) treated pain after arthroscopic shoulder surgery. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints included opioid consumption, discomfort associated with muscle weakness, and&#xD;
      patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      sixty patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided CSAB (n = 30) or PI (n = 30). Pain intensity at rest and discomfort were&#xD;
      recorded upon arrival in the recovery room, discharge to the ward, and at 4, 8, and 24 hours&#xD;
      after surgery. Tramadol consumption was recorded for the first 24 hours. Patient satisfaction&#xD;
      data will be recorded on the second postoperative day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a computer-generated random allocation sequence (created by the study statistician),&#xD;
      patients will randomly be assigned to ultrasound-guided SAB (n = 30) or PI(n = 30).&#xD;
      Allocation numbers will be sealed in an opaque envelope opening in sequence by an independent&#xD;
      anesthesiologist who will not assess outcomes. Outcome assessors will be blinded to treatment&#xD;
      allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After eligible patients are identified from the registry, patient charts were prospectively a&#xD;
      blind orthopedist would collect data. Demographic data including sex, age, body mass index,&#xD;
      surgical procedure, and complications will be recorded. Primary outcome measures were numeric&#xD;
      rating scale pain scores and 24-hour postoperative opioid consumption. Pain scores will be&#xD;
      recorded immediately before surgery, immediately following surgery in the postanesthesia&#xD;
      recovery unit, and 24 hours postoperatively. Total opioid consumption will also be recorded&#xD;
      for the first 24 hours following surgery. Secondary outcome measures included length of&#xD;
      surgery, operating room time, perioperative anesthesia time, blood loss, hospital length of&#xD;
      stay, and intraoperative and 30-day postoperative complication rates. Postoperative&#xD;
      complications were further categorized as nerve-related, cardiopulmonary, and musculoskeletal&#xD;
      (fracture or tendon rupture).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statisticians will compare statistics between groups using a 2-sample t-test for normally&#xD;
      distributed variables. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be used for non-normally distributed&#xD;
      variables. A general linear model with correlated errors was used to account for repeated&#xD;
      pain score assessments over time for each subject. The Fisher exact test will be used for&#xD;
      categorical variables. Summary statistics will be reported as the mean and standard deviation&#xD;
      for data analyzed using the 2-sample t-test and general linear models. The median and 25th&#xD;
      and 75th percentiles will be reported for the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The frequency (i.e., n)&#xD;
      and percentage will be reported for data analyzed using the Fisher exact test. A P value of&#xD;
      .05 will be designated as the threshold for statistical significance.&#xD;
