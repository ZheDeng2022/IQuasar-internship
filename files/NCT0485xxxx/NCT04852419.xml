    <textblock>
      The aim of this phase 1b study in Chinese patients with ER+/Her2- advanced breast cancer is&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ZN-c5 at dose of 50 mg and 150 mg QD well&#xD;
      tolerance established in the previous oversea study in non-Chinese patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer is the most common subset of breast&#xD;
      cancer. The estrogen receptor (ER) in these patients is a key driver of disease progression,&#xD;
      and the primary reason for relapse in these patients is that endocrine therapies are only&#xD;
      partially effective, typically causing cell cycle arrest rather than cell death. As a result,&#xD;
      secondary resistance to endocrine therapy is a major clinical challenge. ZN-c5 is a novel and&#xD;
      potent ZN-c5 is a novel and potent selective estrogen receptor degrader with oral&#xD;
      bioavailability and strong activity in estrogen-dependent and tamoxifen-resistant tumor&#xD;
      models.&#xD;
