  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test the helpfulness of a diagnostic tool, SimulConsult, when&#xD;
      clinicians are diagnosing pediatric rheumatic diseases. Trainees and nurse practitioners will&#xD;
      use the software or not use it, and their differential diagnoses will be compared to those of&#xD;
      attending physicians in the same clinical encounter, and then to definitive diagnoses weeks&#xD;
      later after testing, if one is reached.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The study aims to assess improvement in the clinical performance of trainees evaluating&#xD;
      patients with a suspected rheumatologic disorder. The Intervention is the use of Diagnostic&#xD;
      Decision Support Software (DDSS) already available as a Boston Children's Hospital resource.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Main objective: To assess if the use of the DDSS by trainees and nurse practitioners can&#xD;
           improve their diagnostic performance in developing a differential diagnosis and plan in&#xD;
           real clinical use. (Studies have shown in prior research that the use of the DDSS does&#xD;
           so for case vignettes, lowering diagnostic errors of trainees by 75%). The study will&#xD;
           compare how closely the differential diagnosis and plan of the trainees and nurse&#xD;
           practitioners approximate those of their senior Pediatric Rheumatology attending&#xD;
           physician colleagues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objective: To assess how frequently the differential diagnosis of the trainees&#xD;
           and nurse practitioners includes the definitive diagnosis by doing a manual chart review&#xD;
           weeks after the visit. (Studies have shown in prior research that if the definitive&#xD;
           diagnosis is in the initial differential diagnosis, the right tests get ordered, and&#xD;
           diagnostic errors are avoided.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design is a parallel one, comparing subjects (trainees and nurse practitioners) using the&#xD;
      DDSS (Intervention Arm) to subjects who do not use the DDSS (Control Arm). In both study&#xD;
      arms, subjects may use all other traditional resources. Arm assignment will be by patient&#xD;
      case rather than trainee / nurse practitioner to reduce variation due to each subject's&#xD;
      different capabilities (years of training and familiarity with pediatric rheumatology).&#xD;

    <description>The study will compare the trainee's differential diagnosis and workup plan to those of the attending physician seeing the same patient. The Attending is considered at this stage as the &quot;gold standard&quot; and we aim to answer the question &quot;how well does a trainee with a DDSS (and traditional resources) approximate an experienced, specialist Attending vs. a trainee with access only to more traditional resources?&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Performance against definitive diagnosis: Presence of definitive diagnosis in trainee list</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The study will do a manual chart review of the cases to find the definitive diagnosis (where available) to measure the frequency with which the definitive diagnosis was in the trainee's initial DDx.</description>

        The subjects are trainees (rheumatology and rotating fellows) and nurse practitioners, not&#xD;
        patients. The Attendings participate in their supervisory role, and their clinical&#xD;
        judgments are recorded as a preliminary &quot;gold standard&quot;, but they are not research&#xD;
        subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Trainees seeing new pediatric patients with a potential rheumatologic disorder are&#xD;
             eligible. They will be drawn from the pool of Rheumatology fellows (3),&#xD;
             Allergy/Immunology fellows (6), rotating pediatric and occasional adult residents (1 -&#xD;
             2) per month)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nurse practitioners in Rheumatology (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Rheumatology Attendings for these new patient visits will also be asked to participate&#xD;
             but will be supervisory participants in the study, not subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We anticipate 15 trainees plus nurse practitioners will participate. There are no exclusion&#xD;
        criteria, and we do not anticipate screen failures; however, trainees and nurse&#xD;
        practitioners may decline to participate for individual patients or the entire study.&#xD;
