  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The IVUS CHIP trial is a post-marketing strategy study in which patients with complex&#xD;
      coronary lesions, undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), are treated either&#xD;
      with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) guided PCI or angiographic guided PCI .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IVUS-guided PCI approach is indicated to reduce the frequency of target-lesion failure&#xD;
      (cardiac death, target-vessel myocardial infarction, and clinically indicated target-lesion&#xD;
      revascularization) in patients with complex coronary lesions undergoing PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to assess the superiority of an IVUS-guided approach versus an&#xD;
      angio-guided approach in patients with complex coronary lesions undergoing PCI.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) coronary arteries are visualized to guide&#xD;
      placing the stent. In this study 2 currently utilized methods of visualizing coronary&#xD;
      arteries during PCI are compared: intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and angiographic guided PCI&#xD;
      for patients with complex coronary lesions.The use of IVUS during PCI is suggested to give&#xD;
      better results than angiographic guided PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IVUS-CHIP trial is a randomized, controlled, multicenter, international, post-marketing&#xD;
      study. A total of 2020 patients, in 7 European countries and approximately 40 hospitals, will&#xD;
      be included, randomized in a 1:1 fashion to IVUS-guided PCI versus angio-guided PCI, and&#xD;
      followed up for at least 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IVUS-CHIP is an event-driven study; primary analysis of the data will take place after&#xD;
      169 patients have experienced an event.&#xD;
