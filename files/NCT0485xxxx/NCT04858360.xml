  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With this experiment, we want to use to investigate whether repeated application of EMLA&#xD;
      cream as a tool to modulate non-histaminergic itching, which is produced using small needles&#xD;
      from the plant mucuna pruriens (it is known that antihistamine does not attenuate this form&#xD;
      of itch) and we want to compare the effect of short (1 hour) and prolonged (3 hours)&#xD;
      application of EMLA. The sub-project takes place in 3 sessions over a period of 3 consecutive&#xD;
      days (24 hours apart). All sessions will be identical.&#xD;
