    <textblock>
      This study is looking at the way insulin icodec stays and moves over time in the blood after&#xD;
      injections in Chinese people with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get insulin icodec once a week for 6 weeks. The medicine will be injected&#xD;
      under the skin of the thigh. There will also be a run-in period that will last between 1 week&#xD;
      and 8 weeks with daily doses of insulin degludec before start on insulin icodec.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last for about 15 to 22 weeks. Participants will have about 17 visits with the&#xD;
      study doctor including phone contact during your run-in period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have blood samples taken at the clinic visits. Several samples of&#xD;
      participants blood will be taken for up to 48 hours after getting the first and the last dose&#xD;
      of insulin icodec.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must be a Chinese person diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for at least 6 months&#xD;
      and be on basal insulin treatment for at least 2 months before participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women: Women cannot take part if pregnant, breast-feeding or plan to become pregnant during&#xD;
      the study period&#xD;
