  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research protocol is comparing the effectiveness of surgical excision to the &quot;wait and&#xD;
      see&quot; approach for the management of oral leukoplakia and erythroleukoplakia in prevention of&#xD;
      oral squamous cell carcinoma onset.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Different treatments have been proposed for the management of oral leukoplakia (OL) in order&#xD;
      to prevent oral squamous cell carcinoma onset. However, there is still no consensus on the&#xD;
      most effective approach for the patients affected by such oral potentially malignant&#xD;
      disorders. Surgery is often performed, but there is no randomized clinical trial which&#xD;
      demonstrates its real effectiveness in preventing oral cancer onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent RCT compared surgical treatment with &quot;wait and see approach&quot; care in patients with&#xD;
      nondysplastic OL, assuming that regular clinical follow-up could be considered a reliable&#xD;
      standard of care among patients with nondysplastic oral leukoplakias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate effectiveness of surgical excision in treating OL&#xD;
      and or prolonging the onset of potential oral squamous cell carcinoma. This study will be the&#xD;
      first RCT comparing the effectiveness of surgery to &quot;wait and see approach&quot; in the management&#xD;
      of both dysplastic and nondysplastic oral leukoplakias.&#xD;

    <description>To evaluate the quality of life of patients affected by leukoplakia and treated with surgical excision, via Functional Intraoral Glasgow Scale (FIGS) questionnaire. FIGS is a simple point scale used to assess a patient's ability to speak, chew and swallow. Each of these functions is scored independently on a scale of 1-5, five being no disability and one meaning the patient has an inability to speak, chew, or swallow.</description>
