  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to support the registration of the lanreotide Autogel 120 mg&#xD;
      formulation in China for the treatment of GEP-NETs and treatment of clinical symptoms of&#xD;
      NETs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include a screening period of up to 4 weeks followed by a 48-week intervention&#xD;
      period. After completion of the main study period, approximately five participants will&#xD;
      continue in a self/partner injection cohort with lanreotide Autogel 120 mg every 28 days for&#xD;
      24 weeks.&#xD;
