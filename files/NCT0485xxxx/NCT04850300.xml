      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is currently the international standard for the treatment of&#xD;
      degenerative and rheumatological diseases of the knee joint, as well as certain types of&#xD;
      fractures. Although TKA is a procedure that has been shown to be effective in relieving pain&#xD;
      and improving function in patients with osteoarthritis, approximately 20% of patients are&#xD;
      dissatisfied with the results. Traditional methods of assessing the outcome after joint&#xD;
      arthroplasty often focus on objective indicators of surgery and neglect the needs and&#xD;
      opinions of patients. Because of this, this research project has the aim to know the&#xD;
      effectiveness of two models of stabilization of total knee prostheses on the functionality&#xD;
      achieved and perceived by the patient, as well as in the knee joint biomechanics during&#xD;
      movement in activities of daily life. On the other hand, as a secondary objective, we propose&#xD;
      to determine prognostic biomarkers of knee prosthesis function based on radiological&#xD;
      information, quantification of cytokines, intra-articular markers, and biomechanical&#xD;
      functional evaluation that correlate and predict a correct evolution of patients with a knee&#xD;
      replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To carry out these objectives, 80 participants will be included with an indication to perform&#xD;
      total knee joint replacement surgery. Participants will be randomized allocated into two&#xD;
      groups: i. participants with a prosthesis with medial condylar stabilization ii. participants&#xD;
      with a traditional prosthesis with central pivot stabilization. Participants will be&#xD;
      evaluated at five-times: before surgery, immediate postsurgical, at 3 months of evolution, 6&#xD;
      months of evolution, and one year of evolution.&#xD;

      I. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is currently the international standard for the treatment of&#xD;
      degenerative and rheumatological diseases of the knee joint, as well as certain types of&#xD;
      fractures. It is estimated that knee osteoarthritis affects 10% of the population over 55&#xD;
      years of age, of which one in four patients is severely disabled, which produces a social and&#xD;
      economic cost of great magnitude in the Western countries due to the loss of working hours,&#xD;
      the high consumption of medicines and the use of different health resources. During the last&#xD;
      decade, the number of TKAs performed has increased considerably worldwide, surpassing the&#xD;
      number of total hip arthroplasties (THAs). It is estimated that between 2005 and 2015, the&#xD;
      number of knee replacements increased by 90% and that this figure will grow to 675% in 2030.&#xD;
      In economic terms, the average cost of a primary knee replacement is € 5,000, with the cost&#xD;
      of the implant being one of the most important factors (15-25%). In the case of a revision&#xD;
      TKA, the implant costs are three times higher compared to a primary TKA. If we look at the&#xD;
      figures in numbers and in the cost of this type of implant, we see that in Spain in 2017, 130&#xD;
      knee prostheses were implanted for every 100,000 inhabitants. Assuming that the cost of this&#xD;
      implant ranges between € 1800 - € 2800 depending on the regions in which the surgery is&#xD;
      carried out, we can give you an idea of the social and economic impact of the problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although TKA is a procedure that has been shown to be effective in relieving pain and&#xD;
      improving function in patients with osteoarthritis, approximately 20% of patients are&#xD;
      dissatisfied with the results. Traditional methods of assessing the outcome after joint&#xD;
      arthroplasty often focus on objective indicators of surgery and neglect the needs and&#xD;
      opinions of patients. However, the concerns of patients after TKA can differ significantly&#xD;
      from those of their surgeons. Consequently, the need for postoperative evaluation to use&#xD;
      tools to assess patient-relevant outcomes and provide a more patient-centered view of the&#xD;
      outcome of their treatment has been increasingly recognized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data reviewed show the importance, on the one hand, of prosthetic designs that guarantee&#xD;
      optimal functioning and patient satisfaction and, on the other, of tools for the clinical&#xD;
      follow-up of patients that ensure the early detection of complications and an efficient&#xD;
      strategy. rehabilitation, in order to avoid or delay the need for revision surgery.&#xD;
      Assessment tools are especially necessary during the first year after the intervention, a&#xD;
      period in which there is a significant percentage of patients who present early complications&#xD;
      that can lead to revision surgery. In relation to prosthetic elements, with the aim of&#xD;
      improving functional results and patient satisfaction, a new concept of stabilization of knee&#xD;
      prostheses has emerged, this being an adaptation of the concept of condylar prostheses with&#xD;
      medial condylar stabilization (such as the GMK Sphere prosthesis marketed by MEDACTA).&#xD;
      Supposedly, it offers better kinematic behavior to the implant and also greater functional&#xD;
      satisfaction compared to traditional prostheses with stabilization by means of a &quot;central&#xD;
      pivot&quot; (such as the PERSONA prosthesis, commercialized by the company ZIMMER-BIOMET, among&#xD;
      other models).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, in relation to post-surgery patient monitoring, progress is currently&#xD;
      being made in the continuous monitoring of patients through objective and subjective clinical&#xD;
      indicators, as well as information from mobile devices that could serve as triage for&#xD;
      identify situations with a poor prognosis, verify compliance with the indications related to&#xD;
      physiotherapy and achieve better performance of complementary tests. However, there is a lack&#xD;
      of studies that corroborate its prognostic capacity on the survival and function of knee&#xD;
      prostheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Objectives and Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the information reviewed, this research project has the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To aim to know the effectiveness of two models of stabilization of total knee prostheses&#xD;
           on the functionality achieved and perceived by the patient, as well as in the knee joint&#xD;
           biomechanics during movement in activities of daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. On the other hand, as a secondary objective, we propose to determine prognostic&#xD;
           biomarkers of knee prosthesis function based on radiological information, quantification&#xD;
           of cytokines, intra-articular markers, and biomechanical functional evaluation that&#xD;
           correlate and predict a correct evolution of patients with knee replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thanks to the global analysis of this information, these biomarkers will make it possible to&#xD;
      identify the patients with the highest risk, the causes of failure, and the set of tests to&#xD;
      be carried out that can foresee a foreseeable failure early on in order to make preventive&#xD;
      decisions, adapt the treatment and increase the success rates of the same. Our research&#xD;
      hypothesis proposes that the development of prognostic biomarkers of knee prosthesis function&#xD;
      based on clinical and radiological information, quantification of serum and intra-articular&#xD;
      markers, health questionnaires, and biomechanical functional evaluation allows to prevent the&#xD;
      failure of prosthetic functioning and ensure the effectiveness of the knee implant regardless&#xD;
      of the surgical technique used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. General procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be carried out at the Hospital Clínico Universitario de Valencia with the&#xD;
      INCLIVA Health Research Institute and the University of Valencia (Spain). The Hospital&#xD;
      Clínico Universitario de Valencia has extensive experience in joint reconstructive surgery.&#xD;
      Around 225-250 knee prostheses are implanted annually at this Center, having incorporated the&#xD;
      different technical variants of the surgical procedure. All the medical services involved in&#xD;
      the treatment and control of the implantation of total knee prostheses participate in this&#xD;
      project: the Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology Service, the Rehabilitation and Physical&#xD;
      Medicine Service, the Diagnostic Imaging Service, and the Clinical Analysis Service. Further,&#xD;
      In addition, the project will have the collaboration of the Research group on Personal&#xD;
      Autonomy, Dependence and Serious Mental Disorders of the INCLIVA Institute, which has a&#xD;
      Biomechanical Assessment Laboratory that will be used to perform functional assessments on&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Methodology&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Gripping force of the hand as an indicator of physical frailty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV.4 Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized allocated into two groups: i. participants with a prosthesis&#xD;
      with medial condylar stabilization ii. participants with a traditional prosthesis with&#xD;
      central pivot stabilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV.5 Sample size, recruitment, and randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      To respond to the main objective of the study, a total of 82 people will be recruited. This&#xD;
      sample size has been determined using the G * Power v. 3.1, based on the expected differences&#xD;
      between the two subject groups from baseline to 3-month follow-up [21], with a small-medium&#xD;
      effect (f = 0.15), a statistical significance of 5% at the two-tailed level, and a power of&#xD;
      90%. If 20% of possible dropouts are also considered during the study, the initial&#xD;
      recruitment should be 99 people. Patients will be recruited from the Orthopedic Surgery and&#xD;
      Traumatology Service of Valencia University Clinical Hospital (Spain) only. From the&#xD;
      beginning of the study, every week the coordinating researcher and head of the Orthopedic&#xD;
      Surgery and Traumatology Service, will review the scheduled surgeries of the following weeks&#xD;
      to ask each patient with scheduled TKA if they are interested in participating. All patients&#xD;
      who show interest will be informed and the criteria for participation in their usual&#xD;
      pre-surgical trauma appointment will be evaluated. The study recruitment period will remain&#xD;
      open for one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to patient recruitment will occur over a prolonged period of time, the assignment to the&#xD;
      groups will be performed as block randomization with a 1:1 allocation. This restrictive&#xD;
      sample randomization or permuted block randomization would allow us to ensure a periodic&#xD;
      balance in the number of participants assigned to each intervention group. For this, 13&#xD;
      different blocks were created among themselves, with a homogeneous distribution (8) of&#xD;
      letters A and B, representing each of the prosthetic options. These 13 blocks were randomly&#xD;
      ordered to assign each participant according to the blocks. The coordinating researcher of&#xD;
      the project was the only member who knew about the randomization sequence and is the one who&#xD;
      will indicate to the two surgeons in the study what type of surgery to do according to the&#xD;
      randomized sequence. There not considered stratification factors in randomization. Regarding&#xD;
      the blinding of the study, both the study patients and the researcher who performing the&#xD;
      statistical analyzes will be unaware of the type of prosthetic stabilization used. The two&#xD;
      surgeons in the study and the evaluators of the outcomes will know the type of prosthesis&#xD;
      used in each patient.&#xD;
