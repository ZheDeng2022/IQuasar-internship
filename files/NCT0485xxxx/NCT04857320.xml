  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bio-fermentation produced Human insulin is available without prescription in the U.S. This&#xD;
      study is a physician-initated trial of a formula enabling transdermal delivery of human&#xD;
      insulin.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the amount of lowering serum glucose as a&#xD;
      function of dose of a topically applied formulation of Human Insulin administered by syringe&#xD;
      measurement to adult Healthy Volunteer subjects as compared to no treatment. A 5-day period&#xD;
      of daily blood sugar monitoring by means of wearable Continuous Glucose Monitor and insulin&#xD;
      dosing for 3 days then monitoring for at least 3 days following will form the baseline and&#xD;
      experiemental data for each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to evaluate the tolerability and local and systemic effects of&#xD;
      transdermal Human Insulin if any.&#xD;
