  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to systematically determine the effect of unnecessary physical&#xD;
      therapist assistance in individuals after stroke during the practice of an upper limb task on&#xD;
      an individual's task performance and their underlying motor control patterns when learning&#xD;
      (or re-learning) motor skills.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Independent motor task performance is the most highly prioritized outcome of physical therapy&#xD;
      for individuals with motor disability. Accordingly, a key priority for physical therapists in&#xD;
      multiple practice settings is the advancement of functional motor independence. Therapists&#xD;
      must determine when a patient requires assistance (e.g., verbal cues, physical support) to&#xD;
      complete a motor task and when a patient is able to execute a motor skill with less&#xD;
      assistance. If a therapist does not provide enough support, the patient is at risk for&#xD;
      unsuccessful task performance. As such, therapists often default to providing a higher level&#xD;
      of assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An individual following stroke, for instance, may demonstrate an increased magnitude of&#xD;
      postural sway while completing self-care activities at the sink. A therapist may decide to&#xD;
      provide physical support for the patient to decrease sway variability, whether or not the&#xD;
      patient requires this support to maintain performance. The motor control consequences of&#xD;
      providing this assistance (thus constraining movement variability and providing fewer options&#xD;
      for adapting movement) when assistance is actually not needed is unknown. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to systematically determine the effect of unnecessary assistance during the practice&#xD;
      of an upper limb task on functional performance and underlying motor control patterns when&#xD;
      learning (or re-learning) motor skills in individuals with stroke. The insights gained from&#xD;
      the current project will have the potential to improve the currently available physical&#xD;
      therapy interventions for individuals with stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of unnecessary physical therapist support will be examined in terms of upper limb&#xD;
      task performance, retention, and transfer, and in terms of the postural control supporting&#xD;
      task performance. The study is currently planned for individuals with stroke. Participants&#xD;
      will be required to maintain the position of a virtual laser within a target while standing.&#xD;
      An experimental group will receive postural support (physical assistance to maintain upright&#xD;
      posture) during a practice period in order to specifically determine the effect of postural&#xD;
      support on upper limb task performance and postural sway patterns. Participants will also&#xD;
      engage in a light finger force production transfer task to ascertain the influence of&#xD;
      postural support on a different supra-postural task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that providing unnecessary assistance (and thus limiting independence)&#xD;
      during practice of a novel motor task will result in (a) faster improvements in task&#xD;
      performance but reduced retention and more limited transfer to another, similar task; and (b)&#xD;
      reduced task- sensitive postural sway adjustments (measured in terms of both the quantity and&#xD;
      temporal structure) during practice, at transfer, and at retention, reflecting reduced&#xD;
      adaptability of postural patterns to task demands.&#xD;
