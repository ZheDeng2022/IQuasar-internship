  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite novel acute therapies the global burden of stroke remains high worldwide. Targeting&#xD;
      the immune response after stroke has the potential to improve recovery in all stroke&#xD;
      patients. Experimental studies suggest important roles for T-lymphocytes, especially&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells, in the evolution of stroke and neurological deficit.&#xD;
      Objectives of this study are to either confirm or refute the hypothesis that a subset of&#xD;
      brain regulatory T cells exists in humans and expands after stroke and to identify&#xD;
      immunological biomarkers that can be used in stroke clinical trials targeting the adaptive&#xD;
      immune system.&#xD;

      Rationale: despite novel acute therapies the global burden of stroke remains high worldwide.&#xD;
      Targeting the immune response after stroke has the potential to improve recovery in all&#xD;
      stroke patients. Experimental studies suggest important roles for T-lymphocytes, especially&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells, in the evolution of stroke and neurological deficit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To confirm that patients experience an increase and migration of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ &quot;brain&quot;&#xD;
           Tregs..&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To characterize and subgroup brain T reg cells; to assess clonality of the T reg cells&#xD;
           in order to determine whether a specific antigen-reaction is present; to assess whether&#xD;
           specific antigen-directed FoxP3+ brain Treg cells are recruited through cervical lymph&#xD;
           nodes and subsequently migrate towards the brain; to assess whether T reg cells play a&#xD;
           role in neurotoxic astrogliosis after stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: case control study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: we will include: 60 patients aged 18 years or older with clinical symptoms&#xD;
      of hemispheric ischemic stroke due to occlusion of a large cerebral blood vessel, onset&#xD;
      within 48 hours and NIHSS of 1 or more; 30 healthy age- and sex- matched controls; 10&#xD;
      patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy within 30 days after stroke and 3 patients without&#xD;
      stroke undergoing carotid endarterectomy for asymptomatic carotid stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: we will assess the amount and characteristics of regulatory&#xD;
      T cells in peripheral blood and lymph nodes and compare these with patients without stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: in 60 patients blood will be sampled at 9 time points. In addition, neurologic&#xD;
      examination at 5 time points, 1 MRI scan and 1 telephone interview will be performed. In 10&#xD;
      patients who undergo carotid endarterectomy, a lymph node will be extracted and blood will be&#xD;
      drawn during this surgery. The study is carried out in both capacitated and incapacitated&#xD;
      persons because exclusion of non-communicative stroke patients would lead to a selective&#xD;
      patient sample.&#xD;
