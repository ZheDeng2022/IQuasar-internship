  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative drug treatment has gradually become the standard regimens for locally advanced&#xD;
      gastric cancer, whereas only a subset of patients could benefit from it. Therefore, one major&#xD;
      challenge for perioperative drug treatment is to construct promising biomarkers and to screen&#xD;
      out potential beneficial patients. Recent evidence has revealed that tumor microenvironment&#xD;
      (TME) is highly associated with the prognosis of gastric cancer. Meanwhile, tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment score (TMEscore) established with transcriptomic data is a robust biomarker&#xD;
      for predicting prognosis and guiding individualized immunotherapy strategies. However, its&#xD;
      predictive value for perioperative drug treatment outcomes warrants further exploration and&#xD;
      validation. The study is a multi-center, observational study to evaluate the relationship&#xD;
      between the efficacy of perioperative treatment and tumor microenvironment in patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced resectable adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastreal junction or the stomach,&#xD;
      aiming at further determining the predictive value of TMEscore and establishing a&#xD;
      comprehensive treatment-efficacy evaluation system for gastric cancer.&#xD;

      selected according to the inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria. After the successful&#xD;
      screening, the patients were treated in accordance with the clinical guidelines and the&#xD;
      actual conditions. The residual tissue samples of the primary tumor were collected to conduct&#xD;
      the tumor microenvironment detection. After routine neoadjuvant therapy, followed by a&#xD;
      restaging of the tumor status and surgery. The residual surgical specimens were collected to&#xD;
      conduct the tumor microenvironment detection analysis.&#xD;
