      Observational Clinical Trial of the chronotype, sleep quality, seasonal pattern, behavioral&#xD;
      time preferences, the functional state of the body's regulatory systems and respiratory&#xD;
      systems in individuals of different age groups and metabolic status. In the process of&#xD;
      medico-ecological monitoring, including all of the above, an assessment of the&#xD;
      psycho-physiological status and the state of the regulatory and respiratory systems of the&#xD;
      subjects' body, living in North Ossetia-Alania, will be made.&#xD;

      Modern methods of medicine are aimed at maintaining homeostasis in a situation when, under&#xD;
      the influence of factors of the external or internal environment, acute, chronical and&#xD;
      extreme (in Covid-19 isolation) physiological stress, is formed, which the body is no longer&#xD;
      able to compensate, and which forms the main group of human diseases - adaptation diseases,&#xD;
      primarily cardiovascular, including cardiometabolic syndrome. Against the background of the&#xD;
      Covid-19 pandemic, in conditions of limited physical activity, disruption of the daily&#xD;
      routine and high psychophysiological load, various health disorders of both functional and&#xD;
      organic nature may occur and existing pathologies may worsen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study - screening of health of different age categories of the population,&#xD;
      based on research of chronotype, sleep quality, seasonal pattern, behavioral time preferences&#xD;
      and functional state of body's regulatory and respiratory systems in individuals from the&#xD;
      different age groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: testing of psycho-physiological functions using Composite Scale of Morningness&#xD;
      (CSM), Munich ChronoType Questionnaire (MCTQ), Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire&#xD;
      (SPAQ), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI); Heart rate variability (HRV); Spirometry;&#xD;
      Anthropometry (measurement of height, weight, waist circumference), Blood pressure&#xD;
      measurement (BP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses planned to perform frequency, correlation, factorial and variance&#xD;
      analyzes using Statistica 10,0 software (&quot;StatSoft, Inc&quot;). Data investigate by mean value (M)&#xD;
      and standard deviation (SD) in case of normal data distribution or nonparametric method with&#xD;
      determination of median (Me) and interquantile ranges (25th and 75th percentile) in the case&#xD;
      of a distribution other than normal. ANOVA, MANOVA analysis. Statistically significant&#xD;
      differences in all statistical tests set to P&lt;0.05&#xD;

CSM ask mostly for preferred time of day and imply answers based on clock times or comparisons with others in a given population. In CSM regarding preferred sleeping and waking times, respondents select the most suitable option from a list of time increments. Issues like ease of waking, alertness throughout the day, and exercise are also queried. Potential scores for the scale's items range from 1 to 4 or 5, with higher scores indicating a greater degree of morningness. Cutoffs for the scale were chosen using the upper and lower percentiles of the scale: A score of 22 or below indicates an evening type, a score above 44 indicates a morning type, and scores in between receive a classification of intermediate. In total we used two parameters: CMQ - sum of the scores of the scale's items range; CSMN - nominal chronotype rating.</description>

    <description>Heart rate variability is carried out using the complex of prenosological diagnostics &quot;VARICARD 2.51&quot; with the ISCIM 6.2 program is methodically based on the technology of analysis of heart rate variability, it uses the original scientific and theoretical substantiation of HRV indicators, which is based on modern ideas about stress, functional state of the body and assessment of health levels. It is designed to assess the risk of developing diseases in persons who are in states bordering health and disease. A decrease in the adaptive capabilities of the organism is considered as the main risk factor, the results obtained with its help are considered from the point of view of the level of health or stressful effects. It can be successfully used to control the effectiveness of medical intervention. Functionally, the complex is designed to register an electrical signal and form conclusions about the functional state of the body, assess the level of stress and its effect on health.</description>
