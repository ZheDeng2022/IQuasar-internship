  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of ANV419 (single agent and&#xD;
      combination therapy) in patients with relapsed/refractory advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of this First-in-Human, open-label, dose escalation and expansion study is to&#xD;
      assess the initial safety and efficacy profile of ANV419 intravenous infusion in patients&#xD;
      with advanced solid tumours. Phase 1 will evaluate the safety and tolerability of ANV419&#xD;
      alone and to determine a suitable dose for Phase 2 development. Phase 2 will evaluate the&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy and, the safest and best dose of ANV419 when used alone or together with&#xD;
      established cancer treatment.&#xD;
