    <textblock>
      The researchers investigate the effect of long-term (12-weeks) consumption of diets rich in&#xD;
      boiled potatoes versus those rich in rice or pasta on established cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      parameters. These carbohydrate sources will be part of a recommended healthy dietary pattern&#xD;
      to mimic as closely as possible current dietary guidelines, facilitating the implementation&#xD;
      of the outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To breach the current controversies, there is an urgent need for well-designed controlled&#xD;
      human intervention trials evaluating the true impact of boiled potato consumption as part of&#xD;
      a healthy dietary pattern on cardiometabolic health. There are two important issues that need&#xD;
      to be addressed when designing such an intervention study: First, the longer-term effects of&#xD;
      boiled potato consumption on established fasting and postprandial cardiovascular risk markers&#xD;
      should be addressed. Second, the effect of boiled potatoes should be studied using an&#xD;
      iso-energetic exchange for other traditionally main carbohydrate sources. These&#xD;
      carbohydrate-sources will be part of a recommended healthy dietary pattern to mimic as&#xD;
      closely as possible current dietary guidelines, facilitating the implementation of the&#xD;
      outcomes. Effects will be studied in both fasting and postprandial conditions. In fact, the&#xD;
      evidence is accumulating that optimizing postprandial glucose and lipid responses are&#xD;
      important targets for maintaining health. Since potatoes, white rice and white pasta are all&#xD;
      products with a high glycemic index and concomitant relatively steep glucose excursions after&#xD;
      intake, the question is how long-term intake of these products affects the metabolic capacity&#xD;
      of our body to respond to postprandial challenges. Interestingly, potatoes are not only rich&#xD;
      in complex carbohydrates but are also more nutrient-dense (a wide variety of minerals,&#xD;
      vitamins, and micronutrients) as compared to white rice and white pasta. In addition,&#xD;
      potatoes provide large amounts of fiber and are more satiating than other carbohydrate&#xD;
      sources. This nutrient profile might beneficially impact the resilience of the metabolic&#xD;
      machinery and as such improve postprandial cardiometabolic plasma profiles (glucose, insulin,&#xD;
      and triacylglycerol). In other words, there might be a beneficial effect of longer-term&#xD;
      potato consumption in comparison with longer-term white pasta and white rice consumption will&#xD;
      not only be present in fasting conditions but particularly in the postprandial state when the&#xD;
      cardiometabolic system is challenged.&#xD;
