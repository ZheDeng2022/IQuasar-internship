      The study will take me approximately 10 weeks from the time of consent. This includes initial&#xD;
      screening visit, a baseline assessment, and a follow-up visit (after 6 weeks of therapy). The&#xD;
      baseline and follow up visit will include 2 separate testing sessions, each session will last&#xD;
      approximately 2 hours. I will also participate in approximately 3 training sessions per week&#xD;
      for 6 weeks. Each training session will last approximately 60 minutes.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Approximately 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Spasticity measurements of upper and lower extremities using the Modified Ashworth scale (MAS).&#xD;
The MAS scores range between 0 to 4. A higher score signifies larger level of spasticity and a lower score indicates smaller level of spasticity. scores are as follows:&#xD;
0: No increase in muscle tone&#xD;
Slight increase in muscle tone 1+: Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the range of motion&#xD;
More marked increase in muscle tone through most of the range of motion.&#xD;
Considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult&#xD;
