    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to find out how the T regulatory (Treg) cells control&#xD;
      autoimmune response in multiple sclerosis. We will identify Treg molecular markers and&#xD;
      changes in function in patients with relapse remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). We plan to&#xD;
      study T regulatory immune cells in the blood of RRMS patients and control subjects to examine&#xD;
      how Treg immune cells' deficient function may be involved in the development of mulitple&#xD;
      sclerosis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study will enroll 40 RRMS patients (age 18-55, expanded disability status scale (EDSS)&#xD;
      0-6), and 40 age-, sex- and race-matched Healthy Controls (HCs). The study subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled at the Thomas Jefferson University MS clinic, which serves as a tertiary referral&#xD;
      center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria are confirmed diagnosis of RRMS according to McDonald's diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria12, age 18-55 inclusive, extended disability status score (EDSS) 1.5-5.5, and no&#xD;
      immunomodulatory therapy at the time of the study. Treatment-free period will be at least 4&#xD;
      weeks for IV Methylprednisolone, Interferon-beta, Glatiramer acetate, Fingolimod, Tecfidera&#xD;
      and Natalizumab. Patients previously treated with immunosuppressive therapies, including&#xD;
      Azathioprine, Methotrexate, Mitoxantrone and Cyclophosphamide will not be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study. Exclusion criteria will include concomitant infection, significant medical and&#xD;
      psychiatric condition at the discretion of principal investigator. Pregnant women, and&#xD;
      patients participating in other research trials will not be enrolled in this study. 40&#xD;
      healthy controls matched for age, sex and race with the group of RR MS patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study as a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. A. Identify the phenotype changes in CD4+CD25+CD127- nTregs in RRMS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcriptional profiling of sorted CD4+CD25+CD127- Tregs will be performed using RNAseq in&#xD;
      the first cohort of 10 HCs and 10 RRMS patients. CD4+CD25+CD127- Treg cells will be sorted&#xD;
      from magnetic beads separated CD4+ cells. cDNA will be generated using the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra&#xD;
      Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing. The detection of differentially expressed genes between&#xD;
      RRMS patients and HC-derived Treg cells will permit the functional characterization of Treg&#xD;
      cells in RRMS. The RNA seq experiments and data analysis will be performed by Dr. Paolo&#xD;
      Fortina and Dr. Adam Ertel at TJU Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center. The differential gene&#xD;
      expression in RRMS Tregs identified by RNAseq will be confirmed via RT-PCR and western&#xD;
      blotting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flow cytometry studies using the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from the&#xD;
      second cohort of HCs and RRMS patients (10 donors in each group) will be used to determine&#xD;
      changes in the expression of the Treg protein markers in RRMS patients. Individual Treg&#xD;
      markers confer specific mechanisms of suppression. For the comprehensive Treg phenotypic&#xD;
      profiling, we will determine the percentage of CTLA-4, CD39, GZB, perforin, GITR, OX40,&#xD;
      HLADR, TNFR2, Tim-3, programmed death receptor (PD-1), and LAG3-positive cells within the&#xD;
      CD4+CD25+CD127--gated Tregs. FOXP3, GZB and perforin expression will be determined using&#xD;
      intracellular staining, as well as Tregs' TGF-B, IL-10 and IL-35 cytokine secretion, which&#xD;
      may contribute to their suppressive function (2x106 PBMCs per 14 color staining).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1.B. Characterize the functional deficit of nTregs in RRMS. Functional suppression assays&#xD;
      will compare Treg suppressive function in a third cohort of 10 HC and 10 RRMS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that Treg co-cultures with Teff cells from HCs will increase the&#xD;
      concentration of TGF-B, IL-10 and IL-35 and decrease the concentrations of IFN-y and IL-17A&#xD;
      in culture supernatants (SNs) in comparison to the suppression assays using Treg and Teff&#xD;
      cells from RRMS patients. In order to examine the susceptibility of Teff cells in RRMS&#xD;
      patients in comparison to HCs, the suppression assays will be performed in a cross-over&#xD;
      design experiments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. RMS Tregs+RRMS Teff cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. HC Tregs+HC Teff cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. RRMS Tregs+HC Teff cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. HC Tregs+RRMS Teff cells&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sorted 2x104 CD4+CD25+CD127- Tregs per condition will be co-cultured with autologous Teff&#xD;
      CFSE-stained CD4+CD25-CD127+ cells in the presence of aCD3 (0.5 ug/ml) and aCD28 (1 ug/ml)&#xD;
      mAb and 105 irradiated antigen presenting cells (PBMCs - CD4+ cells) at 1:1 and 1:10 ratios.&#xD;
      We will measure proliferation via CFSE dilution in the Teff cells and cytokine secretion in&#xD;
      the SNs of cell cultures to determine to what extent Treg cells from RRMS patients exhibit&#xD;
      decreased suppression in comparison to HCs. The IFN-y, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-10, TGF-B&#xD;
      and IL-4 cytokine measurements will be performed using ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1.C. Determine the effects of IL-7 on the nTregs' suppressive function in RRMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since our preliminary data have identified IL-7-induced STAT5 phosphorylation and FOXP3&#xD;
      expression, as well as IL-7 in-vitro induced Treg proliferation, we will correlate the serum&#xD;
      IL-7 levels with the Treg numbers (% of CD4+ cells x total number of cells) and their&#xD;
      suppressive function, and examine the effect of pre-incubation of Tregs with this cytokine to&#xD;
      their suppressive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2.A. Determine the phenotype of iTreg cells in RRMS patients. Flow cytometry studies of&#xD;
      the IL-10+CD4+ and TGF-B+CD4+ cells derived from RRMS patients and HCs will identify&#xD;
      disease-specific phenotype of iTregs, which may reflect functional changes of iTregs in RRMS.&#xD;
      We will examine the same samples from cohort of RRMS patients and HCs enrolled in Specific&#xD;
      Aim 1.A. Flow cytometry studies of the gated CD4+IL-10+ and CD4+TGF-B+ cells will be&#xD;
      performed using surface marker staining for CD39, CTLA-4, PD-1, ICOS, CD46, CD49b and LAG-3&#xD;
      and intracellular staining for FOXP3, IL-35, GZMB, pSTAT3, the repressor of GATA-3 (ROG), the&#xD;
      aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and c-Maf transcription factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2.B. Identify the mechanisms of deficient nTreg induction of iTregs in RRMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will perform the suppressive assay as described in Aim 1.B using CD4+CD25+CD127-Treg and&#xD;
      CD4+CD25-CD127+ Teff cells derived from the fourth cohort of 10 HCs and 10 RRMS patients.&#xD;
      After 4 days of co-culture, CD25+ Treg cells will be removed using magnetic beads, and the&#xD;
      remaining CD4+CD25- cells will be irradiated and replated at a 1:10 ratio with autologous&#xD;
      CD4+CD25- T cells, and stimulated by plate-immobilized aCD3 and aCD28 mAb for an additional 5&#xD;
      days in order to demonstrate the suppressive effect of iTregs. Cell proliferation (measured&#xD;
      by 3[H] incorporation) and TGF-Î² and IL-10 secretion in the SNs will be measured to determine&#xD;
      the iTreg suppressive function induced by CD4+CD25+CD127- Tregs in the effector CD4+ cells.&#xD;
      In the second co-culture, we will also examine to what extent the iTreg induction is mediated&#xD;
      via cell-to-cell contact (blocked by a permeable membrane) or by soluble cytokines (blocked&#xD;
      by aIL-10, aTGF-B or aIL-4 mAb).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2.C. Characterize the effect of the iTreg-produced immunoregulatory cytokines on the&#xD;
      reconstitution of immune tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will measure the IFN-y, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22, IL-9, and IL-10, TGF-B and IL-35&#xD;
      levels in the SNs of the above co-cultures of iTregs and CD4+ cell derived from RRMS patients&#xD;
      and HCs at 48 h. We will measure the expression of the MHC class I and II, CD80, CD86, CD40&#xD;
      and CD58 in the remaining PBMC samples obtained in Specific Aim 2B in 10 HCs and 10 RRMS&#xD;
      patients in CD19+-gated B cells, CD14+-gated monocytes, and CD1c-gated DCs using flow&#xD;
      cytometry, as reported in our previous study 43. We will examine to what extent iTreg numbers&#xD;
      and iTregs' IL-10 and TGF-B production, as well as IL-10 and TGF-B serum levels correlate&#xD;
      with the inhibition of MHC and costimulatory molecules' expression in B cells, monocytes and&#xD;
      DCs in HCs and RRMS patients.&#xD;
