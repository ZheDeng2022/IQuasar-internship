  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the clinical retention rates, marginal adaptation,&#xD;
      marginal discoloration and secondary caries formation of two different types of&#xD;
      resin-modified glass ionomers (Fuji® II LC; Clinpro™ XT Varnish) and giomer-containing&#xD;
      fissure sealant materials (Beautifil Flow) with glass ionomer-containing fissure sealant&#xD;
      material (Fuji Triage®) used on newly erupted non-carious first permanent molars as a fissure&#xD;
      sealant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study included 384 teeth belonging to 182 children, aged between 5 to 9 years old, who&#xD;
      have two newly erupted mandibular permanent first molars.&#xD;

      Firstly, patients were randomly allocated to three main groups: Group 1; Fuji II LC/Fuji&#xD;
      Triage (Control) (62 patients), Group 2; Clinpro XT Varnish/Fuji Triage (Control) (60&#xD;
      patients), Group 3; Beautifil Flow/Fuji Triage (Control) (60 patients). After clinical&#xD;
      applications, all samples were evaluated in terms of retention, marginal adaptation, marginal&#xD;
      discoloration and secondary caries formation using modified USPHS criteria in 6th, 12th and&#xD;
      18th months. Also samples were evaluated in terms of remineralization effect using the laser&#xD;
      fluorescence method. Evaluations on occlusal and buccal surfaces were performed separately.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Fuji® II LC CAPSULE</intervention_name>
    <description>Fuji® II LC is a resin modified glass ionomer contained, fluoride releasing and light-cured material. Since the product is tolerant to moisture and saliva, it's used for fissure sealant of newly erupted teeth.&#xD;
Test 1 newly erupted first permanent molars were cleaned with a pumice paste using a bristle brush and isolated with cotton rolls. Then, 20% cavity conditioner was applied to all surfaces of the tooth for 10 seconds.The tooth surface was rinsed with water and dried. Thereafter, Fuji® II LC was applied to the pits and fissures on the tooth surface using a brush. Then, the varnish was applied and cured according to the manufacturer's instructions.</description>
