      Purpose: To explore the sports performance of the adolescent sprinters, including analyzing&#xD;
      the correlations between the results and central nerve sensory, and also between motor&#xD;
      control and various muscle mechanical characteristic and sport-related fitness factor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sprint performance was determined by various relevant factors, and they were mainly&#xD;
      divided into central system factor and peripheral system factor. An effective sprint start&#xD;
      requires a quick reaction to an auditory stimulus followed by a determined sequence of&#xD;
      activation of particular muscles responsible for maximum movement speed. Both of the&#xD;
      skill-related physical fitness, including muscle strength, muscle endurance, muscle power,&#xD;
      speed, agility, and balance, and muscle physical characteristic, including muscle tone and&#xD;
      muscle architecture, are related to the sprint performance. The 100m race could divided into&#xD;
      three different phases, start acceleration, maximum speed, and deceleration. According to&#xD;
      Collet, 1999, the determinants of the temporal structure of the sprint start are RT, movement&#xD;
      speed and movement frequency, which involves in perfecting sprinters' physical performance.&#xD;
      And also, according to Pilianidis et al., 2012; Tonnessen et al., 2013, the start reaction&#xD;
      time significantly affects the reduction of running time in 100 m races. In the recent&#xD;
      studies, there are researches only showing that the auditory stimulus trainings significantly&#xD;
      affected the final results for swimming athletes, and that the visual stimulus trainings&#xD;
      significantly affected the final scores for badminton athletes.This study will mainly recruit&#xD;
      the healthy adolescent athletes of the athletics sprint and other kinds of sports in the age&#xD;
      range 13-18 years, and will evaluate the athletes of anthropometric measurements and physical&#xD;
      fitness, 100m sprint performance, muscle characteristic, jump ability, agility, and nerve&#xD;
      potential measurements.The outcome of this study will be able to be one of the comprehensive&#xD;
      trials for coaches to take into consideration when choosing their own athletes. And also, the&#xD;
      athletes may choose their own specialties that fit their own physical conditions. Moreover,&#xD;
      the adolescent athletes will be trained more precisely and effectively. These will positively&#xD;
      lead to reaching their personal best results and decreasing the occurrences of the sport&#xD;
      injuries due to unsuitable events and trainings.&#xD;
