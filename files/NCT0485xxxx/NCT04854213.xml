      PRELUDE-1 study is a pilot intervention trial that aims to describe the immunologic and&#xD;
      genetic evolutions induced by stereotactic body radiationtherapy (SBRT) treatment in&#xD;
      oligometastatic Colorectal Cancer (omCRC) patients with two-three nodules lung-limited&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

      PRELUDE-1 study is a monocentric pilot interventional trial. The study concerns all patients&#xD;
      enrolled with a diagnosis of oligometastatic Colorectal Cancer (omCRC) with two-three nodules&#xD;
      lung-limited disease and treated with SBRT technique. SBRT will be delivered according to a&#xD;
      risk-adapted protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor genetic background will be assessed on primary FFPE (Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded)&#xD;
      tissues. Liquid biopsy will be done on blood samples collected before radiotherapy (RT) start&#xD;
      and after 40 days to monitor tumor DNA evolution. The most direct method to assess cancer&#xD;
      genetics relies on sampling of tumor DNA and its characterization through whole genome&#xD;
      sequencing techniques (NGS, Next Generation Sequencing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last 48 months, divides as follow: 24 months of enrollment phase and up to 24&#xD;
      months of follow-up. Follow-up will be performed on the 40th day after the end of radiation&#xD;
      treatment and then every 3 months until progression.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the efficacy of SBRT in inducing a regressive genetic trajectory of KRAS gene (evaluated by NGS technique) after SBRT treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>40 days after the end of RT</time_frame>
    <description>A genetic regressive trajectory is defined as KRAS mutated (any mutation) before SBRT and wild-type after SBRT (mutKRAS before SBRT→wtKRAS after SBRT). The sample size of the study is planned on this genetic trajectory, assuming a frequency of the phenomenon of 1/130 (as desumed from literature review). To be exhaustive, other realistic combinations are: wtKRAS→wtKRAS; mutKRAS→mutKRAS; wtKRAS→mutKRAS. Other assumptions for sample size calculation are: an alpha value of 0.05; a priori successful events rate of 0.077; 1-beta=0.60.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the response according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, version 1.1 including any eventual abscopal effect.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months after the end of RT</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the responses' duration (measured from the time of documented objective response until documented tumor progression).</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months after the end of RT</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the progression-free (PFS) survival (from the data of treatment start untill progression).</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months after the end of RT</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The toxicity, which will be graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) of the National Cancer Institute, version 5.0, November 27, 2017.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months after the end of RT</time_frame>
    <description>The CTCAE displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline. Higher scores mean worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Tumor immune microenvironment in primary tumour</measure>
    <time_frame>40 days after the end of RT</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate the tumor immune microenvironment (in particular the number of CD3+/CD8+/Granzyme B+ lymphocytes) of primary CRCs by immunohistochemistry (IHC).</description>
