  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating the combination of three drugs - acalabrutinib, venetoclax,&#xD;
      and obinutuzumab - as a possible treatment for relapsed or refractory and untreated mantle&#xD;
      cell lymphoma (MCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acalabrutinib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venetoclax&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obinutuzumab&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, investigator-initiated, single-arm, multi-cohort phase 1/2 study to&#xD;
      assess the safety and efficacy of the combination of acalabrutinib, venetoclax, and&#xD;
      obinutuzumab (AVO) in relapsed/refractory (R/R) and untreated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acalabrutinib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venetoclax&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obinutuzumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive study treatment for as long as there are no serious side effects&#xD;
      and the disease does not get worse. Participants will be followed for 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that 41 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase I/II clinical trial. Phase I clinical trials test the safety of&#xD;
      investigational drugs and also tries to define the appropriate dose of investigational drugs&#xD;
      to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drugs are being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved venetoclax and obinutuzumab&#xD;
           for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved acalabrutinib as a treatment&#xD;
           option for this disease.&#xD;

                  hormonal therapy for disease treated with curative intent is permissible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence&#xD;
                  of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adequately treated carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Low-risk prostate cancer on active surveillance&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Other exceptions may be made after consultation with the study chair&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known leptomeningeal or brain metastases. Imaging or spinal fluid&#xD;
             analysis to exclude CNS involvement is not required, unless there is clinical&#xD;
             suspicion by the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had a major surgery or significant traumatic injury within 4&#xD;
             weeks of start of study drug, participants who have not adequately recovered from the&#xD;
             side effects of any major surgery (defined as requiring general anesthesia), or&#xD;
             participants that may require major surgery during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vaccinated with live, attenuated vaccines within 28 days of study entry or need for&#xD;
             live virus vaccines at any time during study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or active hepatitis C virus (HCV) or&#xD;
             hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. HIV-positive participants are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions between certain components of&#xD;
             anti-retroviral therapy and venetoclax. Patients who are positive for hepatitis B core&#xD;
             antibody or hepatitis B surface antigen must have a negative polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
             (PCR) result before enrollment. Those who are PCR positive will be excluded. Those who&#xD;
             are positive for either hepatitis B surface antigen and/or hepatitis B core antibody&#xD;
             but negative for HBV DNA will be managed. Patients who are positive for HCV antibody&#xD;
             must be negative for HCV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to be eligible for study&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing or recent infection requiring intravenous antimicrobials at time of screening.&#xD;
             Patients with ongoing use of prophylactic antibiotics are eligible as long as there is&#xD;
             no evidence of active infection and the antibiotic is not included on the list of&#xD;
             prohibited medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness or psychiatric illness/social situations that would&#xD;
             limit compliance with study requirements, compromise the subject's safety, or put the&#xD;
             study outcomes at undue risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lactating or pregnant women are excluded from this study because venetoclax has been&#xD;
             shown to decrease implantation, litter size, live fetuses, and fetal body weight in&#xD;
             animal models. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in&#xD;
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with venetoclax, breastfeeding&#xD;
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with venetoclax. These potential risks&#xD;
             may also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known bleeding disorders (e.g. von Willebrand's disease) or hemophilia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of a bleeding gastrointestinal ulcer diagnosed by endoscopy within 3 months&#xD;
             prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of stroke or intracranial hemorrhage within 6 months prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who require warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists for anticoagulation&#xD;
             (other anticoagulants are allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently active, clinically significant cardiovascular disease, such as uncontrolled&#xD;
             arrhythmia or Class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure as defined by the New York Heart&#xD;
             Association Functional Classification; or a history of myocardial infarction, unstable&#xD;
             angina, or acute coronary syndrome within 6 months prior to randomization. Patients&#xD;
             with atrial fibrillation are allowed as long as they are adequately rate controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who require treatment with proton pump inhibitors. Subjects receiving&#xD;
             proton pump inhibitors who switch to H2-receptor antagonists or antacids are eligible&#xD;
             for enrollment on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who require concurrent treatment with strong CYP3A inhibitors or strong&#xD;
             CYP3A inducers are excluded from the study. If patients are receiving strong CYP3A&#xD;
             inhibitors/inducers at time of screening but do not require continuous administration&#xD;
             of these agents, these patients are eligible if there is a 7-day washout period&#xD;
             between discontinuation of the strong CYP3A inhibitor/inducer and initiation of the&#xD;
             first study drug, acalabrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who require concurrent treatment with P-gp inhibitors or narrow&#xD;
             therapeutic index P-gp substrates are excluded from the study. If patients are&#xD;
             receiving P-gp inhibitors or narrow therapeutic index P-gp substrates at time of&#xD;
             screening but do not require continuous administration of these agents, these patients&#xD;
             are eligible if there is a 7-day washout period between discontinuation of the P-gp&#xD;
             inhibitor and initiation of venetoclax.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to swallow capsules, a large number of tablets, or malabsorption syndrome,&#xD;
             disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal function, or resection of the stomach&#xD;
             or small bowel if thought by the investigator to compromise systemic absorption,&#xD;
             active, symptomatic inflammatory bowel disease or ulcerative colitis, or partial or&#xD;
             complete bowel obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant co-morbid condition or disease which in the judgment of the Principal&#xD;
             Investigator would place the participant at undue risk or interfere with the study.&#xD;
