  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised double-blinded placebo-controlled phase IV trial with two parallel&#xD;
      treatment groups receiving either immune nutrition diet (IND) or conventional diet for 2weeks&#xD;
      peri-radical cystectomy. Patients will be stratified according to the gender, body mass&#xD;
      index, and the type of urinary diversion (orthotopic neobladder or ileal conduit). The&#xD;
      primary end-point is to determine, in intention to treat analysis, the influence of IND on&#xD;
      90-day postoperative morbidity. Secondary study end-points will be the effect of IND on&#xD;
      infectious as well as non-infectious complications over 90 days, compliance and adverse&#xD;
      effects of IND. Finally, an ancillary study will be performed to evaluate whether the IND&#xD;
      costs could counterbalance, by its benefits, the health care costs.It is envisaged to finish&#xD;
      patients' recruitment within 24 months&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Radical cystectomy (RC) with pelvic lymphadenectomy is established as the gold standard&#xD;
      surgical treatment of muscle invasive bladder cancer. Major complication rates at 90 days as&#xD;
      high as 25% have been reported using a standardized reporting methodology even with the use&#xD;
      of enhanced recovery protocol after surgery (ERAS), high lighting the significance of&#xD;
      identification of the potential predictors to alleviate patients suffering after this complex&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major preoperative potentially reversible risk factor for severe postoperative morbidity is&#xD;
      nutritional status, even; it is considered recently the missed ring in the all available&#xD;
      morbidity prognostic indices. This was typically proving in other kinds of cancer. For&#xD;
      instance, it has been shown that patients at nutritional risk have had significantly&#xD;
      postoperative complications 10% as high as compared to those not at nutritional risk as well&#xD;
      as elevated rates of anastomotic leak and infections after colorectal surgery. Likewise, in&#xD;
      an observational trial, there was an increased risk of postoperative complications in&#xD;
      malnourished patients undergoing pneumonectomy for lung cancer.Furthermore, the hazardous&#xD;
      impact of malnutrition does extend beyond the potential morbidity to increased cost, hospital&#xD;
      stay, and readmission rates. Not surprisingly, the prognostic nutritional index was shown,&#xD;
      additionally, to influence the survival after total gastrectomy for patients with gastric&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With respect to urological literature, the incidence of malnutrition amany surgical&#xD;
      candidates largely differs according to the methodology implicated, ranging from 26-43%&#xD;
      according to the nutritional index scoring system and 19% using serum albumin level and&#xD;
      weight loss and body mass index. Moreover, the influence of poor nutritional status on&#xD;
      postoperative morbidity has been clearly identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Johnson et al have demonstrated an increased incidence of postoperative complications from&#xD;
      55% to 67% for patients with nutritional deficiency portrayed by low serum albumin level.&#xD;
      Similarly yet in gynecological cancers, hypoalbuminemia was an independent surrogate for&#xD;
      adverse postoperative events. Therefore, it has been highly recommended to implicate&#xD;
      innovative nutritional interventions for optimizing the outcome after radical cystectomy.What&#xD;
      is worth mention is that the active ingredients of immune diet were considerably the same&#xD;
      across studies on different cancers, and principally including arginine, omega-3 fatty acids,&#xD;
      and glutamine which have been proved to ameliorate the inflammatory and stress response of&#xD;
      the body to surgery, and consequently, minimizing the postoperative morbidity. It is also&#xD;
      particularly important to note that oral diet had been valued over parenteral injections&#xD;
      concerning efficacy and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, only two pilot trials have been applied elucidating the beneficial effect of immune&#xD;
      nutrition diet (IND) on postoperative morbidity and surgery-induced inflammations after&#xD;
      radical cystectomy.Hamilton-Reeves and associates have represented a reduction of 33% and 39%&#xD;
      in overall complications and infection rates, respectively. Then again, the authors have&#xD;
      shown a potential effect of the IND on the laboratory markers of inflammation. Equally&#xD;
      important, a decline by just below the half, falling from 77% to 40% complications rate, and&#xD;
      by more than half, from 66% to 20% infection rate, were noted in a prospective cohort&#xD;
      compared with historical control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yet, these studies were limited by the relative-low number of patients as both were&#xD;
      considered &quot;pilot&quot;. In addition, neither of both studies had determined the nutritional&#xD;
      status of the candidates prior to enrolment in the study protocol. Furthermore, there was no&#xD;
      control for some confounding variables like gender, body mass index and type of diversion,&#xD;
      which definitely would affect the primary outcome of these studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, this protocol was designed to assess the impact of IND on patients&#xD;
      undergoing radical cystectomy controlling for every single potential confounding variable.&#xD;
