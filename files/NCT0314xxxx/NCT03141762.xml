      This observational study aims to investigate the incidence and risk factors for falls in the&#xD;
      first 12 months post hospital discharge in patients following an ICU admission. It also aims&#xD;
      to determine factors at hospital discharge which may predict future falls risk at 12 months&#xD;
      and examine the physical activity levels of ICU survivors. Furthermore, it also will&#xD;
      investigate the relationship between falls, fear of falling and activity limitations and&#xD;
      participation restriction. It is a multicentre study over three sites: UK Healthcare,&#xD;
      Melbourne Health and Austin Health. All adult patients in intensive care that have been&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated for over 24 hours, and remain in the ICU more than 4 days will be&#xD;
      considerer for inclusion. The primary outcome measure is a 12 month falls diary which&#xD;
      commences on hospital discharge. There will also be Physiotherapy assessments just prior to&#xD;
      hospital discharge, 3, 6, and 12 months post hospital discharge.&#xD;
