    <textblock>
      Physicians' assessment of disease activity in SLE is fundamental but challenging. The&#xD;
      Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI-2K) is one of the most commonly&#xD;
      used disease activity indices. Clinical trials experience suggested that the disease activity&#xD;
      instruments did not function well on their own, and composite measures were developed to&#xD;
      address this issue. This approach has been adopted after learning from clinical trials that&#xD;
      the absence of a robust sensitive index is a major flaw when designing a trial. Another issue&#xD;
      with clinical trials is the confounding effect of corticosteroids, which to date have been&#xD;
      the most effective treatment for the management of lupus. However, unregulated use of&#xD;
      corticosteroids in drug trials decrease the investigator's ability to differentiate between&#xD;
      the tested drugs and placebo as they appear to enhance response among the placebo arm and&#xD;
      thus mask the effect of the tested drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the aim is to develop and validate a new index, SLEDAI-2K Glucocorticosteroid&#xD;
      Index (SLEDAI-2KG). It is very challenging to evaluate improvement in drug trials in the&#xD;
      context of the standard of care treatment which includes corticosteroids. This novel index,&#xD;
      SLEDAI-2KG, will help to overcome the confounding effect of corticosteroids and to allow for&#xD;
      more accurate description of disease improvement and thus facilitate accurate investigations&#xD;
      of new therapeutic agents.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe the development and initial validation of the SLEDAI-2KG using the Toronto&#xD;
           Lupus Cohort (TLC) database.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To conduct further validation of SLEDAI-2KG using BLISS trial data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess concurrent construct validity of SLEDAI-2KG prospectively in the University of&#xD;
           Toronto Lupus Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Objective one is a single center study aiming to derive a new index, SLEDAI-2KG, based&#xD;
           on SLEDAI-2K. Scoring of SLEDAI-2KG will be determined in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objective two is a retrospective analysis conducted on prospectively collected data from&#xD;
           two clinical trials, BLISS-52 and BLISS-76.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Objective three is a single centre prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population and Sampling Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective I patient selection: Patients with active disease, SLEDAI-2K ≥0, will be identified&#xD;
      in the TLC database. All patients must have follow up visits at 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective II: Data from BLISS-52 and BLISS-76 trials will be used. Objective III patient&#xD;
      selection: Patients followed at the Toronto Lupus Clinic from May 2017 to December 2017.&#xD;
      Patients will be identified based on active disease with a flare (increase in SLEDAI-2K by at&#xD;
      least 4 requiring an increase in the dose of prednisone to ≥ 15 mg/day or initiation of&#xD;
      prednisone at ≥ 15 mg/day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective III patient selection: Patients followed at the Toronto Lupus Clinic from May 2017&#xD;
      to December 2017. The investigator will identify patients with active disease with a flare&#xD;
      (increase in SLEDAI-2K by at least 4 requiring an increase in the dose of prednisone to ≥ 15&#xD;
      mg/day or initiation of prednisone at ≥ 15 mg/day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Sources:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The University of Toronto Lupus Cohort dataset and GSK BLISS-52 and BLISS-76 trial data The&#xD;
      Toronto Lupus Cohort (TLC) is the largest lupus cohort in Canada, and more than 1600 patients&#xD;
      have been enrolled in this cohort. Patients in the TLC are seen at regular intervals (2-6&#xD;
      months apart) and data, including laboratory and clinical parameters important to lupus, is&#xD;
      collected using a well-defined protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In objective I - Phase 1 will focus on the identification of scenarios of real patients to&#xD;
      derive weight scores for Glucocorticosteroid (GCS). Phase 2 will focus on the development of&#xD;
      SLEDAI-2KG (derivation of an equation to explain the link between SLEDAI-2K and GCS doses)&#xD;
      and phase 3 focused on SLEDAI-2KG validation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of the initial validation of SLEDAI-2KG will be conducted on the selected&#xD;
      patients from the TLC. Improved patients (responders) will be identified based on SLEDAI-2K&#xD;
      definition of improvement and further will be studied by calculating the SLEDAI-2KG using the&#xD;
      above described models. The mean change of SLEDAI-2K scores and the mean change of SLEDAI-2KG&#xD;
      scores in the responders will be studied. Using the SLEDAI-2K responders as &quot;Gold Standard&quot;,&#xD;
      it will be determined if SLEDAI-2KG responders are true responders and not false responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concurrent construct validity: A clinician (external construct) who does not know the&#xD;
      patients and will evaluate each patient's record (electronic record and medical chart) and&#xD;
      assign a clinical activity score for each assessment according to the following scale:&#xD;
      improved, same, and worse, using standardized predefined definitions. The correlation between&#xD;
      the external construct and the change in SLEDAI-2K and SLEDAI-2KG scores will be studied.&#xD;
      Using the clinician scoring of disease activity-Improved as &quot;Gold Standard&quot;, the results of&#xD;
      SLEDAI-2K and SLEDAI-2KG responders will be analyzed by constructing two 2x2 tables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size for 3 objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size 1: The sample size calculation of needed scenarios was based on the assumption of&#xD;
      reliability (Intra-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC)) ≥ 0.80 with a standard error of 0.05&#xD;
      and 3 raters. The required minimum was 46 scenarios.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size 2: For objective two all data available from the BLISS-52 and BLISS-76 trials&#xD;
      will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size 3: For objective three the investigator's target sample size is 100 patients and&#xD;
      to achieve this number at least 18 months will be required and subsequently a 6 months period&#xD;
      for follow-up for each patients. Based on the COSMIN recommendations, a sample size ≥100 is&#xD;
      recommended in this step&#xD;

    <description>SLEDAI-2KG will be further validated using BLISS-52 and BLISS-7S trial data on all patients that were enrolled. The primary endpoint in both trials was SLE Responder Index (SRI).

The primary outcome of this objective is the SRI-modified: The SRI-modified will include the 2nd and 3rd components of SRI, but replace the SELENA-SLEDAI with the SLEDAI-2KG.</description>
