      In this study, the investigators will evaluate genetic variation or polymorphisms between&#xD;
      individuals submitted to IVF/ICSI cycles, and how these variations influence response to COS&#xD;
      and pregnancy outcomes. Thus, this project has the aim to develop a pharmacogenetic algorithm&#xD;
      associating gene polymorphisms, the patient clinical information, and functional and hormonal&#xD;
      biomarker to: 1) predict the patient response to gonadotropin; 2) develop individualized&#xD;
      gonadotropin regimens; 3) improve the accuracy of determining appropriate dosages of&#xD;
      gonadotrophins; 4) improve efficacy and patient compliance to COS; and finally 5) reduce the&#xD;
      time-to-pregnancy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) is crucial for optimizing in vitro fertilization (IVF) /&#xD;
      intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) success. Multiple factors influence the ovarian&#xD;
      response to COS, making predictions about oocyte yields not so straightforward. As a result,&#xD;
      ovarian response may be poor or suboptimal, or even excessive, all of which has negative&#xD;
      consequences to the affected patient. The study of gene polymorphisms regulating the female&#xD;
      reproductive function may help to clarify the mechanisms responsible for gonadal function and&#xD;
      fertility, and also the inter-individual variability in ovarian response to COS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of COS is obtaining an adequate number of good quality oocytes, and also&#xD;
      minimize the adverse drug reactions and cycle cancellations due to a high or poor response.&#xD;
      The ideal number of oocytes to optimize treatment outcomes has been subject of debate for&#xD;
      many years. However, based on recent published data, it seems reasonable to define the&#xD;
      optimal number of oocytes to be retrieved after an adequate COS as 10-15 oocytes. To perform&#xD;
      an adequate COS, it has been suggested that the antral follicle count (AFC) and&#xD;
      anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) are the best biomarkers to predict the ovarian response.&#xD;
      Recently, two nomograms have been proposed for the calculation of the follicle stimulating&#xD;
      hormone (FSH) starting dose for COS, taking into account different parameters, namely: 1)&#xD;
      Age, AFC and day 3 serum FSH; and 2) Age, serum AMH and FSH. Meanwhile, these prediction&#xD;
      models are not able to predict an unexpected poor response and also a higher and undesirable&#xD;
      ovarian response to FSH monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the number of retrieved oocytes, it has been recently purposed a new patient&#xD;
      stratification during ART treatments: poor response (1-3 oocytes); sub-optimal response (4-9&#xD;
      oocytes); normal response (10-15 oocytes); high response (&gt;15 oocytes). The reason to create&#xD;
      this new category of sub-optimal responder is that they have poorer outcomes during ART&#xD;
      treatments when compared to patients that have 10-15 oocytes retrieved. This category of&#xD;
      sub-optimal responder has led to the introduction of new concept in reproductive medicine&#xD;
      with the objective to stratify low prognosis patients undergoing ART based on the combination&#xD;
      of quantitative and qualitative parameters. There is a group of patients that although&#xD;
      present normal biomarkers of ovarian reserve, such as AFC and AMH, they have a sub-optimal&#xD;
      response to COS. They have 9 retrieved oocytes, showing the inadequacy of using only the&#xD;
      traditional ovarian reserve biomarkers to predict the ovarian response. This sub-optimal&#xD;
      response should be related to ovarian sensitivity to exogenous gonadotrophins modulated by&#xD;
      genetic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, adoption of a pharmacogenetic approach in assisted reproduction seems attractive as it&#xD;
      may help understanding the relationship between genetic variants and ovarian response to&#xD;
      exogenous gonadotropins. The patient´s genetic profile could be used to select the most&#xD;
      appropriate gonadotropin type, predict the optimal dosage for each drug, develop&#xD;
      cost-effective treatment plan, maximize the success rates, and finally decrease the&#xD;
      time-to-pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study of genetic polymorphisms is undoubtedly a promising field in reproductive medicine.&#xD;
      The candidate genes that play a role in the ovarian response to COS are as follows: i) genes&#xD;
      that affect follicular function by exerting a hormonal effect - FSH, FSHR, V-LH, AMH, AMHR2,&#xD;
      ERα, ERβ, CYP17, CYP19, COMT, MTHFR, GnRH1, KISS1, and KISS1R; ii) genes that affect the rate&#xD;
      of initial primordial follicle recruitment in relation to the pool of growing follicles -&#xD;
      BMP15, GDF9, and FOXL2; and iii) genes that encode DNA binding proteins and transcription&#xD;
      factors, such as LHX8 and NANOS3. Variations in these genes can determine the variability of&#xD;
      the follicular pool and explain the variance of the COS response and the results of ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In modern reproductive medicine, where the individualization and personalized treatments&#xD;
      should be the norm, optimizing and obtaining the best result in each COS would be of great&#xD;
      interest to both clinicians and patients alike. Considering the variability of patients´&#xD;
      response to COS, it is clear inadequate to select the type of gonadotropin and its initial&#xD;
      dose empirically or based only on clinical and hormonal parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will evaluate genetic variation or polymorphisms between&#xD;
      individuals submitted to IVF/ICSI cycles, and how these variations influence response to COS&#xD;
      and pregnancy outcomes. Thus, this project has the aim to develop a pharmacogenetic algorithm&#xD;
      associating gene polymorphisms, the patient clinical information, and functional and hormonal&#xD;
      biomarker to: 1) predict the patient response to gonadotropin; 2) develop individualized&#xD;
      gonadotropin regimens; 3) improve the accuracy of determining appropriate dosages of&#xD;
      gonadotrophins; 4) improve efficacy and patient compliance to COS; and finally 5) reduce the&#xD;
      time-to-pregnancy.&#xD;
