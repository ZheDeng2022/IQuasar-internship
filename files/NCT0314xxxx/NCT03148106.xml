  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what are the best settings for applying electrical&#xD;
      nerve stimulation over the skin for the short-term improvement of hand dysfunction after a&#xD;
      stroke. The ultimate goal is to some day design an effective long-term training program to&#xD;
      help someone recovery their ability to use their hands and function independently at home and&#xD;
      in society. In order to know how to apply electrical nerve stimulation to produce a good&#xD;
      long-term effect on hand dysfunction, we first need to know how to make it work best in the&#xD;
      short-term, and improve our understanding of for whom it works and how it works.We will use a&#xD;
      commercially available transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) unit to gently&#xD;
      apply electrical nerve stimulation over the skin of the affected arm. This is a portable,&#xD;
      safe and easy to use device designed for patients to operate in their homes.&#xD;

    <description>We will put adhesive electrodes on the affected arm and connect it to a device that will deliver a gentle electrical stimulation to the hand and arm. The stimulation will last for different amounts of time, depending on the stimulation condition. This can be 30 minutes twice a day (1 hour apart), 1 hour continuously, 2 hours continuously, or 3 hours continuously. The stimulation conditions will also vary in stimulation strength. It is normal that some people may feel a tingling sensation, while others may feel nothing.</description>
