    <textblock>
      Pain following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is associated with delayed recovery, impaired&#xD;
      mobility, increased morbidity, longer hospital stay and greater cost. Adductor canal block&#xD;
      has recently been shown to improve the pain control of patients following TKA. It is not&#xD;
      known whether a single shot technique or a continuous catheter-based infusion technique&#xD;
      provides optimal analgesia. The investigators hypothesize that a continuous technique would&#xD;
      provide better analgesia and permit patients to achieve objective measures of recovery&#xD;
      following TKA than a single shot technique.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total knee Arthroplasty (TKA) is the standard treatment for knee osteoarthritis, which&#xD;
      affects millions of people world wide. In 2008, more than 600,000 TKAs were performed in the&#xD;
      United States. This number represents more than double the number performed in 1999 and is&#xD;
      estimated to increase by more than 500 % (from the 1999 value) by 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe postoperative pain occurs in 60% and moderate pain in 30% of patients undergoing TKA.&#xD;
      In addition, the intensity of acute postoperative pain correlates with the risk of developing&#xD;
      a persistent post surgical pain which can be chronic and debilitating. Thus, the management&#xD;
      of pain following TKA is an important determinant of a patient's long term functional&#xD;
      outcome. In addition, recovery from TKA requires extensive and effective postoperative&#xD;
      physiotherapy (PT), itself a painful event following TKA. Physiotherapy ensures good range of&#xD;
      motion and prevents complications such as tissue retraction, adhesion formation and muscle&#xD;
      atrophy, all of which may compromise achievement of long term recovery milestones. Thus, the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist caring for patients undergoing TKA attempts to provide a postoperative&#xD;
      analgesic regimen which ensures that the patient is as pain free as possible while ensuring&#xD;
      that the patient has sufficient motor strength to participate actively in PT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need to find non-narcotic alternatives for post surgical pain management has become even&#xD;
      more urgent recently due to the recent epidemic of narcotic-related deaths. In the United&#xD;
      States the number of opioid related deaths since 1999 has reached almost half a million which&#xD;
      represents a four fold increase in incidence, and at least half of opioid related deaths&#xD;
      involve prescription drugs. Hence effective non-narcotic approaches to pain management hold&#xD;
      great importance not only for clinical care but also for public health on a larger scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, intravenous, intrathecal or oral opioids were the mainstay of postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia following TKA. Although variably effective, the resulting analgesia is associated&#xD;
      with well recognized adverse effects including nausea, vomiting, pruritus and sedation. Each&#xD;
      adverse effect is unpleasant and likely to impede recovery and participation in PT. Epidural&#xD;
      catheters and femoral nerve blocks have both been used for postoperative analgesia in this&#xD;
      setting, but each is associated with lower limb motor weakness which hinders early&#xD;
      implementation of PT and may increase the risk of falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, adductor canal block (ACB) has been reported as an effective means of providing&#xD;
      post-operative analgesia for TKA. The ACB is not a new block, having been first described by&#xD;
      van der Wal over 20 years ago. The adductor canal block, in the context of analgesia&#xD;
      following TKA, is relatively recent, being first described by Tsai et al in 2010.&#xD;
      Infiltration of local anesthetic into the adductor canal blocks primarily the saphenous&#xD;
      nerve, a sensory nerve, which supplies the medial and anteromedial aspects of the knee via an&#xD;
      infra patellar branch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pain following TKA extends well beyond the 8-12 hour duration of a single bolus&#xD;
      injection of local anesthetic. Continuous peripheral nerve blockade (PNB) can facilitate&#xD;
      early discharge and better rehabilitation in the early postoperative period. In addition, PNB&#xD;
      decreases opioid consumption, its associated side effects and is also associated with greater&#xD;
      patient satisfaction .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that patients receiving continuous adductor canal block would&#xD;
      achieve a greater degree of active knee flexion on POD 2 following TKA than those who receive&#xD;
      a single injection ACB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Subjects With Institutional ethical approval from the Clinical Research Ethics&#xD;
      Committee of the Cork Teaching Hospitals, 40 consecutive patients scheduled for unilateral&#xD;
      Total Knee Arthroplasty who met the study criteria and provided written informed consent,&#xD;
      were enrolled in a double blind, randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly allocated to receive either an ACB followed by catheter placement&#xD;
      (n=20) or an adductor canal block followed by sham catheter placement (n=20). The sham&#xD;
      catheter was placed on the surface of the leg and covered by an opaque dressing to conceal&#xD;
      the insertion site. (A similar dressing was placed on real catheter insertions to conceal&#xD;
      group assignment from both patient and assessor.) All patients had the proximal end of their&#xD;
      catheter attached to a Pajunk 350 ml FuserPump (FuserPumps are portable elastomeric infusion&#xD;
      pumps) concealed in opaque bags to prevent patients and assessors from determining which&#xD;
      pumps were actually functioning. These pumps function without a motor and so make no sound.&#xD;
      Computer generated randomization was performed for patient group assignment at the time of&#xD;
      enrolment in the study. Randomization assignments were done in blocks of 10 in a 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      with assignments placed in sealed numbered opaque envelopes. Only the anesthesiologist&#xD;
      responsible for performing the block was aware of the group to which a given patient was&#xD;
      assigned. The researchers responsible for data collection were unaware of the group to which&#xD;
      each patient was assigned .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative Preparation Potential patients were provided information on the study during the&#xD;
      preoperative physiotherapy assessment several weeks before their scheduled surgery. At this&#xD;
      time, baseline values for knee flexion and the TUG test were obtained. On the day of surgery,&#xD;
      after obtaining written informed consent, patients were assigned to a study group by&#xD;
      attaching a sealed randomization envelope to their charts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After registration on the day of surgery patients were brought to the pre-anesthetic area&#xD;
      where IV cannulation was performed and standard anesthetic monitors applied. Patients&#xD;
      received intravenous sedation prior to placement of the spinal anesthetic at the discretion&#xD;
      of the responsible consultant anesthesiologist. A spinal anesthetic was performed under&#xD;
      standard aseptic conditions in the usual fashion. The choice of local anesthetic (either&#xD;
      isobaric bupivacaine 0.5% or hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5%.) used to perform the spinal&#xD;
      anesthetic was at the discretion of the responsible consultant anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative Period Patients received intraoperative sedation at the discretion of the&#xD;
      consultant anesthesiologist using fentanyl, midazolam and propofol as deemed clinically&#xD;
      appropriate. At the conclusion of the procedure, the patients received 30 ml 0.5% bupivacaine&#xD;
      diluted with 70 ml 0.9% saline local infiltration analgesia (LIA) injected into the layers of&#xD;
      soft tissue around the knee joint by the surgeon. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative Period All blocks were performed in the Post Anaesthesia Care Unit immediately&#xD;
      after surgery with standard anesthetic monitoring and an IV cannula in place. No subcutaneous&#xD;
      local anesthetic or sedation were required as the spinal anesthetic was still effective. All&#xD;
      patients received an adductor canal block under ultrasound guidance using a high frequency&#xD;
      probe at the mid thigh level. After appropriate asepsis local anesthesia to the skin was&#xD;
      placed at the level of the mid femur on the medial aspect of the thigh. Using ultrasound&#xD;
      guidance (General Electric Venue 40, 3050 Lake Drive, Citywest Business Campus, Dublin 24,&#xD;
      Ireland) with a high frequency L12 linear transducer the femoral artery was visualized in&#xD;
      cross section and the ultrasound needle (B Braun Contiplex D ultrasound needle and catheter&#xD;
      set, B Braun Melsungen AG, 34209 Melsungen, Germany) placed using in-plane visualization&#xD;
      below the Sartorius muscle and just lateral to the femoral artery and medial to the Vastus&#xD;
      Medialis. All patients received an injection of bupivacaine 0.5% 10 ml. For patients&#xD;
      allocated to receive a continuous infusion postoperatively, a catheter was inserted&#xD;
      immediately after injection of the initial bolus of local anesthetic. Patients allocated to&#xD;
      the single injection group received the injection of local anesthetic followed by placement&#xD;
      of a sham catheter on the skin, covered with a large opaque dressing. (Figure 3) In both&#xD;
      groups, patients' catheters were attached to the concealed in opaque bags. The sham pumps&#xD;
      were filled with normal saline. The pumps containing local anesthetic contained 0.15625%&#xD;
      bupivacaine 350 ml were set to run at 8 ml/ hour (the equivalent of 0.125 % bupivacaine&#xD;
      running at 10 ml/hour) All blocks were placed by Consultant anesthesiologists with fellowship&#xD;
      training in Regional Anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients received multimodal oral analgesia which included Paracetamol 1g po every 6&#xD;
      hours, oxycodone (oxycontin) po twice a day (10 mg/dose for patients &gt;70 years and 20 mg/dose&#xD;
      for those &lt;70 years) , pregabalin 50 mg po 3 times a day, and oxycodone (oxynorm) 5-10mg 4&#xD;
      hourly po as required for breakthrough pain (Pain score &gt; 4/10)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recordings and Measurements Research personnel unaware of patient randomization performed all&#xD;
      clinical assessments. General Demographic data collected included: age, gender, height,&#xD;
      weight, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Status and BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of block function was made by checking for sensory changes to pain and temperature&#xD;
      (using a blunt needle and ethyl chloride spray) in the distribution of the saphenous nerve at&#xD;
      20:00 on POD 0. A functioning adductor canal block with bupivacaine will last at least 8-12&#xD;
      hours. Thus all blocks,( i.e. both with and without a continuous infusion) were anticipated&#xD;
      to still be effective at 20:00H on the day of surgery, as no blocks were performed before 10&#xD;
      AM. Decreased sensation in the extremity receiving the block compared with the unblocked one&#xD;
      at the level of the medial malleolus was accepted as evidence of a functioning block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events Each day the assessor inquired about complications that could be attributable&#xD;
      to the study, such as patient falls or symptoms or signs of local anesthetic toxicity. Any&#xD;
      such events were documented. The common adverse effects of opioids (i.e. nausea, vomiting)&#xD;
      were not recorded. However, there were no episodes of respiratory depression that required&#xD;
      resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methodology Sample size was determined based on an unpublished retrospective&#xD;
      review of knee flexion in patients who had undergone TKA at the investigators institution&#xD;
      having received a single injection ACB. From this review, a mean maximum knee flexion of 82&#xD;
      (SD = 2) degrees on the second day postoperatively was assumed. A 20% difference in knee&#xD;
      flexion was considered to be clinically significant. To achieve an 80% power and to detect a&#xD;
      20% difference in knee flexion with a 2-sided Type I error rate of 0.05, the calculated&#xD;
      minimum sample was 9 patients per group. To prevent loss of power due to early withdrawal of&#xD;
      patients, incomplete data, non-functional adductor canal blocks and absence of statistical&#xD;
      information on a comparable continuous infusion group, 20 patients in each were included&#xD;
      group. General demographic data in both groups were compared using unpaired, two tailed&#xD;
      t-tests for independent samples for continuous variables, and the Chi squared test (or&#xD;
      Fisher's Exact test as appropriate) for categorical variables. Basic statistical tools were&#xD;
      employed to describe the data: mean, median and standard deviation. Cumulative oxycodone&#xD;
      consumption was compared between groups using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted for&#xD;
      age, gender and ASA status.&#xD;
