  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The care environment influences both patients' experiences of care as well as staff's&#xD;
      experiences of the work environment. A radical change in physical environment is planned at a&#xD;
      psychiatric ward, aiming at creating a care environment that supports patients' opportunities&#xD;
      for recovery from mental ill-health and to create a better and more attractive work&#xD;
      environment for the staff. The rebuilding involves a new ward layout and new innovations such&#xD;
      as light installations, a comfort room and an activity room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study uses a single-system design to evaluate the effects of the intervention - the&#xD;
      rebuilt ward. Both quantitative and qualitative data will be used in the evaluation. Data&#xD;
      will be collected using questionnaires measuring dimensions of patients' well-being and&#xD;
      experiences of the care environment, staff's experiences of work-related stress and work&#xD;
      environment, quality of care, a device measuring physical activity, existing clinical&#xD;
      registers and data from medical files, staff' sick leave, participant observations, and&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This evaluation study, to our knowledge the first of it's kind in Sweden, is expected to&#xD;
      generate important knowledge of the effect of the change process that can be used at other&#xD;
      psychiatric wards to design the inpatient care environment. In the long run, the study could&#xD;
      lead to a better reputation of psychiatric nursing and to more attractive workplaces.&#xD;
