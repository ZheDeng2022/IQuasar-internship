  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is highly prevalent among older adults. Adequate treatment is crucial to&#xD;
      maintain health, improve functional status and independency. For severely malnourished&#xD;
      patient, tube feeding is often the most effective treatment, but it also implies a risk of&#xD;
      developing refeeding syndrome (RFS). RFS is described as fluid and electrolyte shifts&#xD;
      particular hypophosphatemia when recommencing nutrition, potentially causing fatal&#xD;
      complications. In 2006 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) developed&#xD;
      guidelines regarding 1) detecting patients at risk for RFS and 2) a treatment plan for&#xD;
      refeeding severely malnourished patients. These guidelines have never been validated. Hence,&#xD;
      there is a need to explore the use of different refeeding regimens in the treatment of older&#xD;
      malnourished patients, in regards to assess safety, as well as the impact of the treatment,&#xD;
      on functional status, independency, quality of life and RFS. This will be the first&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) that challenges the existing NICE guidelines. A blinded RCT&#xD;
      study, with the aim of tube feeding patients at risk for developing RFS, and assigned either&#xD;
      to an intervention group or to a control group, comparing the different refeeding regimens.&#xD;
      This study will help develop safe and validated refeeding protocols for severely malnourished&#xD;
      older patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before 2006, the recommended initial refeeding rate was around 20-25kcal/kg/day for severely&#xD;
      malnourished patients. But due to the risk of RFS, the National Institute of Health and&#xD;
      Clinical Excellence (NICE) in 2006 published new guidelines, recommending a very cautious&#xD;
      refeeding level of only 5-10 kcal/kg/day. However, the supporting literature underpinning the&#xD;
      evidence that results in the above recommendations is weak, and is mostly based upon cohort&#xD;
      studies, case series and consensus expert opinions. RFS was first identified and reported on&#xD;
      in the late forties when starved concentration camp inmates and prisoners of war developed&#xD;
      cardiac arrest, neuralgic symptoms and/or peripheral edema during recommencement of feeding.&#xD;
      Similar symptoms were noticed again during the 1970's and 1980's, when parenteral nutrition&#xD;
      was used widely, and carbohydrate provision was not restricted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients defined as at risk for RFS are those who are malnourished and have recently lost&#xD;
      weight. In addition, patients with, eating disorders, uncontrolled diabetes, cancer,&#xD;
      malabsorption syndromes, alcoholics, surgical patients, elderly, and patients who are fasting&#xD;
      or have undergone bariatric surgery, are high risk groups. It is well known that low levels&#xD;
      of electrolytes are fatal, and may cause cardiac-and lung problems, affect the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal-and the immune system, and increase the occurrence of sepsis and infections.&#xD;
      Even severely malnourished patients have normal electrolyte levels upon admission, but when&#xD;
      refeeding, a rapid drop in electrolytes, especially phosphate, may occur, usually within 2-5&#xD;
      days. Electrolytes like potassium and sodium are measured routinely, but magnesium and&#xD;
      phosphate are not included in routine laboratory tests, and therefore often overlooked.&#xD;
      Studies have found that patients screened as &quot;not at risk&quot; also develop RFS confirming the&#xD;
      need for monitoring phosphate levels on a broader group than just patients at risk. Two main&#xD;
      challenges regarding RFS are the absence of a clear definition and the uncertainties&#xD;
      regarding the optimal refeeding rate. However, new onset hypophosphatemia after refeeding is&#xD;
      a good predictor of RFS and will be used in this study when defining RFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Refeeding syndrome in Anorexia Nervosa:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most studies on RFS conducted on patients with eating disorders, but few are Randomized&#xD;
      Controlled Trials (RCT). In later years there has been a paradigm shift in regards to&#xD;
      refeeding patients with anorexia nervosa (AN). For years, a low calorie approach has been&#xD;
      recommended, but these recommendations has led to poor weight gain and prolonged hospital&#xD;
      stay. Garber et al. did a systematic review on refeeding patients with AN, and concluded that&#xD;
      higher calorie approaches on AN patients in hospital is feasible, when close medical&#xD;
      monitoring is provided. Studies on patients with eating disorders indicate that the severity&#xD;
      of malnutrition rather than the total energy intake predict the development of RFS. For&#xD;
      instance a calorie level at both 125 and 1900 kcal a day led to hypophosphatemia. The great&#xD;
      difference in recommendation for initial refeeding rates in patients with eating disorders,&#xD;
      illustrates the lack of studies and international consensus on the topic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Older adults and refeeding syndrome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall only a few studies are done on tube feeding (TF) in older adults with the aim of&#xD;
      improving nutritional status. Regarding RFS and older adults, there are only six clinical&#xD;
      trials, but none of them RCT's. These trials are mostly looking at occurrence of RFS, and&#xD;
      they all use different cut off levels when defining hypophosphatemia (HP). In addition, they&#xD;
      all used different outcomes measures; either mortality rates, delirium or muscle strength,&#xD;
      which in the end makes it difficult to compare the studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When refeeding malnourished patients the effect on physical function is often the first sign&#xD;
      of improvement. Hand grip strength (HGS) is a relevant marker of physical function, and has&#xD;
      been shown to be a legitimate indicator of nutritional status. In some populations HGS may&#xD;
      even predict outcomes better than traditional nutritional markers such as weight to height&#xD;
      ratios, weight loss or limb circumference . Reduced HGS is associated with increased LoS),&#xD;
      increased risk of complication, premature mortality and earlier onset of dependency. Recently&#xD;
      a study has shown that lower HGS at discharge is associated with higher 30-day readmission&#xD;
      rate, and might be a useful indicator to detect patient at risk of readmission, and the need&#xD;
      for individualize discharge planning including nutrition care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although it is reported that refeeding too cautiously can place patients at even further risk&#xD;
      of malnutrition, postpone recovery and lead to unnecessary loss of physical function but NICE&#xD;
      has stated that guidelines cannot be changed unless more high-quality RCTs are performed.&#xD;
      This study will provide new knowledge regarding how to refeed severely malnourished elderly&#xD;
      patients. By providing them with 40% more calories and protein the first 7 days of&#xD;
      hospitalization one can expect faster improvements in regards to physical function,&#xD;
      independency, reduced readmission-and mortality rates. In addition this study provides new&#xD;
      knowledge regarding the necessity to monitor phosphate levels in patients not identified as&#xD;
      at risk of developing RFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that providing a higher initial refeeding rate,&#xD;
      reaching estimated calorie and protein needs faster, is as safe as following NICE guidelines.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that the intervention group will improve HGS, and&#xD;
      achieve a better long-term effects compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigate if a high initial refeeding rate is safe and leads to improvement of the&#xD;
           patient's physical function and independency compare to a slower refeeding rate?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the long-term effects three months after discharge between two different&#xD;
           refeeding regimens regarding physical function, independency, quality of life, mental&#xD;
           test score, readmission and mortality rates&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the feasibility of the project: it will be carried out on all medical and surgical&#xD;
      wards at Diakonhjemmet hospital. Refeeding of patients using tube feeding is part of routine&#xD;
      care. The study is already approved by the Regional Ethic Committee (REC) and the head of the&#xD;
      departments at Diakonhjemmet hospital have been informed and approved the research project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Refeeding guidelines forms are premade based on kg and type of intervention (fast or slow)&#xD;
      and will be inserted as phrases in the electronic medical journal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding recruitment of patients, it is estimated to include 1.5 patients a week (63&#xD;
      patients in a year based on 42 recruiting weeks in a year). The estimation is based on a&#xD;
      point prevalence of malnutrition performed in 2016, where 12 patients out of the 72 screened&#xD;
      patients 65 years and older (16.7%), had BMI &lt;18.5. The calculation was based on a 10 %&#xD;
      agreement of participation. To be even more cautious the investigators estimates a&#xD;
      recruitment of 126 patients ,within 3 years, based on patients accessibility of 4000 new&#xD;
      admissions a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study period there will be regular meetings with the supervisors and the project&#xD;
      coordinator, located at the same ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research assistant (RA) will perform the physical test and questionnaires, in hospital and&#xD;
      at 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publications:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Will a higher initial refeeding rate, meeting estimated calories and protein needs&#xD;
           faster, in severely malnourished older patients affect patient's handgrip strength?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Effects of two different refeeding regimes in severely malnourished older patients&#xD;
           admitted to hospital in regards to physical function, cognition, quality of life,&#xD;
           activities of daily living, and readmission and mortality rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The difference in occurrence of electrolyte disturbances comparing two refeeding regimes&#xD;
           in severely malnourished older patients admitted to hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Statistics The sample size estimation is performed using HGS as the primary&#xD;
      endpoint. A clinically important difference was defined as a mean difference in HGS of 1 kg&#xD;
      between baseline and follow up between the two treatment groups. Then, if the true mean&#xD;
      difference in the intervention and control group in HGS between baseline and follow up is 1&#xD;
      kg with an estimated standard deviation of 1.8, the investigator will need to study a minimum&#xD;
      of 52 patients in each treatment group, a total of 104 patients, considering a type I error&#xD;
      of 5% and a power of 80%. Due to possible drop-outs the sample size will be increased with 20&#xD;
      %, which gives a total of 126 patients i.e. 63 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS version 20. Data will be presented as the&#xD;
      mean and standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables and as percentages for categorical&#xD;
      variables. Differences between the intervention group and control group will be assessed by&#xD;
      t-tests for continuous data, with non-parametric test for ordinal data and with the&#xD;
      chi-squared test for categorical data. The main statistical assessment of primary and&#xD;
      secondary endpoint with repeated measurements will be mixed models for repeated measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be analysed following the intention to treat principles and all the randomized&#xD;
      patients will be included in the analyses. LoS will be calculated as the difference between&#xD;
      the day of admission and the day of hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      User involvement The project is presented to and discussed with the User Committee (UC) at&#xD;
      Diakonhjemmet Hospital. This study will recruit a very heterogenic patient group, which makes&#xD;
      it difficult to find suitable users. In that matter, the UC has been chosen to represent the&#xD;
      patients. UC has approved the project as they considers it to be clinically relevant and&#xD;
      benefit for the users, and further supports an application. UCs representatives made&#xD;
      important contributions regarding the target group of the project. The UC have raised&#xD;
      concerns regarding patients with dementia making sure that their integrity is cared for&#xD;
      throughout the study. The UC also emphasized patients degree of dementia, and the importance&#xD;
      to reflect critically and continually on the participative process. It is important that they&#xD;
      understand the nature of the research and his /her participation. In addition that patients&#xD;
      with dementia, shows the ability to consider alternatives, including the option not to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Another concern from the UC is the older adults without dementia&#xD;
      that might feel obligated to sign the informed consent and the need for the researcher to&#xD;
      clearly state that this is voluntary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UC has also provided input to the consent form to ensure clear and user-friendly language.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will be presented to the UC at their meetings in 2016 and will be regularly&#xD;
      informed of the progress and given the opportunity to provide input and advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PhD candidate will attend a course in &quot;User involvement in research and service design&quot;&#xD;
      to strengthen her expertise and ensure the safeguarding of the user's role and participation&#xD;
      in the research project (25th of May 2016).&#xD;
