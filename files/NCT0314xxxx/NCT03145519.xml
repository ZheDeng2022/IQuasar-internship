  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial to demonstrate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of the OptiVein IV Catheter in the pediatric population. The study&#xD;
      hypothesis is that OptiVein IV Catheter use will be superior to the control in successful&#xD;
      venous access after first attempt.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The OptiVein IV Catheter is a sterile single use disposable intravascular cannulation device&#xD;
      that is modified from CE certified Vasofix Certo Catheter from B.Braun with the additional&#xD;
      features of an optical fiber and modified flashplug. The OptiVein System also includes an&#xD;
      electronic unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OptiVein Catheter shares a similar intended use and the same catheter components as the&#xD;
      Vasofix Certo IV Catheter. Clinical data will be obtained to demonstrate that there is no&#xD;
      change to the safety and efficacy profile due to the laser component of the OptiVein IV&#xD;
      Catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective, single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial to demonstrate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of the OptiVein IV Catheter in the pediatric population. The study&#xD;
      hypothesis is that OptiVein IV Catheter use will be superior to the control in successful&#xD;
      venous access after first attempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients aged newborn to twelve (12) years requiring short-term use of an IV catheter to&#xD;
      withdraw blood samples or to administer fluids or medications intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating sites will follow routine practice guidelines regarding the personnel&#xD;
      responsible for inserting the catheters for this study, known herein as &quot;operators.&quot;&#xD;
      Operators must be professionally trained in IV catheter placement; educational background and&#xD;
      level of experience of operator will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Operators selected for participation in the study will undergo training on the protocol,&#xD;
      Good Clinical Practice and the assembly and use of the OptiVein IV Catheter and Vasofix Certo&#xD;
      IV catheter prior to enrolling patients into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be in a 1:1 fashion with assignment given by the electronic data capture&#xD;
      (EDC) system.&#xD;
