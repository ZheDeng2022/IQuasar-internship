      This is a phase 2 study of AMG 337 in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors that&#xD;
      overexpress MET or harbor METex14del mutations resulting in MET exon 14 skipping.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, two-cohort, single-arm open-label study that will assess the efficacy of&#xD;
      AMG 337 based on ORR in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors that overexpress&#xD;
      MET or harbor METex14del mutations resulting in MET exon 14 skipping. MET overexpression will&#xD;
      be determined by quantitative proteomics with mass spectrometry. METex14del mutations&#xD;
      resulting in MET exon 14 skipping will be determined by DNA sequencing and confirmed with RNA&#xD;
      sequencing. Subjects will be enrolled as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: Subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors that overexpress MET&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: Subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors that harbor METex14del&#xD;
           mutations Simon's two-stage optimal design will be utilized separately for each cohort&#xD;
           to assess the primary efficacy endpoint ORR. The null hypothesis of Simon's two-stage&#xD;
           design states that the ORR will be ≤ 10% (poor response) and will be tested against a&#xD;
           one-sided alternative.&#xD;
