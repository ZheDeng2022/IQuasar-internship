    <textblock>
      Anti-EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) therapies, namely cetuximab and panitumumab,&#xD;
      have become standards in the management of metastatic colorectal and head and neck cancers.&#xD;
      These therapies are used in daily practice, that requiring to manage their skin and digestive&#xD;
      toxicities. However, anti-EGFR are also frequently responsible for hypomagnesemia often&#xD;
      neglected and under-treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypomagnesemia may manifest as asthenia, cramps, muscle weakness, mood disorders. She is&#xD;
      often underestimated because they are difficult to identify and accountable by clinicians in&#xD;
      the context of cancer under chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no national or international recommendation on the management of&#xD;
      hypomagnesaemia in oncology and medicine in general. There are, however, on the market many&#xD;
      nutritional supplements rich in magnesium in the form of tablets or oral solution, in&#xD;
      multiple dosages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These food supplements rich in magnesium are sold without proof of effectiveness. Moreover,&#xD;
      the prescription of oral magnesium supplementation adds to the oncology patient an&#xD;
      over-medicalization, which can be poorly tolerated at the digestive level, and responsible&#xD;
      for diarrhea and a lack of compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommends in its opinion on &quot;Dietary reference&#xD;
      values for water&quot; to consume 2 liters for women and 2.5 liters for men every day, all sources&#xD;
      combined (food and beverages). The drink represent 80% of the water intake, that is about 1.5&#xD;
      Liter per day excluding food. However, there are multiple water marketed or distributed&#xD;
      freely, with different compositions. Thus the quantity and quality of the mineral water&#xD;
      consumed can influence the metabolism. Rozana® mineral water, has the double advantage of&#xD;
      being the French water the most concentrated in magnesium (160 mg / L) and of being lowly&#xD;
      concentrated in sulphate, responsible of the laxative power of certain waters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instead of adding magnesium supplements with a poor digestive tolerance, to patients with&#xD;
      metastatic cancer and often with a heavy treatment , the aim of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      whether a change in oral hydration in quantitative and qualitative terms can decrease the&#xD;
      rate of hypomagnesemia in patients treated with anti-EGFR.&#xD;

      Anti-EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) therapies, namely cetuximab and panitumumab,&#xD;
      have become standards in the management of metastatic colorectal and head and neck cancers.&#xD;
      These therapies are used in daily practice, that requiring to manage their skin and digestive&#xD;
      toxicities. However, anti-EGFR are also frequently responsible for hypomagnesemia often&#xD;
      neglected and under-treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnesium remains the fourth cation and the second most important intracellular cation in the&#xD;
      body. It is an indispensable cofactor in multiple enzymatic reactions. Hypomagnesemia may&#xD;
      manifest as asthenia, cramps, muscle weakness, mood disorders. She is often underestimated&#xD;
      because they are difficult to identify and accountable by clinicians in the context of cancer&#xD;
      under chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no national or international recommendation on the management of&#xD;
      hypomagnesaemia in oncology and medicine in general. Hypomagnesemia is, in daily practice,&#xD;
      mostly undiagnosed or untreated. There are, however, on the market many nutritional&#xD;
      supplements rich in magnesium in the form of tablets or oral solution, in multiple dosages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, these food supplements rich in magnesium are sold without proof of effectiveness.&#xD;
      The clinical data are very insufficient, and no oral supplementation is reimbursed. Moreover,&#xD;
      the prescription of oral magnesium supplementation, often several intakes a day, adds to the&#xD;
      oncology patient an over-medicalization, which can be poorly tolerated at the digestive&#xD;
      level, and responsible for diarrhea and a lack of compliance. Oral hydration is one of the&#xD;
      most prescribed medical advice and remains essential to combat the risk of dehydration in&#xD;
      extreme ages. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommends in its opinion on &quot;Dietary&#xD;
      reference values for water&quot; to consume 2 liters for women and 2.5 liters for men every day,&#xD;
      all sources combined (food and beverages). The drink represent 80% of the water intake, that&#xD;
      is about 1.5 Liter per day excluding food. However, there are multiple water marketed or&#xD;
      distributed freely, with different compositions. Thus the quantity and quality of the mineral&#xD;
      water consumed can influence the metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The digestive absorption of magnesium provided by mineral water in a healthy individual was&#xD;
      evaluated at around 40 to 50%. Rozana® mineral water, has the double advantage of being the&#xD;
      French water the most concentrated in magnesium (160 mg / L) and of being lowly concentrated&#xD;
      in sulphate, responsible of the laxative power of certain waters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instead of adding magnesium supplements with a poor digestive tolerance, to patients with&#xD;
      metastatic cancer and often with a heavy treatment , the aim of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      whether a change in oral hydration in quantitative and qualitative terms can decrease the&#xD;
      rate of hypomagnesemia in patients treated with anti-EGFR.&#xD;
