    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, single-stage Phase II study designed to evaluate the 1-year PFS rate in&#xD;
      subjects with locally-advanced NSCLC (stage II/III) and treated with Stereotactic Body&#xD;
      Radiation Therapy (SBRT) followed by concurrent mediastinal chemoradiation with or without&#xD;
      consolidation chemotherapy. A total of 60 subjects will be enrolled to this study over a 4&#xD;
      year accrual period.&#xD;

      This study's primary objective is to assess the efficacy of a treatment regimen involving&#xD;
      Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) delivered to the primary tumor followed by&#xD;
      concurrent mediastinal chemoradiation by evaluating the proportion of subjects with&#xD;
      locally-advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) stage II/III who are alive and&#xD;
      progression free at 12 months, and to compare to relevant historical controls. Additionally,&#xD;
      the treatment regimen will be evaluated based on progression free survival, overall survival,&#xD;
      radiologic clinical complete response rate following completion of therapy, objective&#xD;
      response rate as defined by RECIST v 1.1, local and locoregional control, patterns of&#xD;
      failure, and quality of life. Safety objectives include the rate of grade 2+ radiation&#xD;
      pneumonitis and grade 3+ pulmonary events. Exploratory objectives include differential&#xD;
      expression of cytokines and chemokines associated with radiation therapy will be determined.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must meet all the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologic or cytologic documentation of NSCLC (all histologies allowed)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stage II or III disease (AJCC 7th Edition) based on imaging as required during&#xD;
             screening: Stage II disease includes only subjects with medically inoperable N1&#xD;
             disease otherwise meeting eligibility criteria. Primary tumor ≤ 7 cm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with non-malignant pleural effusion identified on CT scan are eligible&#xD;
             provided the effusion is not known or demonstrated to be an exudative effusion. If a&#xD;
             pleural effusion is present, the following criteria must be met to exclude malignant&#xD;
             involvement: A pleuracentesis is required if pleural fluid is present and visible on&#xD;
             both CT scan and chest x-ray. Pleural fluid cytology must be negative for malignancy.&#xD;
             Effusions that are minimal and too small for pleuracentesis as determined by the&#xD;
             investigator will be eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  FEV1 ≥ 1.0 Liter or ≥ 40% predicted with or without bronchodilator within six months&#xD;
             prior to initiation of study treatment. Subjects who meet the criterion without O2,&#xD;
             but who need acute (started within 10 days prior to enrollment) supplemental oxygen&#xD;
             due to tumor-caused obstruction/hypoxia are eligible, provided the amount of the O2&#xD;
             needed has been stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have normal organ and marrow function as defined: Leukocytes ≥4,000/mcL;&#xD;
             Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL; Platelets ≥100,000/mcL; Total bilirubin ≤1.5&#xD;
             times the upper limit of normal; Creatinine clearance ≥25 mL/min/1.73 m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative serum or urine pregnancy test prior to enrollment for women of childbearing&#xD;
             age and potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of radiation on the developing human fetus are not well described. For&#xD;
             this reason, women of child-bearing potential and non-sterilized men who are sexually&#xD;
             active with a woman of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry and for the duration of study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she&#xD;
             should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must not meet any of the following criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have had prior systemic therapy for lung cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have had prior radiation to the region of the chest that would result in&#xD;
             overlap of radiation therapy fields and determined by the treating physician to impede&#xD;
             the treatment of the study malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are actively being treated on any other interventional research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior invasive malignancy unless disease free for a minimum of 3 years from&#xD;
             enrollment. However, non-melanoma skin cancer, low risk prostate cancer, well&#xD;
             differentiated thyroid cancers, in situ carcinomas of the breast, oral cavity, cervix,&#xD;
             and other organs, and tumors that are not thought to impact the life expectancy of the&#xD;
             subject according to the treating investigator is permissible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Centrally located primary tumor &lt; 2 cm from involved nodal disease which would result&#xD;
             in significant overlap of radiation dose. Centrally located is defined as within or&#xD;
             touching the zone of the proximal bronchial tree, which is a volume 2 cm in all&#xD;
             directions around the proximal bronchial tree (carina, right and left main bronchi,&#xD;
             right and left upper lobe bronchi, intermedius bronchus, right middle lobe bronchus,&#xD;
             lingular bronchus right and left lower lobe bronchi).&#xD;
