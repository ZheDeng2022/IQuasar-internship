&#xD;
        -  Fulvestrant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fulvestrant with Palbociclib&#xD;

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied and the researchers are trying to find out more about it- for example, the side&#xD;
      effects it may cause, and the activity of a drug, or combination of drugs, against a cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are evaluating the activity of fulvestrant alone,&#xD;
      fulvestrant and palbociclib, or fulvestrant, palbociclib, and avelumab combined, in&#xD;
      participants with metastatic hormone receptor positive HER2 negative breast cancer that has&#xD;
      previously stopped responding to prior palbociclib and endocrine therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved both palbociclib and fulvestrant&#xD;
      as treatment options for this disease, however the use of palbociclib has not been studied in&#xD;
      people who have previously been treated with palbociclib. The FDA has not approved avelumab&#xD;
      as a treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Palbociclib is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing. Palbociclib blocks activity of&#xD;
      two closely related enzymes (proteins that help chemical reactions in the body occur), called&#xD;
      Cyclin Dependent Kinases 4 and 6 (CDK 4/6). These proteins are part of a pathway, or a&#xD;
      sequence of steps, which is known to promote cancer cell growth. Laboratory testing has shown&#xD;
      that palbociclib may stop the growth of hormone receptor positive breast cancer. Palbociclib&#xD;
      is FDA-approved as therapy for metastatic hormone receptor positive HER2 negative breast&#xD;
      cancer in combination with endocrine therapy in the first line setting, and in combination&#xD;
      with fulvestrant for pre-treated disease. It is not known whether cancers that have grown&#xD;
      despite prior palbociclib treatment are still sensitive to palbociclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endocrine therapy prevents growth of hormone receptor positive breast cancer by blocking&#xD;
      stimulation of cancer cells by estrogen. During this study, the endocrine therapy will be&#xD;
      fulvestrant. Fulvestrant is a drug that is approved by the FDA for treatment of metastatic&#xD;
      hormone receptor positive breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immune system is the body's natural defense against disease. The immune system sends a&#xD;
      type of cells called T cells throughout the body to detect and fight infections and&#xD;
      diseases-including cancers. One way the immune system controls the activity of T cells is&#xD;
      through the PD-1 (programmed cell death protein-1) pathway. However, some cancer cells hide&#xD;
      from T-cell attack by taking control of the PD-1 pathway and this stops T cells from&#xD;
      attacking cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Avelumab is an antibody designed to block the PD-1 pathway and helps the immune system in&#xD;
      detecting and fighting cancer cells. An antibody is a protein produced by the body's immune&#xD;
      system when it detects harmful substances. Previous studies show that the administration of&#xD;
      antibodies which block the PD-1 pathway can lead to tumor destruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the laboratory, adding avelumab to fulvestrant and palbociclib appears to improve&#xD;
      effectiveness. It is not known whether this is true in humans&#xD;

             CLIA-approved setting. Cut-off values for positive/negative staining should be in&#xD;
             accordance with current ASCO/CAP (American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of&#xD;
             American Pathologists) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and pre- and postmenopausal women are eligible. Ongoing monthly GNRH agonist is&#xD;
             required in pre-menopausal women or male participants for at least 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have radiological or objective evidence of progression on an&#xD;
             endocrine and CDK 4/6 inhibitor regimen in the metastatic setting, and/or&#xD;
             relapse/progression during or within 12 months of completion of an endocrine and&#xD;
             CDK4/6 inhibitor regimen in the adjuvant setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants must have previously been exposed to CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy in&#xD;
                  combination with endocrine therapy. Exposure to any prior CDK4/6 inhibitor,&#xD;
                  (including palbociclib, abemaciclib, and ribociclib) is allowed. Patients may&#xD;
                  have a line of endocrine therapy after combination endocrine and CDK4/6 inhibitor&#xD;
                  exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants must have remained on prior endocrine and CDK4/6 therapy in the&#xD;
                  metastatic setting without progression for at least 6 months prior to study&#xD;
                  entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  It is not mandatory to have a CDK 4/6 inhibitor containing regimen as the most&#xD;
                  recent treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants may have 0-1 prior lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy in the metastatic&#xD;
             setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior endocrine therapy in the metastatic setting may include any aromatase inhibitor&#xD;
             (AI) or tamoxifen, but may not include prior fulvestrant. In the metastatic setting,&#xD;
             1-2 prior lines of endocrine therapy are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants may have received radiotherapy for palliative purpose, but must not be&#xD;
             experiencing &gt; grade 1 treatment related toxicities, and must have completed treatment&#xD;
             &gt; 14 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the&#xD;
             use of study agents in participants &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0-1 (see Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/µL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets &gt; 100,000/µL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin &gt; 9g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (participants&#xD;
                  with documented Gilbert's disease are allowed total bilirubin up to 1.5X ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) &lt; 2.5 x institutional ULN, or ≤ 5 x ULN for subjects with&#xD;
                  documented metastatic disease to the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine &lt; institutional ULN or creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for&#xD;
                  subjects with creatinine levels above institutional ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Baseline QTc &lt; 480 ms&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of palbociclib and avelumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. If,&#xD;
             for any reason, a woman should become pregnant or suspect that she is pregnant while&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
             Women of childbearing age, women who are made postmenopausal through use of GNRH&#xD;
             agonists, and men must agree to use adequate contraception for the duration of&#xD;
             protocol treatment and for at least 60 days after the last dose of study medication if&#xD;
             the risk of contraception exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate contraception is defined as one highly effective non-hormonal form of&#xD;
             contraception or two effective forms of non-hormonal contraception by the participant&#xD;
             and/or partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Highly Effective Non-Hormonal Contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Methods of birth control which result in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per&#xD;
             year) when used consistently and correctly are considered highly-effective forms of&#xD;
             contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The following non-hormonal methods of contraception are acceptable:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  True abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the participant. [Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception].&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (with appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence&#xD;
                  of sperm in the ejaculate). For female participants, the vasectomized male&#xD;
                  partner should be the sole partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Effective Non-Hormonal Contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
        Alternatively two of the following effective forms of contraception may be used instead:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Placement of non-hormonal intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).&#xD;
             Consideration should be given to the type of device being used, as there is higher&#xD;
             failure rates quoted for certain types, e.g., steel or copper wire.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal&#xD;
             foam/gel/film/cream/suppository.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The use of barrier contraceptives should always be supplemented with the use of&#xD;
             spermicide. The following should be noted:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failure rates indicate that, when used alone, the diaphragm and condom are not highly&#xD;
             effective forms of contraception. Therefore, the use of additional spermicides does&#xD;
             confer additional theoretical contraceptive protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  However, spermicides alone are ineffective at preventing pregnancy when the whole&#xD;
             ejaculate is spilled. Therefore, spermicides are not a barrier method of contraception&#xD;
             and should not be used alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        It should be noted that two forms of effective contraception are required. A double barrier&#xD;
        method is acceptable, which is defined as condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
        cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream /suppository.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Premenopausal women must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test. Pregnancy&#xD;
             testing does not need to be pursued in female participants who are:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Age &gt; 60 years; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Age &lt; 60 with intact uterus and amenorrhea for 12 consecutive months or more AND&#xD;
                  estrogen (estradiol) levels within postmenopausal range; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Status-post bilateral oophorectomy, total hysterectomy, or bilateral tubal&#xD;
                  ligation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must be able to swallow and retain oral medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had endocrine, chemotherapy, and/or biologic therapy within 14&#xD;
             days prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from any prior&#xD;
             treatment-related toxicities (must recover to no more than grade 1. Alopecia, sensory&#xD;
             neuropathy Grade ≤ 2, or other Grade ≤ 2 toxicity not constituting a safety risk based&#xD;
             on investigator's judgment are acceptable).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving concurrent therapy with other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Rapidly progressive, symptomatic, visceral spread of disease placing participant at&#xD;
             risk of life-threatening complications in the short term.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with active brain metastases. Stable treated brain metastases are allowed&#xD;
             (this includes participants who have documented radiologic stability at least 4 weeks&#xD;
             after radiotherapy, and do not require systemic steroids for management of symptoms&#xD;
             from CNS metastatic lesions).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have discontinued prior palbociclib for toxicity, or have needed more&#xD;
             than one dose or schedule reduction for toxicity from prior palbociclib therapy. If a&#xD;
             participant required a single dose reduction during prior palbociclib therapy and&#xD;
             tolerated it well, for example prior dosing at 100 mg qd 3 weeks on 1 week off&#xD;
             schedule, than that dose may be selected for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions to palbociclib or attributed to compounds of similar&#xD;
             chemical or biologic composition to palbociclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known prior severe hypersensitivity to investigational product or any component in its&#xD;
             formulations, including known severe hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal&#xD;
             antibodies (NCI CTCAE v4.03 Grade ≥ 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or&#xD;
             inducers of CYP3A isoenzymes are ineligible. Lists including medications and&#xD;
             substances known or with the potential to interact with the CYP3A isoenzymes are&#xD;
             provided in Appendix B, and can also be found within Section 5.4. Because the lists of&#xD;
             these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a&#xD;
             frequently-updated list such as http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx;&#xD;
             medical reference texts such as the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this&#xD;
             information. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the participant&#xD;
             will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new&#xD;
             medications need to be prescribed or if the participant is considering a new&#xD;
             over-the-counter medicine or herbal product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of drugs listed in Appendix C that are known to prolong the QT interval&#xD;
             (See Appendix C)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Current use of immunosuppressive medication, except for the following: a. intranasal,&#xD;
             inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injection (e.g., intra-articular&#xD;
             injection); b. Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses ≤ 10 mg/day of prednisone&#xD;
             or equivalent; c. Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT&#xD;
             scan premedication).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to: ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection requiring systemic therapy, clinically significant cardiovascular disease&#xD;
             including: cerebral vascular accident/stroke (&lt; 6 months prior to enrollment),&#xD;
             myocardial infarction (&lt; 6 months prior to enrollment), unstable angina, congestive&#xD;
             heart failure (≥ New York Heart Association Classification Class II), or serious&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, or&#xD;
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirements. Ability to comply with study requirements is to be assessed by each&#xD;
             investigator at the time of screening for study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active autoimmune disease that might deteriorate when receiving an immuno-stimulatory&#xD;
             agent. Participants with diabetes type I, vitiligo, psoriasis, or hypo- or&#xD;
