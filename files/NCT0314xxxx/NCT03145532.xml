  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemiplegia occurs when the function of motor areas in the brain become impaired,&#xD;
      predominantly unilaterally, during perinatal development. Children with hemiplegia show&#xD;
      impairments in motor control of the affected side of the body. Impairments in use of the&#xD;
      upper extremity are common, and lead to functional disability throughout the lifespan of a&#xD;
      person with hemiplegia. Upper extremity impairments can severely affect a person's ability to&#xD;
      carry out activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study at Blythedale Children's Hospital is to test the efficacy of&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and robotic upper extremity therapy in&#xD;
      improving upper extremity function in children with unilateral cerebral palsy. This study&#xD;
      will test the hypothesis that physical rehabilitation, provided by repetitive arm movements&#xD;
      guided by a robot, will improve upper extremity function in children with hemiplegia, and&#xD;
      that this improvement can be enhanced by transcranial direct current stimulation of motor&#xD;
      cortex immediately before robotic training.&#xD;

      This sham-controlled, double-blind study will be completed at Blythedale Children's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Robotic Device and Patient Position&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use existing robots at Blythedale, which are FDA approved robotic&#xD;
      devices that move the shoulder-and-elbow, or wrist-and-forearm, or the Typo Amadeo digit&#xD;
      training robot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All robots: The subject will sit in a foam-padded chair facing the robot and a video screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planar (shoulder-elbow) and wrist robots: The arm will be abducted, forearm supported, and&#xD;
      hand lightly grasping the robot handle, and velcro straps will lightly hold the forearm and&#xD;
      fingers secure. A cursor on the video screen will display the targets and track the movement&#xD;
      of the patient's arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amadeo: The arm will be abducted, forearm supported, and digits attached to the robot with&#xD;
      magnets. Velcro straps will lightly hold the forearm and fingers secure. A cursor on the&#xD;
      video screen will display the targets and track the movement of the patient's fingers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Robotic Training&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a total of 12 sessions comprising 1 hour of interactive robotic&#xD;
      training. Participants will have two to four study visits per week. During one visit, the&#xD;
      child will receive tDCS + 1 hr training on the shoulder-elbow MIT Manus robot, and on the&#xD;
      second visit of the week, the child will receive tDCS + 1 hr training on the wrist MIT Manus&#xD;
      robot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interactive robot features involve visuomotor tasks, moving the robotic manipulandum&#xD;
      according to targets on a computer screen mounted at eye level. A key feature of MIT robots&#xD;
      is the low near isotropic inertia and reduced friction in the robot arm so that, when&#xD;
      appropriate, it can &quot;get out of the way.&quot; The force required to move the robotic arm is&#xD;
      minimal, comparable to moving unrestricted, and if a patient cannot move the robot arm, it&#xD;
      will guide the limb to provide an adaptive sensorimotor experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation&#xD;
&#xD;
      A current up to 1.5mA current will be delivered using surface rubber-carbon electrodes&#xD;
      (35cm2) with surrounding saline soaked sponges (0.9% NaCl) by a battery driven, constant&#xD;
      current stimulator (maximum output 2mA). Participants will receive stimulation for 20 minutes&#xD;
      while seated (before robotic motor training), with the anode over the optimal site for first&#xD;
      dorsal interosseous (FDI) as identified using TMS, and the cathode on the contralateral&#xD;
      supraorbital area. Sham tDCS: comparable set-up to real tDCS, 30 sec real current ramping to&#xD;
      current up to 1.5mA at commencement, then after 5 sec a slow decrease but to no current&#xD;
      sustained for 20mins.&#xD;
