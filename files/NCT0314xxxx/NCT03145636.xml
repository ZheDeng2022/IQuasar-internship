  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a five-year, single arm, multi-center trial to evaluate the long-term safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of the Maestro Rechargeable System in treating obesity. The study will include an&#xD;
      observational arm and a randomized sub-study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the safety and efficacy of the vBloc Therapy delivered by the Maestro&#xD;
      Rechargeable System for the treatment obesity. The Maestro Rechargeable System delivers&#xD;
      intermittent, electrical blocking signals to the anterior and posterior trunks of the&#xD;
      intra-abdominal vagus nerve (termed vBloc Therapy) and is designed to reduce sensations of&#xD;
      hunger and produce satiety leading to weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the observational arm (100 subjects total) will receive the device implant and&#xD;
      use the vBloc Achieve Weight Management Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomized sub-study (100 subjects) will randomly assign subjects (1:1) to either&#xD;
      treatment (50 subjects) or control (50 subjects). The treatment arm will receive the device&#xD;
      implant and use of the vBloc Achieve Weight Management Program. The control arm will&#xD;
      participate in the Control Weight Management (CWM) during a 6 month period prior to receiving&#xD;
      the device implant and using the vBloc Achieve program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vBloc Achieve Weight Management Program consists of recommendations regarding diet,&#xD;
      exercise and behavior modification, and will be utilized by all subjects following their&#xD;
      device implant.&#xD;

             engaged within the last five years&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Ability to complete all study visits and procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with cirrhosis of the liver, portal hypertension, or esophageal varices.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with a large (&gt;5cm) symptomatic hiatal hernia&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients for whom magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is planned&#xD;

             absolutely CANNOT be treated with any type of shortwave, microwave, or therapeutic&#xD;
