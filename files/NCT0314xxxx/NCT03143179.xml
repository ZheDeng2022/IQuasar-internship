    <textblock>
      The immediate period after spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the only opportunities that&#xD;
      clinicians and care-givers have to make a real difference to patient outcomes. One of the&#xD;
      main aims during this period is to preserve blood flow and oxygen delivery to the spinal cord&#xD;
      to prevent any further damage from occurring after the injury. The heart acts as the major&#xD;
      pump for blood to be pumped to the spinal cord and the body. It has been shown in small&#xD;
      animal models and in humans with long-standing SCI that the ability of the heart to pump&#xD;
      blood after injury is compromised, which may in turn reduce the amount of blood and oxygen&#xD;
      delivered to the injured cord. It is unclear how quickly these changes occur in the heart&#xD;
      following SCI and how best to manage heart function such that blood flow and oxygen delivery&#xD;
      can be optimized. In the present study, the investigators will examine how the heart&#xD;
      functions immediately after SCI. The findings from this study are expected to provide new&#xD;
      information that could help clinicians improve the management of people who have just&#xD;
      suffered a SCI.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hemodynamic management of the cervical/high-thoracic spinal cord injured patient&#xD;
      represents a remarkably complex clinical scenario, but represents one of the only potentially&#xD;
      neuroprotective therapeutic options currently available to the clinician. Presently, the&#xD;
      singular goal of hemodynamic management is to increase mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) to&#xD;
      85mmHg by targeting peripheral tone via vasopressor therapy, with a view to increasing&#xD;
      perfusion of the spinal cord, preventing ischemia at the injury site, and optimizing&#xD;
      neurological outcome. It is often overlooked that the instantaneous removal of descending&#xD;
      sympathetic control at the time of SCI renders not only the vast majority of the systemic&#xD;
      vasculature devoid of supraspinal input, but it also impairs descending control of the heart.&#xD;
      What is yet to be considered in current hemodynamic management protocols is that immediate&#xD;
      cardiac dysfunction secondary to impaired supraspinal control of the heart may very well be a&#xD;
      significant contributor to poor spinal cord perfusion. Indeed, data collected over the last&#xD;
      four years in rodent SCI models suggests that cardiac sympathetic decentralization is the&#xD;
      principal cause of the low cardiac output observed in both rodents and people with chronic&#xD;
      SCI. As such, the investigator's initiative is to provide a novel approach to hemodynamic&#xD;
      management to a porcine model that harnesses both peripheral tone and cardiac function. The&#xD;
      investigators believe this approach is an immediately translatable neuroprotective strategy&#xD;
      for acute SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 individuals aged 18-60 who have sustained an acute traumatic SCI (above T2 spinal level)&#xD;
      less than 72 hours prior will be recruited over a period of 2 years. Recruitment will be&#xD;
      isolated to those individuals who already have a central venous catheter and arterial line as&#xD;
      part of standard clinical care (which actually occurs in most patients). In addition to&#xD;
      standard clinical lines, an esophageal Doppler probe will be placed to measure aortic outflow&#xD;
      on which beat-by-beat systolic cardiac function (i.e., stroke volume, cardiac output,&#xD;
      ejection fraction) can be estimated. During a 120 min monitoring period, beat-by-beat&#xD;
      dependent cardiac indices will be recorded and a modified Starling curve will be constructed&#xD;
      by examining relationships between central venous pressure (i.e., an index of venous return)&#xD;
      and aortic flow (i.e., an index of cardiac output). After 1hr of monitoring (Part A), a 250ml&#xD;
      bolus of intravenous crystalloid will be infused over a 5 min period and measure beat-by-beat&#xD;
      central venous pressure and aortic flow (stroke volume) responses (Part B). The primary&#xD;
      outcomes are daily resting stroke volume and ejection fraction, change in stroke volume and&#xD;
      central venous pressure (CVP) in response to fluid challenge. The secondary outcome is the&#xD;
      slope of the Starling curve&#xD;
