      The purpose of this study is to use a wire with a Doppler tip to measure blood flow in&#xD;
      vessels in the brain and determine hemodynamic factors associated with treatment success or&#xD;
      failure. Many neurological diseases cause abnormal blood flow in the brain in specific&#xD;
      vessels. The special wire used in this study is place into brain blood vessels during&#xD;
      standard of care procedure to treat such diseases, and blood flow parameters (such as&#xD;
      velocity and pressure) are measured to gain better understanding of these neurological&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;

      Current treatments of cerebral aneurysms are imperfect, and aneurysmal hemodynamics is an&#xD;
      important factor in treatment failure. The identification of hemodynamic factors that&#xD;
      influence treatment success could predict outcome. Published studies show that the&#xD;
      hemodynamic environment of aneurysms changes after treatment, and there is limited&#xD;
      retrospective evidence that the degree of change affects treatment success. However, previous&#xD;
      hemodynamic calculations did not have access to patient-specific measurements of blood flow,&#xD;
      which substantially reduced their accuracy. In addition, no prospective studies of the&#xD;
      predictive value of post-treatment aneurysm hemodynamics have been done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Prospectively test new aneurysm patients for hemodynamic predictors of treatment&#xD;
      outcome based upon the hypothesis long-term aneurysm treatment outcome can be prospectively&#xD;
      predicted by measuring the immediate hemodynamic effects of aneurysm treatment with novel&#xD;
      patient-specific modeling techniques. Task 1: In a new cohort of patients undergoing aneurysm&#xD;
      treatment, the investigators will again use Doppler guidewire measurements to create&#xD;
      patient-specific hemodynamic models of treatment effects. By prospectively applying the&#xD;
      knowledge of crucial hemodynamic changes the investigators will use immediate post-treatment&#xD;
      hemodynamics to predict long-term treatment outcome.&#xD;

    <description>The results of this prospective aim have the potential to substantially influence aneurysm management by predicting long-term outcome at the time of initial treatment. The investigators will determine how well the prospective test predicts long-term treatment success as applied at the time of treatment, using computational fluid dynamics modeling of hemodynamic factors with the incorporation of patient-specific measurements obtained by the Doppler guidewire</description>

        Patients will be eligible for this aim if they were not previously enrolled in the study,&#xD;
        as this phase seeks to prospectively apply the tests generated by the previous&#xD;
        retrospective cohort. Selection criteria will be similar in which a patient with an&#xD;
        unruptured intracranial aneurysm ≥ 5mm in size undergoes endovascular treatment and&#xD;
        subsequent angiographic follow-up.&#xD;
