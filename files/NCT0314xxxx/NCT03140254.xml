          <description>Participants were treated with 2 of 3 study products, Investigational Product (IP, 0.4% OCT cloth), Vehicle Control (VC, vehicle formulation cloth), and/or Active Control (AC, SAGE 2% CHG cloth), 1 on the left side of the body (abdomen and inguen received the same product) and 1 on the right (abdomen and inguen received the same product). Therefore, treatment groups are not discrete categories and cannot be described by treatment group.</description>
