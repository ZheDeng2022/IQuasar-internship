    <textblock>
      Understanding the emergence of linezolid-resistance in Staphylococci has been allowed in the&#xD;
      past years through the discovery of the clonal dissemination of a chromosomal cassette&#xD;
      carrying a modified crf gene. New mutations have even been described. Though, clinical&#xD;
      evidences are still lacking, especially concerning the factors associated to this emergence.&#xD;
      It could seriously become quite problematic to eliminate one of the last therapeutic weapon&#xD;
      at our disposal for the treatment of severe or complicated infections caused by resistant&#xD;
      strains of Staphylococci and Enterococci.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to describe the mechanisms that permitted to this resistance to become clinically&#xD;
      significant, concerning meticillin-resistant Staphyloccocus epidermidis strains causing blood&#xD;
      stream infections in ICU patients, and show the clinical risk factors associated with it&#xD;
      through a case-control study on patients hospitalized in two ICUs of our hospital between&#xD;
      2011 and 2016.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Resistance to linezolid has been increasing in the past years, suggesting growing therapeutic&#xD;
      difficulties while narrowing the options for treating severe or complicated infections&#xD;
      involving Staphyloccoci or Enterococci strains. This emergence has been partially explained&#xD;
      after the discovery of chromosomal dissemination of a particular gene, named &quot;crf&quot;,&#xD;
      conferring high level resistance to oxazolidinones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, this mechanism has been showed as being prevalent in several countries across North&#xD;
      America, Asia, and Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But still the link with clinical evidences has not yet been very well established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular the role of S. epidermidis has become clinically significant concerning blood&#xD;
      stream infections and catheter-linked infections. The reality of the pathogenicity is more&#xD;
      widely accepted, especially regarding prosthetic joint infections, and immunocompromised&#xD;
      patient, as in hematology and oncology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, it appears necessary to provide more solid informations concerning the risk of using&#xD;
      this antibiotic in a high burden setting of resistance, where it might be prescribed&#xD;
      intensively on critical situations, and thus responsible for a high selection pressure of&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to describe the emergence of the resistance to linezolid in meticillin-resistant S.&#xD;
      epidermidis strains in the two 20-beds ICUs of our Teaching Hospital, in the 5 past years,&#xD;
      between april 2011 and october 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We conduct a case-control study between two populations of patients hospitalized in one of&#xD;
      these ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They all presented a blood stream infection caused by a strain of S. epidermidis that was&#xD;
      resistant to meticillin, and diagnosed prospectively or retrospectively being resistant as&#xD;
      well to linezolid, or not. Indeed, microbiological data was quite easily available as all the&#xD;
      strains isolated from blood samples are conserved after congelation for many years.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, we lack the profile toward linezolid susceptibility as this antibiotic was not&#xD;
      routinely tested before 2014, corresponding to the moment we became aware of the problematic&#xD;
      rising. A previous work thus consists to establish the incidence of the resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of these two populations through a case-control design study, accepting 2&#xD;
      control-patients for one case (matched on the period of hospitalization, mortality and&#xD;
      severity score at admission), might allow understanding risk factors of being infected with a&#xD;
      linezolid-resistant and meticillin-resistant S.epidermidis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So to go further, we first conduct a phenotypic analysis in order to establish the incidence&#xD;
      of this resistance, in accordance with the 2016 EUCAST criteria. Association with genotypic&#xD;
      analysis using Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and Multilocus-sequence typing will allow&#xD;
      underlining the impact of the presence of the crf gene, and mutations described as being&#xD;
      involved in high level resistance (mutations in domaine V of 23S ARN or ribosomal proteins L3&#xD;
      and L4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adult patient admitted to one of these two units can be included and evaluated if he&#xD;
      presented at least two blood cultures sampled at less than 48hours of interval, being&#xD;
      positive for the same strain (in accordance with the 2007 CTINILS definition). We considered&#xD;
      the catheter-linked infections as being apart if it was associated with positive blood&#xD;
      cultures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also search for clinical criteria supposed to be linked to an infection with such a&#xD;
      resistant strain; we check for the demographic data, conditions at admission, antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment before or at admission, procedures considered at high risk for health-care&#xD;
      infections such as surgery, especially in the period of great instability, also endovascular&#xD;
      procedures, like catheter implantation or extra-corporal assistance (Extra-corporal membrane&#xD;
      for oxygenation, Renal Replacement Therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We examine the therapeutic options once the diagnosis of blood stream infections has been&#xD;
      made, the choice of antibiotic as treatment, and the outcome defined as cure or survival at&#xD;
      28 days, which is the period of matching patients.&#xD;
