    <textblock>
      This study is a first in human, Phase 1, open label, multicenter, dose escalation study with&#xD;
      expansion at the RP2D to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary antileukemic&#xD;
      activity of AMV564 in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMV564 will be given on Days 1-14 of a 4-week cycle, or Days 1-28 of a 6-week cycle,via CIV&#xD;
      or subcutaneous administration for 1 or more treatment cycles as monotherapy or in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab.&#xD;

          -  Relapsed or refractory disease meeting the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Primary refractory, ie, refractory to induction with a standard intensive&#xD;
                  anthracycline/cytarabine-based regimen or a non-intensive regimen (e.g.,&#xD;
                  decitabine, azacytidine, low-dose cytarabine) for patients ineligible for an&#xD;
                  intensive anthracycline/cytarabine-based therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. First untreated relapse after a first CR lasting less than 12 months or first&#xD;
                  relapse refractory to salvage therapy regardless of length of first CR; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Second or later relapse. Relapse is defined as the reappearance of leukemic&#xD;
                  blasts in the peripheral blood or ≥ 5% leukemic blasts in the bone marrow after&#xD;
                  prior achievement of a CR or CRi.&#xD;
