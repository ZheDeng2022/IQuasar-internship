  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies the side effects of recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein when given&#xD;
      together with azacitidine or decitabine in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome,&#xD;
      chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, or acute myeloid leukemia that has come back or has not&#xD;
      responded to previous treatment with a hypomethylating agent. Recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion&#xD;
      protein may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth. Hypomethylating agents, such as azacitidine and decitabine, slow down genes that&#xD;
      promote cell growth and can kill cells that are dividing rapidly. Giving recombinant&#xD;
      EphB4-HSA fusion protein together with azacitidine or decitabine may work better in treating&#xD;
      patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, or acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the toxicities and assess the tolerability of recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion&#xD;
      protein (sEphB4-HSA) in combination with an approved hypomethylating agent (HMA) among&#xD;
      patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who are refractory to or have lost their&#xD;
      response to one or more HMAs and among patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (AML) previously treated with a HMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To measure the expression of EphB4 among marrow and peripheral blood blasts in patients&#xD;
      with MDS &amp; AML at baseline and over the course of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To measure the expression of immune check-point activating ligands (such as PD-L1, PD-L2)&#xD;
      on marrow and peripheral blood blasts in patients treated with HMA and sEphB4-HSA in&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To profile immune subsets (activated and exhausted T cells, natural killer [NK] cells, T&#xD;
      regulatory cells, and myeloid derived suppressor cells) in the peripheral blood and marrow in&#xD;
      patients treated with HMA and sEphB4-HSA in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess efficacy of sEphB4-HSA in combination with an HMA as manifest by International&#xD;
      Working Group (IWG) response criteria, as well as time to development of acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (AML) in patients with MDS and time to progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on&#xD;
      days 1 and 15. Patients also receive azacitidine IV or subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-7 or&#xD;
      days 1-5 and 8-9, or decitabine IV on days 1-5. Administration of recombinant EphB4-HSA&#xD;
      fusion protein occurs before or after the HMA (not concurrently). Treatment repeats every 28&#xD;
      days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.&#xD;
