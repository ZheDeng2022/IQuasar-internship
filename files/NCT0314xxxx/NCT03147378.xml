      This study aims to evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of ModraDoc006 in&#xD;
      combination with ritonavir, in an open-label, cross-over design. Patients will be randomized&#xD;
      into two treatment groups receiving ModraDoc006/r week 1 under fasting and week 2 under fed&#xD;
      condition, or vice versa.&#xD;

      In this study the effect of food on the plasma exposure of ModraDoc006/ritonavir will be&#xD;
      assessed in an open-label, cross-over design. Patients will receive ModraDoc006/ritonavir at&#xD;
      the dose of 30 mg ModraDoc006 with 100 mg ritonavir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized 1:1 into two treatment groups (in total 16 evaluable patients are&#xD;
      needed):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: will receive ModraDoc006/ritonavir under fasting conditions the first week and&#xD;
           in a fed condition the second week of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B: will receive ModraDoc006/ritonavir under fed condition the first week and under&#xD;
           fasted condition the second week of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The department of pharmacy of The Netherlands Cancer Institute - Antoni van Leeuwenhoek&#xD;
      Hospital has developed a solid oral dosage form of docetaxel, ModraDoc006 10 mg tablets. This&#xD;
      formulation has been investigated in two phase I clinical studies in combination with the&#xD;
      CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir, according to a weekly once-daily (QD) or bi-daily (BID) schedule,&#xD;
      respectively. Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and pharmacokinetics of both regimes have been&#xD;
      determined and further clinical testing is being planned, in particular of the weekly&#xD;
      bi-daily regime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current study is to evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      ModraDoc006 in combination with ritonavir. For the ritonavir tablet formulation used in this&#xD;
      trial a food-effect on the bio-availability has been found in two prior studies. In these&#xD;
      trials the plasma concentrations were lower when ritonavir was given after a moderate or&#xD;
      high-fat meal. Plasma concentrations and T-lag were dependent on the type/amount of food&#xD;
      administered. Concentrations were lower and T-lag longer when a high-fat meal was&#xD;
      administered as compared to a moderate fat meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed centrally at the Biometrics Department of the Netherlands&#xD;
      Cancer Institute using a minimization technique as implemented in TENALEA©.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics will be performed in week 1 and 2 for up to 48 hours after study drug&#xD;
      administration (see Pharmacokinetics paragraph for exact time points). Patients will receive&#xD;
      a high-fat meal on the morning of the day of fed condition pharmacokinetics, half an hour&#xD;
      prior to intake of ModraDoc006/ritonavir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After week 2, the N15FED study will be completed and patients can be enrolled in the roll&#xD;
      over study N17DEX to continue their treatment with ModraDoc006/r (at the dose of BID 30/20 mg&#xD;
      ModraDoc006 in combination with BID 100 mg ritonavir) in their best interest and to assess&#xD;
      the long-term safety of this treatment.&#xD;
