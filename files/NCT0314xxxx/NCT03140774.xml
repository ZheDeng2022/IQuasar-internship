  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the persistence of the vaccine induced immune&#xD;
      response between 24 - 60 months following primary vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of three cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: volunteers from the Phase 1 study of the various prime/boost regimes with two viral&#xD;
      vectored Ebola vaccines: Ad26-ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo vaccines&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2: volunteers who have been vaccinated previously with Ebola vaccine r-VSV-ZEBOV&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 3: volunteers from the Phase 2 study of 3 prime/boost regimes with Ad26.ZEBOV and&#xD;
      MVA-BN-Filo vaccines (VAC52150EBL2001: EVOLVE).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), is caused by the viruses belonging to the genus Ebola virus.&#xD;
      The disease occurs in sporadic outbreaks in the endemic zones of Africa and results in high&#xD;
      mortality. During an outbreak, human to human to transmission occurs by contact with the body&#xD;
      fluids of an infected individual. In the inter-endemic period the disease is zoonotically&#xD;
      sustained in the environment. Prevention or control of future endemic outbreaks in the high&#xD;
      risk areas of Africa will require effective preventative strategies including immunisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase 1 study with the multiple heterologous prime boost regimes of the Ad26-ZEBOV and&#xD;
      the MVA-BN-Filo vaccines demonstrated a substantive immunogenicity and safety of the&#xD;
      vaccines. A combined immune response of humoral and cellular immunity was observed in the&#xD;
      study participants. Furthermore, persistence of the immune response was evident at one year&#xD;
      following the primary vaccination. It is not known whether the immune response persists&#xD;
      beyond this time point. The duration of the immunological response is important as it will&#xD;
      inform the clinical utility of the vaccines and whether or not additional booster dosage will&#xD;
      be required and if so, at what interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we will invite the 56 participants from the Phase 1 study at two time points:&#xD;
      24 - 30 months and 36 - 48 months after receiving the primary vaccination. Following&#xD;
      consenting and enrolment into the study, the participants will undergo a blood test. We will&#xD;
      assess the humoral immunity by estimating the level of binding antibody to the Ebola virus&#xD;
      envelope glycoprotein. Cellular immunity will be assessed by estimating the functional CD4+&#xD;
      and the CD8+ T cells secreting the pro-inflammatory cytokines. We will undertake this&#xD;
      assessment by intracellular staining of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and&#xD;
      using flowcytometry technique to identify the positively stained cells. A second assessment&#xD;
      of the cellular immunity will be carried out by an in-house ELISpot technique subject to&#xD;
      availability of additional funding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In October 2015, contacts of a laboratory-confirmed case of Ebola virus diseases (EVD) in the&#xD;
      U.K. were given the rVSV-EBOV vaccine as a part of clinical preventative care. Subsequently,&#xD;
      these recipients of the rVSV-EBOV vaccine were enrolled and followed up for safety and immune&#xD;
      response until one year post vaccination in the Glasgow Ebola Vaccine Follow-up Study (REC&#xD;
      reference 15/WS/0251). The duration of persistence of the immune response to rVSV-EBOV beyond&#xD;
      360 days is unknown and may impact on the use of the vaccine in any future Ebola outbreaks.&#xD;
      This study provides an opportunity to study the immune response beyond 1 year from the prime&#xD;
      vaccination and to compare those results with the response to MVA-BN-Filo and Ad26-ZEBOV&#xD;
      vaccines. This study will also allow for a further period of safety follow-up for this&#xD;
      cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-six individuals were vaccinated with the r-VSV-EBOV Ebola vaccine in Glasgow following&#xD;
      possible exposure to a patient with confirmed Ebola virus disease as a part of preventative&#xD;
      clinical care. All 26 individuals will be invited to take part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cohort consists of participants from the Phase 2 study of 3 prime/boost regimes with&#xD;
      Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo vaccines (VAC52150EBL2001: EVOLVE). This was a randomized,&#xD;
      observer-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre, Phase 2 study to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of 3 heterologous prime-boost regimens which&#xD;
      differed in the timing of the boost vaccination. The dose of each study vaccine (Ad26.ZEBOV,&#xD;
      MVA-BN-Filo or placebo) and the sequence of vaccination were identical in each group. The&#xD;
      prime/boost regimens were commenced in July 2015 and completed in February 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of participants in Group 1 (unblinded) of EVOLVE into the PRISM study can&#xD;
      commence once all approvals are in place. However, for participants in Group 2 (blinded) of&#xD;
      the EVOLVE study, recruitment and enrolment will not commence until after EVOLVE has been&#xD;
      unblinded (anticipated to occur in Q4 2018 - Q1 2019).&#xD;
