      Assessment of Therapeutic benefits and hazards of Mechanical Thrombectomy in Ischemic stroke&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is an acute neurologic dysfunction of vascular origin with sudden or at least rapid&#xD;
      occurrence of symptoms and signs corresponding to the involvement of focal areas in the&#xD;
      brain.The two main types of stroke are ischemic and hemorrhagic.Thrombosis can form in the&#xD;
      extracranial and intracranial arteries when the intima is roughened and plaque forms along&#xD;
      the injured vessel.The endothelial injury permits platelets to adhere and aggregate, then&#xD;
      coagulation is activated and thrombus develops at site of plaque.Blood flow through the&#xD;
      extracranial and intracranial systems decreases, and the collateral circulation maintains&#xD;
      function. When the compensatory mechanism of collateral circulation fails, perfusion is&#xD;
      compromised, leading to decreased perfusion and cell death. Stroke is the third leading cause&#xD;
      of death in the United States. Many people die each year from stroke in the United&#xD;
      States.Stroke is the leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States.&#xD;
      Nearly one fourth of strokes occur in people under the age of 65.High blood pressure is the&#xD;
      most important risk factor for stroke. Intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen&#xD;
      activator is the only Food and Drug Administration approved treatment for acute ischemic&#xD;
      stroke. Mechanical thrombectomy improves clinical outcomes in patients with acute ischemic&#xD;
      stroke caused by a large vessel occlusion.There is no apparent benefit of intravenous&#xD;
      thrombolysis to patients with ischemic stroke undergoing mechanical thrombectomy. The study&#xD;
      will be performed involving ischemic stroke patients with proximal occlusion within 4.5 hours&#xD;
      from stroke onset.&#xD;
