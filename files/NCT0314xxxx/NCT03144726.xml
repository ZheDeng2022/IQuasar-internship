  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infections following lower extremity amputations have been reported in up to&#xD;
      40% of patients. Surgical site infections have significant morbidity and even mortality in&#xD;
      terms of emergency room visits, length of hospital stay, reamputation rates and death. Since&#xD;
      its introduction, negative pressure wound therapy has been demonstrated to promote wound&#xD;
      healing and possibly decreasing the need for future amputations. The aim of the study is to&#xD;
      provide level I evidence for the use of negative pressure wound therapy devices in patients&#xD;
      undergoing lower extremity amputation.&#xD;

      Amputations are common vascular surgery procedures performed on patients with multiple&#xD;
      medical comorbidities. Historically, morbidity and mortality following major amputation of&#xD;
      the lower extremity in this patient population has been high. Recent studies have cited&#xD;
      30-day mortality rates ranging from 6% to 17%, with greater risk among patients with&#xD;
      transfemoral vs transtibial amputation. Postoperative goals after amputation include&#xD;
      uncomplicated wound healing and, for appropriate candidates, progression to use of a&#xD;
      prosthesis for ambulation or transfer. Perioperative wound complications can be devastating&#xD;
      in this already debilitated population and can range from 13% to 40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative wound complications, such as infection, dehiscence, and formation of haematoma&#xD;
      or seroma, are common complications of surgical procedures; particularly among patients with&#xD;
      risk factors such as obesity and diabetes. Wound complications may delay recovery, increase&#xD;
      patient discomfort and reduce overall quality of life. Increased healthcare costs may be&#xD;
      incurred due to prolonged inpatient stay, repeat surgery and the need for increased&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wounds that are secondary to amputation are reported in 13-40% of cases and are one of the&#xD;
      most challenging types of lower extremity wounds to heal. These patients often have&#xD;
      compromised healing capacity. Kayssi et al studied Canadian readmission rates, early (&lt;30&#xD;
      days) and late (30-365) readmissions were attributed to stump complications in 13% and 10% of&#xD;
      patients respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wound complications in major limb amputation frequently result in the need for further major&#xD;
      surgery in a group of patients with significant co-morbidity and enhanced operative risk. 1,&#xD;
      3, and 5 year reamputation rates for diabetics who have had major amputations are 4.7%,&#xD;
      11.8%, and 13.3% respectively. Henry et al suggested that undergoing multiple amputation&#xD;
      revisions may indicate aggressive measures to treat critical limb ischemia or chronic&#xD;
      infection that precede conversion to a more proximal amputation. Kono et al studied the&#xD;
      incidence and risk factors for reamputation after forefoot amputation. They found that 16/116&#xD;
      (14%) patients developed postoperative infection, and 10 of these required reamputation&#xD;
      (62.5%). Five of the ten reamputations occurred within 30 days after the patients developed&#xD;
      postoperative infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the morbidity from infection there is also an increased rate of phantom pain&#xD;
      as well as a delay to mobilisation with prosthesis. Minimizing postoperative infections would&#xD;
      likely have improvements in clinical outcomes, quality of life, and utilization of resources.&#xD;
      Currently, all patients are given prophylactic broad spectrum antibiotics to reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of wound infection. Sadat et al investigated whether a prolonged 5 day course of&#xD;
      antibiotics wound reduce stump infections, their results were positive however this treatment&#xD;
      is associated with the increased risk of antimicrobial resistance and c. difficile infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has traditionally been used for the treatment of open&#xD;
      wounds. In recent years, the indication for NPWT has been extended to include treatment of&#xD;
      closed surgical incisions. Armstrong et al conducted a randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      determine whether NPWT delivered by the VAC system was clinically efficacious in treating&#xD;
      amputation wounds of the diabetic foot to improve the proportion of wounds with complete&#xD;
      closure. Treatment with NPWT resulted in a higher proportion of wounds that healed, faster&#xD;
      healing rates, and fewer re-amputations than with standard treatment. No randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials have been performed to assess NPWT and infection rates after major lower&#xD;
      limb amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a paucity of scientific literature reporting outcomes following major amputation in&#xD;
      patients with critical limb ischemia, particularly with regards to wound problems and&#xD;
      infection. The purpose of this study is to provide Level I evidence on whether negative&#xD;
      pressure wound therapy is an effective strategy to significantly reduce postoperative&#xD;
      infections after major lower extremity amputation, thereby reducing patient morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality from this procedure.&#xD;
