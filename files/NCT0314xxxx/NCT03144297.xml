  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: It has already been established that there is a weak positive relationship&#xD;
      between increased intracranial pressure (ICP), as measured by lumbar puncture manometry, and&#xD;
      increased Body Mass Index (BMI). This is also observed clinically in some patients with&#xD;
      idiopathic intracranial hypertension, who typically have raised BMI. The relationship between&#xD;
      BMI and percentage body fat is non-linear, especially at BMI &gt; 40. The Bod Pod device enables&#xD;
      non-invasive body composition profiling, including accurate calculation of percentage body&#xD;
      fat, without the use of radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To examine the relationship between intracranial pressure as measured by lumbar puncture&#xD;
      manometry and percentage body fat as measured by air-displacement plethysmography (Bod Pod)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 100 patients undergoing routine diagnostic and therapeutic lumbar punctures for a&#xD;
      variety of non-emergency neurological conditions will be recruited. Cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
      opening pressure will be measured using standard manometry techniques. Blood pressure,&#xD;
      height, weight, collar size, waist size and hip size will be measured. Body composition&#xD;
      profiling will be carried out using the Bod Pod.&#xD;

      Patients due to attend the elective lumbar puncture clinic will be contacted by letter&#xD;
      beforehand (at least a week) and provided with an information sheet about the this study.&#xD;
      Neurology patients are referred to the lumbar puncture clinic as part of their diagnostic&#xD;
      work-up. The clinic takes place every Friday on the neurology ward and is run by the MS nurse&#xD;
      consultant who does the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients agreeing to take part in the study will have a lumbar puncture as normal. Before&#xD;
      removing a small volume of spinal fluid (cerebrospinal fluid or CSF), the investigators&#xD;
      routinely measure spinal fluid pressure using a manometer (pressure gauge). This is important&#xD;
      because it indirectly tells us what the pressure is within the brain (intracranial pressure&#xD;
      or ICP). Samples of CSF and blood may be needed as part of NHS patient care, but no&#xD;
      additional samples will be needed for this study. The investigators will, however, take some&#xD;
      additional measurements during the visit, which won't take more than an extra 5 minutes.&#xD;
      These will include: weight and height; measures of neck, waist and hip circumference, using a&#xD;
      standard measuring tape; and blood pressure before and after the lumbar puncture. The whole&#xD;
      visit will be 45-60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients agreeing to have body composition assessment in the Bod Pod device will be scheduled&#xD;
      for assessment at the School of Sport Sciences at the University of Gloucestershire (Oxstalls&#xD;
      campus) in the two weeks following lumbar puncture. The investigators will also contact&#xD;
      patients prior to the appointment to confirm this. The university is a five minute drive from&#xD;
      the hospital and can easily be accessed by public transport. Temporary parking permits for&#xD;
      use in the university car park will be provided where necessary. At the university body&#xD;
      composition will be assessed in the Bod Pod device by one of the trained technicians. The&#xD;
      device consists of a small enclosed chamber, in which the patient sits. Changes in air volume&#xD;
      allow calculation of body density and percentage body fat. For the test, patients will need&#xD;
      to bring some form of tight-fitting swimwear (Speedos or underpants for men; swimming&#xD;
      costumes for women, no bikinis). They will also be required to wear a swimming hat (which&#xD;
      will be provided). No metal objects should be worn while in the Bod Pod. Prior to the test we&#xD;
      may need to measure lung volume by asking the patient to blow into a spirometer. This helps&#xD;
      to calculate body density but is not always necessary. The patient will then sit inside the&#xD;
      Bod Pod (which is confined but non-invasive and has a large window in the front hatch and a&#xD;
      panic button if they want to alert the technician) for about 3 minutes. During this time air&#xD;
      displacement measurements are made and some people may experience slight pressure in their&#xD;
      ears, although this is not dangerous. Male and female changing facilities are available and&#xD;
      Bod Pod testing will be in a private, screened-off area with only the technician present.&#xD;
      Patients can also ask for a chaperone or male/female technician if they prefer. This test&#xD;
      will take about 15 minutes to complete and patients will be given computer readout of their&#xD;
      body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A power calculation for the study indicates that approximately 100 patients will need to be&#xD;
      recruited. The investigators aim to recruit between 1 and 3 patients from the lumbar puncture&#xD;
      clinic per week and therefore predict that the study will be completed within 2 years.&#xD;
