      Background Hypertension is the main risk factor for most cardiovascular diseases. Blood&#xD;
      pressure (BP) control has been shown to reduce the incidence of stroke, myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, renal diseases and heart failure. Although BP lowering is effective, few&#xD;
      population programs can achieve BP control. A coordinated and organized system from the&#xD;
      Brazilian Ministry of Healthy involving Family Health Strategy (FHS), a program for the&#xD;
      prevention of chronic disease, and the Popular Pharmacy Program (PPP), which subsidizes&#xD;
      medications for the population, could allow an earlier identification and better BP control.&#xD;
      Matão Controlling Hypertension (MatCH) is a community-based population project that aims to&#xD;
      apply an organized, integrated and coordinated program in the city of Matão, Brazil,&#xD;
      involving FSH and PPP in order to actively search, treat and follow-up hypertensive subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method This is a population community-based, prospective, interventional, follow-up study&#xD;
      where all subjects aged ≥ 40 years assisted by the FHS program in Matão will have BP assessed&#xD;
      monthly by trained Community Health Agents (CHA) during a domiciliary visit. Identified&#xD;
      hypertensive subjects will be referred to FHS physicians for nonpharmacological and&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment. Most of the hypertensive drugs used will be available thought the&#xD;
      PPP. Prevalence of hypertension, awareness, demographics and risk factors will be correlated&#xD;
      with BP control. The population study is expected to involve approximately 15,000 subjects.&#xD;
      The study period will be four years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion Considering that hypertension is asymptomatic in most cases, to reduce the&#xD;
      population burden of BP-related deaths and diseases it is essential to detect and treat early&#xD;
      all hypertensive patients. If BP control be achieved on a large scale, this program can be&#xD;
      applied to other populations from developing countries.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is the main risk factor associated with the global burden of disease and&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brazil, a middle-income country and the largest in Latin America, has a prevalence of&#xD;
      hypertension of about 35% (Ribeiro AL et al, 2016), with no significant difference between&#xD;
      genders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A decrease in cardiovascular disease mortality has been observed. This phenomenon could be&#xD;
      attributed to some public healthy preventive programs such as the Family Healthy Strategy&#xD;
      (FHS) (Macinko J et al, 2015) and the Popular Pharmacy Program (PPP) (Emmerick I et al,&#xD;
      2015), both supported by the Brazilian Ministry of Healthy. FHS is focused on a&#xD;
      community-based approach to providing primary health care. Physicians, nurses, and community&#xD;
      health agents (CHA) visit residents in their homes to prevent complications and to take care&#xD;
      of chronic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the Matão Controlling Hypertension (MatCH) project is to apply an organized,&#xD;
      integrated and coordinated program of all health services in Matão, mainly involving FSH and&#xD;
      PPP, for an earlier identification of hypertensive individuals, followed by treatment and&#xD;
      follow-up in order to control their BP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To identify hypertensive subjects aged ≥ 40 years in a defined population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To control BP in this population by the optimization of the local public health system.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
           A better BP control can be obtained with an integrated and coordinated hypertension&#xD;
           detection and control system involving the Family Healthy Strategy (FHS), Popular&#xD;
           Pharmacy Program (FPP) and local public health services in a defined Brazilian&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
           This will be a population-based, prospective, interventional, follow-up study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inclusion criteria All consented subjects aged ≥ 40 years belonging to FHS and residing&#xD;
           in Matão.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exclusion criteria Patients younger than 40 years. Subjects not belonging to FHS in&#xD;
           Matão. Subjects from other cities.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study period Four years&#xD;
&#xD;
           Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary outcomes Prevalence of hypertension at initial assessment. Number of&#xD;
           hypertensive subjects with BP controlled during follow-up .&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
           Correlation of hypertension prevalence and BP control with demographics, risk factors&#xD;
           and end organ diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Baseline procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
           Matão city characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will be conducted in Matão, Brazil, a city located in São Paulo state, the&#xD;
           wealthiest state in Brazil, in the Brazilian southwest, 300 km northwest to the state&#xD;
           capital. According to the 2010 Brazilian census, the Matão population was 76,786 and the&#xD;
           estimate for 2017 was 81,878 inhabitants, with no difference in sex distribution . The&#xD;
           economy is mainly based on industrial activities and on general services. Ethnicity is&#xD;
           diverse, but most people are of Caucasian origin, descendants of European immigrants.&#xD;
           The population is urban and stable, with a low rate of interurban migration. About 95%&#xD;
           of all dwellings have piped water, a sewage network and electricity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The public healthy system of Matão is well organized. As is the case for most Brazilian&#xD;
           cities, Matão has FHS. There are 12 FHS in the city covering a population of 44,850&#xD;
           people, representing about 57% of the whole population. The city also participates in&#xD;
           the PPP.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study population The 2010 Brazilian census indicated that 29,192 Matão inhabitants were&#xD;
           ≥ 40 years old, representing 38% of the total population. Considering a population of&#xD;
           41,400 covered by FHS, 38% of &gt;40-year-old subjects represent a study population of&#xD;
           about 15,000 subjects. The reason to include a population aged ≥ 40 years is justified&#xD;
           by the fact that the prevalence of hypertension is almost 20% among subjects 35 to 44&#xD;
           years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
           BP assessment BP will be measured by the CHA using the automated device Omron M2®&#xD;
           validated. The CHA will be trained to measure BP properly according to the following&#xD;
           protocol (Malachias et al, 2016): BP will be measured in both arms; if the readings are&#xD;
           different, the arm with the higher reading will be used for subsequent measurements made&#xD;
           1 to 2 minutes apart and the average of these measurements will be considered. A wider&#xD;
           cuff will be used for patients with an arm circumference of more than 32 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Definitions and classifications&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypertension diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
           The diagnosis of hypertension will be confirmed if systolic blood pressure is ≥ 140 mmHg&#xD;
           or diastolic pressure is ≥ 90 mmHg, or both, in two different measurements separated by&#xD;
           about 30 days (Malachias M et al, 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Controlled BP will be defined as systolic blood pressure ≤ 139 mmHg and diastolic blood&#xD;
           pressure ≤ 89 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
           The BP of the study population will be measured monthly by CHA. If BP is above normal&#xD;
           ranges and continues to be elevated at the second monthly measurement, the subject will&#xD;
           be followed up more closely by the FHS physician, who will decide the best hypertensive&#xD;
           treatment strategy. If BP continues to be elevated at the monthly assessments, even with&#xD;
           optimized treatment, the subject will be referred to and followed up by the cardiologist&#xD;
           from the public health service connected to FHS. The monthly BP values obtained will be&#xD;
           inserted in a data base and software developed by the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subject evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
           Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subject data will be collected with a structured questionnaire about age, gender, years&#xD;
           of education, previous history of hypertension, stroke, coronary artery disease, chronic&#xD;
           kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, peripheral artery disease, dyslipidemia, alcohol&#xD;
           abuse, smoking, and physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Treatment of hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
           The treatment of hypertension will be based on the recent VII Brazilian Guidelines of&#xD;
           Arterial Hypertension. (Malaquias M et al, 2016)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Nonpharmacological treatment All hypertensive patients will be counseled to initiate&#xD;
           life style changes. They will receive verbal and written orientations regarding weight&#xD;
           loss, salt reduction, exercise, reduced alcohol consumption, smoking cessation, and the&#xD;
           introduction of more fresh fruits and vegetables in their diets.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pharmacological treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
           Drug treatment will be started for subjects with BP ≥140/90 mm Hg at second assessment,&#xD;
           those with SBP≥ 180 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 110 mmHg at first assessment and all hypertensive&#xD;
           subjects that are not responding to nonpharmacological treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In a first step, the first lines of anti-hypertensive medication will be the&#xD;
           angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) captopril and enalapril, or the&#xD;
           angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) losartan, or calcium channel blockers (CCB),&#xD;
           nifedipine, diltiazem and verapamil, or diuretics, the thiazide-type diuretic&#xD;
           hydrochlorthiazide or chlortalidone, or beta-blockers, atenolol, in selected cases. In a&#xD;
           second step, if BP is not controlled, a combination of two drug classes will be tried.&#xD;
           If BP is not achieved, in a third step, a third drug class will be added. All of these&#xD;
           anti-hypertensive drugs are available in the PPP. In a fourth step, when BP control is&#xD;
           not yet obtained, other antihypertensive drugs will be requested from the city public&#xD;
           health department, preferably low costs drugs such as clonidine, spironolactone,&#xD;
           hydralazine and amlodipine. During this phase, a consultation with a hypertension&#xD;
           specialist physician will be provided. The combined use of ACEI and ARB will be avoided.&#xD;
           For individuals with chronic kidney disease, initial antihypertensive treatment will&#xD;
           include an ACEI or ARB. This includes all chronic kidney disease patients with&#xD;
           hypertension independent of diabetes and race.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ethical approval&#xD;
&#xD;
           The project was approved by the Ethics Committee of Universidade de Araraquara, which is&#xD;
           accredited by the Office of Human Research Protections as an Institutional Review Board,&#xD;
           process no 1.985.885. All participants will give written informed consent to&#xD;
           participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           To analyze the associations between the prevalence of hypertension at baseline,&#xD;
           demographic variables, risk factors and end organ diseases the Chi-square test will be&#xD;
           used for categorical variables and one-way ANOVA for numeric variables. Logistic&#xD;
           regression will be used for multivariate analysis. Since BP will be assessed monthly,&#xD;
           the mean BP values for each month will be compared by ANOVA for multiple repeated&#xD;
           measurements. After the second assessment at baseline to determine how many hypertensive&#xD;
           subjects achieved BP control, the McNemar test for paired samples will be used. For all&#xD;
           tests, will be considered a level of significance of 5% and a 95% confidence interval&#xD;
           (CI).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Discussion&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypertension control on a large scale can be a challenge, with barriers attributed to&#xD;
           patients, healthcare providers, health-care systems, and the silent nature of the&#xD;
           disease (Arima H et al 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Community resources such as volunteers, health nurses, and local organizations are&#xD;
           underutilized to support disease prevention and primary health care. Synergy created by&#xD;
           connecting family physicians, patients, peer volunteers and local resources can lead to&#xD;
           better health outcomes for community residents (Ye et al, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The purpose of this present study is in accordance with these studies. The differential&#xD;
           is that it will be applied to a larger population through local health services with the&#xD;
           efforts involving the CHA from the FHS program. This model of BP control will be tested&#xD;
           in a community-based population, i.e., in the real world, and not in a selected sample&#xD;
           that could generate undesirable bias analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The project has many positive aspects. The local health care system has already been&#xD;
           structured. No additional cost will be necessary regarding human resources or new&#xD;
           buildings and most of the antihypertensive drugs are available at PPP. Individuals aged&#xD;
           ≥ 40 years will be included, so that it will be possible to identify and reduce earlier&#xD;
           the risk of cardiovascular disease in hypertensive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The possible disadvantage would be the high cost to reach a large population. However,&#xD;
           the financial resources of FHS are the same as those already implemented for five years.&#xD;
           Not all recommended anti-hypertensive drugs will be immediately available for&#xD;
           pharmacological treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Some challenges are expected. In a pilot study (Minelli et al, 2016), almost 50% of&#xD;
           cases was not possible to assess BP during CHA visits. Most of the subjects were out&#xD;
           working and a minority refused to take BP assessment. An alternative to this problem is&#xD;
           to make an appointment with these missing subjects or to visit them at their local jobs.&#xD;
           Another challenge is to convince the target population to take their medications even if&#xD;
           there are no hypertension-related symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This project is a proof of concept, i.e., it shows that it is feasible to control BP at&#xD;
           levels better than the reported 40% BP control among Brazilian hypertensive subjects, in&#xD;
           a large number of people, using a system that already exists, i.e., FHS, PPP and local&#xD;
           public health services, although with a coordinated, centralized and organized program&#xD;
           directed at BP control.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If the goals of large-scale BP control be achieved, this model can be applied to other&#xD;
           vulnerable populations from developing countries.&#xD;
