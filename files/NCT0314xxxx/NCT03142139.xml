      It has been found that the non-live vaccine against Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis (DTP)&#xD;
      in addition to its disease specific effects may have so called &quot;non-specific effects&quot; with&#xD;
      the potential to affect sensitivity towards vaccine unrelated pathogens, resulting in excess&#xD;
      mortality(Aaby, Kollmann, &amp; Benn, 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study from Australia found that delayed vaccination with the first dose of&#xD;
      Diphtheria, Tetanus, and acellular Pertussis(DTaP)-containing vaccine is associated with&#xD;
      reduced risk of atopic dermatitis (aOR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.34-0.97, P = 0.04) and reduced use of&#xD;
      medication against atopic dermatitis (aOR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.24-0.83, P = 0.01)(Kiraly et al.,&#xD;
      2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This register based observational study aims to extend the existing knowledge on non-specific&#xD;
      effects of non-live vaccines by testing the above finding, that delayed vaccination with&#xD;
      Diphtheria, Tetanus, acellular Pertussis - Inactivated Polio vaccine - Haemophilus influenzae&#xD;
      type b (DTaP-IPV-Hib) is associated with lower risk of developing atopic dermatitis before 1&#xD;
      year of age in the Danish birth cohorts from 1997-2012.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      It has been found that the non-live vaccine against Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis (DTP)&#xD;
      in addition to its disease specific effects may have so called non-specific effects with the&#xD;
      potential to affect resistance towards vaccine unrelated pathogens, resulting in excess&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity(Aaby et al., 2014). These immunomodifying effects may affect&#xD;
      development of atopic dermatitis through increased immunological sensitivity(Nilsson, Gruber,&#xD;
      Granstrom, Bjorksten, &amp; Kjellman, 1998). A recent study from Australia found that delayed&#xD;
      vaccination with the first dose of Diphtheria, Tetanus, and acellular&#xD;
      Pertussis(DTaP)-containing vaccine is associated with reduced eczema (aOR: 0.57; 95% CI:&#xD;
      0.34-0.97, P = 0.04) and reduced use of medication against atopic dermatitis (aOR: 0.45; 95%&#xD;
      CI: 0.24-0.83, P = 0.01)(Kiraly et al., 2016). The present study aims to test the above&#xD;
      finding and investigate the effect of timeliness of vaccination with DTaP-IPV-Hib (with or&#xD;
      without PCV) on development of atopic dermatitis before 1 year of age among Danish children&#xD;
      born between 1997 and 2012. From 1997 to 2012 children in Denmark were scheduled to receive&#xD;
      the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd dose of DTaP-IPV-Hib at 3, 5, and 12 months respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary investigation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question 1.a Is delayed vaccination with the first dose of DTaP-IPV-Hib (vaccination&#xD;
      at or after 4 months of age) associated with a reduced risk of development of atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis from 4 months and until but not including 12 months of age compared with receiving&#xD;
      the first dose of DTaP-IPV-Hib before 4 months of age?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary investigations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question 1.b Among children with a timely 1st dose of DTaP-IPV-Hib (vaccination&#xD;
      before 4 months of age), is delayed vaccination with the second dose of DTaP-IPV-Hib&#xD;
      (vaccination at or after 6 months of age) associated with a reduced risk of development of&#xD;
      atopic dermatitis from 6 months and until but not including 12 months of age compared with&#xD;
      receiving the second dose of DTaP-IPV-Hib before 6 months of age?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question 2. Is receipt of DTaP-IPV-Hib associated with development of atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis from 3 months and until but not including 8 months of age compared with being&#xD;
      unvaccinated?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data assessment Information on development of atopic dermatitis and vaccination status is&#xD;
      assessed at baseline (which is 4 months of age (research question 1.a.),6 months of age&#xD;
      (research question 1.b.) and 3 months of age (research question 2.)) and through follow up&#xD;
      (until 1 year of age). Confounder information is assessed at 3 months of age for all&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of atopic dermatitis is assessed according to an algorithm described in detail&#xD;
      under &quot;9. Outcome measures&quot;, which uses information on prescriptions and hospitalizations up&#xD;
      until one year after the last age of outcome assessment (1 year of age in this study) to&#xD;
      confirm a case. Children must therefore be alive and living in Denmark until 2 years of age&#xD;
      representative of age at end of follow-up plus 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Danish national registers contains individual-level information on a broad range of&#xD;
      health and social factors. Every child born in Denmark receives a unique personal&#xD;
      identification number (ID) at birth, which follows the individual through life. Using the ID&#xD;
      it is possible to link information from the different registers at an individual level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confounders:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will seek to retain information on potential confounders from the Danish&#xD;
      registers. Potential confounders will be assessed at 3 months of age and included in the&#xD;
      adjusted analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information on sex, season of birth, death, emigration, parental identity, sibling's identity&#xD;
      and exact address will be obtained from the Danish Civil Registration System. The&#xD;
      investigators will use information on parental identity to link every child to its parents&#xD;
      and obtain information on parents' origin of birth, single parenthood and the number of&#xD;
      children in the household. The investigators will furthermore derive information on&#xD;
      population density based on information on the municipality in which the child lives.&#xD;
      Information on parental and sibling's identity will be used to link information on family&#xD;
      history of atopic dermatitis to the child. Atopic dermatitis is categorized according to the&#xD;
      algorithm described in detail under &quot;9. Outcome measures&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variables; caesarean section, preterm birth, birthweight, and maternal smoking during&#xD;
      pregnancy is obtained from the Danish Medical Birth Register, which contains information on&#xD;
      all live and stillbirths in Denmark. Antibiotic use is recorded in the Danish National&#xD;
      Prescription Register. Information on chronic disease is obtained from in the Danish national&#xD;
      patient registry. Household income is obtained from the Danish registers on personal income&#xD;
      and transfer payment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal highest education is obtained from the Danish education registers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dataset is expected to contain close to complete information on confounders. Hence, it is&#xD;
      expected that children with missing confounder information constitute an ignorable proportion&#xD;
      of the complete study population, wherefore the investigators aim to conduct complete case&#xD;
      analyses only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical model for research question 1.a +1.b; investigation of the effect of timing of&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For investigation of the effect of timing of the first and second dose of DTaP-IPV-Hib with&#xD;
      or without PCV, a Binary regression model will be used to estimate the adjusted relative risk&#xD;
      of developing atopic dermatitis from baseline (age for categorized timely vaccination) until&#xD;
      one year of age, among delayed vaccinated compared to timely vaccinated children. The&#xD;
      analysis will include all abovementioned potential confounders. Absolute risk differences&#xD;
      will be reported if relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intended subgroup and sensitivity analysis for the primary investigation (research question&#xD;
      1.a)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following presents a priory identified relevant subgroup and sensitivity analyses. If&#xD;
      relevant, additional analysis will be included with the aim to pursue potential tendencies&#xD;
      revealed in the data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sex differential effect Data will be analyzed for effect modification by sex because of&#xD;
           evidence of sex-differential non-specific effects of vaccines (Aaby et al., 2014) and&#xD;
           also sex-differential atopic sensitization associated with delayed vaccination (Kiraly&#xD;
           et al., 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Further subgroup analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Effect modification by PCV vaccination. PCV was enrolled into the Danish&#xD;
                vaccination schedule during the years of this investigation. Hence, it will be&#xD;
                investigated if potential NSEs of DTaP-IPV-Hib vary according to receipt of PCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Exploratory analysis of effect modification.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Subgroup analysis, which only includes first born children; Parents of children&#xD;
                with older siblings may be more familiar with AD, which may result in a less&#xD;
                frequent health care seeking behavior. Parents of children with older siblings, who&#xD;
                have had AD themselves, may further have prescription medicines in the home from&#xD;
                treatment of prior cases of AD among the siblings. Hence, cases of AD categorized&#xD;
                based on disease specific prescriptions may be misclassified if the parents do not&#xD;
                get a new prescription for that child.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sensitivity analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sensitivity analysis to investigate if the results are affected by inclusion of&#xD;
                children with no DTaP-IPV-Hib before 1 year of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Investigation of reverse causation: A Cox regression will be conducted to&#xD;
                investigate if presence of atopic dermatitis is associated with subsequent delayed&#xD;
                vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Inclusion of negative control outcome/exposure; In similar studies, it has been&#xD;
                suspected that there may be a risk of ascertainment bias, whereby parents of&#xD;
                children who are delayed vaccinated, represent parents with a general lower health&#xD;
                care seeking behavior, which could result in lower levels of AD diagnosis among&#xD;
                their children. In order to accommodate this potential unmeasured confounder, the&#xD;
                investigators will seek to identify a relevant negative control exposure or&#xD;
                outcome, which will help indicate the strength of a potential interference from&#xD;
                this unmeasured confounder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical model for investigation of research question 2; investigation of the effect of&#xD;
      being vaccinated with DTaP-IPV-Hib with or without PCV compared with being non-vaccinated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For investigation of the effect of being vaccinated with DTaP-IPV-Hib compared with being&#xD;
      non-vaccinated a Cox proportional hazards regression with age as the underlying time will be&#xD;
      used to estimate the adjusted HR of developing atopic dermatitis among children vaccinated&#xD;
      with DTaP-IPV-Hib compared with unvaccinated children. Vaccination status will be assessed&#xD;
      from time of scheduled vaccination (3 months of age) and set as a time dependent variable&#xD;
      with the categories unvaccinated and vaccinated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As vaccination status is included as a time dependent variable, the group of unvaccinated&#xD;
      children will inherently become smaller with time as they get vaccinated. In order to assure&#xD;
      sufficient group sizes, children will only be followed until 8 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The model will include all identified potential confounding factors listed above. All&#xD;
      co-variates will be included as fixed variables and assessed at baseline (3 months of age).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proportional hazard assumption will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity analysis for the Cox regression&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Delayed diagnosis; Atopic dermatitis does not become apparent until the child has scratched&#xD;
      the affected skin. Furthermore, it may take weeks to months before the parents become aware&#xD;
      that this is not something which is passing, and bring the child to a doctor. Therefore, it&#xD;
      is very likely that actual onset of AD is weeks/months prior to date of diagnosis by the&#xD;
      healthcare professionals or receipt of disease specific prescriptions. Due to this delay,&#xD;
      there is a risk of differential misclassification, whereby cases of AD may be falsely&#xD;
      ascribed to the vaccinated exposure group. A sensitivity analysis will account for this delay&#xD;
      by setting the date for onset of AD prior to onset according to the AD algorithm. Primary&#xD;
      health care facilities will be contacted in order to gain expert insight on approximate delay&#xD;
      from onset of symptoms to receipt of prescription medicines or referral to a hospital.&#xD;
