  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The skin of a newborn has a sensitive skin barrier relative to an older child and an adult.&#xD;
      Newborn's skin, for example, is extremely vulnerable to damage by environmental agents such&#xD;
      as harsh detergents, some topical oils, and other irritant chemicals. Evolving perspectives&#xD;
      on barrier dysfunction in newborn babies has led to the idea that there may be a window of&#xD;
      opportunity in the first few months of a newborn's life to change the environmental agents&#xD;
      that their skin is exposed to in order to maximize skin health. These environmental changes&#xD;
      could involve the use of optimally formulated wash products and emollients, as well as the&#xD;
      removal of all other irritant substances that could damage the skin barrier. Further research&#xD;
      is required to identify skincare practices that are harmful and those that are positive, and&#xD;
      to ultimately ascertain what the optimum skincare routine should be.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An important skincare strategy is to identify an appropriate regimen (use of topical&#xD;
      emollients and wash products) that will be used to maintain healthy skin in the future. Baby&#xD;
      massage in particular has been shown to enhance the bond between mother and newborn,&#xD;
      highlighting that early intervention can support skin health while also being a rewarding&#xD;
      experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gentle Touch/Early Massage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apply the lotion with a gentle touch to communicate love to your baby and to create a special&#xD;
      bonding moment with skin-to-skin touch. Your touch nur-tures baby's social, emotional and&#xD;
      physical development. Please take your time to apply consciously the lotion on the whole body&#xD;
      of your baby while engaging with her/him. Your touch, light but present, will be consistent&#xD;
      across all the face and body areas, it is delicate and soft but more than just applying the&#xD;
      lotion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents/guardians are using products to help care for their newborn's skin and there is a&#xD;
      need to help parents/guardians identify the most appropriate products through research. This&#xD;
      study aims to help address this need.&#xD;

      2 BACKGROUND 2.1 SKIN DEVELOPMENT FROM BIRTH The skin visually reaches maturity anywhere&#xD;
      between 30 and 37 weeks of gestational age, yet neonatal and infant skin exhibits a&#xD;
      'sensitive' nature.1 To emphasise this, 78% of participants in one study reported a 'rash' in&#xD;
      the first month of their newborns life.2 Its now clear that this sensitivity is related to&#xD;
      the functioning of the skin barrier, formed by the skins uppermost layer, the stratum&#xD;
      corneum. It takes more than 12 months following birth before the stratum corneum reaches&#xD;
      structural maturity at a microscopic level.3 This is reflected by the reduced function of the&#xD;
      skin barrier during this time, indicated by elevated transepidermal water loss (TEWL).4 The&#xD;
      reduced skin barrier function exhibited during the months following birth increases the risk&#xD;
      of irritant and allergen penetration through the skin and consequently the development of&#xD;
      dermatological conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 SKIN CLEANSING For both children and adults, bathing to cleanse the skin is a hygienic&#xD;
      necessity. The goal of hygiene is the preservation of skin health. Cleansing is essential to&#xD;
      remove: potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as those from faeces; bodily secretions, such&#xD;
      as faeces and saliva that contain enzymes (lipases and proteases) that breakdown the skin&#xD;
      barrier; foods, including milk that can disturb skin homeostasis and peanuts that can cause&#xD;
      sensitization; and other chemical irritants in the environment.1 However there is a balance&#xD;
      to be made between cleansing the skin and preservation of its homeostatic properties such as&#xD;
      skin barrier function and integrity.5 For instance some soaps and cleansers used to clean the&#xD;
      skin that contain harsh detergents, such as sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), increase skin&#xD;
      surface pH, reduce skin hydration and alter skin barrier function.6 Nevertheless cleansers&#xD;
      are important. Washing with water alone is ineffective at removing fat-soluble substances&#xD;
      from skin.7 The surfactants in cleansers are required to remove these potential fat-soluble&#xD;
      irritants. Moreover, washing with tap water alone leads to the extraction of water-soluble&#xD;
      metabolites from the skin, including NMF, and causes mild irritation and increased skin&#xD;
      dryness. Washing with hard water, as opposed to soft water, in particular is consistently&#xD;
      reported to increase the risk of developing AD. A balance is therefore required between&#xD;
      effective cleansing and the need for cleansers that are kind to the skin.8 There is now a&#xD;
      wide range of detergents and detergent complexes available for the use in cleansing with a&#xD;
      spectrum of effects on the skin from harsh irritant effects, such as those caused by SLS, to&#xD;
      very mild effects comparable to washing with water alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of cleansing products compared to water alone for bathing babies has been subject to&#xD;
      a systematic review,9 which focused on two trials. One study10 comprised of four trial arms,&#xD;
      including washing twice weekly with a wash gel product; bathing twice weekly with water then&#xD;
      applying a cream; bathing with wash gel and applying cream after bathing; and bathing with&#xD;
      water only. The second study11 compared two different liquid cleansers with water for bathing&#xD;
      infants. The results of these studies indicated no harm to skin barrier function with the&#xD;
      tested cleaning agents, although the number of babies in each treatment arm was small.9 A&#xD;
      large UK-based trial of a mild pH 5.5 liquid SLS-free cleanser versus water alone in bathing&#xD;
      newborn babies for the first 28 days, conducted since this systematic review, showed&#xD;
      essentially no differences in TEWL, hydration, skin surface pH and clinical observations.12&#xD;
      Skin hydration was raised in the cleanser arm at 14 days postnatal (ITT: mean wash score 49.7&#xD;
      (SD 9.2) vs. water 46.7 (SD 8.4), p=0.02, 95% CI -5.46 to -0.43), but was equal to those in&#xD;
      the water group at 28 days postnatal. The evidence suggests that while some cleansers,&#xD;
      particularly those containing SLS, can be harsh on the skin, other cleansers are available&#xD;
      that have very mild effects on the skin, effects as least as mild as washing with water&#xD;
      alone. The advantage of these mild cleansers is their increased cleansing efficacy and&#xD;
      cosmetic acceptability. Given the limited number of robust clinical trials in this area there&#xD;
      is a need to conduct further research to enable healthcare professionals and parents/carers&#xD;
      to identify suitable and safe wash products and cleansing regimens for their babies and&#xD;
      infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 CURRENT GUIDANCE ON SKIN CLEANSING Current guidance on skin cleansing has been limited by&#xD;
      the lack of available high quality evidence, leading to a number of differing&#xD;
      guidelines.13-17 Hence, there has been confusion amongst health professionals in relation to&#xD;
      appropriate advice.18 Guidance from the World Health Organization13 is limited to bathing a&#xD;
      baby in warm water, at least 6 hours following birth. There is no United Kingdom NICE&#xD;
      (National Institute for Clinical Excellence) guidance specifically about neonatal skin care.&#xD;
      The NICE Postnatal Care Guidelines17 contains one paragraph about neonatal skin care which&#xD;
      recommends that cleansing agents, lotions or medicated wipes should not be used; using only a&#xD;
      mild non-perfumed soap where necessary. No evidence is cited to support this practice, and&#xD;
      recent trials have demonstrated that the use of products can significantly reduce the&#xD;
      development of dermatological conditions. In contrast to the NICE Postnatal Care Guideline,&#xD;
      AWOHNN14,19 guidance is more comprehensive and specific and recommends use of a cleansing&#xD;
      wash, with a neutral pH, that has been specifically formulated for use on babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are guidelines available, not all are evidence based and debate still remains&#xD;
      on best practice. The most recent guideline, produced by a panel of experts, advocates the&#xD;
      use of wash products. Based upon this guideline the recently NHIR-funded Barrier Enhancement&#xD;
      for Eczema Prevention (BEEP) study investigating an early skincare intervention in babies&#xD;
      provided the following advice to participants: (1) avoid soap and bubble bath; (2) use a&#xD;
      mild, fragrance-free synthetic cleanser designed specifically for babies; (3) avoid bath oils&#xD;
      and additives; (4) use a mild, fragrance-free shampoo designed specifically for babies and&#xD;
      avoid washing the suds over the baby's body; and (5) avoid using baby wipes, where&#xD;
      possible.20 The challenge for parents is identifying 'mild' products, and so this advice&#xD;
      currently has limited real-world value until more evidence on the effects of different&#xD;
      products becomes available. There have been substantial advances in formulation technology of&#xD;
      baby wash products since some of these guidelines were written highlighting the need for&#xD;
      further research into neonatal skincare practices.10-12,21-24 2.4 INFANT SKIN MASSAGE Infant&#xD;
      massage is a traditional practice advocated and used throughout the world to promote physical&#xD;
      and mental development.25 Moreover it is an integral aspect of topical emollient use in&#xD;
      newborn babies because emollient lotions and creams applied to the skin must be rubbed, or&#xD;
      'massaged', in. In the UK more than half of maternity/neonatal units endorse the use of&#xD;
      massage oil as part of infant skincare.26 A number of studies into infant massage have&#xD;
      identified potential physical and mental benefits that require validation.25 These benefits&#xD;
      include: increased weight, length, head circumference; improved sleep; reduced episodes of&#xD;
      crying/fussing; improved motor skills (gross and fine); enhanced personal and social&#xD;
      behaviour; and improved psychomotor development. The development of a secure attachment&#xD;
      between parent and infant in the early years is highly protective in promoting healthy&#xD;
      psychosocial and emotional development. Infant massage may have a role in facilitating the&#xD;
      development of early sensitive parent - infant relationships and attunement, known precursors&#xD;
      to the development of secure attachments27. At 2 months of age the&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical system produces and regulates glucocorticoid cortisol&#xD;
      in response to stress. Sensitive and attuned parents-infant interactions are associated with&#xD;
      reduced cortisol excretion and thus improved affect regulation in infants28. A randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial conducted by Gurol and Polat on infant massage in 120 newborn babies found a&#xD;
      significant positive effect of the intervention on attachment between the mother and baby.29&#xD;
      The association between early secure attachment relationships, and the promotion of healthy&#xD;
      brain development, emotional wellbeing and mental health is increasingly recognised and&#xD;
      associated with improved outcomes for children across all domains of functioning30. Although&#xD;
      there is significant research in the area of infant / child massage which supports positive&#xD;
      benefits, very few studies have specifically studied the effects of massage in combination&#xD;
      with a specific product form as a focus of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gentle Touch/Early Massage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apply the lotion with a gentle touch to communicate love to your baby and to create a special&#xD;
      bonding moment with skin-to-skin touch. Your touch nur-tures baby's social, emotional and&#xD;
      physical development. Please take your time to apply consciously the lotion on the whole body&#xD;
      of your baby while engaging with her/him. Your touch, light but present, will be consistent&#xD;
      across all the face and body areas, it is delicate and soft but more than just applying the&#xD;
      lotion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improved parent-infant interaction is currently an overlooked potential benefit of emollient&#xD;
      use in newborn babies in most studies reported. Care is needed when selecting an emollient&#xD;
      medium for infant massage because some topical oils have been found to damage the skin&#xD;
      barrier.31-33 This study aims to investigate the effects of an emollient lotion specially&#xD;
      formulated for use in newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5 PATIENT AND PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT We have taken the views of parents with young babies into&#xD;
      consideration when developing this study so that the findings have the greatest meaning and&#xD;
      impact to them. In 2008 the views of 26 mothers, 20 midwives and 10 health visitors on baby&#xD;
      bathing practices were ascertained as part of a qualitative study.18 Since then we have&#xD;
      gathered the views of parents on baby bathing practices and clinical research on these&#xD;
      practices as part of several clinical studies.26,31,34-37 Parents are using products to help&#xD;
      care for their baby's skin and there is a need to help parents identify the most appropriate&#xD;
      products through research. This study aims to help address this need.&#xD;
