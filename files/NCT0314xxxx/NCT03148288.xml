  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a very common functional gastrointestinal disorder&#xD;
      affecting nearly 20% of the North American population. IBS is characterized by chronic&#xD;
      abdominal, associated with a change in bowel frequency and or consistency that lack a known&#xD;
      structural or anatomic explanation. Current treatment for IBS is primarily symptom-based.&#xD;
      However over a third of patients with IBS fail to respond to currently available therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency is estimated in over a billion people&#xD;
      world-wide . Vitamin D has potential mechanisms not only in the balance of calcium and bone&#xD;
      homeostasis, but also a key modulator of the immune system. Vitamin D receptors (VDRs) are&#xD;
      located on all nucleated cells including the GI tract. Thus far, there is already&#xD;
      accumulating evidence for a role for vitamin D supplementation in inflammatory bowel disease&#xD;
      (IBD). A recent systematic review suggested there may be benefits of vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation in IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D insufficiency is widespread in patients with IBS and there is a positive&#xD;
      association between vitamin D status and quality of life. To date, there is no US trial&#xD;
      examining the effect of vitamin d supplementation on IBS symptoms and quality of life in&#xD;
      patients with IBS.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Provide signed and dated informed consent and understand the nature of the study&#xD;
             sufficiently to allow completion of all study assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Be ambulatory, community dwelling, 18 to 80 years, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Meet Rome IV diagnostic criteria for IBS&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have IBS of at least &quot;moderate&quot; severity, i.e., have a score on the IBS-SSS of &gt; 175&#xD;
             (0-500) at the baseline visit (Visit 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. If the patient is on medications which affect the gastrointestinal tract or visceral&#xD;
             sensation (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, fiber, antispasmodics, etc.) they must be&#xD;
             on a stable dose for at least 1 month prior to entering the study and for the duration&#xD;
             of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have a history of intractable IBS, defined as continuous, unremitting and severe&#xD;
             abdominal pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Be pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have an established diagnosis of any concomitant bowel disturbance that would&#xD;
             interfere with the assessment of efficacy or safety in the study (e.g., Hirschsprung's&#xD;
             disease, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Report warning symptoms (i.e., rectal bleeding, weight loss &gt;10%, iron deficiency&#xD;
             anemia, etc.) otherwise not explained&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have undergone previous abdominal surgery (with the exception of uncomplicated&#xD;
             appendectomy, cholecystectomy, hysterectomy, or polypectomy &gt; 6 months prior to&#xD;
             enrollment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have a history of metabolic or inflammatory disease that may affect bowel motility&#xD;
             (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, celiac, sarcoidosis, connective tissue disease,&#xD;
             amyloidosis, or poorly controlled hypo/hyperthyroidism).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Have a history of significant concomitant psychiatric, neurological, metabolic,&#xD;
             hepatic, renal, infectious, hematological, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, or&#xD;
             pulmonary illness. If there is a history of such disease but the condition has been&#xD;
             stable for more than one year and is judged by the Investigator not to interfere with&#xD;
             the patient's participation in the study, the patient may be included. Staff will&#xD;
             document such cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Have a history of drug, excluding nicotine or caffeine, or alcohol abuse within 2&#xD;
             years of entry into the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Exhibit abnormalities on physical examination, have abnormal vital signs, or clinical&#xD;
             laboratory values, unless these abnormalities are judged to be clinically&#xD;
             insignificant by the Investigator. Such cases will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Active laxative abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Unable or unwilling to cooperate with the study protocol or considered by the&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. Currently taking Vitamin D supplements&#xD;
&#xD;
