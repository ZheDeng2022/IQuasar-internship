  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking causes cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, cancers and diabetes, and it has been&#xD;
      a leading risk factor for death globally. Despite the availability of smoking cessation&#xD;
      services locally, most smokers do not use such services. Workplace is one of the most&#xD;
      convenient platforms to provide smoking cessation services and over 55% of smokers are&#xD;
      employed according to the local population-based survey. However, the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      smoking cessation programme conducted in workplace is yet to be examined in Hong Kong, and&#xD;
      the attitudes and practices of corporations in promoting smoking cessation are not clear.&#xD;
      Thus, this study aims to examine the employers'/managerial staff's knowledge, attitudes and&#xD;
      practices in promoting smoking cessation in workplace and evaluate the smoking behaviours of&#xD;
      participants before and after attending a smoking cessation intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will separate into two phases. Phase I is a large scale cross-sectional survey to&#xD;
      corporations in Hong Kong to examine the employers' knowledge, attitudes and practices in&#xD;
      promoting smoking cessation in the workplace. Phase II is a randomized controlled trial study&#xD;
      to evaluate the effectiveness of a smoking cessation intervention to assess the subjects'&#xD;
      smoking behaviors, knowledge on smoking and satisfaction of the smoking cessation services.&#xD;
      The investigators are interested to know if the intervention package including health&#xD;
      education,social media and telephone follow-up would trigger higher quit rate or other&#xD;
      changes in smoking behaviors. The investigators will also monitor the smoking status of the&#xD;
      subjects regularly through telephone follow-ups, understand the company's practices about&#xD;
      smoke-free policy as well as evaluate the outcomes of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the study is to measure participated smokers' self-reported 7-day&#xD;
      point prevalence quit rate at 26 weeks follow-ups. The secondary outcomes include&#xD;
      participated smokers' (i) self-reported reduction rate at 52 weeks follow-ups; (ii)&#xD;
      self-reported quit attempt at 26 and 52 weeks follow-ups; (iii) self-reported reduction rate&#xD;
      at 26 and 52 weeks follow-ups; (iv) Engagement in social media intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data of the above outcomes will be collected through telephone interviews (follow-ups) by the&#xD;
      investigators. Descriptive statistics will be used to measure the (1) basic info of the&#xD;
      participants, including the total number of employees and smoking employees; (2) knowledge on&#xD;
      smoking of employers/managerial staff; (3) attitudes on smoking cessation of&#xD;
      employers/managerial staff; (4) practices of the corporations with respect to smoking&#xD;
      cessation. Logistic regression, linear regression and spearman correlation coefficient will&#xD;
      be used to examine the relationships between corporates' policy in smoking cessation and the&#xD;
      knowledge and attitudes of employers/ managerial staff. Chi square and t-test will also be&#xD;
      used to compare the quit rates between groups and logistic regression will be used to predict&#xD;
      quitting. Data will be entered and analyzed using IBM SPSS version 23.&#xD;
