      This pilot randomised controlled trial will directly compare the effect of isometric exercise&#xD;
      to isotonic exercise over a period of 12 weeks for participants with a clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
      Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome (GTPS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain at the side of the hip over or around the greater trochanter of the femur has previously&#xD;
      been termed as Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome (GTPS). Recent research has found that it&#xD;
      is normally due to the gluteal tendons being torn or injured and is often termed as 'gluteal&#xD;
      tendinopathy'. GTPS predominantly affects adults aged 40-60 years and is the second most&#xD;
      common condition affecting the hip region after osteoarthritis. Quality of life scores are&#xD;
      similar to those with advanced hip osteoarthritis but despite its prevalence and disease&#xD;
      burden the most effective treatment for this problem is currently unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous studies have shown that exercise programmes are the most effective treatment for&#xD;
      other lower limb tendon problems, particularly the Achilles and patella. These programmes&#xD;
      typically last a minimum of 12 weeks and are often prescribed by physiotherapists as&#xD;
      first-line treatment. However, there is currently limited evidence to support exercise for&#xD;
      gluteal tendinopathy. The study plans to directly compare two different types of exercise&#xD;
      programmes for those with GTPS for a period of 12 weeks. One group will receive an isometric&#xD;
      exercise programme (where the muscle length does not change) and a second group an isotonic&#xD;
      exercise programme (where the muscle length does change).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure which will be used has recently been validated for patients with&#xD;
      gluteal tendinopathy and measures function and disability. Additional secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures will evaluate aspects relating to quality of life, physical activity and pain. Both&#xD;
      groups will be compared at the start of the study and at different times up to a maximum of&#xD;
      12 weeks to help determine if one exercise programme is better than the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this pilot study will also help to identify whether a larger trial would be&#xD;
      possible in the future.&#xD;
