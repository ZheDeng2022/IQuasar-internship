    <measure>Change in Spleen Volume at Week 24 Compared to Baseline.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Spleen volume was measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or CT scan in participants who were not candidates for MRI or when MRI was not readily available. The MRIs or CTs were read in the central imaging laboratory. Spleen volume was obtained by outlining the circumference of the organ and determining the volume using the technique of least squares. The same method (MRI or CT) was used for a given participant unless a new contraindication to the use of MRI (eg, pacemaker insertion) occurred. A positive value indicates an increase in spleen volume and a negative value indicates a decrease in spleen volume.</description>

        <title>Change in Spleen Volume at Week 24 Compared to Baseline.</title>
        <description>Spleen volume was measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or CT scan in participants who were not candidates for MRI or when MRI was not readily available. The MRIs or CTs were read in the central imaging laboratory. Spleen volume was obtained by outlining the circumference of the organ and determining the volume using the technique of least squares. The same method (MRI or CT) was used for a given participant unless a new contraindication to the use of MRI (eg, pacemaker insertion) occurred. A positive value indicates an increase in spleen volume and a negative value indicates a decrease in spleen volume.</description>

        <description>Spleen volume was measured using magnetic resonance imaging (or CT scan in applicable participants). MRI of the upper and lower abdomen and pelvis was performed, to assess spleen volumes. MRI was performed with a body coil. The MRIs were read in the central imaging laboratory. Spleen volume was obtained by outlining the circumference of the organ and determining the volume using the technique of least squares. MRI was the preferred method for obtaining spleen volume data. The CT scans were processed by the same central laboratory used for MRIs. The same method (MRI or CT) was used for a given participant unless a new contraindication to the use of MRI (eg, pacemaker insertion) occurred.</description>

          <title>Percentage Change From Baseline Through Week 12 and Week 24 on Spleen Length as Measured by Palpation</title>
          <description>Measurement of spleen length below the left costal margin was measured by palpation. Spleen size was determined at every physical examination with the participant in the recumbent (not left decubitus) position. The edge of the spleen was determined by palpation, and measured in centimeters, using a soft ruler, from the costal margin to the point of greatest splenic protrusion. The measurements should be noted and the site at which it was determined listed (eg, anterior axillary line, midclavicular line, and/or subxiphoid). A positive value indicates an increase in spleen volume and a negative value indicates a decrease in spleen volume.</description>

        <description>Symptoms of myelofibrosis were assessed using a modified MFSAF Version 2.0 diary. Using the diary, participants rated the following symptoms on a scale from 0 (absent/as good as it can be) to 10 (worst imaginable/as bad as it can be): itching, night sweats, abdominal discomfort/bloating, early satiety, pain under the ribs on left side and bone/muscle pain. The total symptom score ranged from 0-60 and was calculated as the sum of the 6 symptom scores. A higher score indicates worse symptoms.</description>

        <title>Percentage Change From Baseline Through Week 12 and Week 24 in Total Symptom Score as Measured by the MPN-SAF</title>
        <description>Symptoms are evaluated by the MPN-SAF TSS. The MPN-SAF TSS assessed by the participants themselves and this includes fatigue, concentration, early satiety, inactivity, night sweats, itching, bone pain, abdominal discomfort, weight loss, and fevers. Scoring is from 0 (absent/as good as it can be) to 10 (worst imaginable/as bad as it can be) for each item. The MPN-SAF TSS is the summation of all the individual scores (0-100 scale). A higher score indicates worse symptoms. Note that the mean percentage change can vary in direction from the mean absolute change because percent increases (but not decreases) can exceed 100%.</description>

        <description>AUCtau defined as area under the concentration-time curve over a dosing interval for Itacitinib. The concentrations of itacitinib in plasma were determined using a validated Liquid Chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method with an assay range of 5 to 5000 nM. The PK parameters were calculated using standard noncompartmental analysis in Phoenix WinNonlin® v8.2 (Certara USA Inc., Princeton, NJ). Itacitinib PK data for Cohort A on Week 2 were not available as itacitinib was to be held until the completion of PK sample collection.</description>

        <title>Apparent Oral Dose Clearance (CL/F) of Itacitinib</title>
        <description>Clearance of a drug was measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. The concentrations of itacitinib in plasma were determined using a validated LC/MS/MS method with an assay range of 5 to 5000 nM. The PK parameters were calculated using standard noncompartmental analysis in Phoenix WinNonlin® v8.2 (Certara USA Inc., Princeton, NJ). Data for Cohort A (Itacitinib) on Week 2 was not available as Cohort A, itacitinib was to be held on Week 2 until the completion of the PK sample collection.</description>
