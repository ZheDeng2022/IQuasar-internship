  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the efficacy (the effect on the tumor) and the safety (the effect&#xD;
      on the body) of the study drugs when given as a combination in participants with this type of&#xD;
      cancer. Another purpose of the study is to see which tumor markers (proteins in the blood&#xD;
      that the body produces in response to the cancer) lead to better results in participants&#xD;
      treated with the study drugs. Nivolumab and ipilimumab are antibodies, which are human&#xD;
      proteins that recognize and attach to a part of the tumor and/or body's immune cells. They&#xD;
      work in slightly different ways to activate the immune system and help the body's immune&#xD;
      system to work against tumor cells. Nivolumab and ipilimumab are investigational because they&#xD;
      are not approved by the FDA to be used for the type of cancer being studied.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess median progression-free survival rate (PFSR) as well as PFSR at 6 and 12 months&#xD;
      in patients with recurrent or metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) treated with a&#xD;
      combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the efficacy of nivolumab and ipilimumab according to response rate (RR),&#xD;
      disease control rate (DCR; complete response [CR], partial response [PR], and stable disease&#xD;
      [SD] at 6 and 12 months), overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) using&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria in patients with recurrent or&#xD;
      metastatic ACC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the efficacy of nivolumab and ipilimumab according to overall response rate&#xD;
      (ORR), DCR, progression free survival (PFS), and OS in patients with recurrent or metastatic&#xD;
      ACC using immune-related response criteria (irRC) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the safety and tolerability profile of nivolumab and ipilimumab therapy in&#xD;
      patients with recurrent or metastatic ACC using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse&#xD;
      Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess safety, tolerability and activity of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in non-ACC malignant&#xD;
      salivary gland tumors (MSGT's) using clinical benefit rate (CBR), ORR, PFS, OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the predictive value of genomic aberrations observed upon comprehensive genomic&#xD;
      profiling of the tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) derived from archival tumor tissue, if&#xD;
      available, or blood from patients with recurrent or metastatic ACC and non-ACC MSGTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Circulating cell free DNA genomic profiling will also be performed at baseline and&#xD;
      during treatment with each imaging to explore the genomic landscape of clonal evolution that&#xD;
      may elucidate mechanisms behind response or resistance with immunotherapy in adenoid cystic&#xD;
      carcinoma and non-ACC MSGTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Correlation between expression of PD-L1 and response to treatment will be explored in all&#xD;
      patients enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Correlations between other markers of inflammatory/immune signature will be performed that&#xD;
      may include but not be limited to PD-1, OX40, CD73, CD39, T cell immunoglobulin and mucin&#xD;
      domain containing protein 3 (TIM3), GITRL, CTLA-4, CD3, CD4, CD8, protein tyrosine&#xD;
      phosphatase receptor type C (CD45RO), forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), and granzyme by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry analysis and/or flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 15, 29, 43, 57, and&#xD;
      71 of course 1 and on days 1 and 15 of course 2, over 60 minutes on days 29 and 57 of course&#xD;
      2 and on days 1, 29, and 57 of subsequent courses. Patients also receive ipilimumab over 90&#xD;
      minutes on days 1 and 43. Courses repeat every 84 days in the absence of disease progression,&#xD;
      unexpected toxicity, or withdrawal of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, every 4 weeks for&#xD;
      12 weeks, and then every 12 weeks for up to 2 years.&#xD;
