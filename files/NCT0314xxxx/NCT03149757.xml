      YouTHrive (YT) is a two-arm randomized control trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of an adapted&#xD;
      version of the Thrive With Me (TWM) intervention for youth living with HIV (YLWH). In the&#xD;
      RCT, intervention participants will have access to the full YouTHrive (YT) website- a&#xD;
      mobile-enhanced private social networking website aimed at improving medication adherence for&#xD;
      YLWH. The investigators will enroll up to 60 YLWH for formative work on YT, and 300 YLWH&#xD;
      (15-24 years old) of all genders living in eight cities and randomize them to either the&#xD;
      intervention condition or control condition. Assessments will be collected at baseline and&#xD;
      5-month follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Youth between the ages of 13 and 24 accounted for 22% of all new HIV infections in 2015. Less&#xD;
      than half (44%) of youth living with HIV (YLWH) in the US are estimated to be virally&#xD;
      suppressed, which is a well recognized critical factor in individual health and&#xD;
      non-infectiousness. Given the high demands of social identity development during adolescence&#xD;
      and early adulthood, as well as the increasing use of social media as important and&#xD;
      influential communication channels, there is an ongoing need for innovative programs that&#xD;
      leverage current communication channels to foster social support for ART adherence behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators developed a program first called Thrive With Me (TWM) as an intervention&#xD;
      that leverages enhanced peer-to-peer interaction, ART adherence reminders and&#xD;
      self-monitoring, and ART and HIV informational content to improve ART adherence. Given&#xD;
      youth's broad acceptance and adoption of many of the components of the TWM intervention, and&#xD;
      the critical need for novel and scalable ART adherence interventions for this population, we&#xD;
      have adapted TWM for a younger audience and all genders in a program called YouTHrive (YT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus groups will provide insights into what features and functions of the current TWM study&#xD;
      youth like and dislike to assist intervention adaptation. The investigators will conduct&#xD;
      focus groups in three cities (Houston, Bronx, and Chicago) and will recruit up to 16 YLWH per&#xD;
      city, and use the results to develop the YT intervention. Ahead of the RCT, the investigators&#xD;
      will conduct usability testing on YT to gain feedback about the developed intervention. The&#xD;
      investigators will recruit 12 YLWH in six cities to use the intervention for a two-week&#xD;
      period for usability testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomized controlled efficacy trial will compare YT (N=150) to a control group (N=150).&#xD;
      YLWH in the control arm will receive weekly static information-only emails, compared to daily&#xD;
      use of the dynamic YT social network site for the intervention group. Participants will be&#xD;
      recruited from eight cities: Atlanta, New York, Chapel Hill, Charlotte, Chicago, Houston,&#xD;
      Philadelphia, and Tampa. Assessments will be collected at baseline and 5-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: In a 2-arm RCT (n=300), assess the efficacy of YouTHrive(YT) to promote&#xD;
      higher treatment success at month 5 among YLWH, compared to an HIV information-only control&#xD;
      condition, as defined by higher self-reported ART adherence (primary), higher percent&#xD;
      suppressed viral load (secondary), and higher HIV care attendance (secondary).&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Participants in the YT intervention arm than in the information-only control arm will&#xD;
      report higher ART adherence at the 5-month follow-up time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: A higher proportion of participants in the YT intervention arm than in the&#xD;
      information-only control arm will have suppressed viral load at the 5-month follow-up time&#xD;
      point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3: Participants in the YT intervention arm than in the information-only control arm will&#xD;
      report higher HIV care attendance at the 5-month follow-up time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H4: A higher proportion of participants in the YT intervention arm than in the&#xD;
      information-only control arm will demonstrate treatment success on a composite variable of&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective 1: Assess whether YT has more HIV treatment benefits for substance-using&#xD;
      than non-substance-using YLWH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H5: Among YLWH in the YT intervention arm, a higher proportion of substance-using&#xD;
      participants will demonstrate improvement on primary and secondary outcomes, and a composite&#xD;
      variable of these outcomes, at the 5-month follow-up time point compared to&#xD;
      non-substance-using participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective 2: Examine whether YT has positive impacts on mental health and social&#xD;
      support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H6: Participants in the YT intervention arm will report lower depression and anxiety and&#xD;
      higher social support at the 5-month follow-up time point compared to those in an&#xD;
      information-only control arm.&#xD;

    <description>The YT website is a mobile-enhanced private social networking website. Participants on the site are anonymous and choose alternate usernames and personalized profile features for a new online identity within YT. The investigators designed YouTHrive to encourage social support, reduce isolation, improve HIV medication adherence, and promote general well being. The study involves rolling recruitment so that new members are continuously entering the intervention. Participants use YT for five months before &quot;graduating&quot; from the program. The core components of YT are: 1) peer-to-peer interaction in a shared feed; 2) daily monitoring of HIV medication adherence and real-time mood; 3) daily mixed-media content with strategies to improve medication adherence' and 4) goal setting and monitoring.</description>

    <ipd_description>The investigators will assure the timely release and sharing of data two years after the publication of the main trial findings from the final dataset. Study variables will be available; however, the investigators will protect the rights and privacy of human subjects by redacting all identifiers from the data set. The de-identified data from this project will be available through individual requests directed to the Principal Investigator.</ipd_description>
