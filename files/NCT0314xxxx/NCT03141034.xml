  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that this combination regimen of irinotecan plus ramucirumab&#xD;
      administered as second line treatment will be tolerated and lead to improved outcomes similar&#xD;
      to paclitaxel plus ramucirumab in patients with advanced gastric and gastro-esophageal&#xD;
      junction (GEJ) cancers. This study proposes a phase II clinical trial with irinotecan plus&#xD;
      ramucirumab for treatment of patients with metastatic gastric and GEJ adenocarcinoma who have&#xD;
      progressed after first line chemotherapy. To the knowledge of the investigators, this regimen&#xD;
      has not been previously administered to this patient population, so safety and tolerability&#xD;
      will be monitored and reported.&#xD;

    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 months from completion of treatment (estimated to be 36 months)</time_frame>
    <description>-PFS will be measured from date of study entry to first radiographic progression or death due to any cause. Radiographic progressive disease (PD) will be defined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1 (RECIST v1.1). For those who are alive and do not experience progression, the investigators will censor them at the time of loss to follow-up (very few) or at 30 months from the study entry, whichever comes first.</description>

    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 months from completion of treatment (estimated to be 36 months)</time_frame>
    <description>-OS time will be measured from date of study entry to date of death from any cause. For those who are alive, the investigators will censor them at the time of loss to follow-up (very few) or at 30 months from the date of treatment discontinuation, whichever comes first.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to progressive disease (TTP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 months from completion of treatment (estimated to be 36 months)</time_frame>
    <description>-TTP is defined as the time from study entry until date of radiographic PD using RECIST v1.1 criteria. For those who are alive and do not experience progression, the investigators will censor them at the time of loss to follow-up (very few) or at 30 months from the study entry, whichever comes first. For those who are dead before progression, the investigators will consider death as the competing risk. If the number of death are very small, the investigators will censor them at time of death.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Best overall response (BOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to end of treatment (estimated to be 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>-BOR is defined as the best response across all time points from randomization until radiologically confirmed PD using RECIST, v1.1 criteria. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm and normalization of tumor marker level of non-target lesions. PR is defined as having a ≥30% decrease in sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions. PD was defined as having a ≥20% increase in sum of LD of target lesions and ≥5 mm increase above nadir. SD was defined as small changes that did not meet above criteria.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective response rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to end of treatment (estimated to be 6 months)</time_frame>

             325 mg/day) is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has elective or planned major surgery to be performed during the course of&#xD;
             the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;

             intestinal resection (hemicolectomy or extensive small intestine resection with&#xD;

             infection, metabolic disorders or other nonmalignant organ or systemic disease or&#xD;
             secondary effects of cancer that induce a high medical risk and make assessment of&#xD;
             survival uncertain, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV-positivity on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the potential&#xD;
             for pharmacokinetic interactions with ramucirumab and irinotecan. In addition, these&#xD;
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
