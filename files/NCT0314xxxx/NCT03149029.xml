  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination of drugs as a possible treatment for&#xD;
      unresectable or metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab (Keytruda)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trametinib (Mekinist)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dabrafenib (Tafinlar)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the&#xD;
           safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in&#xD;
           treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved pembrolizumab, dabrafenib,&#xD;
           and trametinib for this specific disease but the combination of all three has not been&#xD;
           approved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study is being conducted to document whether trametinib with or without dabrafenib&#xD;
           taken for brief period of time prior to and with pembrolizumab works better than the&#xD;
           investigators expect pembrolizumab to work in participants with unresectable and/or&#xD;
           metastatic melanoma. All three of these drugs are FDA-approved for unresectable and/or&#xD;
           metastatic melanoma; however, they are not FDA-approved for use all together.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pembrolizumab is a type of antibody that inhibits the cancer cell growth. An&#xD;
                antibody is a cell that attaches to other cells to fight off infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Trametinib is a cell inhibitor that binds to the cancer cells to inhibit the cancer&#xD;
                cells' signals to decrease cell growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Dabrafenib is also a cell inhibitor and works by stopping the cancer cell from&#xD;
                duplicating.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have histologically confirmed metastatic or unresectable melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥&#xD;
             20 mm with conventional techniques or as ≥10 mm with spiral CT scan. See section 11&#xD;
             for the evaluation of measureable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants may have previously received ipilimumab, adjuvant anti-PD1 therapy, or&#xD;
             high-dose IL-2. They may not have previously been treated with BRAF inhibitors&#xD;
             (vemurafenib, dabrafenib, encorafenib), MEK inhibitors (selumetinib, trametinib,&#xD;
             binimetinib, cobimetinib), and/or anti-PD1/PDL1 monoclonal antibodies for metastatic&#xD;
             or unresectable disease. Participants must allow 2 weeks between prior chemotherapy&#xD;
             targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy prior to study Day 1 or recovery&#xD;
             (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered&#xD;
             agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and&#xD;
                  may qualify for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from&#xD;
                  the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are&#xD;
             currently available on the use of the combination of trametinib with or without&#xD;
             dabrafenib, and pembrolizumab in participants less than 18 years of age, children are&#xD;
             excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X institutional upper limits of normal; total bilirubin &gt;&#xD;
                  1.5X above institutional upper limits of normal will be allowed if direct&#xD;
                  bilirubin is within normal limits or if patients has a documented history of&#xD;
                  Gilbert's disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits or creatinine clearance ≥ 60&#xD;
                  mL/min/1.73 m2 for subjects with creatinine levels about institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have BRAFV600-mutation status known.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have disease amenable to and be willing to undergo serial core or&#xD;
             excisional biopsies of a tumor lesion(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because both dabrafenib and trametinib are class D agents with the potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
             of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with either&#xD;
             dabrafenib and trametinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is&#xD;
             treated with either dabrafenib, trametinib, or the combination of dabrafenib and&#xD;
             trametinib. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2&#xD;
             methods of birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual&#xD;
             activity for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
             medication. Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically&#xD;
             sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year. Should a woman become&#xD;
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this&#xD;
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Male subjects should&#xD;
             agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study&#xD;
             therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants treated with prior chemotherapy, or radiation therapy within 2 weeks&#xD;
             prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from&#xD;
             adverse events due to a previously administered agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and&#xD;
                  may qualify for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from&#xD;
                  the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants previously treated with BRAF inhibitors (vemurafenib, dabrafenib,&#xD;
             encorafenib), MEK inhibitors (selumetinib, trametinib, binimetinib, cobimetinib),&#xD;
             and/or anti-PD1/PDL1 monoclonal antibodies for metastatic or unresectable disease. Any&#xD;
             other prior therapy will be allowed (including ipilimumab, adjuvant anti-PD1 therapy,&#xD;
             high-dose IL-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with symptomatic brain metastases will be excluded from this clinical&#xD;
             trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive&#xD;
             neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other&#xD;
             adverse events. Subjects with asymptomatic, stable brain metastases and/or who have&#xD;
             been previously treated for these conditions that are asymptomatic in the absence of&#xD;
             corticosteroid therapy are allowed to enroll. Brain metastasis must be stable with&#xD;
             verification by imaging (brain MRI completed at screening demonstrating no current&#xD;
             evidence of progressive brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study&#xD;
             Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events&#xD;
             due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other anti-neoplastic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any&#xD;
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because both dabrafenib and trametinib are&#xD;
             class D agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because&#xD;
             there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary&#xD;
             to treatment of the mother with either dabrafenib and trametinib, breastfeeding should&#xD;
             be discontinued if the mother is treated with either dabrafenib, trametinib, or the&#xD;
             combination of dabrafenib and trametinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants known to be HIV-positive and on combination antiretroviral therapy are&#xD;
             ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with either&#xD;
             dabrafenib or trametinib. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current/active&#xD;
             pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Visible retinal pathology as assessed by ophthalmic exam that is considered a risk&#xD;
             factor for RVO or RPED such as evidence of new optic disc cupping, evidence of visual&#xD;
             field defects, and intraocular pressure &gt;21 mm Hg.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;

                  may interfere with the conduct of the study or interpretation of study results&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
                  requirements&#xD;
&#xD;

             following circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible if they have been&#xD;
                  disease-free for at least 3 years and are deemed by the investigator to be at low&#xD;
                  risk for recurrence of that malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Individuals with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated&#xD;
