  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder associated with significant impairments in&#xD;
      affective, cognitive and social functioning. Consequently, a special interest in the&#xD;
      prevention of schizophrenia and psychotic disorders has emerged. Pharmacological as well as&#xD;
      psychological interventions show promising preventive effects. The purpose of this&#xD;
      multicentric study is the investigation of possible preventive effects of a treatment&#xD;
      combination containing a psychotherapy form and medication (N-Acetylcytein - NAC) in&#xD;
      individuals with an enhanced risk for developing schizophrenia. Both treatment forms may&#xD;
      reduce the risk in this population due to their specific properties: The psychotherapy can&#xD;
      improve social skills, whereas NAC is supposed to develop its protective effects on neuronal&#xD;
      level due to its antiinflammatory properties. The investigators will examine the preventive&#xD;
      effects by measuring transition rates to psychosis after treatment as well as improvements in&#xD;
      social, affective and cognitive functioning.&#xD;

      Psychotic disorders are among the most expensive brain-related disorders in Europe. This is&#xD;
      mainly due to their onset early in life and their long-term disabling courses. Current&#xD;
      treatments fail to improve most influential factors such as social-cognitive deficits.&#xD;
      Prevention is recognized as one of the key strategies to fight these deteriorating outcomes&#xD;
      and is expected to significantly reduce both, the societal costs as well as the immense&#xD;
      burden for the patients and for their families. Recent meta-analyses indicate promising&#xD;
      preventive effects of both pharmacological and cognitive-behavioural interventions. Yet,&#xD;
      reported transition rates are still too high. Clinical evidence suggests that disturbances of&#xD;
      social functioning predict conversion to psychosis. Neurobiological evidence implicates&#xD;
      glutamatergic dysfunction and redox imbalance in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that interventions targeting (i) social functioning and (ii)&#xD;
      glutamatergic / oxidative pathways already in at-risk states would significantly reduce&#xD;
      transition rates. To test these hypotheses, our study is designed as a randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, 18-month trial (six months of intervention plus 12 months of follow-up),&#xD;
      involving 200 subjects at-risk for psychosis. Specifically, the investigators will compare&#xD;
      the preventive effects of a cognitive-behavioural and social-cognitive intervention to a&#xD;
      pharmacological intervention (IPPI) with Acetylcysteine, a drug with a proglutamatergic,&#xD;
      neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory profile in a 2x2 factorial design. The results of our&#xD;
      planned study are expected to provide new and well tolerated interventions, thus hopefully&#xD;
      helping to achieve the major goal of individualized prevention, and, consequently, lower the&#xD;
      individual and societal burden of psychosis.&#xD;
