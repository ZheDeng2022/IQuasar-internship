  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this protocol is to expand access for patients who lack a fully HLA&#xD;
      (Human leukocyte antigen) matched sibling donor, and who are candidates for allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). These patients have a serious or immediately&#xD;
      life-threatening disease for which HSCT is indicated. These patients are not eligible for&#xD;
      other Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocols&#xD;
      that utilize CliniMACs technology for T depletion.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Only 25-30% of patients who may benefit from HSCT have a matched related donor. An unrelated&#xD;
      cord blood may not be available due to size or matching criteria, or if a reduced intensity&#xD;
      regiment is recommended. The risk of severe graft vs. host disease (GVHD) and other&#xD;
      complications is higher with unrelated donors, or partially matched related donors. At the&#xD;
      Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) there is extensive experience using mismatched&#xD;
      unrelated donors or partially matched related donors with complete or partial T depletion to&#xD;
      reduce the risk of severe GVHD.&#xD;

    <description>Stem cells will be processed using the CliniMACS device for alpha/beta and CD19+ T cell depletion. Processing of cells using the CliniMACS will occur in accordance with the Investigator Brochure and Technical Manual following the laboratory standard operating procedures (SOPs) and using aseptic technique.</description>

        PATIENT AND DONOR ELIGIBILITY&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who lack an HLA matched sibling and who are candidates for allogeneic&#xD;
        hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) but do not meet criteria for current open&#xD;
        institutional protocols using ClinMACs device for Î² T/CD19+ depletion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with the following transplantable diseases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Non-malignant diseases:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metabolic storage diseases correctable by HSCT&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bone marrow failure syndromes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immunodeficiencies/immune dysregulation syndromes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sickle cell disease with severe central nervous system (CNS) vasculopathy&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Lymphomas&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Myelodyplastic syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
        Organ function criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        It is important to note that the conditioning prescribed to the patient will be determined&#xD;
        based on the disease and organ status and will be regimens considered standard. Appropriate&#xD;
        combinations of chemotherapy, immunotherapy and/or radiation will be determined on an&#xD;
        individual basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient eligibility will be assessed as per our institutional standard operating&#xD;
        procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lansky or Karnofsky performance &gt;60&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Renal function: will be determined based on serum creatinine as per our Institutional&#xD;
             SOP&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hepatic: Transaminases will be assessed as per current institutional SOP&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiac shortening fraction &gt;27% as per institutional SOP&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilirubin &lt;2.5x normal (unless elevation due to Gilberts disease) as per Institutional&#xD;
             SOP&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Unrelated donor that meets the matching criteria of the NMDP: Unrelated donors that&#xD;
