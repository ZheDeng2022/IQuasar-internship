      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, patients suspected of having prostate cancer undergo ultrasound-guided systematic&#xD;
      biopsies of the prostate. However, up to a quarter of clinically significant tumors, which&#xD;
      may pose a risk to patient's well-being, may be missed on random biopsies. MRI enables&#xD;
      detection of further tumors in this patient population, but also has limited accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that hybrid PET-MRI, a novel scanner which incorporates MRI with molecular&#xD;
      imaging will improve the detection rate of clinically significant tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective trial, we will recruit 57 men who are suspected of having prostate cancer&#xD;
      but have had negative systematic biopsies, who have been diagnosed with low-risk disease but&#xD;
      have clinically signs of more aggressive tumor or who have a focal tumor detected and are&#xD;
      candidates for minimally-invasive tumor ablation (=tumor destruction with laser or ultrasound&#xD;
      waves), in whom it is crucial to exclude other tumor sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo PET/MRI after injection of a radiopharmaceutical called&#xD;
      &quot;18F-DCFPyL&quot;. This is a radioactive probe which has been shown in preliminary studies to be&#xD;
      sensitive and specific for detection of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All lesions detected on PET/MRI will undergo biopsy under ultrasound using fused PET/MRI and&#xD;
      ultrasound images for guidance, and compared to histopathology. The primary outcome measure&#xD;
      in this study is the proportion of clinically significant prostate cancers that are detected&#xD;
      with PET/MRI compared to MRI alone. Improved detection of clinically significant prostate&#xD;
      cancer may enable a tailored, personalized therapeutic approach, decreasing morbidity and&#xD;
      potentially improving overall patient outcome.&#xD;

      Prostate cancer overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate cancer (PCa) is the 3rd leading cause of death from cancer in men and constitutes&#xD;
      almost 1/4 of all new cancer cancers in men. Although PCa is prevalent, the risk of clinical&#xD;
      or fatal PCa in a 50 year old man is estimated at only 10% and 3%, respectively Currently,&#xD;
      over 2/3 of men diagnosed with PCa are diagnosed with organ confined, low risk disease (PSA &lt;&#xD;
      10 ng/ml, Gleason score (=GS) 3+3, cT1c). Management is depending on tumor grade, size and&#xD;
      stage and clinical parameters (e.g. life expectancy) and may range from active surveillance&#xD;
      to radical therapy including definitive whole gland treatment (radical prostatectomy (RP), or&#xD;
      radiotherapy). Although radical whole gland therapy is effective from an oncological&#xD;
      standpoint, it may be associated with significant side effects. A more conservative approach&#xD;
      in select patients may be enrollment in an active surveillance program. The concept behind&#xD;
      this approach is that small volume, low grade PCa may have an indolent course and may not&#xD;
      progress to biological significance in the absence of treatment in the patient's lifetime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional workup of patients with clinical suspicion of PCa:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsies: Current workup of patients with clinical&#xD;
      suspicion of PCa includes TRUS-guided systematic biopsies. These are associated with a&#xD;
      relatively high false negative rate, especially for areas difficult to access for biopsy,&#xD;
      with csPCa missed in approximately 1 of 4 patients. Furthermore, there is only Ëœ50%&#xD;
      correlation between biopsy obtained GS and final pathology at RP, with upgrading in more than&#xD;
      1 in 3 cases. This may lead to inaccurate risk stratification and inappropriate selection of&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Role of multiparametric-MR &amp; MR-Ultrasound Fusion Biopsy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, multiparametric MR (mpMR) has been incorporated in the workup of patients&#xD;
      with suspected PCa. T2- weighted imaging (T2WI) in combination with diffusion-weighted&#xD;
      imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MR have shown promise in the detection,&#xD;
      local staging and risk stratification of PCa, with a reported sensitivity and specificity of&#xD;
      0.74 &amp; 0.88, respectively. Prostate MR is interpreted using a 5-point scoring scale (PI-RADS&#xD;
      - Prostate Imaging and Reporting Archiving Data System), with an overall sensitivity &amp;&#xD;
      specificity of 77.0% &amp; 71.4%, respectively, for detection of csPCa using PI-RADS-v2. Using&#xD;
      MR-US fusion targeted biopsy for mpMR detected lesions improves detection of csPCa compared&#xD;
      to standard biopsy (median: 9.1%) and improves correlation of biopsy-derived and surgical&#xD;
      tumor grade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focal ablation therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, trials have evaluated various focal ablative therapies (FT) as alternative&#xD;
      management for select patients with low/ intermediate risk, organ-confined disease. FT for&#xD;
      PCa involves varying degrees of predefined subtotal glandular ablation using a myriad of&#xD;
      ablative energy sources e.g high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), or laser ablation. The&#xD;
      common aim of all of these methods is curative-intent tumor ablation while minimizing&#xD;
      morbidity, thereby potentially providing the best balance between oncologic control and side&#xD;
      effects of radical therapy. FT relies on the notion that the index lesion can be identified&#xD;
      by mpMRI, and localized for intervention. Although no long term data exists on the safety and&#xD;
      oncologic outcome of FT, FT appears well-tolerated and associated with significantly less&#xD;
      morbidity than whole-gland treatment. At our institution, in-bore focal laser ablation&#xD;
      program (MRgFLT) allows patients with a single site of csPCa to be treated while the in-bore&#xD;
      HIFU program allows inclusion of patients with up to 2 sites of csPCa confirmed on MR-TRUS&#xD;
      fusion biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the main risks with a strategy of FT in PCa is selection failure. Although data is&#xD;
      scarce, residual or unrecognized cancer was detected on follow-up biopsy in 22-50% of&#xD;
      patients from two separate small series, including cancers in portions of the prostate not&#xD;
      appreciated prior to intervention. Although it is uncertain how many of these are csPCa, this&#xD;
      highlights the potential limitations of current workup algorithms for patients considered for&#xD;
      FT. As only recognized index tumor site is targeted, detection of any further site of csPCa&#xD;
      is paramount for appropriate patient selection and therapy success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular imaging in PCa:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are shortcomings of current workup of patients with clinical suspicion of PCa,&#xD;
      including significant false negative rate of TRUS-biopsies and mpMR. At least 1 in 5 patients&#xD;
      in active surveillance program thought to have low-risk disease based on biopsies, turns out&#xD;
      to have unfavorable features on surgical pathology. As specific patient management is based&#xD;
      on accurate risk stratification, there is a clinical need for further tools to improve&#xD;
      identification and characterization of csPCa. There has been increasing interest in molecular&#xD;
      imaging in PCa in recent years. The most common radiopharmaceuticals used include choline&#xD;
      (11C-Choline/ 18F-Fluorocholine) and 68Ga-PSMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PSMA, a type II transmembrane protein, is expressed in normal prostate epithelium and highly&#xD;
      expressed in ~90% primary PCa and metastases. 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC, the most common PSMA PET&#xD;
      radiopharmaceutical assessed to date, has shown high sensitivity in detecting recurrent&#xD;
      disease. Recently developed 18F-labelled PSMA compounds (e.g. 18F-DCFPyL) offer several&#xD;
      technical advantages over 68Ga including high imaging statistic and higher image resolution.&#xD;
      Initial preclinical studies have shown favorable tissue binding and the first clinical&#xD;
      investigation in 9 patients has shown very high levels of uptake in primary tumors and&#xD;
      metastases with further pilot data suggesting additional metastases identified in &gt;20% of&#xD;
      patients compared to 68Ga-PSMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently introduced hybrid PET/MR scanners allow simultaneous acquisition of MR &amp; PET data,&#xD;
      incorporation the advantages of MR and molecular imaging. Emerging data is showing PET/MR to&#xD;
      be potentially robust for assessment of oncology indications, particularly those that are&#xD;
      better addressed with MR such as PCa. A recently published trial on 68Ga-PSMA PET/MR in&#xD;
      intermediate-high risk patients has shown that mpMR, PET and PET/MR had a sensitivity of 66%,&#xD;
      92% and 98%, respectively in localizing Pca. PSMA-PET may also help characterize equivocal&#xD;
      lesions on mpMR (PI-RAD v.2 score 3) and may facilitate targeted fusion biopsies of lesions&#xD;
      not seen on MR.&#xD;
