  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-treatment study. It will not involve the use of any investigational drug or&#xD;
      device. Potential participants will be enrolled through direct contact with collaborating&#xD;
      clinical sites when the patient's annual 3D mammogram report yields a BIRADS rating of 4-5.&#xD;
      The clinical Investigators or a member of their staff will conduct consent discussion once a&#xD;
      suspicious mammogram report is identified or if a patient is referred for imaging of a&#xD;
      suspicious area in the breast. After consenting the participant will be asked to donate a&#xD;
      blood sample, a saliva sample, medical records pertaining to the suspicious mammogram report&#xD;
      and a medical history questionnaire. The participants will be followed after one year to&#xD;
      capture progression or resolution of their suspicious mammogram report. After a biopsy&#xD;
      confirms the diagnosis of cancer or benign lesion, a recut sample of the tissue may be&#xD;
      requested for research.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality in women worldwide. According to&#xD;
      estimates, approximately 46,000 women in the United States, and 130,000 women in the European&#xD;
      Union, die due to breast cancer yearly. Early detection is of paramount importance in&#xD;
      reducing mortality from this major public health burden. Screening mammography has been shown&#xD;
      to reduce breast cancer mortality by 20% to 35% in women aged 40 to 69 years. Detection of&#xD;
      small volume breast cancer at early stages is associated with a 10-year disease-free survival&#xD;
      rate as high as 98% in patients with pT1a,bN0M0 tumors (measuring 1 cm or less, with&#xD;
      disease-free axillary lymph nodes and no distant metastasis). The assumption that early&#xD;
      diagnosis will lead to improved treatment outcomes has driven the search for diagnostic&#xD;
      biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite this enthusiasm, a biomarker for stage I breast cancer has been elusive. The&#xD;
      predictive value of mammography declines in cohorts of patients with denser breast tissue and&#xD;
      smaller lesions, and recent studies have indicated that the small amount of biomarker&#xD;
      molecules emanating from a breast tumor of less than 1 cm is well below the sensitivity of&#xD;
      detection for current analytical methods. In addition, biomarkers in body fluids are highly&#xD;
      perishable. Biomarkers break down during collection, transport and storage due to endogenous&#xD;
      degradative enzymes yielding false negatives. Thus there is a significant need for new&#xD;
      technologies that will a) identify and measure low abundance biomarkers (less than 1&#xD;
      nanogram/mL), and b) is low cost and can be seamlessly integrated into the clinical workflow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to a) experimentally discover putative plasma markers for&#xD;
      detecting early, stage I breast cancer in the setting of a suspicious mammogram and&#xD;
      distinguish those cancers from benign lesions b) verify the putative markers through&#xD;
      molecular profiling; and c) validate the markers by mass spectrometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine percent accuracy of breast cancer diagnosis in the context of 3D&#xD;
           mammographically (screen detected) tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine percent precision of cancer diagnosis in the context of 3D mammographically&#xD;
           (screen detected) tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Discover additional protein markers of early stage breast cancer that distinguish these&#xD;
           tumors from benign lesions identified by mammography by comparing protein markers&#xD;
           between patients with invasive cancer vs. benign tumors as determined by biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Additionally compare protein markers between patients with invasive cancer and&#xD;
           pre-invasive neoplasms as determined by biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Bank samples for future research and sequencing.&#xD;

        All participants will be enrolled through direct contact with collaborating clinical sites.&#xD;
        In the first phase this study will strive to enroll 150 participants who are identified as&#xD;
        having a suspicious mammogram. Review of the data for the first set of 150 patients&#xD;
        revealed a set of biomarkers discovered and evaluated blindly that showed a strong&#xD;
        statistical correlation with cancer versus non cancer in the final pathologic diagnosis.&#xD;
        Based on this success, a decision is made by the PI to extend the study to enroll an&#xD;
        additional 120 patients.&#xD;
