      This study is designed as an experimental trial which collect prospective data at Mahidol&#xD;
      university. It aims to characterize the responses of Thai pediatric population,age 1 - 6&#xD;
      years, to oxycodone oral syrup and its metabolites (oxymorphone, noroxymorphone and&#xD;
      noroxycodone) with specific respect to the pharmacogenomics (How drug affects patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 20 generally healthy, opioid-naive children, aged 1-6 years, scheduled as&#xD;
      in-patient surgery for non-emergency surgery, non-gastrointestinal tract surgery are&#xD;
      involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are divide into 2 groups (1) 10 patients in 12 months - 1.9 years, and (2) 10&#xD;
      patients in the 2 - 5.9 years age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every patient will receive inhalational or intravenous induction of anesthesia as decided by&#xD;
      the anesthesia team on the day of surgery, as is routine clinical care. An intravenous&#xD;
      cannula (IV) will be inserted in every patient as part of their routine clinical care. No&#xD;
      additional intravenous line will be required for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the study protocol, a blood sample (5 mL) will be taken from the IV and sent for&#xD;
      genetic analysis. (However, in order to limit the amount of blood drawn from small babies, 3&#xD;
      ml will be drawn, not 5 ml, if the patient is less than 6 months or less than 10kg.) The&#xD;
      genetic testing is specifically to analyze the following genotypes only: CYP2D6 and CYP3A4,&#xD;
      which represent the differences in cytochrome P450 metabolism of oxycodone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An orogastric tube will be placed in the stomach under anesthesia as is part of standard&#xD;
      routine clinical care to remove gastric contents. The same orogastric tube will be used for&#xD;
      intragastric liquid oxycodone administration in a dose of 0.1 mg/kg before the surgical&#xD;
      incision. This weight-adjusted dose of 0.1 mg/kg is administered as per standard clinical&#xD;
      dosing guidelines. 10 blood samples (51mL/sample) will be taken from the IV and sent for&#xD;
      drug-level analysis. A total of 11 blood samples will be drawn for the study. The first&#xD;
      sample will be sent for genetic testing. The other 10 samples will be drawn at the following&#xD;
      time points: 30 minutes, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours post-dose in every patient and the&#xD;
      other 2 samples anytime between 6 and 24 hours post-dose .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxycodone, oxymorphone, noroxymorphone and noroxycodone levels, at 10 time points, will be&#xD;
      used to determine the individual responses to oxycodone. CYP2D6 genotype will be determined&#xD;
      to identify the ultra-rapid metabolizers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oxycodone is the most commonly used analgesic for the management of moderate and severe&#xD;
      postoperative pain. The efficacy of Oxycodone as a potent opioid has been confirmed in&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal metabolic pathway of oxycodone in humans is N-demethylation via enzyme CYP3A4&#xD;
      to generate inactive noroxycodone. A smaller amount (approximately 11%) is O-demethylated by&#xD;
      cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6 to become oxymorphone, the active and potent metabolite which&#xD;
      exhibits about 40 times the affinity and 8 times the potency on Î¼-opioid receptors compared&#xD;
      to the mother substance. Approximate frequencies of cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6 phenotypes&#xD;
      for the Caucasian population are: poor metabolizers 5 - 10%, extensive/intermediate&#xD;
      metabolizers 65-90%, and ultra-rapid metabolizers 5 - 10%. Kirchheiner and colleagues noticed&#xD;
      more codeine-related sedative side-effects in ultra-rapid metabolizers. In studies&#xD;
      investigating extensive and poor metabolizers, codeine side-effects do not seem to be related&#xD;
      to CYP2D6 genotype. However, clinical investigations of CYP2D6 genotype in the postoperative&#xD;
      pain setting have shown conflicting results, and well-designed prospective studies are&#xD;
      lacking. Taken together, these results demonstrate the need for careful pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      studies in children who received a pharmacologic agent, such as oxycodone, which is&#xD;
      metabolized by the enzyme CYP2D6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population PK of oxycodone and its metabolites has not been fully established for oral&#xD;
      oxycodone in pediatric patients. In addition, there is a group of ultra-rapid metabolizers&#xD;
      (approximately 4.5% of the population, but as high as 20% in some particular ethnic groups;&#xD;
      East African and Saudi Arabian populations) which may be at risk for serious side effects in&#xD;
      the commonly prescribed dose (which is extrapolated from adult recommendations). It is&#xD;
      important to further investigate oral oxycodone to optimize dosing recommendations.&#xD;
