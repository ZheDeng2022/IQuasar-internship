      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of the&#xD;
      anti-tuberculosis (TB) drug delamanid (DLM) in combination with an optimized multidrug&#xD;
      background regimen (OBR) for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in HIV-infected and&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of&#xD;
      the anti-TB drug DLM in combination with OBR for MDR-TB in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected&#xD;
      children with MDR-TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled in one of four age cohorts: 12 to less than 18 years, 6 to less&#xD;
      than 12 years, 3 to less than 6 years, or 0 to less than 3 years. All participants will&#xD;
      receive DLM dosed according to their age group and weight for 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits will occur at study entry; Weeks 2 and 4; every 4 weeks through Week 40; and at&#xD;
      Weeks 48, 60, 72, and 96. Visits may include physical examinations; blood, urine, and sputum&#xD;
      collection; chest x-rays; electrocardiograms (ECGs); hearing tests; adherence assessments;&#xD;
      and acceptability questionnaires.&#xD;
