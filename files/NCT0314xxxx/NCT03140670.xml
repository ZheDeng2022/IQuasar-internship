    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma with&#xD;
             locally advanced or metastatic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≥18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have previously failed non-platinum containing therapy or may never have&#xD;
             previously progressed on treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be on treatment with platinum-based (cisplatin, oxaliplatin or&#xD;
             carboplatin) treatment for locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer and have&#xD;
             received a minimum of 16 weeks of therapy without evidence of disease progression&#xD;
             based on the investigator's opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Discontinuation of the platinum component of the regimen for chemotherapy-related&#xD;
             toxicity is permissible provided the patient has previously received at least 16 weeks&#xD;
             of platinum-based therapy without evidence of disease progression ≤8 weeks after&#xD;
             treatment with the platinum agent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented deleterious BRCA1/2 or PALB2 mutation (germline or somatic) as assessed by&#xD;
             CLIA certified laboratory. Variants that are considered to be non-detrimental&#xD;
             (&quot;Variants of uncertain significance&quot;, &quot;Variants of unknown significance&quot;, &quot;Variant,&#xD;
             favor polymorphism&quot; or &quot;benign polymorphism&quot; etc) are not sufficient for study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease is not required for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate organ function confirmed by the following laboratory values obtained ≤7 days&#xD;
             prior to the first day of rucaparib:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5 x 109/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Platelets&gt;100 x 109/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Hemoglobin≥9g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤3 x upper&#xD;
                  limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN; if liver metastases or metabolic disorder such as&#xD;
                  Gilbert's syndrome, then ≤2.5 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN or estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥45&#xD;
                  mL/min using Cockcroft Gault formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with a PARP inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have demonstrated resistance to platinum agents (e.g. oxaliplatin,&#xD;
             cisplatin) are not eligible to participate in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical evidence of uncontrolled malabsorption and/or any other gastrointestinal&#xD;
             disorder or defect that would, in the opinion of the investigator, interfere with the&#xD;
             absorption of rucaparib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute infection requiring intravenous antibiotics, antiviral or antifungal agents&#xD;
             during the 14 days prior to first dose of rucaparib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic or untreated CNS metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Expected life expectancy of &lt;12 weeks as determined by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For fertile patient (female able to become pregnant or male able to father a child),&#xD;
             refusal to use effective contraception during the period of the trial and for 6 months&#xD;
             after the last dose of rucaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received any systemic treatment for pancreatic cancer ≤14 days prior to first dose of&#xD;
             rucaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-study related minor surgical procedure ≤5 days, or major surgical procedure ≤21&#xD;
             days, prior to the first dose of rucaparib; in all cases, patients must be&#xD;
             sufficiently recovered and stable before treatment administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that would interfere with study compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of any other condition that may increase the risk associated with study&#xD;
             participation or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
