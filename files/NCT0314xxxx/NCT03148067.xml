    <textblock>
      Diaphyseal femoral and tibial fractures are in the spotlight within the&#xD;
      traumatology-orthopedics scenario. Intramedullary nailing (IMN) remains the method of choice&#xD;
      for treating these fractures, both open and closed ones. Occurrences of surgical site&#xD;
      infection (SSI) related to this type of osteosynthesis are a challenge for all the&#xD;
      professionals involved in patient healthcare. The reported incidence of SSI after IMN ranges&#xD;
      from 0.9 to 17.5%. The majority of the data comes from retrospective studies and as part of&#xD;
      case series descriptions, with little detail about the criteria used for defining and&#xD;
      searching for cases of infection. Regarding the potential risk factors for this complication,&#xD;
      previous use of external fixators, occurrence of open fractures and the severity of exposure&#xD;
      according to the Gustilo-Anderson classification were indicated in a few retrospective&#xD;
      studies as being possibly related to this complication. The objectives of the present&#xD;
      observational cohort study are: 1. To determine the incidence of SSI related to IMN for&#xD;
      fixation of diaphyseal femoral and tibial fractures in patients treated in a university&#xD;
      traumatology and orthopedics reference hospital in São Paulo, Brazil; 2. To evaluate the risk&#xD;
      factors related to the occurrence of this type of infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diaphyseal femoral and tibial fractures are a important challenge faced by the orthopedic&#xD;
      surgeon, due to their high incidence and high social and economic impact. Currently, the&#xD;
      observed increases in the rates of injuries secondary to traffic, work and firearms-related&#xD;
      accidents, and also those related to sports practice, have led to significant growth of the&#xD;
      incidence of these fractures, especially among young and economically active individuals .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although standardized criteria for indications of conservative treatment exist, surgery is&#xD;
      often recommended due to its better functional results and shorter rehabilitation period.&#xD;
      Intramedullary nailing (IMN) was introduced by Küntscher in 1939 and remains the method of&#xD;
      choice for treating these fractures, both closed and open ones, especially because the&#xD;
      surgical technique is considered to be simple, standardized and replicable; does not cause&#xD;
      major soft tissue damage and allows early loading. This technique is associated with a higher&#xD;
      consolidation rate and lower incidence of complications, among which infections are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical site infection (SSI) after internal fracture fixation is considered to be a severe,&#xD;
      hard-to-treat complication, and it is important to remember that the presence of the implant&#xD;
      itself favors bacterial invasion and alters local immunity, thus hampering the action of&#xD;
      granulocytes. In addition, injury to the soft tissues adjacent to the fracture focus also&#xD;
      hampers this immunity and favors occurrence of infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although complications are less frequent than in other internal fracture fixation methods,&#xD;
      they can occur during the postoperative period, relating to the use of IMN, and these may&#xD;
      include SSI. Its occurrence significantly increases recovery time and treatment costs, and it&#xD;
      compromises the long-term functional results and rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SSIs, including those related to IMN, are defined internationally in accordance with the&#xD;
      criteria established in the United States (USA) by the National Healthcare Safety Network&#xD;
      (NHSN), an agency belonging to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 8 This&#xD;
      body is responsible for healthcare-related infection surveillance actions in that country. In&#xD;
      Brazil, as in other countries, adaptations made by the local health and epidemiological&#xD;
      surveillance authorities are followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In January 2015, the NHSN made available a document with new definitions of SSI, which came&#xD;
      into force in the USA from that moment onwards, with important changes. The period for&#xD;
      defining infections relating to fracture fixation procedures, regardless of the type of&#xD;
      synthesis material used, became only 90 days, instead of one year from the data of the&#xD;
      surgery. For better evaluation, however, for the present study, the surveillance period&#xD;
      remains one year for defining SSIs relating to IMN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different incidences of SSI after fixation of lower-limb fractures through IMN have been&#xD;
      reported in the literature. Most of these have come from retrospective studies and as part of&#xD;
      the description of series of cases of patients who underwent this procedure, with little&#xD;
      detail about the criteria used for defining and searching for SSI cases. Only two prospective&#xD;
      studies have so far reported the occurrence of this complication: these studies were not&#xD;
      specifically designed for evaluating SSI and only describe its occurrence superficially,&#xD;
      among other complications . Until recently, only Gaebler et al., in 2000, had described this&#xD;
      complication with greater methodological rigor. In 2015, however, because of the gap in&#xD;
      knowledge that existed, three authors published the results from retrospective studies that&#xD;
      had been specifically designed for evaluating SSIs relating to IMN for correcting lower-limb&#xD;
      fractures. Despite this recent interest in this subject among researchers, there continue to&#xD;
      be no prospective studies specifically designed for investigating the incidence of this&#xD;
      complication, or its risk factors. In Latin America, in particular, there are no studies of&#xD;
      any kind evaluating the incidence of SSI after fixation of lower-limb fractures using IMN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factors for occurrences of surgical site infections are generally divided into those&#xD;
      relating to the host, the surgical environment and the microbiota. For occurrences of SSI&#xD;
      after fracture fixation procedures, the following are considered also to be risk factors:&#xD;
      degree of energy of the associated trauma, degree of injury of the adjacent soft tissues,&#xD;
      degree of local contamination, duration of osteosynthesis surgery and immunological status of&#xD;
      the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, specifically with regard to risk factors relating to occurrences of SSI after&#xD;
      fixation of lower-limb fractures through IMN, information is scarce, given that the majority&#xD;
      of the studies that analyzed the incidence of this complication did not allow for analysis of&#xD;
      the risk factors relating to their occurrence. Until 2015, only Gaebler et al. had published&#xD;
      results from an analysis on these risk factors. They concluded from their retrospective study&#xD;
      that the risk of acquiring SSI after implantation of IMNs was 22.4 times higher among&#xD;
      patients with Gustilo III open fractures than among patients with other types of fractures.&#xD;
      However, these authors did not evaluate the importance of other factors that are considered&#xD;
      to be associated with occurrences of SSI after fracture fixation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the lack of information on this important subject, in 2015 three authors published&#xD;
      results from retrospective investigations that enabled a few conclusions. Galvin et al., in&#xD;
      their study on closed tibial fractures in American soldiers, found higher incidence of SSI&#xD;
      after IMN in patients who presented clinical instability during the initial care, although&#xD;
      this difference was not statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In turn, Metsemakers et al. concluded, after an initial univariate analysis, that previous&#xD;
      use of external fixators, occurrences of open fractures and the severity of exposure&#xD;
      according to Gustilo-Anderson would be factors associated with occurrences of SSI, as also&#xD;
      would greater time intervals between the fracture and its fixation through IMN. It needs to&#xD;
      be highlighted that these authors did not define the time interval above which the risk of&#xD;
      infection would be greater. After multiple logistic regression analysis, however, only&#xD;
      previous external fixation remained as a factor associated with occurrence of SSI after&#xD;
      internal fixation of the fracture with IMN. In the study conducted by Roussignol et al., only&#xD;
      the severity of the open fracture according to the Gustilo-Anderson classification had a&#xD;
      statistically significant correlation with occurrences of infection. Other variables,&#xD;
      including the severity according to the AO classification, previous external fixation, and&#xD;
      time interval between fracture and its internal fixation did not present correlations with&#xD;
      increased incidence of SSI associated with IMN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It needs to be emphasized that none of the studies cited that presented information on the&#xD;
      factors associated with occurrences of SSI after fracture fixation through IMN were&#xD;
      prospective. This shows that the medical literature still lacks information obtained using&#xD;
      greater methodological rigor.&#xD;
