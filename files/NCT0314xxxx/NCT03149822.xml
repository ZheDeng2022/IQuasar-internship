  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II open-label study designed to evaluate the combination of pembrolizumab&#xD;
      and cabozantinib in subjects with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma. Sequential dose escalation of cabozantinib with standard dose pembrolizumab will&#xD;
      occur in the phase I dose escalation part of the study to determine the recommended phase 2&#xD;
      dose (RP2D). Subsequently, subjects will receive cabozantinib at the RP2D in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in the phase II dose expansion part of the study.&#xD;

      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the efficacy based on objective response rate [ORR = complete response (CR)&#xD;
           + partial response (PR)] of pembrolizumab and cabozantinib when administered in&#xD;
           combination in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and&#xD;
           recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess other measures of anti-tumor activity of the combination of pembrolizumab and&#xD;
           cabozantinib in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
