  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are over 44,000 persons living with spinal cord injury (SCI) in Canada, who face&#xD;
      substantial challenges in maintaining a healthy body composition after injury. As a result,&#xD;
      obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease are prevalent in this population. Guidelines&#xD;
      indicating that twice weekly 20-minute sessions of exercise (plus resistance training) will&#xD;
      increase physical fitness in those with SCI have been recently published. However, no&#xD;
      SCI-specific guidelines indicating the volume of exercise to reduce the risk of developing&#xD;
      obesity-related diseases exist. Longitudinal studies indicate that a weekly exercise-related&#xD;
      energy expenditure of 2000 - 2500 Calories is correlated with the least likelihood of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease in the able-bodied population. There is little information regarding&#xD;
      energy expenditure (EE) for activities carried out by persons with SCI, with less available&#xD;
      for persons with tetraplegia. Once known, this EE data can be used to develop exercise&#xD;
      interventions to determine the volume of voluntary exercise required to reduce obesity and&#xD;
      risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular disease in those living with tetraplegia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the absence of successful regeneration treatments to recover normal neurological function&#xD;
      after spinal cord injury, there has been a needed focus on research aimed at preventing or&#xD;
      minimizing the secondary complications of living with a spinal cord injury (SCI).&#xD;
      Approximately 44,000 persons live with traumatic spinal cord injury in Canada, half of which&#xD;
      have tetraplegia, with 35 new spinal cord injuries (SCI) per million each year. Persons with&#xD;
      spinal cord injury SCI are among the most sedentary on the planet, with a much higher&#xD;
      incidence of related diseases, such as obesity, glucose intolerance, diabetes and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease than the able-bodied population. At the same time, information needed&#xD;
      to minimize the risk of developing these diseases for those living with spinal cord injury is&#xD;
      lacking. For example, specific information regarding resting energy requirements, energy&#xD;
      expenditure during exercise, and the volume of exercise required to maintain a healthy body&#xD;
      composition and prevent the development of sedentary-related disease in this population is&#xD;
      scarce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to maintain weight, and not gain excess body fat, energy intake in food Calories&#xD;
      needs to match energy use. In addition to understanding energy use in order to maintain&#xD;
      weight balance, exercise is also important for muscular and cardiovascular health. Research&#xD;
      to date indicates that the resting energy expenditure of persons with SCI is considerably&#xD;
      less than able-bodied persons with the same weight or body mass index. A considerable portion&#xD;
      of this reduced resting energy expense is due to the reduced muscle mass after SCI. There are&#xD;
      mixed research results regarding whether there are additional reductions in resting energy&#xD;
      expenditure, after adjusting for fat free mass, in persons with SCI. Training has been shown&#xD;
      to be effective in reducing shoulder pain, improving function, improving physical capacity,&#xD;
      reducing hyperinsulinemia, and reducing dyslipidemia in persons with chronic paraplegia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, it is less clear if voluntary exercise can have the same beneficial effects for&#xD;
      those living with tetraplegia, in part because their peak power output is only one-third to&#xD;
      one-half that achieved during arm exercise in those with paraplegia. In addition, it may be&#xD;
      very difficult for those with tetraplegia to be able to exercise for a sufficient duration to&#xD;
      achieve a sufficient training effect to either maintain a healthy body composition or reduce&#xD;
      the risk of developing the sedentary diseases common to this population. This study will&#xD;
      provide the exercise-related energy expenditure data to address this question.&#xD;

    <description>Study 1 will test if optimizing the height of the arm crank axis during arm cycle ergometry will show a greater mechanical efficiency for those with tetraplegia and lead to a longer duration of sustained rhythmic exercise.&#xD;
Study 2 will determine the energy expenditure while performing different modes and intensities of voluntary exercise in those with tetraplegia (wheeling, arm cycle ergometry and hand-cycling).&#xD;
Study 3: Will determine if periods of reduced core temperature are present and contribute to the reduced basal and resting energy expenditure in those living with tetraplegia.</description>
