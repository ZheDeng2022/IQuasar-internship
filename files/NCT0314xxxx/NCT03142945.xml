  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In addition to manual therapy, mobilizations, manipulations, and exercise, the McKenzie&#xD;
      method of Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy (MDT) is currently being used to treat headaches.&#xD;
      However, there is little supportive evidence about the efficacy of this type of treatment.&#xD;
      The MDT method focuses on actively involving the patient in education and self-management of&#xD;
      pain. The focus is to have the patient learn about his/her condition and how to manage the&#xD;
      symptoms independently when possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regards to research that has been conducted on the use of MDT with headaches, one study&#xD;
      compared mechanical traction, rhythmic impulse, and MDT exercises in relieving tension-type&#xD;
      headaches (TTH). Mechanical cervical traction was found to be more effective at reducing&#xD;
      headaches in both infrequent episodic and frequent episodic TTH. While MDT was used in this&#xD;
      study, a general treatment was prescribed to each patient in that group without consideration&#xD;
      to directional preference. This treatment had the patients perform the same exercises in the&#xD;
      same progression, including four extension exercises, one flexion exercise, two lateral&#xD;
      flexion exercise, and one rotation exercise. In addition, they performed the exercises for&#xD;
      the same length of time for the same number of repetitions. The study was unclear about&#xD;
      whether the exercises were administered by physical therapists or whether the practitioners&#xD;
      were MDT credentialed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One case study described the treatment of a cervicogenic headache using the MDT retraction&#xD;
      progression along with therapeutic exercises that included deep neck flexor and extensor&#xD;
      strengthening and stretching of neck musculature as indicated . The patient reported that&#xD;
      performing retractions at home provided him relief from his headaches for progressively&#xD;
      longer periods of time as his treatment progressed. By the end of the treatment, the patient&#xD;
      no longer experienced headaches. The results from this article support the proposition that&#xD;
      headaches which present with mechanical origins can be successfully treated with the MDT&#xD;
      approach.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Headaches affect an estimated 46% of adults worldwide, and the pain can have a detrimental&#xD;
      effect on an individual's livelihood. In a two-week time period, 12.7% of the US workforce&#xD;
      was unable to productively work due to pain, with headache pain as the most common complaint.&#xD;
      For those with headache pain, this resulted in 3.5 +/- 0.1 hours of productivity lost in a&#xD;
      week. Quality of life, financial situation, employment, and social involvement are negatively&#xD;
      impacted by headache pain. Coworkers and family may have to handle work or personal&#xD;
      responsibilities that those with headaches are unable to fulfill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to manual therapy, mobilizations, manipulations, and exercise, the McKenzie&#xD;
      method of Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy (MDT) is currently being used to treat headaches.&#xD;
      However, there is little supportive evidence about the efficacy of this type of treatment.&#xD;
      The MDT method focuses on actively involving the patient in education and self-management of&#xD;
      pain. The focus is to have the patient learn about his/her condition and how to manage the&#xD;
      symptoms independently when possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study in Poland compared MDT interventions to a control group that received therapeutic&#xD;
      exercise, massage, and ultra-red radiation for patients with cervical derangement. Although&#xD;
      not targeted at patients with a primary complaint of headache, the percentage of patients in&#xD;
      the MDT group experiencing headache decreased from 80% to 3.33% whereas the percentage of&#xD;
      patients in the control group experiencing headaches decreased from 83.87% to 51.61%. This&#xD;
      indicates that MDT may be an effective treatment for headaches with a mechanical component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regards to research that has been conducted on the use of MDT with headaches, one study&#xD;
      compared mechanical traction, rhythmic impulse, and MDT exercises in relieving TTH.&#xD;
      Mechanical cervical traction was found to be more effective at reducing headaches in both&#xD;
      infrequent episodic and frequent episodic TTH. While MDT was used in this study, a general&#xD;
