  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the proposed study is to identify the contributions of the amount of&#xD;
      task-specific practice on locomotor (i.e., walking) recovery in patients with chronic (&gt; 1&#xD;
      yr) motor incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI). Consistent with principles of motor learning&#xD;
      and exercise physiology, the investigators contend that certain training (i.e., dosage)&#xD;
      parameters of physical rehabilitation are critical to mobility outcomes following&#xD;
      neurological injury. Specifically, the specificity, amount and intensity of physical&#xD;
      interventions (i.e., practice) may influence specific outcomes in the patient population&#xD;
      treated. In ambulatory patients with iSCI, there are very few studies that have controlled&#xD;
      for or targeted these training variables or their influence on locomotor recovery. Previous&#xD;
      work suggests these training parameters may influence locomotor recovery in patients with&#xD;
      other neurological disorders (i.e., stroke), although few studies have attempted to delineate&#xD;
      similar contributions of in iSCI. Indeed, no studies have carefully controlled the amount of&#xD;
      task-specific practice during physical rehabilitation of patients with iSCI, and such&#xD;
      interventions are rarely utilized in the clinical setting. The goal of the present study is&#xD;
      to delineate the relative contributions of amount of task-specific training on locomotor&#xD;
      outcomes in individuals with iSCI. Using a cross-over, randomized clinical trial design, the&#xD;
      investigators anticipated non-specific (i.e., non-stepping) training activities would result&#xD;
      in smaller improvements as compared to task-specific (stepping) training. The investigators&#xD;
      will investigate the effects of such training on walking performance and kinematics, as well&#xD;
      as the impairments thought to contribute to walking performance. Successful completion of&#xD;
      this project could have an immediate impact on rehabilitation research and treatment of&#xD;
      people following iSCI, and may be utilized to treat more subacute patients with iSCI or other&#xD;
      acute-onset neurological disorders.&#xD;

      The primary goal of the proposed study is to identify the contributions of the amount of&#xD;
      task-specific practice on locomotor (i.e., walking) recovery in patients with chronic (&gt; 1&#xD;
      yr) motor incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI). The investigators will do this by building on&#xD;
      previous work directed towards identifying the essential exercise training parameters that&#xD;
      maximize locomotor recovery. Consistent with principles of motor learning and exercise&#xD;
      physiology, the investigators contend that certain training (i.e., dosage) parameters of&#xD;
      physical rehabilitation, including the type (specificity) and amount of task practice, are&#xD;
      critical to mobility outcomes following neurological injury. Previous work suggests these&#xD;
      training parameters may influence locomotor recovery in patients with other neurological&#xD;
      disorders (i.e., stroke), although few studies have attempted to delineate similar&#xD;
      contributions of amount of task-specific practice in iSCI. Indeed, no studies have carefully&#xD;
      controlled these training parameters during physical rehabilitation of patients with iSCI,&#xD;
      and such interventions are rarely utilized in the clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reasons for these knowledge gaps from other rehabilitation studies to patients with iSCI or&#xD;
      lack of clinical implementation are unclear, but may be due to adherence to traditional&#xD;
      rehabilitation theories. One concern is that practicing only stepping tasks reduces attention&#xD;
      towards hallmark physical impairments following iSCI, such as loss of strength or postural&#xD;
      stability, which are considered primary determinants of decreased mobility. Only a few&#xD;
      studies have addressed whether providing only structured stepping training can mitigate these&#xD;
      impairments without their explicit practice, but not in the iSCI population. A related&#xD;
      concern is that focused stepping training without significant attention towards impairments&#xD;
      or gait quality may exaggerate altered movement strategies, which could be reinforced with&#xD;
      repeated practice. However, there is little data to suggest &quot;worsening&quot; of abnormal gait&#xD;
      patterns following high intensity training. Rather, recent findings suggest patients&#xD;
      demonstrate more normal kinematics. If focused task specific (i.e., stepping) training is to&#xD;
      be applied clinically, the investigators must delineate its contributions towards improving&#xD;
      locomotor function, and their effects on underlying impairments and gait kinematics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypotheses are that stepping training in iSCI results in:1) greater locomotor&#xD;
      gains as compared to non-specific interventions; 2) gains in selected impairments underlying&#xD;
      gait dysfunction (i.e., strength and metabolic capacity and efficiency); and, 3) improvements&#xD;
      in gait quality. To test these hypotheses, the proposed crossover, assessor-blinded,&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial (RCT) is designed to test the effects of specificity of&#xD;
      rehabilitation training applied early-post-stroke. In this RCT, patients &gt; 1 year post-iSCI&#xD;
      will be allocated to 4-6 weeks (20 session) of high-intensity stepping training or&#xD;
      high-intensity non-specific training. Importantly, training intensity will be held constant&#xD;
      to account for this potential confounding factor. Blinded assessments will be performed prior&#xD;
      to and following each training paradigm. The investigators will address 3 specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Demonstrate that high intensity stepping training in patients with chronic&#xD;
      iSCI produces greater locomotor gains as compared to high intensity non-specific training&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: High intensity stepping training will result in greater increases in gait&#xD;
      speeds and distances Specific Aim 2: Test the effects of these training strategies on&#xD;
      impairments and non-locomotor mobility tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Higher intensity stepping training groups will result in greater gains in&#xD;
      metabolic capacity and efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: Analyze the potential effects of high intensity stepping or non-specific&#xD;
      training on gait quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: High intensity training will result in improved sagittal-plane gait kinematics&#xD;
      consistent with normal locomotor function, due in part to greater locomotor speeds, as&#xD;
      compared to non-specific training strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims represent an innovative approach to improving long-term mobility outcomes of&#xD;
      patients with iSCI by applying selected principles of motor learning and exercise physiology&#xD;
      yet untested in this population. Expected outcomes will be demonstration of the efficacy of a&#xD;
      high intensity stepping training paradigm, with further understanding of potential underlying&#xD;
      mechanisms and movement strategies used with improved locomotor performance. Successful&#xD;
      completion of this project could have an immediate impact on rehabilitation research and&#xD;
      treatment of people following iSCI, and may be utilized to treat more subacute patients with&#xD;
      iSCI&#xD;
