  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is aimed at examining mitochondrial function as a potential target of&#xD;
      action of vitamin D on muscle metabolism, size, and strength in preventing the progression of&#xD;
      cachexia. This is the first clinical trial designed to understand the effects of vitamin D on&#xD;
      muscle metabolic dynamics driving dysfunction in cachectic muscle. Our preliminary data&#xD;
      suggest that vitamin D promotes lipid partitioning and muscle metabolic function, which the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize, will mitigate cachexia via improved muscle health and quality that&#xD;
      translates into reduced fatigue, and improved patient resilience to multimodal cancer&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D repletion is linked to improved muscle mitochondrial function, lipid deposition and&#xD;
      preservation; however, while vitamin D insufficiency is common in cancer, the mechanistic&#xD;
      effects of vitamin D on muscle metabolic health in cancer patients have not been studied.&#xD;
      This is important to address because cancer cachexia is characterized by marked muscle&#xD;
      wasting, anabolic resistance, ectopic fat infiltration, mitochondrial dysfunction and&#xD;
      contributes to decreased survival. With novel strategies to address this knowledge gap, the&#xD;
      investigators will use a combination of advanced metabolic analytical approaches with&#xD;
      complementary model systems in cell culture and human subjects to understand the biochemical&#xD;
      and physiological mechanisms underlying cancer cachexia in relation to the role of vitamin D&#xD;
      in conjunction with resistance exercise (RE). By combining analyses of muscle size and local&#xD;
      tissue hemodynamics in vivo, metabolomics analyses of muscle tissue and isolated&#xD;
      mitochondria, and changes in anabolic cell signaling, lipid metabolism and oxidative capacity&#xD;
      of primary muscle cells in vitro, the investigators will identify mechanisms underlying&#xD;
      muscle response to vitamin D repletion. Our previous findings, together with data that&#xD;
      exercise improves muscle vitamin D storage and retrieval, suggest that vitamin D repletion&#xD;
      synergizes with RE to improve muscle metabolic function and protein synthesis. Our overall&#xD;
      objective is to examine mitochondrial function and anabolic resistance as potential targets&#xD;
      of action of vitamin D on muscle metabolism, size and strength in preventing the progression&#xD;
      of cachexia. The aims of this study are to: 1) non-invasively quantify lipid redistribution,&#xD;
      local muscle tissue metabolism and muscle mass and strength of cancer patients before and&#xD;
      after 12 weeks of double blinded vitamin D repletion with exercise and protein&#xD;
      supplementation (VitD) compared to exercise and protein supplementation only (Ctl); 2)&#xD;
      determine differences in muscle mitochondrial function in live tissue biopsied from human&#xD;
      gastrocnemius from VitD compared to Ctl; and 3) identify mechanisms whereby vitamin D and&#xD;
      exercise regulate muscle anabolic signaling and mitochondrial activity in primary human&#xD;
      myotube cultures. Our central hypothesis is that vitamin D promotes muscle lipid availability&#xD;
      for β-oxidation in response to exercise, thereby preventing lipotoxicity in the muscle and&#xD;
      potentially improving anabolic sensitivity in muscle during cancer cachexia. The impact of&#xD;
      this project, the first nutrition and exercise study designed as an inexpensive intervention,&#xD;
      is to understand the effect of vitamin D on the metabolic and anabolic dynamics which&#xD;
      underpin dysfunction in cachectic muscle. If vitamin D promotes lipid partitioning, muscle&#xD;
      metabolic function and/or anabolic sensitivity, these adaptations will ultimately improve&#xD;
      cancer therapy by combating cancer cachexia. Further, diffuse optical spectroscopy techniques&#xD;
      have the potential to identify the minimum effective intervention dose for optimizing&#xD;
      metabolic health leading to more practical and individualized lifestyle prescriptions to&#xD;
      reduce health care costs.&#xD;
