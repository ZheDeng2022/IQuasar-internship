  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This retrospective multi-centric Belgian observational trial will involve all patients who&#xD;
      have initiated adalimumab for moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis prior to September 1st&#xD;
      2015 in a Belgian centre maintaining a prospective log of patients using biological therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only patients fulfilling all Belgian reimbursement criteria for adalimumab will be included,&#xD;
      namely having failed mesalamine and steroids or thiopurine analogues for at least 3 months,&#xD;
      or being intolerant to this therapy, and showing a total Mayo score of at least 6 with an&#xD;
      endoscopic sub-score of at least 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both short-term and long-term outcome of adalimumab therapy will be evaluated, focusing on&#xD;
      the need and successfulness of adalimumab dose-escalation from 40mg every other week to 40mg&#xD;
      every week, and dose de-escalation back to 40mg every other week.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adalimumab is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis after&#xD;
      failure of aminosalicylates plus corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators.1-4 In the&#xD;
      registration studies for adalimumab in ulcerative colitis prior anti-tumor necrosis factor&#xD;
      (TNF) treatment was restricted; in ULTRA 1, prior anti-TNF treatment was an exclusion&#xD;
      criterion,5 while in ULTRA 2, 40% of patients had been exposed to infliximab prior to start&#xD;
      of adalimumab, but primary non-responders to infliximab were excluded.6 Open label real life&#xD;
      studies have shown good responses to adalimumab in UC. However typically, these cohorts were&#xD;
      small and most patients were anti-TNF naïve. One Italian open label study on 88 patients&#xD;
      reported clinical remission rates of 28% and 43% at week 12 and year 1, respectively.7 No&#xD;
      significant differences were observed between infliximab naïve and infliximab exposed UC&#xD;
      patients. In a Belgian open label study of 73 patients previously failing infliximab, overall&#xD;
      clinical response at week 12 and 52 were 75% and 52%, respectively.8 Adalimumab was continued&#xD;
      without need for dose escalation throughout year 1 in 16 patients, 22 needed dose escalation&#xD;
      and 35 discontinued treatment within 1 year. Prior response to infliximab and early serum&#xD;
      concentrations correlated with response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While data are available in Crohn's disease,9 real life data on adalimumab dose escalation&#xD;
      and dose de-escalation are limited in ulcerative colitis. Similarly, factors associated with&#xD;
      need and success of dose escalation and dose de-escalation later on are almost absent.&#xD;

Success of dose-escalation is defined based on a positive physician global assessment and absence of blood on two consecutive visits at least 3 months apart from each other. Of note: patients requiring a second intervention later on (addition of any type of steroids, addition of any immunomodulatory drug or optimization to off-label adalimumab 80 mg every week) will be regarded as failure (treatment optimization based on trough level monitoring or biomarkers alone will not be included)</description>
