  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is characterized by chronic airway inflammation of the large and small airways. Asthma&#xD;
      patients often have episodes with symptoms of dyspnea, wheezing and nocturnal awakening.&#xD;
      Currently available inhaled anti-inflammatory treatments reduce the airway inflammation and&#xD;
      treatment but do not cure the disease. Therefore asthma patients often need life-long&#xD;
      treatment to control their asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a small subset of patients, their asthma resolves spontaneously. This phenomenon is called&#xD;
      asthma remission. Subjects with asthma remission do not experience symptoms or signs of&#xD;
      airway inflammation anymore and do not require inhaled treatments. Some subjects with asthma&#xD;
      remission also have a completely normal lung function without signs of bronchial&#xD;
      hyperresponsivess: they have complete asthma remission. Unfortunately, asthma remission&#xD;
      occurs only in a small subset of 15-25% of asthma patients.Objective: to determine the&#xD;
      underlying mechanisms and molecular events leading to remission of asthma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Asthma inception occurs only in susceptible individuals, and is often triggered by&#xD;
      specific environmental factors, such as respiratory viruses and aeroallergens. Although&#xD;
      asthma is generally viewed as a chronic persistent disease, remission of asthma is possible&#xD;
      in a subset of patients. This is highly relevant, since understanding mechanisms that&#xD;
      contribute to asthma inception and remission may teach us how asthma can be stopped and thus&#xD;
      may provide novel avenues for the treatment of asthma. In adulthood, average remission rates&#xD;
      of asthma are approximate 2% per year 1. We observed that remission in adulthood is more&#xD;
      likely with earlier onset of asthma, less airway obstruction, more severe bronchial&#xD;
      hyperresponsiveness, and smoking cessation. A proper definition of remission is very&#xD;
      important; we therefore introduced the terms 'clinical remission' and 'complete remission' 2.&#xD;
      Clinical remission was defined as the absence of asthma symptoms and no use of asthma&#xD;
      medication, complete remission as the absence of asthma symptoms, no use of asthma&#xD;
      medication, normal lung function and no bronchial hyperresponsiveness. In a longitudinal&#xD;
      study of 119 allergic asthmatic children followed-up for 30 years, our group found that&#xD;
      clinical remission occurred in 30% and complete remission in 22% of all cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: to determine the underlying mechanisms and molecular events involved in the&#xD;
      inception and remission of asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: We will include a 40 subjects divided over the following 4 groups: i) clinical&#xD;
      asthma remission (10 subjects), ii) complete asthma remission (10 subjects), iii) ongoing&#xD;
      asthma (10 patients), iv) non-asthmatic healthy controls (10 subjects) in a cross-sectional&#xD;
      study. All subjects will be extensively clinically characterized including respiratory&#xD;
      symptoms/questionnaires, in- and expiratory CT-scans, and parameters of large and small&#xD;
      airway function and inflammation. In addition, blood and nasal epithelial brushes will be&#xD;
      obtained to study the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of asthma remission. Finally,&#xD;
      bronchoscopy with bronchial biopsies and brushes will be performed under conscious sedation.&#xD;
      Bronchial biopsies from all four patient groups will be used for index FACS sorting of the&#xD;
      three most important cell types orchestrating the asthmatic inflammatory process: i.e. B&#xD;
      lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. We will perform single cell whole-genome&#xD;
      transcriptome sequencing on at least 100 cells of each type and the primary outcome of the&#xD;
      study is to identify how the transcriptomic profile of bronchial epithelial cells is changed&#xD;
      between asthma patients and healthy controls as a consequence of asthma inception and what&#xD;
      transcriptomic profile changes occur in CD4+ CD8+ and B lymphocytes in the airways from&#xD;
      subjects with asthma remission compared to patients with ongoing asthma and healthy controls.&#xD;
