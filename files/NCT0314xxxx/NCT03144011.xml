    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in patients with congenital heart defects&#xD;
      after cardiopulmonary bypass. The death rate from AKI in critically ill children remains high&#xD;
      and reaches 60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basic criteria for diagnosing and assessing the severity of kidney injury until recently&#xD;
      were the level of serum creatinine and the amount of urine released. However, it should be&#xD;
      noted that the level of serum creatinine, traditionally used to assess renal function, does&#xD;
      not significantly increase until a decrease of more than 50% of the glomerular filtration&#xD;
      rate, in addition, its level depends also on some extrarenal causes. Artificial blood&#xD;
      circulation and hemodilution leads to the preservation of the level of creatinine at&#xD;
      sufficiently low levels up to 1-3 days postoperative period. The level of diuresis as well as&#xD;
      the level of creatinine is a nonspecific criterion after cardiac surgery and depends on&#xD;
      several factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, in the field of acute renal injury studies, progress has been made in the&#xD;
      emergence of new biomarkers such as the tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) and&#xD;
      insulin-like growth factor binding globulin-7 (IGFBP7), which are early markers of acute&#xD;
      renal damage. In a study in adult patients, it was shown that the levels of TIMP-2 and IGFBP7&#xD;
      increased In the first 24-48 before the diagnosis of IR-associated renal damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among pediatric patients with congenital heart defects, such studies are single and only&#xD;
      present for the age group 3 and older, which also demonstrated the high specificity and&#xD;
      prognostic significance of these biomarkers in the early diagnosis of acute renal damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should also be noted that, in spite of the high specificity of the markers described, it&#xD;
      is also necessary to note their considerable cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, taking into account the above, it is planned to compare and identify the relationship&#xD;
      of these indicators with such parameter as the index of renal vascular resistance, the&#xD;
      increase of which in the pre- and postoperative period may serve as a sign of the beginning&#xD;
      acute renal injury.&#xD;
