  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral nutritional supplements and enteral tube feeds are commonly used to meet the nutritional&#xD;
      requirements of patients with disease-related malnutrition, or who require medical nutrition&#xD;
      support for other reasons. Some patients may not tolerate standard formulations containing&#xD;
      whole proteins (typically due to maldigestion/malabsorption) leading to gastrointestinal&#xD;
      symptoms (i.e. vomiting and diarrhoea). Without appropriate management, this may lead to&#xD;
      reduced nutritional intake, increased nutritional losses and risk of malnutrition in patients&#xD;
      who may already have elevated nutritional requirements due to their clinical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poor tolerance to standard feed formulations can be managed with extensively hydrolysed&#xD;
      (peptide-based) enteral feeds, where the protein source is provided in smaller proteins.&#xD;
      Patients with elevated nutritional requirements, poor tolerance, maldigestion and/or&#xD;
      malabsorption often require a higher energy, higher protein feed to meet their nutritional&#xD;
      requirements in a smaller volume of feed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study feed is a high energy (1.5kcal/ml), high protein (7.5g protein/100ml) peptide-based&#xD;
      feed, available as a 500ml enteral tube feed, and a 200ml Vanilla-flavour oral nutritional&#xD;
      supplement. The study will investigate the gastrointestinal tolerance, compliance and&#xD;
      acceptability of the high energy, high protein peptide-based feed in 60 adult patients&#xD;
      requiring a peptide-based feed, in several NHS sites across England. Patients will be asked&#xD;
      to take the study feed for 28 days. Data will be recorded using questionnaires with no&#xD;
      invasive measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is gastrointestinal tolerance with secondary outcomes of compliance,&#xD;
      acceptability, nutrient intake and anthropometry.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition or &quot;undernutrition&quot; in adults (â‰¥18 years of age) is the deficiency of nutrients&#xD;
      (energy, protein and micronutrients) which causes adverse effects on bodily composition,&#xD;
      clinical and functional outcomes. Malnutrition can occur as a result of a number of factors&#xD;
      including inadequate calorie intake, impaired nutrient absorption&#xD;
      (malabsorption/maldigestion) or increased energy requirements usually associated with&#xD;
      disease/illness e.g. cancer, inflammatory bowel disease and pancreatitis, and its management,&#xD;
      e.g. chemotherapy and surgery. Patients who have or are at risk of malnutrition can be&#xD;
      managed with a range of nutrition support strategies, including the use of oral nutritional&#xD;
      supplements and enteral feeds (administered by feeding tubes such as nasogastric tubes,&#xD;
      gastrostomies or jejunostomies). These feeds may provide either a sole source of nutrition or&#xD;
      in combination with the diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small group of patients requiring nutritional support experience severe malabsorption and&#xD;
      maldigestion of nutrients (particularly protein and fat), resulting in them having an&#xD;
      inadequate energy and nutrient supply. This may be due to inadequate functioning of the&#xD;
      gastro-intestinal tract due to inflammation, reduced concentration of digestive enzymes&#xD;
      and/or reduced surface area for nutrient absorption associated with some diseases and&#xD;
      treatments. These may include patients with pancreatic enzyme deficiency (pancreatitis,&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer, cystic fibrosis), inflammatory bowel disease, radiation enteritis and&#xD;
      chemotherapy, short bowel syndrome, HIV-related gastrointestinal disorders, enteric fistulae&#xD;
      or intolerance/allergy of unknown cause. Some of these patients will not be able to tolerate&#xD;
      a standard feed containing whole protein and fat. In these cases oral nutritional supplements&#xD;
      and enteral tube feeds known as 'extensively hydrolysed', 'semi-elemental' or 'peptide-based'&#xD;
      with extensively digested protein (containing peptides and small proteins) and containing&#xD;
      more easily absorbed types of fat (medium chain triglycerides (MCTs)), can help improve&#xD;
      digestion and absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peptide-based feeds have been used effectively in the dietary management of patients with&#xD;
      Crohn's disease, pancreatitis, pancreatectomy, radiation enteritis and chemotherapy,&#xD;
      HIV-related GI disorders and short bowel syndrome. The use of MCTs in patients with fat (long&#xD;
      chain triglyceride (LCT)) malabsorption has been shown to decrease steatorrhoea, decrease&#xD;
      dyspepsia and improve nutritional status. Feed formulations with a mixture of MCTs and LCTs&#xD;
      are also thought to provide beneficial effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such specialised, ready to use feeds have been commonly used in clinical practice for many&#xD;
      years. However, the energy density (1kcal/ml) and the protein content (4g/100ml) of some such&#xD;
      feeds have meant that patients are often unable to tolerate the required volumes of feed&#xD;
      either orally or via tube to meet their nutritional requirements, which are often elevated by&#xD;
      their disease. Therefore, in order to meet the nutritional requirements of patients with poor&#xD;
      feed tolerance, a more energy dense (1.5kcal/ml), higher protein (7.5g protein/100ml),&#xD;
      nutritionally complete peptide-based feed for oral and tube feeding may be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study feed is a high energy (1.5kcal/ml), high protein (7.5g protein/100ml) peptide-based&#xD;
      feed, available as a 500ml enteral tube feed, and a 200ml Vanilla-flavour oral nutritional&#xD;
      supplement. However, the tolerance, compliance and acceptability of this feed is unknown in&#xD;
      this patient group who have complex clinical conditions. Therefore this study is required to&#xD;
      assess gastrointestinal tolerance, compliance and acceptability of this high energy density&#xD;
      (1.5kcal/ml), high protein (7.5g/100ml), peptide-based feed in community patients requiring&#xD;
      nutrition support in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 adult patients requiring a peptide-based feed will be recruited from several NHS sites&#xD;
      across England. Patients will be asked to take the study feed for 4 weeks (28 days), in a&#xD;
      quantity advised by their Dietitian. Data will be recorded at baseline, Week 4 and throughout&#xD;
      the study using questionnaires with no invasive measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is gastrointestinal tolerance with secondary outcomes of compliance to&#xD;
      prescribed study feed volumes, acceptability of the study feed, nutrient intake and&#xD;
      anthropometry.&#xD;
