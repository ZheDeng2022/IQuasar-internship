  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this R01 proposal is to evaluate the clinical impact, hypothesized mechanisms&#xD;
      of behavior change, and cost-effectiveness of a partners-focused integrated elimination of&#xD;
      mother-to-child transmission of HIV (EMTCT) package comprised of: 1) antenatal care-based&#xD;
      couples HIV testing, ART enrollment, and care for sero-concordant HIV+ expectant couples; (2)&#xD;
      Couples-based treatment in the post-partum period; (3) Couple-based education and skills&#xD;
      building; and (4) Treatment continuity with the support of expert-patient (peer) supporters&#xD;
      from couples who have successfully navigated EMTCT. This innovative approach to scaling up&#xD;
      EMTCT services, if proven feasible and effective, will be adopted in President's Emergency&#xD;
      Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) programs to accelerate progress toward EMTCT and helping&#xD;
      families with HIV infection live long, healthy lives.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In severely resource-limited rural settings, scale-up of services to eliminate&#xD;
      mother-to-child transmission of HIV (EMTCT) has failed to provide effective HIV testing and&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage for women in highest prevalence southern African&#xD;
      regions. All HIV-infected pregnant women are now eligible for life-long antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy (ART) (Option B+), but retention among women enrolled through Option B+ programs&#xD;
      remains sub-optimal. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) it is common for women to require male&#xD;
      partner approval to access and remain engaged in HIV-related health services. Despite the&#xD;
      likelihood that male involvement would improve program coverage and adherence, the evidence&#xD;
      base for effective interventions to involve male partners in HIV testing and treatment&#xD;
      through antenatal care (ANC) point of care is very limited. Furthermore, whether such&#xD;
      strategies are indeed cost-effective for improving outcomes of HIV-diagnosis and treatment in&#xD;
      pregnancy is unknown. This proposal seeks to address these key gaps in the evidence base and&#xD;
      guide scale-up by evaluating a promising male engagement intervention (&quot;Homens para Saúde&quot;&#xD;
      (HoPS)+ [Men for Health]) targeting EMTCT in Mozambique through a clinic-randomized trial.&#xD;
      This study will engage 24 ANC clinics; 12 intervention and 12 standard of care, with 45&#xD;
      HIV-infected couples per clinic where currently &gt;60% of couples attend their first ANC visit&#xD;
      together. The planned intervention addresses social-structural and cultural factors&#xD;
      influencing EMTCT through the creation of couples-centered integrated HIV services,&#xD;
      including: (1) ANC-based couples HIV testing, ART enrollment, and care for sero-concordant&#xD;
      HIV+ expectant couples; (2) Couple-based treatment in the post-partum period; (3)&#xD;
      Couple-based education and skills building; and (4) Treatment continuity with the support of&#xD;
      expert-patient (peer) supporters from couples who have successfully navigated EMTCT. Given&#xD;
      that 8.0% of all pregnant women and 7.2% of their partners tested HIV-positive during ANC&#xD;
      visits in 2015 (FGH monitoring and evaluation [M&amp;E] data), the investigators pioneering work&#xD;
      in Mozambique's rural Zambézia province suggests that innovative strategies are essential to&#xD;
      engaging HIV-infected male partners in antenatal care (ANC) in order to achieve EMTCT and to&#xD;
      improve substantially the health of the mothers. This team of Mozambican and U.S.&#xD;
      investigators has a proven record of international HIV research success and they have&#xD;
      specific recent experience with EMTCT cluster randomized trials, male-engagement in ANC&#xD;
      services, and cost-effectiveness analysis of HIV programs. The specific aims of this study&#xD;
      are: (1) To implement and evaluate the impact of male-engaged, couples-centered services on&#xD;
      retention in care, adherence to ART, and early infant diagnosis among HIV+ pregnant women and&#xD;
      their HIV+ male partners through a cluster-randomized control trial (RCT); (2) To investigate&#xD;
      the impact of HoPS+ on hypothesized mechanisms of change; and (3) To use validated simulation&#xD;
      models to evaluate cost-effectiveness of the HoPS+ intervention with the use of programmatic&#xD;
      provincial monitoring and evaluation data and data from the trial results.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The 12 clinics randomly assigned to the intervention arm will receive a combination of community and clinical services, including: (1) ANC-based couples HIV testing, couples-based treatment enrollment, and clinical care for sero-concordant HIV+ expectant couples; (2) couple-centered treatment in the post-partum period; (3) couples-based education and skills building during the ANC and post-partum period; and (4) treatment continuity support by expert-patient (peer) navigators selected among couples who have successfully navigated EMTCT. The 12 clinics randomized to the control arm will continue to provide standard of care EMTCT services that include: standard HoPS male engagement (male invitation to ANC services and couples HIV testing), opt-out rapid HIV testing of all pregnant women attending ANC, HIV-specific counseling and support for all women who test positive, provision of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis, and universal ART, as per option B+ guidelines.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Our primary outcome is patient retention, defined as monthly medication pick-up. Specifically, any ART medication pick-up between days 16 and 45 will count as medication pick-up during month 1, any medication pick-up between days 46 and 75 will count as medication pick-up during month 2, and so forth, up until 12 months (i.e., medication pick-up between day 346 and 375).</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Specifically, every patient is given 30 days to pick up their medication, with a grace period of 5 days. If a patient picks up medication more than 35 days from their last pick-up, then they will be considered not on their medication from day 30 until the day of their next pick-up, at which time they will be assumed to be on medication again; this will be calculated over the course of the one-year follow-up.</description>
