    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre phase I/II trial looking at the combination of romidepsin and&#xD;
      carfilzomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the phase I part is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the&#xD;
      combination. This part will recruit up to 27 patients, plus possibly an additional 3 patients&#xD;
      at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the phase II part is to assess the activity of the combination at the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose in 28 patients (including at least 6 patients treated at the MTD from phase&#xD;
      I).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive 8 cycles of romidepsin with carfilzomib and response will be assessed&#xD;
      every second cycle. Patients will be followed up for progression and survival until the end&#xD;
      of the trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single arm, phase I/II, multicentre, dose finding study of romidepsin&#xD;
      in combination with carfilzomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the phase I is to establish the MTD of the combination using a restricted&#xD;
      two-stage CRM. The MTD is defined as the dose level that is closest to the level at which 25%&#xD;
      of patients experience a DLT over the first cycle of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intention in phase I is to evaluate the DLT-inducing effects of doses in cohorts of&#xD;
      patients. Patients will be treated in cohorts at a dose level and each patient will be&#xD;
      evaluated for presence or absence of DLT. In stage I, the first cohort of 3 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled at the starting dose, i.e. dose level 2. If none experiences a DLT, the next cohort&#xD;
      of 3 patients will be recruited at the next higher level, i.e. dose level 3. This escalation&#xD;
      routine will continue until the first DLT is observed or the maximum recruitment for stage I&#xD;
      is reached. As soon as the first DLT is observed, dose escalation and de-escalation will be&#xD;
      guided by the CRM design that will recommend the dose believed to have associated DLT-rate&#xD;
      closest to 25%. If the trial escalates, each dose below the newly tested dose is regarded as&#xD;
      being tolerable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In stage II, we will consider variable cohort sizes of up to eight patients. Patients are&#xD;
      screened for eligibility before they are formally registered. During screening, we expect it&#xD;
      to transpire that some patients will be ineligible. To maximise recruitment and reduce trial&#xD;
      suspension period between cohorts in this rare disease, we will allow for the flexibility of&#xD;
      variable cohort sizes by screening cohorts of up to eight patients. We will allocate&#xD;
      screening slots so that the sum of: a) the number of patients already receiving treatment in&#xD;
      the current cohort; and (b) the number of patients in screening; does not exceed eight. If a&#xD;
      patient is screened and proves to be eligible, they will be recruited to the trial. The first&#xD;
      three patients in a cohort will receive the dose-level allocated to the cohort. Patients who&#xD;
      are inevaluable, as described immediately above, can be replaced. If the fourth to eighth&#xD;
      patients are recruited to a cohort and the dose allocated to the cohort is not yet regarded&#xD;
      as tolerable, the fourth to eighth patients will receive the next dose-level below.&#xD;
      Otherwise, they will receive the same dose level as the previous patients in the cohort. The&#xD;
      aim of the described strategy is to maximise recruitment but not expose more than three&#xD;
      patients to a dose that has not yet been demonstrated tolerable. The model will be updated&#xD;
      regularly and subsequent recommended doses will be assigned to patients iteratively until the&#xD;
      maximum sample size is reached, or the trial is stopped early because there is a high chance&#xD;
      that the lowest dose is too toxic. It is expected that the CRM will likely allocate patients&#xD;
      to the eventual MTD at the later stage of the trial as more data accumulate. Recruitment will&#xD;
      be permitted to continue seamlessly to the Phase II component at the latest recommended MTD&#xD;
      dose, in consultation with the Trial Safety Committee, unless it is considered necessary to&#xD;
      halt recruitment The initial guess of MTD is at dose combination level 4, however to exercise&#xD;
      caution, dose level 2 is defined as the starting dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 8mg/m2 Romidepsin (days 1, 8, 15), 20/36mg/m2 Carfilzomib (days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. (Starting dose) 10mg/m2 Romidepsin (days 1, 8, 15), 20/36mg/m2 Carfilzomib (days 1, 2,&#xD;
           8, 9, 15, 16)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 10mg/m2 Romidepsin (days 1, 8, 15), 20/45mg/m2 Carfilzomib (days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 12mg/m2 Romidepsin (days 1, 8, 15), 20/45mg/m2 Carfilzomib (days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 12mg/m2 Romidepsin (days 1, 8, 15), 20/56mg/m2 Carfilzomib (days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. 14mg/m2 Romidepsin (days 1, 8, 15), 20/56mg/m2 Carfilzomib (days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16) For&#xD;
           all dose levels, the carfilzomib dose will be 20mg/m2 for the first 2 doses (i.e. day 1&#xD;
           and 2 of cycle 1), rising to the target dose for subsequent doses and cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the MTD is defined, patients recruited at a lower dose may receive the MTD for any&#xD;
      subsequent cycles of treatment at the discretion of the treating Investigator and the Chief&#xD;
      Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase II component will aim to provide a preliminary estimate of activity in 28 patients&#xD;
      at the MTD combination established in phase I. The phase II component is based on A'Hern's&#xD;
      single arm, single stage design and would utilise patients allocated to the MTD in phase I.&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited over a 36-month period and will receive a minimum of 8 cycles of&#xD;
      treatment. Patients will continue to be followed up for progression and survival until the&#xD;
      end of the trial.&#xD;
