      This study aims to help women have a better birth experience, by trying to understand what a&#xD;
      'confident birth' means to women during pregnancy and labour. Results from a recent service&#xD;
      evaluation at a local NHS Trust, exploring a new programme designed to enhance women's birth&#xD;
      experience, highlighted the importance of understanding women's confidence for birth. A&#xD;
      significant number of pregnant women that attended the course (19.5%) felt 'not at all&#xD;
      confident' for birth. The service evaluation results also suggested that confidence for birth&#xD;
      is an important influence of enhancing birth experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is some research that suggests that if women's confidence for birth can be improved,&#xD;
      then she may be less fearful of birth and have experience less labour pain. However, very&#xD;
      little is known about what women consider to be a 'confident birth' and who or what they feel&#xD;
      influences their confidence. If maternity services are able to understand this, this could&#xD;
      possibly lead to the development of tools and strategies to help women to feel more confident&#xD;
      for giving birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a qualitative study that involves two methods of data collection: interviews and&#xD;
      social media. Women that are pregnant or have recently given birth will be interviewed to&#xD;
      explore who or what they feel has influenced their confidence for birth. The interviews will&#xD;
      last for about one and a half hours. The location for interview is flexible and women can be&#xD;
      interviewed in their own home. In addition to this, approximately 500 messages posted on a&#xD;
      large UK parenting website about confidence for birth will also be analysed.&#xD;
