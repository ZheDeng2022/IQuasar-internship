  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is a chronic and sometimes progressive disorder, characterized by headache,&#xD;
      recurrent episodes, and other associated symptoms. Migraine is the most common cause of&#xD;
      headache among patients who applied to emergency services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the investigators is to compare the efficacy of oral paracetamol and&#xD;
      zolmitriptan in the treatment of acute migraine headache in an emergency department.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  This is prospective, randomized, controlled research to compare the efficacy of these&#xD;
           two drugs in emergancy department.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The clinical trial was conducted in the ED of Pamukkale University Medical Faculty&#xD;
           Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study personnel (emergency physicians and nurses) were trained before the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When oral drugs (paracetamol, zolmitriptan was being recommended, an eligibility&#xD;
           checklist was completed by the attending physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If there were no exclusion criteria, written informed consent was obtained and baseline&#xD;
           information, including initial headache pain score ratings with VAS and NRS were&#xD;
           recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The need for identification and enrollment of participants by staff with conflicting&#xD;
           work pressures resulted in recruitment of a convenience sample of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients eligible for the study were randomized to one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First Group: paracetamol 1000 mg was given oral to 100 patients,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Second Group: Zolmitriptan 2,5 mg was given oral to 100 patients which determined to be&#xD;
           applied as a group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drugs were prepared according to the computer-generated random number sequence to assign&#xD;
           treatment allocations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The allocation list was kept by the emergency nurse. Patients received the paracetamol,&#xD;
           zolmitriptan medication schemes according to their random allocations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After enrollment and recording of baseline information, the next numbered study drug was&#xD;
           obtained, and administered as oral.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization was achieved by using computer software to generate random numbers. During&#xD;
           the intervention, participants were monitored by an oxygen saturation (SpO2) monitor, an&#xD;
           automatic sphygmomanometer (blood pressure), and a rhythm monitor (heart rate and&#xD;
           rhythms)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One researcher blinded to patient allocation observed the whole procedure and recorded&#xD;
           the Headache scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Headache scores were recorded at 0, 15, 30, and 60 min on a VAS of 1 to 100 mm and NRS&#xD;
           of 1 to 10. Patients with nausea are treated with 15 minutes of 10 mg metoclorpramide&#xD;
           slow infusion in 150 cc saline solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rescue medication (1 mcg/kg fentanyl ) was given İntravenöz to patients if pain VAS&#xD;
           scores ≥ 50 mm in 60 minutes after study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All other medications required during the study also were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the study, pulse rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure,&#xD;
           respiration rate and oxygen saturation (SpO2) were recorded at baseline (0 min), 15, 30,&#xD;
           and 60 min.&#xD;
