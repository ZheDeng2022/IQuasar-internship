  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will compare the effect of broad and directed (narrow) technology-based training on&#xD;
      basic perceptual and cognitive abilities in older adults and on the performance of simulated&#xD;
      tasks of daily living including driving and fraud avoidance.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomly assigned to four training conditions: broad training using&#xD;
      either 1) Posit Science's web-based &quot;BrainHQ&quot; or 2) the video game Rise of Nations, or to&#xD;
      directed training for 3) Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) training on both&#xD;
      driving, American Association of Retired Persons (AARP)'s web-based older driver training&#xD;
      program, and training for fraud avoidance, a web-based tutorial on finance and fraud, or 4)&#xD;
      to an active control condition of puzzle solving. Training will take approximately 15-20 hr&#xD;
      for each treatment condition. Before training begins, participants will take baseline ability&#xD;
      tests of perception, attention, memory, and cognition, activities of daily living, as well as&#xD;
      a driving simulator test for hazard perception, and a financial fraud recognition test. They&#xD;
      will be tested again on these measures following training completion, and at a one-year&#xD;
      follow-up from training completion.&#xD;

    <measure>Fraud Detection Post Training</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Immediately after 4-week intervention training</time_frame>
    <description>Percent confidence that a given vignette describing fraud is actually an example of fraud, measured at baseline and immediately after 4 weeks of training. Participants were given a vignette describing fraud (which was mixed in with vignettes not describing fraud) and were asked to give their percent confidence that this is actually an example of fraud. Higher confidence indicates higher accuracy when detecting fraud, with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 100. Measures accuracy in discriminating fraud from non-fraud text-based scenarios (using 3 parallel forms).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Immediately after 4-week intervention training</time_frame>
    <description>Driving simulator (scenarios including hazards) measures of speed, maximum brake compression, and lane position, at baseline and immediately after 4 weeks of training. These measures provide an estimate of accuracy in driving scenarios that involve hazards in the DriveSafety simulator (using 3 parallel forms). All measures were transformed into Z scores and averaged in order to create a measure of overall driving performance, where higher scores represent more dangerous (worse) driving performance.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>8 participants were consented and completed some baseline measures, but removed themselves from the study before they were randomly assigned to a certain condition. Thus, 238 participants agreed to participate in the study, but only 230 participants appear at baseline across conditions.</pre_assignment_details>

These measures provide an estimate of accuracy in driving scenarios that involve hazards in the DriveSafety simulator (using 3 parallel forms). All measures were transformed into Z scores and averaged in order to create a measure of overall driving performance, where higher scores represent more dangerous (worse) driving performance.</description>

Participants were given a vignette describing fraud (which was mixed in with vignettes not describing fraud) and were asked to give their percent confidence that this is actually an example of fraud. Higher confidence indicates higher accuracy when detecting fraud, with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 100.

        <title>Driving Simulator Average Lane Position at One Year</title>
        <description>Average lane position in a driving simulator measured at baseline and one year after 4 weeks of training. Lane position measures the average deviation from the center of a lane while driving (values from -1 to 1), averaged across participants, where 0 represents perfect center, negative scores represent deviation to the left (from 0 to -1), and positive scores represent deviation to the right (from 0 to 1). Lane position indicates vehicle control and safety.</description>

        <population>Participants were instructed that they could refuse any individual measure, which may influence the participant counts for some measures. This was particularly pronounced for driving simulator measures because of discomfort and simulator sickness.</population>
