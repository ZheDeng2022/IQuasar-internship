  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a hypervascular tumor. The reference treatment of advanced&#xD;
      forms of stage C according to the Barcelona classification (BCLC C) is sorafenib, a&#xD;
      multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor with predominant anti-angiogenic action. In order not&#xD;
      to underestimate the efficacy of sorafenib, scannographic evaluation of the tumor response&#xD;
      should be performed with mRECIST criteria that are significantly better correlated with&#xD;
      survival. These criteria take into account the tumor size and also the modification of the&#xD;
      tumor contrast enhancement after anti-angiogenic treatment. It seems appropriate to evaluate&#xD;
      tumor control rather than tumor response since sorafenib is more stable than tumor response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This evaluation will be made according to the mRECIST criteria after 3 months of treatment&#xD;
      since the progression-free survival is of the order of 3 to 4 months. The determination of&#xD;
      early predictive criteria for the response to sorafenib would optimize the management of&#xD;
      advanced HCCs. Indeed, sorafenib only improves overall survival by 3 months in selected&#xD;
      patients, and with undesirable effects and a significant cost. Predictive biological criteria&#xD;
      have already been studied, such as alpha foeto-protein (AFP), whose early decrease with&#xD;
      sorafenib is associated with better overall survival. The same applies to the early reduction&#xD;
      at 4-6 weeks of tumor arterial contrast according to mRECIST criteria. The perfusion scanner&#xD;
      appears to be an accessible and reproducible choice imaging technique for assessing tumor&#xD;
      vasculature. In metastatic kidney cancers, it was demonstrated that some criteria for tumor&#xD;
      perfusion prior to treatment with sorafenib were predictive of better control of the disease&#xD;
      and even a better tumor response according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria. The determination of&#xD;
      pre-therapeutic tumor perfusion criteria in order to predict tumor control or even overall&#xD;
      survival has never been studied in advanced CHCs. On the other hand, an early variation in&#xD;
      the criteria for tumor perfusion under treatment would tend to be correlated with the tumor&#xD;
      response and even with overall progression-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the study of tumor vascularization by the perfusion scanner could make it possible&#xD;
      to demonstrate early predictive criteria for tumor control under sorafenib in order to&#xD;
      optimize the management of patients with advanced HCC.&#xD;
