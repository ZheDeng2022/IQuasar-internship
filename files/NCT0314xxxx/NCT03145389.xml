  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous thoracic epidural analgesia plays a very vital role in patients undergoing&#xD;
      exploratory laparotomy. It not only supports a stable perioperative hemodynamics but also&#xD;
      helps in early return of bowel activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intestinal perforation is one of the commonest surgical emergency that the investigators&#xD;
      encounter in emergency. Perioperative management of most of such patients is a challenging&#xD;
      task for the anesthesiologist, as patients are often hemodynamically unstable at the time of&#xD;
      their presentation to emergency. Usual plan of anesthesia for these patients is general&#xD;
      anesthesia with or without an epidural block. In routine practice the investigators often&#xD;
      place an epidural catheter, primarily for postoperative analgesia, unless there is some&#xD;
      contraindication to epidural analgesia. Most often lower thoracic epidural is preferred&#xD;
      because of longer length of the laparotomy incision. Thoracic epidural analgesia with local&#xD;
      anesthetic (LA) is not only effective in managing the post-operative pain; it is also helpful&#xD;
      in supplementing intra-operative analgesia with reduced requirement of anesthetic, muscle&#xD;
      relaxant and the analgesic (opioid) drugs. In addition, it has also been reported to be&#xD;
      associated with early return of gut motility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It appears that absent / significantly reduced pain leads to lesser stress response, leading&#xD;
      to less sympathetic activation and lesser catecholamine release. As catecholamines are&#xD;
      inhibitory to gastrointestinal motility, earlier return of gastro intestinal (GI) motility&#xD;
      can be achieved by reducing perioperative pain by continuous epidural analgesia. Moreover, an&#xD;
      effective epidural analgesia with LA results in avoidance of opioid analgesics for optimal&#xD;
      perioperative pain relief, which too may be helpful in achieving earlier return of gut&#xD;
      motility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus the investigators aimed at determining the effect of continuous thoracic epidural&#xD;
      analgesia on return of gut motility in patients undergoing emergency exploratory laparotomy&#xD;
      following intestinal perforation and compare it with those in whom epidural analgesia was not&#xD;
      used.&#xD;

    <description>After explaining about the procedure an 18 Gauge epidural catheter was inserted into thoracic 11-12 inter vertebral space under strict asepsis. Before inserting the epidural needle same space was infiltrated with adequate amount of 2% Lignocaine with Adrenaline (1: 200,000) to make the procedure pain free. Epidural space was confirmed by loss of resistance technique.</description>
