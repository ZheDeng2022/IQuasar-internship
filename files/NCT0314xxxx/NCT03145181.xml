  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2Ds) and schedule&#xD;
      assessed to be safe for Teclistamab and to characterize the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      Teclistamab at the RP2Ds.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in 2 parts, separately for IV and SC administration: dose&#xD;
      escalation (Part 1) and dose expansion (Part 2). It will evaluate safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and preliminary antitumor activity of Teclistamab administered to adult&#xD;
      participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The overall safety of the study&#xD;
      drug will be assessed by physical examinations, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group&#xD;
      performance status, laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms, adverse event&#xD;
      monitoring, and concomitant medication usage. Disease evaluations will include peripheral&#xD;
      blood and bone marrow assessments at screening (performed within 28 days) and to confirm&#xD;
      stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), or relapse from CR. The end of&#xD;
      study (study completion) is defined as 2 years after the last participant in Part 3 has&#xD;
      received his or her initial dose of teclistamab. Study record NCT04557098 is Phase 2 part of&#xD;
      this study and study record NCT03145181 is Phase 1 part of this study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented diagnosis of multiple myeloma according to International Myeloma Working&#xD;
             Group (IMWG) diagnostic criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable multiple myeloma that is relapsed or refractory to established therapies&#xD;
             with known clinical benefit in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma or be intolerant&#xD;
             of those established multiple myeloma therapies, and a candidate for Teclistamab&#xD;
             treatment in the opinion of the treating physician. Prior lines of therapy must&#xD;
             include a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory drug and anti-CD38 monoclonal&#xD;
             antibody in any order during the course of treatment. Participants who could not&#xD;
             tolerate a proteasome inhibitor or immunomodulatory drugs and an anti-CD38 monoclonal&#xD;
             antibody are allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status score of 0 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential and fertile men who are sexually active must agree to&#xD;
             use a highly effective method of contraception (less than [&lt;] 1%/year failure rate)&#xD;
             during the study and for 90 days after the last dose of study drug. Contraception must&#xD;
             be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of birth control methods for&#xD;
             participants participating in clinical trials. When a woman is of childbearing&#xD;
             potential the following are required: A woman using hormonal contraceptives must use&#xD;
             an additional barrier method (failure rate of &lt;1% per year when used consistently and&#xD;
             correctly). Examples of highly effective contraceptives for women include&#xD;
             user-independent methods (for example, implantable progestogen-only hormone&#xD;
             contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation; intrauterine device;&#xD;
             intrauterine hormone-releasing system; vasectomized partner) and user-dependent&#xD;
             methods (for example: combined [estrogen- and progestogen-containing] hormonal&#xD;
             contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation [oral/intravaginal/&#xD;
             transdermal]; progestogen-only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of&#xD;
             ovulation [oral/injectable]. In addition to the highly effective method of&#xD;
             contraception, a man who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential&#xD;
             must agree to use a barrier method of contraception (for example a condom with&#xD;
             spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository). Additionally, a man who is sexually&#xD;
             active with a woman who is pregnant must use a condom. Women and men must agree not to&#xD;
             donate eggs (ova, oocytes) or sperm, respectively, during the study and for 90 days&#xD;
             after the last dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must sign an informed consent form (ICF) indicating that he or she&#xD;
             understands the purpose of and procedures required for the study and is willing to&#xD;
             participate in the study. Consent is to be obtained prior to the initiation of any&#xD;
             study-related tests or procedures that are not part of standard-of-care for the&#xD;
             participant's disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with any B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) targeted therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior antitumor therapy as follows, before the first dose of study drug: Targeted&#xD;
             therapy, epigenetic therapy, or treatment with an investigational drug or used an&#xD;
             invasive investigational medical device within 21 days or at least 5 half-lives,&#xD;
             whichever is less; Monoclonal antibody treatment for multiple myeloma within 21 days;&#xD;
             Cytotoxic therapy within 21 days; Proteasome inhibitor therapy within 14 days;&#xD;
             Immunomodulatory agent therapy within 7 days; Gene modified adoptive cell therapy&#xD;
             (example, chimeric antigen receptor modified T cells, natural killer [NK] cells)&#xD;
             within 3 months; Radiotherapy within 14 days or focal radiation within &amp; days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Toxicities from previous anticancer therapies that have not resolved to baseline&#xD;
             levels or to Grade 1 or less except for alopecia or peripheral neuropathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received a cumulative dose of corticosteroids equivalent to &gt;= 140 milligram (mg) of&#xD;
             prednisone within the 14-day period before the first dose of study drug (does not&#xD;
             include pretreatment medication)&#xD;
