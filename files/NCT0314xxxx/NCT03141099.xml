    <textblock>
      This study compares two blood pressure targets and two oxygenation targets in the&#xD;
      post-resuscitation care of comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrets patients. Using a novel&#xD;
      method the blood pressure-intervention is double-blinded. The oxygenation-intervention is&#xD;
      open-label. As a subordinate study, the patients will be randomized 1:1 to active&#xD;
      fever-control with an automated feedback temperature control-device for 36 or 72 hours&#xD;
      following return of spontaneous circulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In comatose patients resuscitated from out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), neurological&#xD;
      injuries remain the leading cause of death. The in-hospital mortality is reported at 30-50%,&#xD;
      and the total mortality, although improved substantially over the last decade, remain to be&#xD;
      significant, in most countries at up to 90%. An adequate blood pressure must be maintained in&#xD;
      the post-cardiac arrest patient i order to optimize neurological recovery and avoid further&#xD;
      brain injury. Blood pressure targets in post-resuscitation guidelines are based on limited&#xD;
      clinical evidence. Furthermore registry and clinical data suggest a u-shaped relationship of&#xD;
      outcome with levels of oxygen supplementation. Blinded, randomized, clinical trials&#xD;
      addressing specific blood pressure- or oxygenation-targets during the post-resuscitation&#xD;
      care, have not been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current trial addresses strategies for neuroprotection using a 2-by-2 design of two&#xD;
      different target blood pressure levels and two different oxygenation levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  'Low-normal MAP' (appoximately 63 mmHg) vs. 'high-normal MAP' (approximately 77 mmHg)&#xD;
           (double blind intervention) and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Low-normal oxygenation (9-10 kPa) vs. high-normal oxygenation (13-14) kPa (open label).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As a subordinate study, the patients will be randomized 1:1 to active fever-control with&#xD;
           an automated feedback temperature control device for 72 hours or to 36 hours following&#xD;
           return of spontaneous circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: National collaborative, randomized clinical trial randomizing 800 comatose&#xD;
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients undergoing targeted temperature management (TTM) to&#xD;
      the specified interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have planned the following sub-studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-study 1: Devopment and validation af a method for double blinded allocation to different&#xD;
      blood pressure targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: It is possible to develop a method for double blinded allocation of patients to&#xD;
      different blood pressure targets in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-study 2: Assessment of different blood pressure targets and relation to renal function&#xD;
      during TTM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Different blood presure goals will affect biomarkes of renal function after&#xD;
      cardiac arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-study 3: To investigate the hemodynamic profil in relation to different blood pressure&#xD;
      targets after cardiac arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Blood pressure and vassopressor-doses are related to hemodynamic parameters, such&#xD;
      as systemic vaskular resistence index and cardiac index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-study 4: To investigate the hemodynamic profil in relation to different oxygenation&#xD;
      targets after cardiac arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Lower oxygenation targets are related to higher pulmonary vascular resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-study 5: The prognostic value of automated videobased assessment of pupillary dilatation&#xD;
      and reaction to light. Derivation and validation of relevant cut-off for introducing&#xD;
      pupillomtry as part of the prognostication&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERIM ANALYSIS There will be an independent DSMC arranging an independent statistician to&#xD;
      conduct primarily a blinded interim analysis at time points of their choosing. The DSMC will&#xD;
      be able to request unblinding of data coordinated by the data managing agency. An interim&#xD;
      analysis is planned after inclusion of 200 and 400 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the BP intervention, a blinded interim analysis of vasorepressor need and recorded blood&#xD;
      pressures is planned after 50 patients, to monitor blinding of treatment allocation and that&#xD;
      a clinically relevant blood pressure separation between groups is achieved. Vasopressor needs&#xD;
      in terms of vasopressor need in a variance component model is expected to differ. New sites&#xD;
      will be monitored for these factors after inclusion of 50 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EARLY STOPPING CRITERIA After an interim analysis the DSMC may suggest to the steering&#xD;
      committee that the trial should be stopped early. No specific criteria to guide the DSMB will&#xD;
      be put forward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACCOUNTABILITY PROCEDURE FOR MISSING DATA/POPULATION FOR ANALYSIS Trial sites will be asked&#xD;
      to complete all CRFs and other forms if missing data is found in the electronic database.&#xD;
      Missing data will be reported in the publications. More than 5% missing data will result in&#xD;
      multiple imputation with the creation of 5-10 imputed datasets to be analysed separately and&#xD;
      the aggregated into one estimate of intervention effect on the primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes. Analyses will be performed according to the modified intention to treat principle&#xD;
      with patients lost to follow up included in the denominator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBGROUP ANALYSIS AND DESIGN VARIABLES Subgroups will be analysed according to pre-defined&#xD;
      design variables: over or under median age, shockable rhythm, gender, the presence of shock&#xD;
      at admission, diagnosed AMI and time from arrest to ROSC. Difference in intervention effect&#xD;
      estimates according to subgroup will be declared exclusively based on a statistically&#xD;
      significant test of interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTATION The principal investigator and the site&#xD;
      investigators will permit monitoring, audits, review of ethical committees and regulatory&#xD;
      authorities direct access to source data and documentation, blinded to treatment allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING Individual patient data will be handled as ordinary chart&#xD;
      records and will be kept according to the legislation (e.g. data protection agencies) of the&#xD;
      countries of each health system. The study database will be stored for 15 years and&#xD;
      anonymised if requested by the relevant authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Danish legislation regarding the respect for patients physical and mental integrity and&#xD;
      rights will be respected, Approval for storing data relevant to the trial, including&#xD;
      potentially sensitive information has been approved by the relevant authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE A monitoring plan will be published before start of the&#xD;
      trial. The monitoring will include: inclusion and absence of exclusion criteria, consent&#xD;
      obtained in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All trial sites will be provided with sufficient information to participate in the trial. The&#xD;
      site investigator will be responsible for that all relevant data is entered into the&#xD;
      electronic CRFs. The CRFs will be constructed in order to assure data quality with predefined&#xD;
      values and ranges on all data entries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL METHODS The combined primary outcome will be reported as proportional hazard of&#xD;
      experiencing one of two endpoints (death or poor neurological status at hospital discharge),&#xD;
      differences tested with a log rank test. Other proportions are expected to be normally&#xD;
      distributed; therefore a t-test is applied. Survival analyses are performed using&#xD;
      proportional hazard models, survival is adjusted for site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore pre-specified analysis of interaction for design variables: sex, age (median),&#xD;
      time to ROSC (median), shockable rhythm, STEMI, pre-existing hypertension, pre-existing&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE A two-sided significance level of 0.05 will be applied to all endpoints. No&#xD;
      adjustment for the factorial design is made, as no interaction is expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATION Sample size estimation is based on blinded BP target allocation and on&#xD;
      the assumption that no interaction of the two interventions exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combined primary outcome is time to death or hospital discharge in a state of CPC 3 or 4.&#xD;
      The investigators are planning a study with 400 subjects in each group, an accrual interval&#xD;
      of 48 months, and additional follow-up after the accrual interval of 3 months. Prior data&#xD;
      indicate the 6 months mortality is 33% overall. Assuming a mortality of 28% in the superior&#xD;
      group compared to 38% in the inferior groups the investigators will need to include 732&#xD;
      patients in total or 846 patients in total to achieve a power of 0.8 and 0.9 respectively.&#xD;
      The Type I error probability associated with this test of the null hypothesis that the&#xD;
      experimental and control survival curves are equal is 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Loss of final measurement is expected but from the experience from previous trial the number&#xD;
      of missing follow-up assessments is small (&lt;5%) and will not result in an increase of the&#xD;
      number of patients needed.&#xD;
