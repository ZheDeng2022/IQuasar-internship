  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Photoaged or chronically sun-exposed skin is characterised by a number of clinical features&#xD;
      including fine and coarse wrinkles. The pathogenesis of wrinkle formation has yet to be&#xD;
      determined fully but recent work suggests that ultraviolet radiation-induced reduction in&#xD;
      dermal fibrillin (in the form of fibrillin-rich microfibrils) is important. Using an extended&#xD;
      in vivo patch test assay, it has been identified that skin care products - currently marketed&#xD;
      by CG Skin Ltd - increase the deposition of these microfibrils in photoaged dermis and hence&#xD;
      have the potential to repair photoaged skin. The Investigators now propose to examine the&#xD;
      efficacy of the product in randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who satisfy the inclusion/exclusion criteria and who have given their written,&#xD;
      witnessed, informed consent will be admitted to the studies. Subjects will be clinically&#xD;
      assessed (fine wrinkling, coarse wrinkling, mottled hyperpigmentation, sallowness) and&#xD;
      clinical photographs taken prior to instruction on the use of the allocated cream by the&#xD;
      study Investigator (product or placebo). Product will be applied daily to the entire face and&#xD;
      dorsum of hands, including the wrists and extensor forearm, for six months. Successive&#xD;
      follow-up visits (3 visits over a 6-month period) will be made to assess efficacy and safety.&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly allocated to self-treatment with either product or placebo cream&#xD;
      using a computer generated code (Research Randomizer; www.randomizer.org).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be treatment efficacy; this will be assessed by the study&#xD;
      Investigators as changes in the clinical parameters of photoaging (fine wrinkles, coarse&#xD;
      wrinkles, mottled hyperpigmentation, sallowness).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will assess two secondary outcome measures: (1) Histological improvement in&#xD;
      skin structure. Skin biopsies from the treated extensor forearm will be taken at study&#xD;
      initiation and at the end of the six month study period. These biopsies will be evaluated&#xD;
      for: (a) epidermal thickness; (b) fibrillin expression and; (c) pro-collagen I expression.&#xD;
      (2) Tolerance and irritancy. Tolerance and irritation assessments will be made by recording&#xD;
      the occurrence and severity of signs of erythema and scaling. Safety will be evaluated by&#xD;
      recording all adverse events experienced by subjects. Any subject exhibiting adverse events&#xD;
      of sufficient severity will be withdrawn from the trial. Completion or withdrawal of subjects&#xD;
      from the trial will be noted on the end of study form. All subjects will be monitored for the&#xD;
      occurrence of serious adverse events up to, and including, 28 days after their involvement&#xD;
      with this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be conducted according to the recommendations of ICH GCP and those of the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki, only after approval of the study has been obtained from the relevant&#xD;
      Research Ethics Committee.&#xD;
