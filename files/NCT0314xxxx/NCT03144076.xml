  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators use a randomized field experiment in Karnataka, India, to&#xD;
      measure the effects of a free inpatient public health insurance plan, Rashtriya Swasthya Bima&#xD;
      Yojana (RSBY), on health and poverty. RSBY is India's first large-scale national public&#xD;
      health insurance program, and was adopted in 2008 to cover below poverty line (BPL)&#xD;
      households. This study examines the impact of expanding RSBY to cover above poverty line&#xD;
      (APL) households that are not covered by RSBY or other secondary hospital care insurance&#xD;
      plans. The study will examine the impact of a public insurance program on a range of health&#xD;
      and economic outcomes to capture the full range of benefits from insurance. The goal of the&#xD;
      study is to quantify how the RSBY program benefits health and reduces poverty. Differences in&#xD;
      the outcomes between the treatment and control groups over the duration of the project will&#xD;
      measure the causal effect of health insurance on health and financial outcomes. The&#xD;
      investigators believe this will serve as a platform for the future of development of RSBY,&#xD;
      and provide further insight into the effectiveness of health insurance in low-income&#xD;
      countries.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study measures the impact of health insurance on healthcare utilization, health&#xD;
      expenditures, nonmedical consumption, and financial behavior of participant households. The&#xD;
      study consists of an evaluation involving households in two Indian districts of Karnataka -&#xD;
      Mysore and Gulbarga. To measure the impact, households were randomized into one of three&#xD;
      treatment groups and a control group that did not receive any intervention. Comparing&#xD;
      households' health and financial status across the control and treatment groups will identify&#xD;
      the impact of the RSBY coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INNOVATIVE ASPECTS OF THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has a number of innovative features that distinguish it from prior health insurance&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spillovers from insurance: The study attempts to estimate the impact of financial and health&#xD;
      spillovers from insurance. For example, formal health insurance may crowd out informal health&#xD;
      insurance. The investigators study such spillovers by randomizing villages to different&#xD;
      fractional allocations of households to study arms. Varying fractional allocations to each&#xD;
      study group across villages allows them to randomly vary the fraction of households in each&#xD;
      village that has insurance. This in turn yields different spillovers across villages that the&#xD;
      investigators estimate using knowledge of the fractional allocation in each village.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive impacts of sickness and insurance: The investigators study the cognitive benefits&#xD;
      of health insurance and better health. Recent research suggests that economic shocks, perhaps&#xD;
      because they cause stress, reduce the cognitive capacity of individuals. This in turn leads&#xD;
      to poor economic decision making and, perhaps, poverty traps. The investigators examine&#xD;
      whether the same logic applies to health shocks and whether health insurance ameliorates&#xD;
      negative cognitive effects associated with illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-household distribution of benefits: The investigators examine the effect of health&#xD;
      insurance on the distribution of resources within the family. By ignoring that health&#xD;
      insurance products are often designed for a household rather than for an individual (in their&#xD;
      case, with a household-level cap), existing studies are missing potentially important&#xD;
      distributional effects. The investigators also test whether health insurance is more likely&#xD;
      to benefit women and children when it is provided for free relative to when households decide&#xD;
      to purchase it. Such a behavior may arise because household willingness-to-pay for health&#xD;
      insurance and for health care may differ depending on the health status of the different&#xD;
      members of a household. This study's theoretical framework is based on the collective model&#xD;
      of household decision making, which allows the investigators to model how a policy affects&#xD;
      the distribution of resources within a household and the well-being of different household&#xD;
      members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Location: The study will be conducted in 2 districts in the state of Karnataka - Mysore&#xD;
      and Gulbarga. The study locations were determined based on the following criteria. First,&#xD;
      because the treatment group is to receive an RSBY insurance plan, the investigators selected&#xD;
      districts in which the RSBY scheme has already been rolled out. This ensures there is a local&#xD;
      insurance company able to provide RSBY coverage and hospitals with the infrastructure&#xD;
      required to process payment from RSBY insurance cards. Second, because limited hospital&#xD;
      supply can undermine the value of insurance, the investigators selected districts with&#xD;
      substantial peri-urban regions. Peri-urban areas are sufficiently developed that they have&#xD;
      adequate numbers of secondary and tertiary hospitals and a transportation network to enable&#xD;
      access by patients. The study will take place exclusively in peri-urban regions of each&#xD;
      district. Third, because study participants are drawn from the middle and upper tercile of&#xD;
      the asset distribution, the investigators selected districts in which no more than 50% of the&#xD;
      population (26% in Mysore, 48% in Gulbarga) is on the state's BPL or National Rural&#xD;
      Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) list, which comprises primarily individuals from the bottom&#xD;
      tercile of the nation's income distribution. Avoiding the poorest districts ensures a&#xD;
      reasonable yield of eligible households per district. Finally, the investigators selected a&#xD;
      state in which the local government offered substantial cooperation with their study. The&#xD;
      Minister of Labor and the chief executive officer of the local RSBY program in Karnataka are&#xD;
      enthusiastic about the study. Their hope is to learn about what works in RSBY and what does&#xD;
      not so that they can improve the program going forward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed description of Intervention: After the baseline survey, roughly 11,000 households in&#xD;
      2 districts (Mysore and Gulbarga) were randomized to either be in the control (no&#xD;
      intervention) group or one of three treatments groups. The goal was to quantify how the RSBY&#xD;
      program benefits health and reduces poverty. Differences in the outcomes between the&#xD;
      treatment and control groups over time measures the causal effect of health insurance on&#xD;
      health and financial outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental assignment process: Subjects were randomized to the four study groups using a&#xD;
      two-stage matched randomization process. First, the investigators matched villages based on&#xD;
      criteria such as village population and then randomized matched villages to different&#xD;
      fractional allocations to each study arm. Second, the investigators matched households within&#xD;
      the village based on a range of health and financial measures and then randomized matched&#xD;
      households to different arms based on the fractional allocation assigned to that village in&#xD;
      the first stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first stage was intended to allow the investigators to measure the spillover effects of&#xD;
      insurance. The second stage was intended to increase power. Matching households based on&#xD;
      characteristics before randomizing increases the statistical power of the study because it&#xD;
      increases the statistical similarity of households in a group above and beyond that from&#xD;
      randomization itself. It makes the sample even more conservative with respect to power than&#xD;
      implied by power calculations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA SOURCES The surveys were designed to gather information on not only how proving access&#xD;
      to insurance influences households' health and financial standing, but also on how households&#xD;
      interact with RSBY. The investigators will measure health-related behaviors, healthcare&#xD;
      utilization, as well as household consumption and finances, including the cost of alternative&#xD;
      methods of financing available to households. The investigators will use these outcomes to&#xD;
      inform future design of RSBY expansion and to influence the design of other health insurance&#xD;
      schemes. The study will obtain data from household surveys, special surveys following serious&#xD;
      health events, and insurance claims data. Questionnaires containing anthropometrics health&#xD;
      measurements such as height, weight, blood pressure, skin fold, lung function will also be&#xD;
      administered. Before any data collection, informed consent was (and will be) sought from all&#xD;
      participants in future surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Household listing exercise: The investigators first identified and recruited households from&#xD;
      selected villages to participate in the study. To identify these households, their survey&#xD;
      partner, the Centre for Microfinance (CMF), used the &quot;participatory rural appraisal&quot; method&#xD;
      to conduct a house-listing exercise (a social map) with residents of the village. This map&#xD;
      identified household names, locations, and assets. Households in both treatment and control&#xD;
      groups were then selected on the basis of two criteria which are discussed in the&#xD;
      'Eligibility Criteria' section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Household surveys: Several surveys will be conducted on each household, including a Baseline&#xD;
      Survey, Annual Survey, Ethnographic Survey, and Post Health Event Survey. Each survey&#xD;
      contains a common set of core questions on employment status, income, health utilization&#xD;
      (inpatient and outpatient), health expenditures (inpatient and outpatient), health status&#xD;
      (symptoms and activities of daily living (ADLs)), nonmedical consumption, productive and&#xD;
      nonproductive assets, borrowing and savings, and other investments, including education. In&#xD;
      addition, the baseline survey contained questions on household demographics and both the&#xD;
      baseline and annual surveys will ask about knowledge of and attitude toward the healthcare&#xD;
      system and facilities. Appropriate questions have been drawn from several Indian surveys&#xD;
      (e.g., the NSS socioeconomic and consumption surveys and the National Family Health and&#xD;
      District Level Household surveys), along with prior international health insurance&#xD;
      experiments. Each of these questionnaires has been previously pilot tested. The Post Health&#xD;
      Event Survey is an innovative, high-frequency survey methodology designed to capture&#xD;
      hospitalization data more efficiently. An incentive of Rs. 50 cash will be provided to&#xD;
      encourage households to cooperate with each survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administrative claims data from RSBY servers: Insofar as is possible, the investigators will&#xD;
      access data on claims filed by households and paid by the insurance company, procedures&#xD;
      performed, and date and location of those procedures. These data are available only for&#xD;
      households in the treatment group. The ratio of claims filed to claims paid is a measure of&#xD;
      the effective &quot;dosage&quot; of insurance provided to the treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POWER CALCULATIONS The investigators powered the existing study to ensure that they could&#xD;
      detect a 0.1 standard deviation (25%) change in the primary outcome, hospitalization, and a&#xD;
      1/3 standard deviation (26.5%) change in secondary outcome, financial status as proxied by a&#xD;
      composite measure of asset levels drawn from the Indian National Sample Survey (NSS) survey.&#xD;
      The investigators also padded the sample to allow for 10% attrition. The power calculations&#xD;
      required each group have roughly 2,250 households. The large sample size requirement is&#xD;
      driven primarily by the rarity of the hospitalization, roughly 2.5 per 100 persons per year&#xD;
      in Karnataka.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the investigators doubled the size of the first treatment group to account for its&#xD;
      centrality in their analysis, the sample size is 11,250 households (5 x 2,250), roughly&#xD;
      56,000 people, drawn equally from Gulbarga and Mysore districts. The investigators believe&#xD;
      that their sample makes the study the second largest health insurance experiment ever&#xD;
      conducted, the largest being the Seguro Popular study in 2009.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MANAGEMENT The study design will generate a longitudinal dataset of treatment and&#xD;
      control group households. There will be at least two waves of the data - a baseline and a&#xD;
      follow-up annual survey. In addition, those households that experience at least one serious&#xD;
      health event will be captured in a separate dataset from the Post Health Event Survey. This&#xD;
      longitudinal framework will allow the investigators to measure the effect of RSBY on the&#xD;
      outcomes mentioned in specific aims. Randomization of households to the treatment and control&#xD;
      groups eliminates the risk of household-specific confounding effects on outcomes. The use of&#xD;
      a baseline survey minimizes the risk of time varying confounders that are common across&#xD;
      households, and improves precision. Regression and statistical analysis will be used to&#xD;
      analyze the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be stored in encrypted files that only key research team members have access to.&#xD;
      Personally identifying information will be delinked completely from the dataset before&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
