  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disease with a broad&#xD;
      diversity of symptoms and fluctuating progression patterns. Clinical assessments are&#xD;
      challenging and are continually reviewed and enhanced. Optimal multiple sclerosis care&#xD;
      depends on early detection of disease progression. The Digital self-Assessment for Multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis (DAM) mobile program was developed by Ad Scientiam in order to create a robust and&#xD;
      clinically validated remote monitoring platform for MS patients and clinicians. The&#xD;
      correlation between DAM version 0 (the first iteration of DAMS) and Multiple Sclerosis&#xD;
      Functional Composite (MSFC) has been clinically evaluated in a preliminary study in 30&#xD;
      subjects. DAM version 0 and MFSC global scores were correlated. However, the cognition test&#xD;
      had a poor reproducibility and clinicians expressed the wish to measure a walking range&#xD;
      rather than a walking speed. Even though vision is the main sense impacting all other tests,&#xD;
      particularly when interacting with a mobile, visual tests are rarely performed in real life.&#xD;
      A new version of DAM version 0, DAMS, was therefore developed with the addition of the Sloan&#xD;
      Low Contrast Letter Acuity Test (SLCLAT), the replacement of the walking speed test with a&#xD;
      walking distance test and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) by a new version of&#xD;
      the cognitive test which resembles the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that systematic and prospective multi-dimensional data collection of MS&#xD;
      disabilities through the DAMS mobile application will refine the quality and accuracy of both&#xD;
      clinicians and patients' knowledge of the disease progression and will ultimately improve the&#xD;
      current care of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this assumption, the statistician will analyze:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The global diagnostic performance of DAMS with (DAMS 4 tests) and without (DAMS 3 tests)&#xD;
           the low contrast vision test versus standard MS scales&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The test-retest reliability of DAMS' scores at a 15 day interval&#xD;
