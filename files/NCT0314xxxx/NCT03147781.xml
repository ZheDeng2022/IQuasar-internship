  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to function as a pilot study in evaluating the effects of auricular&#xD;
      therapy (AT) on lactation for women in the immediate post cesarean period while examining the&#xD;
      feasibility of the three-parallel-arm, sham-controlled randomized design. The study&#xD;
      hypothesizes that post cesarean women who receive AT with standard care for 96 hours&#xD;
      postpartum have earlier onset of lactogenesis II and larger milk production when compared&#xD;
      with women who receive sham AT with standard care or standard care alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breastfeeding has been of major concern in maternal-child healthcare. Challenges posed by&#xD;
      cesarean delivery can have negative impacts on breastfeeding. Efforts to facilitate, support,&#xD;
      and sustain breastfeeding have been investigated to a great extent by researchers from a&#xD;
      variety of disciplines. In the field of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), a number of&#xD;
      clinical studies have been carried out to study the effect of auricular therapy (AT) on&#xD;
      postpartum lactation over the years. Limitations in the evidence that currently exists&#xD;
      include the lack of randomization, sham-controlled treatment, blinding and/or no valid&#xD;
      outcome measures. Given that such information is important for maternal-child health and&#xD;
      clinical practice, the study has set out to conduct a pilot trial which employs randomized,&#xD;
      single-blinded, and sham group design that examines relevant outcomes using valid&#xD;
      measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 96 post cesarean participants have been randomly assigned to one of three&#xD;
      treatment conditions: (1) standard care (n=32); (2) standard care with Medulla Junci adhesive&#xD;
      on auricular acupoints (n=32); (3) standard care with magnetic pellets adhesive on auricular&#xD;
      acupoints (n=32). The standard care group participants only received the standard post&#xD;
      cesarean care of the study hospital without any additional therapies. The same set of six&#xD;
      pre-specified auricular points were adopted for both Medulla Junci and magnetic pellets&#xD;
      groups. The treatment was initiated within 4 to 8 hours post cesarean for 96 hours during&#xD;
      their hospital stay at a maternal hospital in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Milk production and onset of lactogenesis II have been used as primary outcome variables for&#xD;
      the evaluation of the effectiveness of AT. Milk production is determined by the summed value&#xD;
      of infant test weighing measurements and expressed breast milk. Maternal perceptions of&#xD;
      breast fullness, swelling, leakage, or tingling are the indicator of onset of lactogenesis&#xD;
      II. The secondary outcome measures are infant behaviors of observed swallowing and rooting&#xD;
      during breastfeeding, neonatal weight gain, and frequencies of urination and defecation of&#xD;
      the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numeric rating scales have been used to measure the effect of the possible mediating&#xD;
      variables, i.e., pain and stress. Potential confounding variables have been controlled by&#xD;
      either stratified randomization and exclusion criteria or monitored during the study period.&#xD;
      Treatment expectation and satisfaction toward AT have been assessed in order to examine their&#xD;
      relationship with therapy outcomes. Main components of study feasibility, i.e., recruitment,&#xD;
      retention, and acceptance, have been evaluated. Participants also have been contacted to&#xD;
      acquire their one and three-month breastfeeding practice status.&#xD;

    <description>Maternal perception of breast symptoms of lactation, i.e., breast fullness, swelling, leakage, or tingling, are employed in identifying onset of lactogenesis II. Assessment of maternal perception began within 4 to 8 hours postpartum. Participants was instructed to record the approximate time when breast symptoms of lactation first noticed. They was interviewed regarding these breast symptoms twice daily during their hospital stay.</description>
