  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to describe the evolution of hypodopaminergic syndrome in&#xD;
      patients with Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients to be included have been clinically described in the early phase of their&#xD;
      disease, before instauration of dopaminergic treatment, in the context of a former study&#xD;
      (&quot;Non Motor Aspects in De Novo Parkinson's Disease (Honeymoon) NCT02786667&quot;) between june&#xD;
      2012 and june 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 to 5 years after this study, those patients who started dopaminergic treatment will be&#xD;
      evaluated again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study, which takes place 3 to 5 year after the initial evaluation, is&#xD;
      to measure the evolution of apathy and other symptoms of the hypodopaminergic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are the evolution of other parameters including pain, personality and&#xD;
      behavior. All parameters measured have been determined of each patient in the Honeymoon&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    <description>Evolution of hypodopaminergic symptoms in Patients with Parkinson's disease under dopaminergic treatment. Hypodopaminergic symptoms are evaluated with different scales: ECMP (behavioral evaluation in Parkinsons's disease) for depression and anxiety, STAI (State-trait-anxiety inventory, self-assessment-questionnaire for anxiety, BDI (Beck depression inventory) for depression, PFS-16 (Piper Fatigue Sale) for fatigue. Hypodopaminergia is the expressed as the sum of its symptoms.</description>
