  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalization for allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation constitutes a&#xD;
      particular time in the management of patients with malignant hemopathies both for the&#xD;
      patient, for his entourage or for the nursing staff. For the patient, the strict protective&#xD;
      isolation set up during this period is a source of isolation in the broad sense and is&#xD;
      associated with an escape from external events and society. It also constitutes a physical&#xD;
      barrier (mask, charlotte, surblouse and overshoes worn by caregivers or visitors) and even&#xD;
      psychological in relations with relatives. Moreover, this period is also difficult because of&#xD;
      the possible complications of conditioning (mucositis, transit disorders, fever ...) and&#xD;
      allograft itself (graft versus host disease, no transplant, relapse diseaseâ€¦). The patient&#xD;
      may be weakened and diminished, which can give a feeling of helplessness and uselessness to&#xD;
      the family. Finally, this therapy can have serious physical and psychological consequences&#xD;
      for the patient and his entourage (especially in the case of family allograft) who do not&#xD;
      always have the possibility to express themselves verbally. Published studies in hematology&#xD;
      report depressive, anxious and post-traumatic stress disorders in patients and relatives&#xD;
      during allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. It is therefore important to&#xD;
      reduce these symptoms, particularly those related to the cut-off during hospitalization for&#xD;
      allogeneic haematopoietic stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last decade or so, the logbook has been used in some resuscitation services in&#xD;
      intubated patients, with the main objective of filling the &quot;memory gap&quot; mentioned by the&#xD;
      intubated patients when they woke up and limiting the trauma associated with this Cut in the&#xD;
      world corresponding to the sedation period. For this purpose, the use of a logbook in&#xD;
      Hematology, by analogy with what is used in the resuscitation services, could be a means of&#xD;
      limiting the psychological complications related to the allograft.&#xD;
