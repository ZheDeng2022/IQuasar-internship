    <textblock>
      The Articulating Oral Airway (AOA) is a novel oral airway which actively displaces the&#xD;
      tongue, allowing for a greater cross-sectional area for mask ventilation. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that, in patients with predictors for difficult mask ventilation, the AOA will be&#xD;
      non-inferior to the Geudel oral airway in terms of expired tidal volumes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Difficult mask ventilation (MV) is common in the obese population and can result in patient&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. The Articulating Oral Airway (AOA) is a novel oral airway which&#xD;
      actively displaces the tongue, allowing for a greater cross-sectional area for MV. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that, while using the same ventilatory pressure in neuromuscularly&#xD;
      blocked patients with predictors for difficult mask ventilation, MV with an AOA will not&#xD;
      result in smaller expired tidal volumes than MV with a similarly sized Guedel oral airway&#xD;
      (GDA). In other words, the AOA will be non-inferior to the GDA in terms of expired tidal&#xD;
      volumes.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Anesthesia facemasks will be opacified so that the clinical provider will be blinded to which oral airway (Guedel vs AOA) is being used and in what order. The patient will be anesthetized and thus blinded. The Investigator and Outcomes Assessor will only see video of the data on the anesthesia monitor (not the patient/device/etc) and will thus be blinded. The only individuals who will not be blinded are the Research Assistants who will not be involved in data analysis.</masking_description>

    <description>Measured expiratory tidal volume (from video of anesthesia monitor). Each participant had measurements collected during breaths number 6-10 after the insertion of each oral airway (GOA or AOA) with the order of first treatment randomized. The average expiratory tidal volumes reported were weight standardized per kilogram of participant's body weight, meaning the expiratory measurements were divided by the participant's weight (kg). A total of 56 patients were enrolled and randomized--28 received the Guedel Oral Airway first and 28 received the Articulated Oral Airway first. The average expiratory values are reported as outlined in table below:&#xD;

        <description>Measured expiratory tidal volume (from video of anesthesia monitor). Each participant had measurements collected during breaths number 6-10 after the insertion of each oral airway (GOA or AOA) with the order of first treatment randomized. The average expiratory tidal volumes reported were weight standardized per kilogram of participant's body weight, meaning the expiratory measurements were divided by the participant's weight (kg). A total of 56 patients were enrolled and randomized--28 received the Guedel Oral Airway first and 28 received the Articulated Oral Airway first. The average expiratory values are reported as outlined in table below:&#xD;
