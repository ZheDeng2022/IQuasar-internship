    <textblock>
      This study proposes to evaluate the accuracy of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in&#xD;
      diagnosing abdominal solid organ injuries in pediatric patients. 146 subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled across approximately 8 sites in the US. All subjects will have had a Computerized&#xD;
      Tomography (CT) scan as part of standard of care, confirming at least one solid organ&#xD;
      abdominal injury. All subjects will have an abdominal ultrasound without contrast, followed&#xD;
      by a contrast-enhanced ultrasound using the contrast agent Lumason. Ultrasound and&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced ultrasound results will be compared to the CT scan results. The study&#xD;
      procedures will take place within 48 hours of injury.&#xD;

      Ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound results will be compared to the CT scan results.&#xD;
      The study procedures will take place within 48 hours of injury. At conclusion of enrollment&#xD;
      of all subjects a centralized review of CT vs. CEUS will occur to compare to real time&#xD;
      readings.&#xD;
