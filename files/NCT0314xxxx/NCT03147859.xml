      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In nearly all people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, immunity cannot&#xD;
      either control or eradicate the infection. There are good medicinal treatments, collectively&#xD;
      called &quot;ART&quot; (antiretroviral therapy) which control HIV infection by suppressing the virus in&#xD;
      the bloodstream. ART is needed for life, and if a person stops taking ART the HIV infection&#xD;
      returns in the bloodstream. So, there is good treatment, but no cure. The researchers want to&#xD;
      test whether a period of treatment with vedolizumab can be used to control HIV infection in&#xD;
      the bloodstream in persons with HIV on ART, after stopping ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether vedolizumab is safe and tolerable in people with HIV, to assess the&#xD;
      safety of an analytical treatment interruption (ATI), and to determine whether vedolizumab&#xD;
      can control HIV infection in the bloodstream without the use of ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults 18-65 with HIV who are being treated with ART&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with: Physical exam, medical history, blood and urine tests&#xD;
      Participants will have a baseline visit which will include repeat of the screening testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then present for their first study visit which will include: receiving&#xD;
      vedolizumab infusions through an arm vein, repeats of the baseline testing. Participants will&#xD;
      then have serial visits on a pre-specific schedule to receive ongoing vedolizumab doses every&#xD;
      2-4 weeks until week 20. Each visit will also include repeat of the baseline tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After week 6 and before week 7 patients will discontinue ART. After the final infusion of&#xD;
      vedolizumab at week 20 patients will continue to be assessed with physical exam, medical&#xD;
      history, and repeat of the baseline testing every 4 weeks up to 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ART will be re-started for participants if the level of HIV in the blood becomes too high,&#xD;
      persists for too long, or if the CD4 count decreases by too much.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      HIV is a chronic active infection of lymphocytes and monocytoid cells resulting in a&#xD;
      progressive and profound depletion of T cell subsets and ultimately in acquired immune&#xD;
      deficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV infects cells of the immune system throughout the body and&#xD;
      may cause an active cytolytic infection in activated lymphocytes, become dormant as a latent&#xD;
      infection in resting lymphocytes, or continue as a chronically active infection in&#xD;
      macrophages. Continuous anti-retroviral drug treatment (ART) suppresses virus within the&#xD;
      bloodstream and allows some degree of immune healing so as to permit near-normal health and&#xD;
      life expectancy. However, interruption of ART is uniformly followed by rebound of viremia as&#xD;
      a result of ongoing chronic active infection, and reactivation of latent infection.&#xD;
      Successful ART requires daily medications indefinitely. There is an ongoing need for&#xD;
      treatments which are more effective in the eradication of HIV. Counter to past expectations&#xD;
      for cell-mediated immunity, broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nmAb) have been&#xD;
      developed which show anti-HIV activity in vivo in reducing viremia (plasma virus load, PVL),&#xD;
      and in slightly reducing recurrence of lasting PVL following analytical treatment&#xD;
      interruption (ATI). Monoclonal antibody therapies against host cellular markers such as HIV&#xD;
      co-receptors have been put forward as potential strategy in immunological treatment of HIV&#xD;
      infection. If activated lymphocytes could be protected from cytolytic HIV infection in the&#xD;
      presence of concurrent active HIV infection of other cells and tissues, then unperturbed&#xD;
      potent acquired specific or innate immunity might confer lasting immunological remission of&#xD;
      HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This year, an unexpected finding of sustained remission of plasma viremia level (PVL) to&#xD;
      below quantifiable assay limits in a rhesus macaque SIV infection model of AIDS was reported.&#xD;
      The envelope of SIV (and HIV) appears to interact with α4β7 integrin, a lymphocyte homing&#xD;
      receptor for trafficking to gut mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) that was the target&#xD;
      of mAb treatment in this study. This study showed that in animals treated with the mAb while&#xD;
      discontinuing ART there was a diminished rebound and sustained remission of PVL, and less&#xD;
      GALT associated viral load for a long-lasting period of at least 24 months. The mechanism of&#xD;
      this unexpected post-treatment effect is unknown. In humans infected with HIV, such an effect&#xD;
      sustained over time with continued remission of progressive immunodeficiency would meet&#xD;
      definitional criteria of &quot;functional cure&quot; of HIV/AIDS. The results observed in the SIV model&#xD;
      reveal a promising avenue for investigation in this area of research towards control of HIV&#xD;
      infection in absence of ART. We propose to assess the safety and tolerability of anti-α4β7&#xD;
      integrin monoclonal antibody in healthy HIV-infected adults on ART, to assess the safety of&#xD;
      ATI and whether anti-α4β7 integrin monoclonal antibody treatment can induce sustained&#xD;
      virologic remission in the absence of ART.&#xD;

    <description>* Please note that the previous low dose arm was 75mg of vedolizumab per infusion, but no participant was ever given this dose. The study will have a 20-week treatment phase and a 28-week follow-up phase over one year. Intravenous infusion of 150 mg of vedolizumab per infusion per visit schedule will be administered to 4 participants. The visit schedule will be the same for each group - Infusion at weeks 0, 2, 5, 8 and every 4 weeks thereafter up to 40 weeks for at least 7 doses as tolerated. ATI will begin between weeks 6 and 7, and infusions continued at weeks 8, 12, 16 and 20.</description>
