  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this project is to determine if the intranasal administration of&#xD;
      naloxone during exercise will be a novel approach to preserve the counterregulatory response&#xD;
      to hypoglycemia experienced the next day in patients with type 1 diabetes. Exercise induced&#xD;
      autonomic failure contributes to the development of impaired awareness of hypoglycemia.&#xD;
      Treatments that blunt the consequences of exercise induced autonomic failure, such as&#xD;
      preserving the post-exercise counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia, may improve&#xD;
      awareness of hypoglycemia. Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, is an extremely promising agent.&#xD;
      In healthy volunteers, intravenous administration of naloxone during exercise preserved the&#xD;
      counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia the following day (1). In this study,&#xD;
      investigators will extend the clinical applicability by administering intranasal naloxone to&#xD;
      individuals with type 1 diabetes. Specifically, the investigators will use a randomized,&#xD;
      placebo controlled, crossover design to administer drug or placebo to patients with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes during acute exercise and assess the counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia the&#xD;
      following day. The use of intranasal naloxone is a highly innovative aspect of this proposal.&#xD;
      Intranasal naloxone translates readily to clinical use and, as demonstrated by the&#xD;
      investigators preliminary data, achieves similar plasma drug concentrations as after IV&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Type 1 diabetes diagnosed on clinical grounds (history of DKA, use of insulin within 6&#xD;
             months of diagnosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diabetes duration &lt; 30 years (impaired awareness of hypoglycemia increases with&#xD;
             duration so it will be more likely that shorter duration participants will have&#xD;
             hypoglycemia awareness) but &gt; 2 years (to ensure that they have lost hypoglycemia&#xD;
             induced glucagon secretion as is typical in patients who develop impaired awareness of&#xD;
             hypoglycemia)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 - 65 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline hemoglobin A1C 6.8 - 9.0% (range selected to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia&#xD;
             and uncontrolled diabetes in the weeks before the study, both of which may affect the&#xD;
             responses to hypoglycemia)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Awareness of hypoglycemia as verified by Cox questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of stroke, seizures (other than those related to hypoglycemia), arrhythmias,&#xD;
             active cardiac disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hypertension or blood pressure &gt; 140/95 mm Hg at screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or plan to become pregnant during the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Health related limitations in exercise (including but not limited to: angina,&#xD;
             uncontrolled asthma, peripheral arterial disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwillingness to avoid exercise during the 7 days before each part of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant medical problems that may prevent the participant from successfully&#xD;
             completing the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Smoking as defined by 2 or more tobacco cigarettes a week&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Daily use of opioids or an opioid antagonist or use in the past two weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwillingness to wear a continuous glucose monitor for one week before and one week&#xD;
             after each part of the study&#xD;
