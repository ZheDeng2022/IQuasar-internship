  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People living with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) need dialysis or transplantation in order&#xD;
      to stay alive. This illness and treatment significantly impact peoples' health, emotions,&#xD;
      work and relationships. To promote person-centred care, healthcare professionals should be&#xD;
      asking patients about what matters to them and using this feedback to plan and deliver care.&#xD;
      Patient-reported outcome and experience questionnaires (jointly referred to as PROs) allow&#xD;
      patients to provide information about their quality of life, symptoms and experiences with&#xD;
      care. PROs are increasingly used to help healthcare professionals learn about what is&#xD;
      important to patients and the impacts of illness or treatments from patients' point of view.&#xD;
      Embedding feedback from patients into routine clinical practice is important in end-stage&#xD;
      kidney disease because of the physical and quality of life challenges these patients face&#xD;
      when living with kidney failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROs provide vital and often missing information that the healthcare team can use to support&#xD;
      patients. However, PROs administered via paper questionnaires have been perceived as&#xD;
      cumbersome, difficult to integrate with other health information and do not provide immediate&#xD;
      feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research, home dialysis patients will have the opportunity to complete electronically&#xD;
      administered PROs (ePROs) and healthcare professionals will receive education about how to&#xD;
      use PRO information. The goal is to learn how to support healthcare professionals to&#xD;
      routinely use this information to inform patient care, and see if this makes a difference in&#xD;
      patients' symptoms, person-centred care, quality of life and satisfaction with care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Learning what matters most to patients is essential for healthcare professionals to provide&#xD;
      person-centred care. This research will address the gap in our understanding of how to best&#xD;
      use patients' reports in healthcare. Findings of this research may ultimately improve the&#xD;
      quality of healthcare for Canadians living with end-stage kidney disease.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Understand the process of supporting clinicians to utilize PROs in multidisciplinary,&#xD;
           home dialysis practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine to what extent utilization of PRO information is associated with differences in&#xD;
           symptoms and person-centred care [primary outcomes], as well as satisfaction with care,&#xD;
           utilization of health services, mental health, and QOL [secondary outcomes].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve these goals, a mixed methods design of process evaluation will be used to compare&#xD;
      two groups: Northern and Southern Alberta Renal Programs, NARP (Edmonton) and SARP (Calgary).&#xD;
      In Edmonton (Intervention group), patients and clinicians will be invited to participate in&#xD;
      the study. Only patients will be invited to take part in the study in Calgary (Comparison&#xD;
      group). The research study will be undertaken collaboratively with a Patient Advisory&#xD;
      Committee and knowledge users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will be conducted among patients receiving home dialysis across Alberta Kidney&#xD;
      Care, from its two units: Aberhart Clinic in the Northern Alberta Renal Program (NARP), and&#xD;
      Sheldon M. Chumir Health Centre in the Southern Alberta Renal Program (SARP). NARP and SARP&#xD;
      have 305 and 350 home dialysis patients respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided into two phases: Phase 1-Year 1 (Usability Testing) and Phase 2-Year 2&#xD;
      (Evaluation). SARP and NARP participants will be invited to complete ePROs for each of their&#xD;
      scheduled appointments, every three months, throughout Phases 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In NARP, the intervention group, interested patients will be approached and consent will be&#xD;
      obtained. Before the clinic visit, the patient will complete a demographic survey, and the&#xD;
      Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale revised for renal patients (ESASr:Renal) using Cambian&#xD;
      Navigator, a web-based ePRO system hosted by Cambian Business Services Inc. Survey results&#xD;
      will be printed and given to the nurse, transcribed and placed in the patient' chart as well&#xD;
      as on their electronic chart. NARP patients will also complete the Kidney Disease Quality of&#xD;
      Life (KDQOL-36), the Patient Assessment of Care for Chronic Conditions (PACIC-20), and the&#xD;
      EQ-5D-5L after their clinic appointment. These 3 outcome evaluation measures will not be&#xD;
      included in patient charts, or be used by clinicians at point of care. Usability testing and&#xD;
      formative evaluation with NARP patients will also include up to 5 focus groups and 10&#xD;
      interviews to discuss how they would like their PRO information to be used by clinicians.&#xD;
      Usability testing and formative evaluation with NARP multidisciplinary clinicians will&#xD;
      include a series of focus groups (3-4) to discuss the ideal process for ePROs surveys to be&#xD;
      integrated in existing work structures. Findings from these focus groups will be used to&#xD;
      refine the targeted workshops provided as an intervention in Phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In SARP, the comparator group, all patients meeting inclusion criteria will be invited to&#xD;
      complete the consent form, demographic survey, and the ePRO survey tools collected in NARP,&#xD;
      but not to participate in focus groups and interviews. The ePRO surveys will not be seen by&#xD;
      the clinicians, but they will be informed of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a prospective design, the workshops (intervention) will occur in NARP. Clinicians will&#xD;
      receive ePRO feedback as well as targeted education about how to use PRO information.&#xD;
      Workshops will be offered every 1.5 months over the 6-month intervention period. Evaluation&#xD;
      survey feedback will be sought at the end of each workshop to tailor information to&#xD;
      clinicians' needs. In NARP, patients will continue to complete the PRO surveys before and&#xD;
      after their clinic appointments. If other PRO measures are requested by clinicians in Phase&#xD;
      1, these will be added to Phase 2 data collection. Additionally, clinicians will be invited&#xD;
      to complete an anonymous ticky-box form every 2 weeks, indicating if they reviewed the PRO&#xD;
      information, and changed their decision-making based on the PRO information. All NARP&#xD;
      clinicians will also be invited to participate in 1 interview (n=20). They will be asked to&#xD;
      share examples of how they have used PRO information in their practice, and the challenges,&#xD;
      benefits and facilitators of integrating ePROs in practice. Patient participants will also be&#xD;
      invited to take part in a focus group (n=6) or interview (n=6) to discuss how they see&#xD;
      clinicians following up on their PRO information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In SARP, clinicians will provide usual care. Clinicians will not receive PRO information or&#xD;
      participate in workshops. Education will be provide to SARP clinicians following completion&#xD;
      of the study, as a form of knowledge translation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive methods and statistical tests will be used to examine the trajectories of outcome&#xD;
      measures for patients in the comparator and intervention groups. The area under the curve&#xD;
      (AUC) will be calculated for each trajectory during the period that the patient is&#xD;
      participating to create a summary score. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used as the&#xD;
      method of analysis to compare AUC scores of outcomes of both groups while controlling for&#xD;
      within- and between-group differences, such as comorbidities, gender, age and dialysis type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data from focus groups and interviews will be recorded, transcribed verbatim and&#xD;
      analyzed using the methodology of interpretive description. NVIVO, a qualitative software&#xD;
      system, will be used to create a filing system and coding database. The first focus&#xD;
      group/interview transcript in each phase will be read and re-read to generate an initial&#xD;
      codebook. The codebooks will be iteratively refined throughout the analysis. Codes will be&#xD;
      categorized and analyzed thematically. Patient and clinician data will be analyzed&#xD;
      separately. Differences between pre- and post-implementation in NARP will also be examined.&#xD;

    <description>Assessed using one item added to the end of the Patient Assessment of Care for Chronic Conditions 20 item questionnaire (PACIC-20) related to care received. This item is from the NHS Outpatient Survey (2011). (RateClin) related to care received on a Likert-type scale from Excellent = 1 to Very Poor = 6. Min = 1, max = 6. The number of patients who selected &quot;1 - Excellent&quot; was tabulated and compared between the two groups. The higher the number the more patients who felt the care provided to them was excellent.</description>

    <measure>Mental Health - Trajectory of Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Trajectories of up to 24 months from start of enrollment to study completion</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using the SF-12 mental component summary (MCS) subscale in the Kidney Disease Quality of Life 36-item Short-Form Survey (KDQOL-36). The SF-12 uses 2 items (psychological distress and psychological well being) to measure the MCS score. The summary score is transformed using Canadian norm-based scoring. The scores ranged from 0 (worst health) to 100 (best health). The higher the score the better the mental health.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life - Trajectory of Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Trajectories of up to 24 months from start of enrollment to study completion</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using the Euro Quality of Life EQ-5D-5L. This assessment uses a descriptive system for health-related Quality of Life states in adults consisting of 5 dimensions; Mobility, Self-Care, Usual Activities, Pain/Discomfort, and Anxiety/Depression. Each dimension is scored between 1 = indicating no problem and 5 = indicating unable to/extreme problems. An EQ-5D summary index is derived by applying a formula (the Canadian standard value set) that attaches values (weights) to each of the levels in each dimension. Index min= 0.0 max = 1.0. The higher the index the better the quality of life/state of health.</description>

          <description>In this study arm home dialysis clinic patient participants completed Electronic Patient Reported Outcome Measures (ePRO) every three months, the ePRO results for the ESASr were given to the nurse and placed in the patient chart (paper and electronic). This process helps to facilitate real time Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) data collection and feedback in clinical practice.&#xD;
Educational Training and Support was provided to the multidisciplinary home dialysis clinicians on how to use the results of the patient completed ePROs routinely in their practice to support ongoing patient care.&#xD;

        <title>Quality of Life - Trajectory of Change</title>
        <description>Assessed using the Euro Quality of Life EQ-5D-5L. This assessment uses a descriptive system for health-related Quality of Life states in adults consisting of 5 dimensions; Mobility, Self-Care, Usual Activities, Pain/Discomfort, and Anxiety/Depression. Each dimension is scored between 1 = indicating no problem and 5 = indicating unable to/extreme problems. An EQ-5D summary index is derived by applying a formula (the Canadian standard value set) that attaches values (weights) to each of the levels in each dimension. Index min= 0.0 max = 1.0. The higher the index the better the quality of life/state of health.</description>
