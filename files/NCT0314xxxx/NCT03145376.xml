  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since October of 2014, the Policlinico Umberto I Hospital has an &quot;Heart Team&quot;, a group of&#xD;
      selected specialists with the task of assessing and identifying eligible patients for&#xD;
      valvular aortic transcatheter implantation (TAVI) or a placement of a MitraClip .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specialists taking part to Heart Team are: a cardiologist, a heart surgeon, a vascular&#xD;
      surgeon, an anesthesiologist and a geriatrician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Geriatrician is called to make a careful multidimensional assessment of the elderly&#xD;
      patients who have been suggested for the interventions mentioned above. His role is to assess&#xD;
      the degree of co-morbidity and polypathology, autonomy in the common activities of daily&#xD;
      living, nutritional status, cognitive status and quality of life. Following this evaluation,&#xD;
      together with the other components of Heart Team, it is expressed a collective judgment on&#xD;
      the patient's eligibility to these interventions. So, the aim of the present study is to&#xD;
      identify changes in the degree of cognitive decline, of autonomy in carrying out activities&#xD;
      of daily living, quality of life, nutritional status, pre- and postoperatively (6 months&#xD;
      after the procedure) polypathology degree in elderly patients to be undergone or undergoing&#xD;
      TAVI or positioning MitraClip because suffering from aortic valvular stenosis or severe&#xD;
      mitral insufficiency. The patients undergo to a battery of tests, to a 5 minutes&#xD;
      electrocardiographic record to evaluate the Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and to a complete&#xD;
      echocardiographic evaluation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aortic stenosis (AS) is a progressive chronic valvular disease that progressively and rapidly&#xD;
      leads to the development of heart failure. This pathology, which is typical of the elderly,&#xD;
      is increasing together with the age of the population and it is a candidate for the&#xD;
      development of less invasive and innovative therapies that enable the treatment of older&#xD;
      patients with polypathology and high degree of comorbidity. According to the most recent&#xD;
      guidelines for the treatment of valvular heart disease, the degenerative AS is the most&#xD;
      common valve disease in Western countries especially in the group aged over 65 years. The&#xD;
      degenerative AS, in its most severe form, is a highly debilitating chronic condition&#xD;
      characterized by symptoms as such precordial pain suggestive of angina, transient altered&#xD;
      state of consciousness, or syncope, dyspnea and other heart failure symptoms secondary to&#xD;
      reduced stroke volume. A recent systematic review (2) estimated the prevalence of AS in the&#xD;
      elderly population aged over 75 years amounted to 12.4% while the prevalence of severe AS&#xD;
      amounted to 3.4%. The average survival after the onset of symptoms is about 2-3 years. The&#xD;
      natural history of the disease is not modified by conservative treatment and, to date, the&#xD;
      surgical aortic valve replacement is recommended by both the American and European guidelines&#xD;
      for patients with severe symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with reduced ejection fraction&#xD;
      (80 years obtain appreciable results with a less than 10% mortality and morbidity between 5&#xD;
      and 10%. Some conditions, such as the presence of comorbidities (chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease, vasculopathy, chronic renal failure, dementia and other) and the advanced&#xD;
      age of the patients, make the surgery too risky or impossible to achieve. Therefore,&#xD;
      approximately one third of patients in advanced age is not currently subjected to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the &quot;first man&quot; made in 2002, TAVI has been introduced in the clinic in 2007 and has&#xD;
      quickly gained critical acclaim. Up to now, about 150,000 TAVI procedures were performed with&#xD;
      a growing trend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methodical approach of the techniques involve various approaches: transfemoral,&#xD;
      transapical, (the two most popular), transaxillary, transaortic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enormous diffusion of the method follows the growing demand. Conservative treatment of&#xD;
      the SA guarantees any improvement; optimized drugs therapy is able nor to mitigate the&#xD;
      symptomatology associated nor to resolve the underlying disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgery requires the use of extracorporeal circulation and, although conducted in the&#xD;
      less invasive way possible, it remains an intervention in which elderly patients with&#xD;
      polypathology and high degree of comorbidity are hardly addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical evaluation and multidimensional geriatric assessment are indispensable to ensure a&#xD;
      correct diagnosis of the patient, estimating the risk of periprocedural mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity and evaluate the actual possibility of intervention benefit on the patient's&#xD;
      overall health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MitraClip&#xD;
&#xD;
      The severe mitral regurgitation is a clear indication to intervention of mitral repair which&#xD;
      has advantages compared to traditional surgery, preserving the contractile function of the&#xD;
      left ventricle, reducing the incidence of adverse events related to the system of the&#xD;
      prosthesis, by reducing the hospital mortality, morbidity and hospitalization, improving the&#xD;
      long-term survival. The surgical risk of mitral plastic surgery presents a percentage lower&#xD;
      than 2.5% in the centers that perform no less than 140 operations per year. However, an&#xD;
      ejection fraction (FE) of the left ventricle lower than 55% is a negative prognostic index.&#xD;
      In addition, the mitral plastic surgery has a long and difficult learning curves, but also&#xD;
      the indisputable advantage of less invasiveness than traditional surgery, which allows its&#xD;
      use even in patients deemed to be at higher operative risk. The placement of a MitraClip is&#xD;
      the evolution of conventional surgery (Alfieri's speech): percutaneous, trans-septal&#xD;
      puncture, placing clips on the mitral leaflets to create a dual orifice and therefore&#xD;
      decrease or completely abolish the valve insufficiency . The EVEREST II study has shown that&#xD;
      this procedure is less effective than surgery in reducing the degree of mitral regurgitation,&#xD;
      but the percutaneous repair of mitral regurgitation is more secure and has shown improved&#xD;
      clinical outcomes, comparable to cardiac surgery. At a post-hoc analysis, patients who&#xD;
      benefit most from the MitraClip patients are elderly with low ejection fraction and&#xD;
      functional mitral insufficiency. Considering that the prevalence of mitral insufficiency in&#xD;
      the elderly is 30-50%, it is comprehensible how the MitraClip will have certain evolution in&#xD;
      numerical terms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MitraClip is, therefore, a valid therapeutic option in case of functional mitral&#xD;
      regurgitation, since the surgery in these patients is burdened with high mortality, by high&#xD;
      recurrence of mitral regurgitation and a long hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MitraClip is to be used in a small number of properly selected patients. The procedural&#xD;
      success depends on the ability to choose an individualized therapy for each patient depending&#xD;
      on valvular anatomy, valve functionality, on comorbidities and on patient's life expectation,&#xD;
      performing an estimation of the risk-benefit of the two percutaneous techniques and surgical&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This estimate and evaluation of the patient must be operated in the geriatric&#xD;
      multidisciplinary field, to ensure a comprehensive risk assessment of patients and their best&#xD;
      selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identify changes in the degree of cognitive decline, of autonomy in carrying out activities&#xD;
      of daily living, quality of life, nutritional status, pre- and postoperatively (6 months&#xD;
      after the procedure) polypathology degree in elderly patients to be undergone or undergoing&#xD;
      TAVI or positioning MitraClip because suffering from aortic valvular stenosis or severe&#xD;
      mitral insufficiency. The patients undergo to a battery of tests, to a 5 minutes&#xD;
      electrocardiographic record to evaluate the Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and to a complete&#xD;
      echocardiographic evaluation.&#xD;
