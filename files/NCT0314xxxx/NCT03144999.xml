  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss in individuals&#xD;
      over age 60. AMD is classified as wet and dry. Wet AMD constitutes 10 to 15% of all cases of&#xD;
      AMD and occurs when an abnormal blood vessel grows in or under the retina leading to central&#xD;
      vision loss. Wet AMD is successfully treated with injections in the eye on a monthly basis&#xD;
      that stop the blood vessel from growing and leaking. The most common form of AMD is the dry&#xD;
      variant or dry AMD that affects 85 to 90% of all patients with AMD. In dry AMD, there is loss&#xD;
      of retinal pigment, formation of deposits called drusen, and loss of the vessels in a layer&#xD;
      of the retina called the choriocapillaris. In the most severe forms of dry AMD there is loss&#xD;
      of retinal tissue called geographic atrophy. Over time retinal tissue degenerates in the area&#xD;
      responsible for central vision leading to vision loss leading to legal blindness. Currently&#xD;
      no treatment for dry AMD exists so that there is a significant unmet need in patients with&#xD;
      this ocular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, evidence has implicated an overactive inflammatory cascade called the complement&#xD;
      system as playing a pivotal role in the development of dry AMD. The complement cascade&#xD;
      consists of 3 arms that converge to form a pore-like complex on the surface of cells called&#xD;
      the membrane attack complex (MAC). Accumulation of MAC on cell surfaces leads to cell damage&#xD;
      and death causing the clinical findings seen in AMD. Normal cells within the human body&#xD;
      produce a protein on their cell surfaces called CD59 that blocks the MAC from forming. In&#xD;
      AMD, the complement cascade is upregulated and leads to more MAC formation than the body can&#xD;
      protect itself against leading to cell destruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AAVCAGsCD59, an ocular gene therapy product that is injected in to the eye in the physician's&#xD;
      office, causes normal retinal cells to increase the expression of a soluble form of CD59&#xD;
      (sCD59). This soluble recombinant version of the naturally occurring CD59 is designed and&#xD;
      intended to protect retinal cells that are responsible for central vision by inhibiting the&#xD;
      formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), the terminal step of complement-mediated cell&#xD;
      lysis. In gene therapy the cells of the retina are potentially permanently altered to make&#xD;
      sCD59 for the life of the patient. With gene therapy only one injection is needed for the&#xD;
      drug to be effective for the patient's entire life. This study will evaluate the safety after&#xD;
      a single injection of AAVCAGsCD59 administered in an office setting for patients whose&#xD;
      enrolled eye has advanced dry AMD with geographic atrophy. The initial study is 26 weeks&#xD;
      followed by an additional 18-month safety evaluation.&#xD;
