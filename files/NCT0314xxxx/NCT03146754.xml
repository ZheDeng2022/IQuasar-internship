  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory study to evaluate lung ultrasound as a method for measuring&#xD;
      extravascular lung water in stabilized patients during hospitalization for ADHF. Subjects who&#xD;
      have been stabilized following admission for ADHF and capable of lying supine will be&#xD;
      evaluated by lung ultrasound to determine the degree of lung congestion as measured by the&#xD;
      total B-line score. Since different patients may require different degrees of postural change&#xD;
      and/or other maneuvers (e.g., leg elevation or exercise) to induce B-line increments, a&#xD;
      tailored sequential protocol will be employed to define which maneuvers are sufficient for&#xD;
      each patient. Control patients, age-matched, will be recruited to provide a comparison group&#xD;
      for data analysis.&#xD;

        Reached at least a 12-hour period after hospital admission&#xD;
