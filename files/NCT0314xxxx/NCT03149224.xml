  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize specific brain signals elicited by motor&#xD;
      disturbances and errors in stroke patients. The patients will perform a motor task using both&#xD;
      their affected and unaffected hands. There are two types of errors: low level errors and high&#xD;
      level errors. While disturbances (low level errors) have been shown to elicit P300,&#xD;
      uncorrectable actions (high level errors) have been shown to elicit ERN. These event related&#xD;
      potentials (ERP) have been extensively studied in healthy subjects including a recent paper&#xD;
      from our Lab.&#xD;

      The experiment includes two parts, cognitive and motor parts, which will be conducted over&#xD;
      different sessions in different days. Patients will fill in a consent form, and pre&#xD;
      questionnaire form in the first session, and a post questionnaire at the end the last&#xD;
      session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG activity and eye movements will be recorded using BrainProducts EEG system. At the&#xD;
      beginning of each session an EEG cap will be placed on the patient's head and conductive gel&#xD;
      will be inserted between the cap and the head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session I - cognitive part: The cognitive parts involves the well-known oddball and Eriksen&#xD;
      flanker tasks, which are expected to elicit P300 and ERN, respectively. Both tasks will be&#xD;
      performed in one session unless the patient will be tired, in which case they will be&#xD;
      performed in two sessions (in two different days). In the oddball task patients will be shown&#xD;
      a sequence of simple geometrical shapes, including a standard blue circle, a large blue&#xD;
      circle and a square. The probability of these shapes will be 80%, 10% and 10%, respectively.&#xD;
      Each shape will appear for 100mse every 1500-2000msec. Patients will be asked to press the&#xD;
      space-bar (with the unaffected hand) when the large blue circle appears. There will be 3&#xD;
      blocks of 400 shapes each. This task will last one hour with breaks between the blocks. In&#xD;
      the Eriksen flanker task patients will be shown a sequence of congruent, non-congruent and&#xD;
      neutral stimuli. Each stimulus will include a central pair of arrows, flanked at the top and&#xD;
      bottom by two other pairs of either arrows or squares. In congruent and non-congruent stimuli&#xD;
      the top and bottom pairs include arrows that are either in the same (congruent) or opposite&#xD;
      (non-congruent) direction as the central pair, while in neutral stimuli the top and bottom&#xD;
      pairs are squares. Each stimulus will appear for 200msec every 1500-2000msec. Patients will&#xD;
      be asked to press the left or right arrow on the keyboard (with the unaffected hand)&#xD;
      according to the direction of the arrows in the central pair as fast as possible. There will&#xD;
      be 8 blocks of 64 stimuli each and will last 45-60min, including breaks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sessions II-V: Patients will sit in front of a computer screen and will play a simple&#xD;
      computer game by moving a cursor using a Joystick, and reaching the target on the screen.&#xD;
      Each block of reaching movements will be conducted with the same hand, and different blocks&#xD;
      will be conducted with the affected or unaffected hands. During reaching movements with the&#xD;
      unaffected hand there will be random jumps in the position of the target and/or cursor. The&#xD;
      number of reaching movements in each block will be adjusted to the comfort of each patient,&#xD;
      but will be limited to 50. A total of 250 reaching movements will be performed with each&#xD;
      hand, over 60-120min depending on the number and duration of the breaks. The experiment will&#xD;
      be conducted over 1-4 sessions depending on how long the patient will be able to participate&#xD;
      in each day.&#xD;
