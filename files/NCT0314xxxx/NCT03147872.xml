  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical in vitro fertilization relies on successful embryo culture. The primary goal of&#xD;
      embryo culture is to attempt to recapitulate the in vivo conditions as much as possible. In&#xD;
      the past decade, the majority embryo culture has been performed at 5% oxygen due to the&#xD;
      discovery that the oxygen tension in the fallopian tube (where the embryo is located for the&#xD;
      first 3 days after fertilization) is 5%. However, relatively recent studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      that the oxygen tension in the uterus (where the embryo is located after day 3) is closer to&#xD;
      2%. This study is a randomized controlled trial that will compare pregnancy rates between&#xD;
      embryos cultured in 2% versus 5% after day 3 of development.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Significant progress has been made in characterizing the optimal environment for a developing&#xD;
      embryo in culture. These efforts have been based on the premise that clinical embryo culture&#xD;
      should mimic the in vivo environment. To this end, investigators have gone to great lengths&#xD;
      to recreate every aspect of the natural setting to which the early embryo is exposed. This&#xD;
      focused approach has led to significant modifications of the embryo culture system in the&#xD;
      modern in vitro fertilization (IVF) lab and ultimately to improvements in pregnancy rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One area that has been subject to significant scrutiny is the relationship between incubator&#xD;
      oxygen concentration and early embryonic development. Oxygen plays a central role in&#xD;
      embryonic metabolism. The mechanism governing its utilization is dependent on the stage of&#xD;
      embryonic development. During the first 3 days of development, oxygen reaches the embryo via&#xD;
      passive diffusion and its concentration gradient is regulated by oxygen consumption during&#xD;
      oxidative phosphorylation. Inefficiencies in this process - due to compromised integrity of&#xD;
      the inner mitochondrial membrane or alterations in substrate availability - can result in&#xD;
      excessive production of harmful reactive oxygen species which can cause significant damage to&#xD;
      cellular machinery and ultimately lead to embryonic arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concentration of oxygen that the embryo in culture is exposed to can also impact this&#xD;
      delicately balanced system and alter the metabolic health of an embryo. Historically,&#xD;
      atmospheric oxygen concentration (approximately 20%) was exclusively used in human IVF&#xD;
      laboratories for embryo culture. However, multiple investigations subsequently found that the&#xD;
      physiologic concentration of oxygen within the female reproductive tract is well below&#xD;
      atmospheric levels, being consistently measured at &lt;10%. These observations led to multiple&#xD;
      trials comparing atmospheric oxygen concentrations to 5% oxygen in embryo culture. These&#xD;
      studies demonstrated significant perturbations in gene expression, protein secretion, and&#xD;
      suboptimal utilization of amino acids and carbohydrates in embryos cultured in atmospheric&#xD;
      oxygen. The same comparisons were made in clinical IVF studies and demonstrated that embryos&#xD;
      cultured in 5% oxygen consistently resulted in an increase in clinical pregnancy rate and&#xD;
      live birth rate. A meta-analysis of this topic suggested that a clinic with a baseline live&#xD;
      birth rate of 30% could expect an improvement as great as 13% when culturing embryos at 5%&#xD;
      O2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of these compelling data, most modern IVF programs now exclusively culture&#xD;
      embryos at 5% oxygen concentration. However, some have proposed that the oxygen concentration&#xD;
      to which the embryo is exposed after day 3 of development is actually lower than 5%. These&#xD;
      data originate from the idea that the embryo crosses the utero-tubal junction on day 3 of&#xD;
      development in vivo. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the oxygen concentration in the&#xD;
      uterus is actually lower than that in the fallopian tube at approximately 2%. Thus, the most&#xD;
      physiologic embryo culture system would culture embryos in 5% oxygen until day 3 and then&#xD;
      decrease the oxygen concentration to 2% until transfer or cryopreservation on day 5 or 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A change in the optimal oxygen concentration for an embryo on day 3 would fit with a general&#xD;
      shift in metabolic requirements of embryos seen at this stage of development. Activation of&#xD;
      the embryonic genome occurs on day 3 which prompts a significant increase in biosynthetic&#xD;
      activity. The metabolic behavior of embryos also shifts substantially during this time. The&#xD;
      embryo changes its metabolic strategy from oxidative phosphorylation to glucose based&#xD;
      metabolism in the form of the aerobic glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. During this&#xD;
      process, termed compaction, embryos exhibit greatly increased oxygen consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physiologic environment of the female reproductive tract tends to mirror the metabolic&#xD;
      needs of the developing preimplantation embryo. As the embryo shifts its metabolic strategy&#xD;
      after compaction and upon entering the uterus, it is certainly possible that a reduced oxygen&#xD;
      concentration in the uterus may best support the energy producing mechanisms of this stage in&#xD;
      embryonic development. Recapitulating this environment in culture may enhance embryonic&#xD;
      development and long term health of pregnancies resulting from IVF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This theory has been corroborated in two recent pilot studies. The first study, recently&#xD;
      awarded the Prize Paper Award at the 2016 American Society for Reproductive Medicine&#xD;
      Scientific Meeting, randomized embryos donated to research to 2% or 5% oxygen concentration&#xD;
      after day 3 of development and found that embryos were twice as likely to blastulate if they&#xD;
      were cultured in 2% oxygen concentration. However, embryos studied in this investigation were&#xD;
      either abnormally fertilized or warmed from cryopreservation on day 3 after being donated to&#xD;
      research. None were intended for clinical use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With these limitations in mind, our group has recently completed a study utilizing embryos&#xD;
      intended for clinical use (Copernicus IRB: RMA-2016-02). In this study, we enrolled 60&#xD;
      patients and split all ongoing embryos on day 3 of development to culture in either 2% or 5%&#xD;
      oxygen until the blastocyst stage. The results have not yet been published, but culture in 2%&#xD;
      oxygen after day 3 produced more blastocysts than culture in 5% oxygen. In total, 30 patients&#xD;
      had more embryos reach blastocyst in 2% oxygen, while only 17 patients had more embryos reach&#xD;
      blastocyst in 5% oxygen. Ten patients had an equal number in both conditions (3 withdrew from&#xD;
      the study). This difference reached statistical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This initial study was designed to specifically evaluate the developmental performance of&#xD;
      embryos in both conditions. However, there are also some pregnancy data available from those&#xD;
      patients who have proceeded to transfer these embryos. In this initial study, culture&#xD;
      conditions had no impact on the decision of which embryo to transfer. This was blinded to&#xD;
      embryologists and patients and only typical morphology criteria were utilized. Again, of&#xD;
      patients who have proceeded to embryo transfer, embryos that had been cultured in 2% oxygen&#xD;
      have performed better than those exclusively in 5% (88.9% [16/18] vs. 62.5% [15/24]&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, this initial study was not designed to specifically test the question of whether 2%&#xD;
      versus 5% oxygen in extended culture produces better pregnancy outcomes. The patients were&#xD;
      not randomized to either 2% or 5% oxygen. Thus, current pregnancy data is prone to some bias&#xD;
      and a better controlled study is needed evaluate the impact of reduced oxygen concentration&#xD;
      in culture on the most important outcomes: live birth rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of Proposed Study This study seeks to compare clinical outcomes of embryos cultured&#xD;
      at 2% oxygen concentration and 5% oxygen concentration after compaction. The primary outcome&#xD;
      under study will be live birth rate. Secondary outcomes will include miscarriage rate,&#xD;
      gestational age at delivery, birth weight at delivery, embryo blastulation rate, embryo&#xD;
      ploidy status (aneuploid or euploid) and morphologic parameters (expansion, inner cell mass&#xD;
      grade, trophectoderm grade). The cumulative live birth rate of all embryos that originate&#xD;
      from the study stimulation cycle will also be collected and analyzed. This will theoretically&#xD;
      reveal whether any advantage in the number of available blastocysts for transfer translates&#xD;
      to greater reproductive efficiency when extended culture is performed at 2% oxygen.&#xD;
