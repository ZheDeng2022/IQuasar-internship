  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uncomplicated sigmoid diverticulitis is a common disease in Western countries. Traditional&#xD;
      management includes inpatient administration of either oral or intravenous antibiotics with&#xD;
      resumption of oral intake as symptoms improve. Recent literature has however questioned both&#xD;
      inpatient and antibiotic treatment. Indeed, both inpatient and antibiotic treatment are&#xD;
      associated with non-negligible risks to patients. The aim of this trial is to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of a randomized controlled trial designed to determine whether nonantibiotic&#xD;
      treatment of uncomplicated diverticulitis is safe in the outpatient setting.&#xD;

      as a pilot non-inferiority blinded randomized controlled trial. The estimated length of this&#xD;
      pilot trial is 1 year. The target population is capable adults of who have a CT-diagnosed&#xD;
      episode of uncomplicated diverticulitis who present to the Jewish General Hospital Emergency&#xD;
      room.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome pertains to the feasibility of a non-inferiority randomized controlled trial. The study group's main concern is that accrual will be impeded by the important change in clinical management that nonantibiotic treatment of uncomplicated diverticulitis requires. Also, the study group is concerned that patients may be lost to follow-up. For these reasons, the primary outcome is the retention rate of patients from screening to the end of follow-up. The rate will be calculated according to (1) the proportion of participants screened but not randomized, and (2) the proportion of participants lost to follow-up.</description>

    <measure>Treatment failure</measure>

    <description>Treatment failure is defined as persistence, increase or recurrence of abdominal pain and/or fever, inflammatory bowel obstruction, need for radiological abscess drainage or immediate surgery due to complicated diverticulitis, need for hospital admission, and mortality during the first 60 days after discharge.</description>
