  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic commonly used to manage postoperative pain. Liver resection&#xD;
      patients typically have an epidural catheter placed preoperatively through which they receive&#xD;
      a continuous infusion of bupivacaine and hydromorphone for up to 5 days postoperatively. The&#xD;
      liver metabolizes bupivacaine, and produces proteins that bind with bupivacaine to take it&#xD;
      out of circulation and thereby reduce its toxicity. Because a portion of the liver is being&#xD;
      removed due to pre-existing liver disease, investigators hypothesize that liver resection&#xD;
      patients have an impaired ability to clear bupivacaine from circulation that may increase&#xD;
      their susceptibility to bupivacaine toxicity. To assess this, investigators will measure free&#xD;
      and bound bupivacaine in liver resection patients postoperatively to determine whether&#xD;
      bupivacaine reaches toxic levels. Investigators will also quantify binding protein levels to&#xD;
      determine if these levels are reduced after surgery, which could contribute to the elevated&#xD;
      bupivacaine levels in these patients. Finally, investigators will monitor patients for signs&#xD;
      and symptoms associated with bupivacaine toxicity.&#xD;

      This observational study has been approved for ethical compliance by the Queen's University&#xD;
      Health Sciences &amp; Affiliated Teaching Hospitals Research Ethics Board. Following signed&#xD;
      informed consent, investigators will collect blood samples from 20 liver resection patients&#xD;
      preoperatively and then at 3 different time points after their liver surgery at Kingston&#xD;
      General Hospital (upon entry to the post-anesthetic care unit [PACU], on postoperative day 2,&#xD;
      and immediately prior to discontinuation of the bupivacaine infusion). These blood draws will&#xD;
      occur at the same time as standard of care blood draws. Blood will be centrifuged, and plasma&#xD;
      will be stored in duplicate at -70Â°C until all samples are collected. Samples will be shipped&#xD;
      to Centre De Recherche, Centre De Hospitalier, de l'Universitie de Montreal (CHUM) in&#xD;
      Montreal, Quebec, Canada, for quantification of free and total bupivacaine as well as AGP. In&#xD;
      addition to quantifying circulating bupivacaine and AGP concentrations, investigators will&#xD;
      also assess postoperative wound pain on a visual analog scale from 0 to 10, and the&#xD;
      presence/absence of local anesthetic toxicity symptoms (tremor, tinnitus, dizziness, blurred&#xD;
      vision, hypotension and arrhythmia (including bradycardia).6 These will be assessed as close&#xD;
      as possible to the blood collection times (preoperatively, upon arrival to the PACU, on&#xD;
      postoperative day 2, and immediately prior to discontinuation of the bupivacaine infusion).&#xD;
      Finally, demographic and surgical characteristics will be recorded for all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria are competent ASA I-IV patients 18 years of age and older scheduled for&#xD;
      elective liver resection of at least 3 segments who receive epidural bupivacaine infusion for&#xD;
      pain control. Exclusion criteria: pregnancy, renal failure requiring dialysis, sepsis,&#xD;
      ejection fraction documented as &lt;15%, taking fluvoxamine or itraconazole, and inability to&#xD;
      understand and read English.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have several outcomes of interest in this study. Of primary interest: plasma&#xD;
      concentrations of free and bound bupivacaine and AGP at various time points after surgery.&#xD;
      Additional outcomes of interest are pain scores and signs or symptoms of local anesthetic&#xD;
      toxicity. Demographic and surgical characteristics will be collected for each patient.&#xD;
      Descriptive, univariate and multivariable analyses will be completed with the assistance of a&#xD;
      biostatistician.&#xD;
