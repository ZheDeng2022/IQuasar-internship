      The aim of this proposal is to investigate the effects of uneventful microsurgical and&#xD;
      endovascular treatment of unruptured saccular non-giant anterior communicating artery [ACoA]&#xD;
      aneurysms on resting state functional connectivity levels of higher order cognitive networks&#xD;
      and to correlate the connectivity levels of these networks with neuropsychological&#xD;
      performance and functional outcome.&#xD;

      The aim of this proposal is to investigate the effects of uneventful microsurgical and&#xD;
      endovascular treatment of unruptured saccular non-giant anterior communicating artery [ACoA]&#xD;
      aneurysms on resting state functional connectivity levels of higher order cognitive networks&#xD;
      and to correlate the connectivity levels of these networks with neuropsychological&#xD;
      performance and functional outcome. The investigators' hypothesis is that the functional&#xD;
      connectivity of various cognition networks, i.e. cognitive control network, emotion control&#xD;
      of cognitive networks, and working memory networks, as assessed by resting state functional&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging [rsfMRI], can be impaired after uneventful microsurgical and&#xD;
      endovascular treatment of unruptured ACoA aneurysms and can be correlated with&#xD;
      neuropsychological performance. The investigators propose to investigate 38 patients&#xD;
      harboring unruptured ACoA aneurysms and 19 healthy controls over a 36 (until 48) months&#xD;
      period. Patients and healthy controls will undergo baseline structural MRI, task fMRI,&#xD;
      rsfMRI, and baseline neuropsychological examinations prior as well as 2 months after either&#xD;
      microsurgical or endovascular aneurysm treatment or baseline examinations, respectively.&#xD;
      Furthermore all subjects will undergo additional neuropsychological examinations 12 months&#xD;
      after baseline examination or long-term recovery from microsurgical and endovascular&#xD;
      treatment, respectively. The research question is of substantial importance for this patient&#xD;
      population, since it is currently incompletely understood how the minor structural brain&#xD;
      tissue damages seen after both treatment methods of unruptured ACoA aneurysms translate into&#xD;
      the observed neuropsychological deficits - which are often subtle and transient in nature but&#xD;
      still insufficiently explained on grounds of morphology and structural connectivity alone.&#xD;
      The sensitivity of rsfMRI to depict the functional communication of spatially remote brain&#xD;
      regions presents a novel opportunity to investigate these deficits on a whole brain scale by&#xD;
      mapping resting state functional connectivity in higher order cognition networks that are&#xD;
      thought to be endangered by events related to both microsurgery and embolization. Correlating&#xD;
      these data seems promising for several reasons. First, functional connectivity analysis could&#xD;
      be correlated with the neuropsychological impairment in various neuropsychiatric disorders&#xD;
      and in ischemic stroke. Ischemic damage to the territories supplied by ACoA perforating&#xD;
      arteries is involved in many cases of postoperative neuropsychological impairment after ACoA&#xD;
      aneurysm treatment. Second, neuropsychological evaluations have become increasingly&#xD;
      incorporated into the standard of care in the postoperative follow-up of cerebral aneurysm&#xD;
      patients. RsfMRI could serve as a novel adjunct to neuropsychological outcome assessment.&#xD;
      Third, the results could add relevant information to the general perception of the role of&#xD;
      frontal lobe and forebrain damage in the pathophysiology of neurocognitive impairment. This&#xD;
      could have an impact on neurorehabilitation programs to improve neurocognitive outcome and&#xD;
      quality of life in this patient population. Forth, the correlation of validated&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests with the functional connectivity rsfMRI data would further enhance&#xD;
      the role of rsfMRI in neuroscience and its clinical use.&#xD;
