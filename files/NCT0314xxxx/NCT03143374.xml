    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the amount of a protein in the brain known as tau&#xD;
      using an imaging procedure called Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT). Tau has been shown&#xD;
      to build up in the brains of patients with injury to brain cells. This study looks at&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal degeneration (FTD).&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to measure the amount of a protein in the brain known as tau&#xD;
      using an imaging procedure called Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT). Tau has been shown&#xD;
      to build up in the brains of patients with injury to brain cells, including Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease, Parkinson's disease, Lewy body disease and Frontotemporal degeneration. [18F]T807&#xD;
      (also known as 18F-AV- 1451) is a specialized radioactive PET tracer that sticks to the tau&#xD;
      protein in the brain. In this study, researchers will use [18F]T807 to form images of tau&#xD;
      binding in the brain. [18F]T807 is an investigational or experimental imaging agent that has&#xD;
      not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in brain imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, researchers want to find out how accurate and useful [18F]T807 is in imaging&#xD;
      patients who have problems with thinking, remembering, speech, and visual activities, and may&#xD;
      be diagnosed with different types of neurodegenerative disease. This study will help test how&#xD;
      imaging measures may provide information that could be used to determine diagnosis for&#xD;
      patients in the future. The results of the PET/CT scan will be compared with other&#xD;
      information obtained under related protocols, including brain magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI), spinal fluid and cognitive test results.&#xD;

    <description>experimental PET/CT scan of the brain. In this scan, imaging is done with specialized cameras that can pick up radiation signals given off by a radioactive tracer and determine where the signals come from.&#xD;
The tracer used for this study is called [18]FT807 (also known as 18F-AV-1451). [18]FT807 is a specialized radioactive PET tracer used to detect the presence of tau proteins in the brain. [18]FT807 is an experimental tracer that has been studied in patients with known or suspected Alzheimer's disease, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) and Corticobasal Degeneration (CBS/CBD). In this study, patients will have one (1) [18F]T807 PET/CT scan performed at the University of Pennsylvania. The [18F]T807 PET/CT scan will require up to 3 hours of time, including preparation. The scan will take place using PET/CT scanners in the Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine or the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.</description>

        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR NEURODEGENERATIVE SUBJECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants has been diagnosed with one of the following neurodegenerative diseases:&#xD;
             Frontotemporal Degeneration, Primary Progressive Aphasia, Corticobasal Degeneration,&#xD;
             Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, Mild Cognitive Impairment, Alzheimer's Disease,&#xD;
             Posterior Cortical Atrophy, Parkinson's Disease, Parkinson's Disease Dementia,&#xD;
             Dementia with Lewy Bodies, Multiple Systems Atrophy, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or&#xD;
             Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis with Frontotemporal Degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants will be 18 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and provide&#xD;
             written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines prior&#xD;
             to study-specific procedures. If the subject is unable to provide informed consent,&#xD;
             the subject's legal representative may consent on behalf of the patient but the&#xD;
             patient will be asked to confirm assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participants must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits and imaging&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. An Electrocardiogram (ECG) is required prior to the first [18F]T807 PET/CT scan. If&#xD;
             the participant has had an ECG completed within 3 months prior to the enrollment date,&#xD;
             the ECG may be used for this study, if not; an ECG will be completed as part of this&#xD;
             study's activities at screening. At each longitudinal visit participants will be&#xD;
             queried to any changes to their cardiac health since their last visit. If there have&#xD;
             been changes that put the participant at high risk for Torsades de Pointes an ECG will&#xD;
             be performed to evaluate for a prolonged QT interval. If the participant has had an&#xD;
             ECG completed within 3 months prior to the visit date, the ECG may be used for the&#xD;
             evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. A brain MRI is required to participate in this study. If a brain MRI has been&#xD;
             performed within 6 months prior to enrollment in this study and is of adequate&#xD;
             quality, in the judgment of an investigator, the MRI may be used for the study&#xD;
             analysis. Subjects who do not have a brain MRI will undergo a brain MRI as part of one&#xD;
             of the Center's other ongoing study protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR HEALTHY CONTROL SUBJECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants will be 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and provide&#xD;
             written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines prior&#xD;
             to study-specific procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits and imaging&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. An ECG is required prior to the first [18F]T807 PET/CT scan. If the participant has&#xD;
             had an ECG completed within 3 months prior to the enrollment date, the ECG may be used&#xD;
             for this study, if not; an ECG will be completed as part of this study's activities at&#xD;
             screening. At each longitudinal visit participants will be queried to any changes to&#xD;
             their cardiac health since their last visit. If there have been changes that put the&#xD;
             participant at high risk for Torsades de Pointes an ECG will be performed to evaluate&#xD;
             for a prolonged QT interval. If the participant has had an ECG completed within 3&#xD;
             months prior to the visit date, the ECG may be used for the evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. A brain MRI is required to participate in this study. If a brain MRI has been performed&#xD;
        within 6 months prior to enrollment in this study and is of research quality, that scan may&#xD;
        be used for the study analysis. Subjects who do not have a brain MRI will undergo a brain&#xD;
        MRI as part of one of the Center's other ongoing study protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR ALL SUBJECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Females who are pregnant or breast feeding at the time of the baseline PET/CT scan&#xD;
             will not be eligible for this study. A urine pregnancy test will be performed in women&#xD;
             of child-bearing potential at screening and within 24 hours of any scheduled PET/CT or&#xD;
             MRI scanning&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Inability to tolerate or contraindication to imaging procedures in the opinion of an&#xD;
             investigator or treating physician&#xD;

          3. QTc &gt; 450 msec on screening ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any medical or psychological condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would&#xD;
             compromise the subject's safety or successful participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        ADDITIONAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR HEALTHY CONTROL SUBJECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. No pre-existing psychiatric conditions (e.g., active depression, schizophrenia, or&#xD;
