  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Asthma is a common chronic condition characterized by respiratory symptoms and&#xD;
      hyperresponsive airways. According to treatment guidelines, patients with persistent asthma&#xD;
      require daily treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). However, certain subgroups of&#xD;
      asthma patients such as non-eosinophilic asthma patients do not respond well to the ICS&#xD;
      treatment. In the present study, asthma patients treated with ICS and exhibiting low levels&#xD;
      of eosinophilic biomarkers such as S-periostin, FeNO and blood eosinophils, are randomized&#xD;
      1:1 to either 1) tapering of ICS or 2) usual care. Thus, the aim of the present study is to&#xD;
      investigate whether patients with non-eosinophilic asthma can sustain their level of disease&#xD;
      control during ICS tapering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a randomized, controlled, one-center, non-inferiority study of ICS tapering&#xD;
      in patients with non-eosinophilic asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria: 1) Objectively secured asthma diagnosis, 2) Age 18-65&#xD;
      years, 3) ICS treatment equivalent to Budesonide 800 microgr daily or more with at least 80%&#xD;
      adherence, 4) Serum-periostin &lt; 50 ng/ml, 5) FeNO&lt;20 ppb at all prior visits, 6)&#xD;
      Blood-eosinophils&lt;0.15 at screening, 7) no allergic asthma history, 8) never daily smoker, 9)&#xD;
      no other respiratory diasease, 10) no daily treatment with immunosuppressives, 11) no&#xD;
      pregnancy, and 12) no history of drug or alcohol abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints: Primary: Change in Control Questionnaire (ACQ) from baseline to post-tapered ICS&#xD;
      and time from baseline to drop-out. Secondary: Change in FeNO, change in Serum-Periostin,&#xD;
      change in FEV1, change in blood-eosinophils.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Relevant patients will be recruited from Respiratory Outpatient Wards. In total, 110&#xD;
      patients will be required. Visits will be performed at screening, at week 0, 4, 8, 12, 16,&#xD;
      26, 52. In the active arm, ICS dosage will be reduced to 50% at week 0 and removed at week 8.&#xD;
      All visits include ACQ, FeNO, spirometry, blood eosinophils. S-periostin will be measured at&#xD;
      screening and at week 8 and 16.&#xD;
