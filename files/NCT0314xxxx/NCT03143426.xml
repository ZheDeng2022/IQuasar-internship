  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is currently the most commonly performed major abdominal&#xD;
      surgery in Western countries. Ever since the introduction of laparoscopic surgery in the late&#xD;
      1980s, cholecystectomies are now routinely performed laparoscopically; concomitantly the&#xD;
      introduction and refinement of other laparoscopic abdominal surgeries have rapidly progressed&#xD;
      due to the early experience and safety profile seen in LC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The introduction of stereoscopes which allow for 3D visual feedback has been postulated to&#xD;
      overcome setbacks encountered in conventional 2-dimensional (2D) laparoscopic surgery. Since&#xD;
      its introduction in the mid-2000s, 3D visualisation has been proven to be advantageous over&#xD;
      2D visualisation, especially so within the context of training junior surgeons in controlled,&#xD;
      experimental settings. The body of evidence on benefits of 3D visualisation within the&#xD;
      clinical setting, i.e. when applied on live patients in operating theatres, remains small and&#xD;
      weak. The previous publications however did not extrapolate any potential benefits on&#xD;
      patients' well-being in correlation to their reported benefits and neither did they explore&#xD;
      any potential benefits in reducing operative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We decided to embark on a study to investigate any peri-operative advantage conferred on&#xD;
      junior surgeons in performing LC using 3D visualisation as the majority of LCs in Sibu&#xD;
      Hospital are carried out by junior surgeons.&#xD;

      Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is currently the most commonly performed major abdominal&#xD;
      surgery in Western countries.1,2 Ever since the introduction of laparoscopic surgery in the&#xD;
      late 1980s, cholecystectomies are now routinely performed laparoscopically; concomitantly the&#xD;
      introduction and refinement of other laparoscopic abdominal surgeries have rapidly progressed&#xD;
      due to the early experience and safety profile seen in LC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the benefits of LC are well described (e.g. decreased post-operative pain, decreased&#xD;
      need for post-operative analgesia, shortened hospital stay and earlier return to full&#xD;
      activity),3,4 it is not completely risk-free. The surgeon's experience, or rather the lack&#xD;
      of, has been previously identified as one of the significant correlations to inadvertent&#xD;
      visceral injury.5 According to the European Association for Endoscopic Surgery, a minimum of&#xD;
      20 LCs are necessary before a surgeon is deemed able to perform it safely.6 This is&#xD;
      consistent with the concept of the learning curve as analysed by Moore and Bennett; they&#xD;
      noted that 90% of iatrogenic bile duct injuries occurred within the first 30 cases of the&#xD;
      operating surgeon's experience.7 Publications on LC learning curve have identified the risk&#xD;
      of an iatrogenic bile duct injury as 0.17% - 0.35% after a surgeon's 50th case as opposed to&#xD;
      1.3 - 1.7% when fewer than 50 cases.7,8 These higher risks of iatrogenic injuries have been&#xD;
      attributed to the major setbacks encountered during conventional laparoscopic surgery,&#xD;
      chiefly the lack of depth perception and tactile sensory feedback to the operating surgeon&#xD;
      thus risking inadvertent injury to surrounding structures and imprecise dissection within the&#xD;
      Calot's triangle. While the importance of senior supervision and guidance are indispensible,&#xD;
      the technical short-comings of conventional laparoscopic surgery, i.e. the lack of depth&#xD;
      perception, have led to the development of technology to allow for 3-dimensional (3D)&#xD;
      visualisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The introduction of stereoscopes which allow for 3D visual feedback has been postulated to&#xD;
      overcome these setbacks encountered in conventional 2-dimensional (2D) laparoscopic surgery.&#xD;
      Since its introduction in the mid-2000s, 3D visualisation has been proven to be advantageous&#xD;
      over 2D visualisation, especially so within the context of training junior surgeons in&#xD;
      controlled, experimental settings.9,10 The body of evidence on benefits of 3D visualisation&#xD;
      within the clinical setting, i.e. when applied on live patients in operating theatres,&#xD;
      remains small and weak. These were mostly small, single-institution studies focused only on&#xD;
      specific laparoscopic procedures such as hernia repair, distal gastrectomies,11&#xD;
      urologic12,13,14 and gynaecologic15,16 procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sakata and workers also believed that advantages conferred by 3D visualisation has been&#xD;
      underreported and undermined by flawed study designs and utilised mostly earlier generation&#xD;
      of 3D stereoscopes that has since been phased out, therefore undermining the clinical&#xD;
      potential of 3D laparoscopy.17 Experience with utilisation of 3D visualisation in performing&#xD;
      LC is still in its infancy and to the authors' knowledge, there have been no unfavourable&#xD;
      results reported with the use of 3D visualisation for laparoscopic surgery. Data on direct&#xD;
      comparison of 2D against 3D LC is still scarce; there are only three such studies and all&#xD;
      demonstrated superiority of 3D over 2D visualisation in LC. These studies, though originating&#xD;
      from tertiary institutions, are hampered by the limited numbers of patients operated using 3D&#xD;
      visualisation (n = 8, 15 &amp; 40 respectively).11,18,19 The third study,19 reported advantages&#xD;
      of 3D visualisation conferred to junior surgeons in terms of reducing operative time, better&#xD;
      depth perception and reduced subjective visual strain. The authors however did not&#xD;
      extrapolate any potential benefits on patients' well-being in correlation to their reported&#xD;
      benefits and neither did they explore any potential benefits in reducing operative&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sibu Hospital is a 534-bedded tertiary and referral hospital for advanced specialised health&#xD;
      care within the central region of Sarawak. Data from 2007 estimated that Sibu Hospital serves&#xD;
      a population of at least 500 000 and this population is believed to have doubled to date.20&#xD;
      The department of general surgery is headed by a senior consultant surgeon (AD) and this&#xD;
      department also serves as a training center for junior surgeons who have just completed their&#xD;
      post-graduate qualifications. Under the tutelage of at least one senior consultant general&#xD;
      surgeon, these junior surgeons are mentored through their early learning curves in performing&#xD;
      major complicated surgeries, including LCs as it is the most common laparoscopic surgery&#xD;
      being carried out in Sibu Hospital. Unpublished hospital data revealed that between 48 to 72&#xD;
      LCs are being performed annually since data collection began in 2010. Although major&#xD;
      complications (e.g. adjacent organ injury) post-LC are rarely encountered in Sibu Hospital,&#xD;
      relatively minor complications (e.g. excessive bleeding leading to prolonged theatre time)&#xD;
      can still occur. In a bid to further reduce the complication rates of LC, we therefore&#xD;
      decided to embark on a study to investigate any peri-operative advantage conferred on junior&#xD;
      surgeons in performing LC using 3D visualisation as the majority of LCs in Sibu Hospital are&#xD;
      carried out by junior surgeons.&#xD;
