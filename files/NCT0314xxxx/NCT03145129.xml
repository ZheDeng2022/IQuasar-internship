  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some people with Primary Open-angle Glaucoma (POAG) also suffer from Obstructive Sleep Apnoea&#xD;
      (OSA), a common sleep disorder which is known to affect heart and blood vessels, and may&#xD;
      contribute to glaucoma progression. Obstructive Sleep Apnoea is treated with Continuous&#xD;
      Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP); however using this type of breathing support may raise&#xD;
      intraocular pressure (IOP). The evidence for this is limited and the potential mechanisms&#xD;
      involved are poorly understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we will determine whether CPAP applied at night changes IOP and ocular&#xD;
      perfusion pressure (OPP). We will also assess its possible impact on ocular microvasculature.&#xD;
      Two groups of patients will be included: those with POAG and OSA, and those with OSA without&#xD;
      glaucoma. They will attend for two overnight assessments: the first before starting CPAP and&#xD;
      the second 4-6 weeks into the treatment. Repeated measurements of IOP at night will be&#xD;
      performed and participants will continue self-measuring IOP at home in the day. An Ocular&#xD;
      Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCT Angiography) of the optic disc and the surrounding&#xD;
      retina will be performed at baseline and after a few weeks of CPAP treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with OAG and concomitant OSA associated with the relevant symptoms, particularly&#xD;
      daytime sleepiness, currently receive standard treatment with CPAP. However, the impact of&#xD;
      CPAP on their glaucoma is unknown. There are concerns that CPAP increases IOP, currently the&#xD;
      only modifiable factor in glaucoma, though the evidence for this is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding the influence of CPAP on IOP is important as it may inform the management of&#xD;
      people with OSA and concomitant glaucoma. If CPAP is shown to raise IOP or alter OPP to&#xD;
      levels that pose clinical risk it will be necessary to assess available alternative treatment&#xD;
      options for OSA. If, however, CPAP does not alter these parameters, there would be a&#xD;
      rationale for assessing long-term effects of CPAP, most probably in the form of a randomised&#xD;
      interventional trial, informed by the findings of this research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective controlled study which will examine the impact of CPAP on nocturnal IOP&#xD;
      and OPP in people with OSA with and without POAG. In addition, we will assess ocular&#xD;
      microvasculature before and a few weeks into CPAP treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: to determine if IOP increases at night following treatment with CPAP in people with&#xD;
      OSA with and without POAG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Secondary:(i) to investigate whether diurnal IOP raises after CPAP treatment; (ii) to&#xD;
      investigate whether CPAP alters peri-papillary and macular microcirculation measured with OCT&#xD;
      Angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: People with newly diagnosed OSA who require treatment with CPAP will be&#xD;
      invited. We will recruit participants with POAG and people without glaucoma (control&#xD;
      subjects). All participant will undergo a detailed ocular assessment including: visual&#xD;
      acuity, IOP measurement, OCT and visual field test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: 30 participants: 15 per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 0: Baseline ocular examination to confirm or exclude glaucoma will be undertaken during&#xD;
      this visit unless a participant already had this examination within the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Participants will attend the sleep centre (Respiratory Support and Sleep&#xD;
      Centre-RSSC, Papworth Hospital) where they will be admitted to a separate ward. Consented&#xD;
      participants will undergo the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessment: A brief medical history, spirometry and anthropomorphic measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated measurements: IOP will be measured in each eye using a rebound tonometer (Icare Pro,&#xD;
      Finland Oy). Blood pressure and ocular perfusion pressure will be checked simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be advised to sleep at their habitual hours. Sleep onset and duration will&#xD;
      be recorded. All the above measurements will be repeated every 2 hours starting from 10pm and&#xD;
      finishing at 8am. In the morning OCT Angiographic will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then self-measure IOP at home using a rebound tonometer (Icare Home,&#xD;
      Finland Oy). The measurements will be performed in the daytime every 2 hours before they&#xD;
      start CPAP and 4-6 weeks into the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Participants will return for the second overnight assessment 4-6weeks after&#xD;
      initiation of CPAP treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPAP usage data will be downloaded. All the measurements following the same procedure as for&#xD;
      Visit 1 will be repeated this time with participants using CPAP. OCT Angiographic will be&#xD;
      performed immediately after removing CPAP in the morning.&#xD;

        There are two recruitment sources:&#xD;
&#xD;
        i. Eligible participants who have completed the POSAG trial (NCT02713152) and were&#xD;
        diagnosed with OSA for which CPAP treatment was recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ii. Patients who attend Sleep Disturbance Clinic (SDC) at Papworth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We aim to recruit 15 participants with OSA and POAG (Glaucoma group) and 15 participants&#xD;
        with OSA and no Glaucoma (Control group). Patients with OSA and POAG will be recruited&#xD;
        first and control participants matched for OSA severity subsequently. Matching will be&#xD;
        performed according to 3 OSA categories: mild (AHI:5-15), moderate (AHI:15-30), severe&#xD;
        (AHI&gt;30)).&#xD;
