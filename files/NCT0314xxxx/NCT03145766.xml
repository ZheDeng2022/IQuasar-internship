  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study assessed different formulations of the modified formulation of VRVg (VRVg 2-&#xD;
      formulations 1 [low], 2 [medium] and 3 [high]) tested in parallel to the initial VRVg&#xD;
      formulation (VRVg-1) and Imovax Rabies. Immune responses were assessed at Day 14, Day 28, Day&#xD;
      42, and at Month 7. Safety events were also reported.&#xD;

        <title>Number of Participants With Immediate Unsolicited Adverse Events</title>
        <description>An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug and does not necessary have to have a causal relationship with treatment. An unsolicited AE was an observed AE that did not fulfill the conditions prelisted in the case report form (CRF) in terms of diagnosis and/or onset post-vaccination. All participants were observed for 30 minutes after any vaccination, and any unsolicited AEs occurred during that time were recorded as immediate unsolicited AEs in the CRF. Immediate AEs considered as related to vaccination were recorded as immediate unsolicited adverse reactions (ARs).</description>

        <population>Analysis was performed on safety analysis set (SafAS) that included participant who had received at least one least one dose of the study vaccine and were analyzed according to the actual treatment received. 1 participant of Group 4 received Imovax Rabies, and thus counted in Group 5 for safety analysis.</population>

        <description>A solicited reaction was an AR observed and reported under the conditions (symptom and onset) prelisted (i.e., solicited) in the CRF and considered as related to vaccination. An AR was all noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose. Solicited systemic reactions included fever, headache, malaise and myalgia.</description>
