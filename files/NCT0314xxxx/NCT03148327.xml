    <textblock>
      This study uses durvalumab (MEDI 4736), an experimental type of drug made by Astra Zeneca&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals, (limited partnership) LP, which in early studies has shown to possibly&#xD;
      reduce the growth of certain types of lung cancer. The Investigators will enroll up to 105&#xD;
      subjects into the study. After an initial safety sample of 15 individuals receiving&#xD;
      durvalumab (MEDI 4736) and Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR), if it is shown to&#xD;
      be safe to administer this combination of therapies, the next enrolled subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 fashion (each subject with a &quot;50-50 chance&quot; like the flip of a coin) to&#xD;
      receive either SABR and durvalumab (MEDI 4736), or SABR alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once treatment is completed, all subjects will return to the University of California at Los&#xD;
      Angeles (UCLA) for regular follow-up visits to check on their health and outcomes. At visits&#xD;
      both prior to and after treatment special blood samples will be drawn to be studied by UCLA&#xD;
      scientists to look into the basic science aspects of how durvalumab (MEDI 4736) and radiation&#xD;
      work in the body. It is hoped that we will learn more about the basic safety and science of&#xD;
      durvalumab (MEDI 4736) combined with Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR) vs. SABR&#xD;
      alone, while extending the life and quality of life of these subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, prospective, randomized phase II study with a phase I safety lead&#xD;
      in. Patients in this study will undergo radiation therapy alone or in combination with&#xD;
      durvalumab (MEDI 4736). Patients eligible for treatment must be diagnosed with node negative,&#xD;
      non-metastatic, biopsy- proven early-stage NSCLC and be ineligible for surgical resection or&#xD;
      refuse surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will begin with a phase I lead in evaluating radiation therapy with durvalumab&#xD;
      (MEDI 4736). (Regimen A) to ensure general safety of this combination and specifically&#xD;
      relating to pulmonary toxicity (pneumonitis), cardiac toxicity (pericarditis) and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal toxicity (esophagitis, gastritis, enterocolitis). Following initial&#xD;
      demonstration of safety, enrollment to the phase II component with 1:1 randomization to&#xD;
      radiation therapy and durvalumab (MEDI 4736), (Regimen A) or radiation therapy alone (Regimen&#xD;
      B) will be performed with stratification only based on T-stage (Tumor) (T1 versus T2). A&#xD;
      total of 90 patients will be randomized in the phase II component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regimen A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Durvalumab (MEDI 4736), at 1500 mg via IV infusion will be delivered on day -5 of therapy.&#xD;
      Radiation therapy will start on Day 0 ±5 from the first infusion of durvalumab (MEDI 4736)&#xD;
      and patients will receive 3, 4, or 10 fractions of radiation therapy to a total dose of 54&#xD;
      Grays (Gy), 50Gy, or 65Gy, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting on day 23 (28 days post first durvalumab (MEDI 4736), infusion), durvalumab (MEDI&#xD;
      4736), 1500mg IV q4weeks will be delivered for up to 4 additional cycles or until&#xD;
      progression, toxicity or withdrawal from study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regimen B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive radiation therapy alone of 3, 4, or 10 fractions to a total dose of&#xD;
      54Gy, 50Gy, or 65Gy, respectively. Regimen B patients will not receive durvalumab (MEDI 4736)&#xD;
      and will only receive radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety review will continue to occur on an ongoing basis. Should the rates of grade 3&#xD;
      treatment-related pulmonary toxicity (defined as pneumonitis), cardiac toxicity (defined as&#xD;
      pericarditis) or gastrointestinal toxicity (defined as esophagitis, gastritis or enter&#xD;
      colitis) be observed at a frequency greater than 15%, accrual will be halted and study will&#xD;
      be re-evaluated. Should any patient have ≥ grade 4 treatment-related adverse effects, accrual&#xD;
      will be halted and study will be re-evaluated Follow-up Routine surveillance computerized&#xD;
      axial tomography (CT) imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis will be performed starting at&#xD;
      12 weeks after completion of radiation in both treatment groups to allow for primary endpoint&#xD;
      assessment. Routine CT imaging surveillance will continue per standard of care. Patients will&#xD;
      also be followed clinically with history and physical examinations, vitals signs, and&#xD;
      laboratory examinations as indicated.&#xD;
