    <textblock>
      This investigation will preliminarily determine if a course of high frequency rTMS applied to&#xD;
      the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, will reduce cue elicited craving, and cue reactivity&#xD;
      in treatment seeking cannabis use disordered participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this proposal is to investigate if a course of excitatory DLPFC rTMS&#xD;
      results in reduced cannabis cue-induced craving in treatment seeking individuals with CUD&#xD;
      (Aim1). Additionally, the investigators seek to explore the mechanistic underpinnings of any&#xD;
      observed effect, by collecting functional magnetic resonance imaging data during cannabis&#xD;
      cue-administration before and after the treatment course (Aim 2). These aims will be&#xD;
      addressed through a seven week, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled study in which 72&#xD;
      treatment seeking cannabis use disordered participants (36/group) will be given 20 sessions&#xD;
      of either Active or Sham excitatory rTMS applied to the DLPFC. TMS will be delivered in an&#xD;
      accelerated fashion over two weeks (2 sessions each day, five days each week). TMS will be&#xD;
      applied in conjunction with a validated two-session Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET)&#xD;
      behavioral intervention.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators hypothesize that as compared to those participants receiving sham rTMS, those participants receiving active rTMS will have a reduced level of cannabis cue-induced craving following their final rTMS session as compared to prior to their first rTMS session. The investigators will measure self-reported cannabis craving during a validated cannabis cue-reactivity paradigm, and define cue-induced craving as change in self reported craving from pre-to-post cue administration using the marijuana craving questionaire.</description>

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators hypothesize that as compared to those participants receiving sham rTMS, those participants receiving active rTMS will have a reduced percent signal change in BOLD response in reward structures during a validated cue-reactivity fMRI paradigm following their final TMS session as compared to prior to their first rTMS session.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Abstinence</measure>
    <time_frame>7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators hypothesize that those participants receiving active rTMS will be more likely to be abstinent over the final two-weeks of the study period than those receiving sham rTMS. We will define abstinence as no self reported cannabis use over the final two weeks of the study, and a ratio of four week to two week creatinine corrected urine THCCOOH of &lt; 0.5, suggesting no new use of cannabis.</description>

    <description>rTMS will be delivered via a MagPro double blinded rTMS Research System (MagVenture, Denmark) with a Cool-B65 Butterfly Coil (a combined active and sham coil). We will use a standard resting motor threshold (rMT) determination to determine the TMS dose (49). Treatment will be delivered at 120% rMT. Each active TMS treatment will consist of a total of 4000 pulses of 10Hz stimulation (5s-on,10s-off). Treatments will be delivered at the EEG coordinate for F3 (which approximates the left DLPFC), and will be found using the Beam-F3 method.</description>

    <description>Sham sessions will be delivered using an electronic sham system consisting of a coil that mimics the appearance and sound of TMS, combined with a TENS device which produces a small electric shock mimicking the feeling of real TMS. This type of sham has been demonstrated to be indistinguishable from real TMS.</description>
