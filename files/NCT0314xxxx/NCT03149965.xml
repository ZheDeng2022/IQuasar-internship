      The hypothesis was that the anovaginal distance (AVD), defined as the distance between the&#xD;
      anal mucosa and the vaginal wall at the middle level of the anal canal, is higher in obese&#xD;
      women compared with normal weight women. Measuring the AVD with transperineal ultrasound has&#xD;
      been shown to have a high interobserver agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aimed to establish if there was a difference in AVD measured by transperineal&#xD;
      ultrasound between obese and normal weight women in active phase of labor at term pregnancy.&#xD;
      The second aim was to present normal values for the AVD in active phase of labor at term&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;

      This is a prospective cohort study including primiparous women in active phase of labor at&#xD;
      term pregnancy on admission at the delivery ward at Linkoping University hospital. The study&#xD;
      period was between October 2014 and March 2016. Term pregnancy was defined as ≥ 37 - ≤ 42&#xD;
      gestational weeks. The women had to be in active labor according to the Swedish definition;&#xD;
      two out of three of the following criteria must be present: painful contractions (two to&#xD;
      three contractions in every ten minutes), cervix shortened and dilated &gt; one centimeter (cm)&#xD;
      and/or rupture of membranes. The maximum cervix dilatation allowed for inclusion was seven&#xD;
      cm. Further the participant had to be proficient in the Swedish language and aged ≥18 years.&#xD;
      All participants were given written and verbal information of the study. The verbal consent&#xD;
      to participate was documented in the women´s medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total number of 207 women were included in the study. There was no information available&#xD;
      about whether the women declined participation or if they were not invited to participate.&#xD;
      333 women were excluded due to prematurity, cervix dilatation &gt; seven cm when the women were&#xD;
      signed in at the delivery ward, younger than 18 years or not speaking satisfactory Swedish&#xD;
      language. After woman's informed consent, the AVD was measured with transperineal ultrasound.&#xD;
      The standardized method consisted of placing the vaginal probe at a right angle to the&#xD;
      posterior vaginal distal wall, and in a transversal scanning plane. All examinations were&#xD;
      done with the patient in the lithotomy position. The internal anal sphincter was detected as&#xD;
      a low-echogenic ring when the probe was moved cranially from the distal anal canal to the mid&#xD;
      anal canal. The AVD in this study was measured and defined as the distance between the anal&#xD;
      mucosa and the vaginal wall at the middle level of the anal canal. The measured AVD, in&#xD;
      millimeters (mm), was documented in the women´s medical record under a specific keyword named&#xD;
      &quot;anovaginal distance&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The examiners had different proficiency in vaginal ultrasound. As a minimum training to be&#xD;
      allowed to include women in the study, the midwives and doctors were trained individually in&#xD;
      a defined education program. The education program was based on co-measuring the AVD with one&#xD;
      of two experienced experts of AVD-measurement ( ref metodartikeln) . All examiners had to&#xD;
      perform co-measurements in at least five women in term pregnancy. Each woman was, after&#xD;
      informed consent, measured three times by both the expert and the examiner at education.&#xD;
      These women were not included in the present study. The measured AVD values were not shared&#xD;
      by the expert and the examiner. The AVD values were compared afterwards, outside the delivery&#xD;
      room. In order to be given permission to independently measure the AVD, the examiners had to&#xD;
      perform similar values (+/- five mm) as the expert, in five women. Proficiency was achieved&#xD;
      among all examiners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information on measured AVD, maternal age, smoking status in early pregnancy, ethnicity,&#xD;
      measured maternal weight and maternal height in early pregnancy was extracted from the&#xD;
      digitalized medical records for every participant and manually registered in an anonymous&#xD;
      research database. Gestational weight gain was defined as the difference between the&#xD;
      registered weight in kilograms (kg) at the first antenatal visit to the antenatal care&#xD;
      center, and the registered weight in term pregnancy at the delivery ward. If there was no&#xD;
      registered weight at the delivery ward, the last registered weight at the antenatal care&#xD;
      center (between gestational week 37-42) was used to calculate gestational weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population was then divided into three Body Mass Index (BMI) classes based on&#xD;
      measured maternal weight and height in early pregnancy (gestational week 10-12); normal&#xD;
      weight (BMI &lt;25) , overweight (BMI 25-29.9) and obese (BMI ≥30) . Maternal obesity (BMI ≥30)&#xD;
      was also subdivided into obesity class I (BMI 30-34.9) obesity class II (BMI 35-39.9) and&#xD;
      obesity class III (BMI ≥40) as suggested by WHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of women included was based on a power calculation where the relevant difference&#xD;
      in AVD between the BMI groups was set to be 10 mm and significance level were equals five&#xD;
      percent. A stipulation that a difference of five mm in the AVD could be of clinical relevance&#xD;
      was performed. The sample size in each BMI group was calculated to be at least 30 to reach a&#xD;
      power of 80% to detect five mm difference in the AVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses were performed in order to compare background characteristics between&#xD;
      different BMI groups using One-way Anova for continuous variables and X2-test for categorical&#xD;
      variables. Post hoc tests were adjusted by the method of Tukey. A two-way Anova was used in&#xD;
      order to analyze BMI groups and measurer simultaneously. A p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered&#xD;
      significant. Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social&#xD;
      Sciences (IBM SPSS Statistics, Chicago, IL, USA; version 22)&#xD;
