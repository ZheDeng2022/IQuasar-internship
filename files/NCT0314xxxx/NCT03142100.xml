      Introduction: Bilateral-bimodal users may benefit from bilateral-binaural and a bimodal&#xD;
      effect . The two modes of stimulation complement each other and may overcome the limitation&#xD;
      of electric hearing alone. However, alongside the expected benefits of having two hearing&#xD;
      systems in bilateral bimodal hearing, there are several inherent mismatches in combing two&#xD;
      different stimulation methods, which may negatively impact the processing of the binaural&#xD;
      cues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To determine whether bimodal listening with a hearing aid programmed using a dedicated&#xD;
      bimodal fitting formula, which aligns the frequency response, loudness growth functions, and&#xD;
      automatic gain control (AGC) characteristics between the cochlear implant speech processor&#xD;
      and the hearing aid brings additional benefit over bimodal listening with the subject's&#xD;
      clinical hearing instrument via the use of using a comprehensive battery of speech perception&#xD;
      tests aimed at different aspects of binaural hearing as well as the contribution of the&#xD;
      unique bimodal complementary effect. A secondary goal is to identify the tests that are best&#xD;
      suited to predicting and evaluating bimodal benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The study will include 20 Hebrew and 20 Arabic speakers' adult bilateral-bimodal&#xD;
      users that their audiometric thresholds in the non implanted ear will be no worse than 75 dB&#xD;
      HL at 250 and 85 dB HL at 500 Hz, who use their hearing aids for at least 75% of their waking&#xD;
      hours. The added benefit of the hearing aid programmed using a dedicated bimodal fitting&#xD;
      formula will be evaluated using six task-specific tests designed to sensitively assess the&#xD;
      bilateral-binaural and bimodal complementary effects using roving speech and noise and&#xD;
      different types of background noises (maskers), pitch-related task and subjective&#xD;
      questionnaire. Participants will be tested twice in quick succession, at two-weekly&#xD;
      intervals, in establishing a baseline score with their clinical HAs. Then participants will&#xD;
      be tested again twice in quick succession, at two-weekly intervals following three month&#xD;
      experience with the HA fitted with the bimodal fitting formula. All tests will be&#xD;
      administered the CI/HA listening condition.&#xD;

      Introduction: Bilateral-bimodal hearing, cochlear implant on one ear and hearing aid on the&#xD;
      other ear (CI/HA) may benefit from bilateral-binaural effects as a result of using two&#xD;
      hearing systems, and a bimodal effect as a result of using two modes of stimulation, namely&#xD;
      acoustic via a HA and electrical via a CI. The two modes of stimulation complement each other&#xD;
      and may overcome the limitation of electric hearing alone. However, alongside the expected&#xD;
      benefits of having two hearing systems in bilateral bimodal hearing, there are several&#xD;
      inherent mismatches in combing two different stimulation methods, which may negatively impact&#xD;
      the processing of the binaural cues. These mismatches include mismatch in the incoming speech&#xD;
      signal timing; mismatch in pitch balance between two devices, mismatch in the frequency range&#xD;
      conferred, and mismatch in the frequency range conveyed to a specific location in the cochlea&#xD;
      by the cochlear implant and to a different location in the contra-lateral cochlea by the&#xD;
      hearing aid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To determine whether bimodal listening with a hearing aid programmed using a dedicated&#xD;
      bimodal fitting formula, which aligns the frequency response, loudness growth functions, and&#xD;
      automatic gain control (AGC) characteristics between the cochlear implant speech processor&#xD;
      and the hearing aid brings additional benefit over bimodal listening with the subject's&#xD;
      clinical hearing instrument via the use of using a comprehensive battery of speech perception&#xD;
      tests aimed at different aspects of binaural hearing as well as the contribution of the&#xD;
      unique bimodal complementary effect. A secondary goal is to identify the tests that are best&#xD;
      suited to predicting and evaluating bimodal benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The study will include 20 Hebrew and 20 Arabic speakers' adult bilateral-bimodal&#xD;
      users that their audiometric thresholds in the non implanted ear will be no worse than 75 dB&#xD;

      experience with the HA fitted with the bimodal fitting formula. All tests will be&#xD;
      administered the CI/HA listening condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: Speech perception test results and self-rating questionnaire scores will be&#xD;
      analyzed by repeated measure analysis of variance. The difference between the two moods of&#xD;
      bimodal listening (clinical HA versus HA fitted by the bimodal formula) will be evaluated.&#xD;
      Correlation between audiological variables aided and unaided hearing thresholds in the&#xD;
      non-implanted ear and the bilateral-bimodal benefit will be examined as well.&#xD;
