  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obtaining vital signs and blood pressure (BP) in particularly, as part of a pediatric&#xD;
      Emergency Department (ED) patient triage is sometimes difficult and leads to many false&#xD;
      negative results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stress, noisy environment and lack of cooperation are only a few of the things that&#xD;
      interfere with proper vital signs measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past decade, there has been a rapid growth in the presence of therapeutic clowns in&#xD;
      hospitals, particularly in pediatric settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators speculate that the incorporation of a medical clown during the procedure of&#xD;
      blood pressure measurement in the triage will shorten the procedure and decrease the number&#xD;
      of attempts, making it much more efficient.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blood pressure is measured in the triage amongst most children presented to the Pediatric ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many barriers to obtaining an accurate BP measurement in children, including&#xD;
      inappropriate technique, lack of equipment, but also - pain, and the child's&#xD;
      uncooperativeness or anxiety. The latter may even be accentuated in an ED setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These factors may lead to falsely elevated BP readings, which may provoke significant anxiety&#xD;
      in children and families and possibly lead to a cascade of unnecessary investigation and&#xD;
      consultations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, an abnormal measured BP value routinely mandate an additional measurement&#xD;
      attempt which itself may cause anxiety and restlessness among children, especially toddlers&#xD;
      and infants, and prolongs the entire triage process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Second Task Force Report on Blood Pressure Control in Children emphasizes taking blood&#xD;
      pressure measurements in a quiet environment, using a proper size cuff and using appropriate&#xD;
      technique. Ideally, BP should be measured several times in a a relaxed child and in a quiet&#xD;
      setting, however this scenario is nearly impossible in the ED, as demonstrated in a previous&#xD;
      retrospective study that indicated that although BP was elevated in 52% of children who&#xD;
      underwent triage blood pressure measurement in the ED, the measurement was repeated in only&#xD;
      38%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past decade, there has been a rapid growth in the presence of therapeutic clowns in&#xD;
      hospitals, particularly in pediatric settings. A recent study conducted in a pediatric ED in&#xD;
      Israel has demonstrated the benefit of medical clowns in diminishing pain and anxiety during&#xD;
      painful procedures being performed on children in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies conducted in our institute have demonstrated a beneficial effect on vital&#xD;
      signs (blood pressure and heart rate) as a sign of decreased anxiety following the&#xD;
      incorporation of a medical clown in a multisystem team caring for pediatric patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure measurement among pediatric patients, although not a painful procedure, may&#xD;
      cause a stressful reaction, prolonging the entire process and requiring additional attempts -&#xD;
      making it a time consuming task in a busy ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A medical clown may have a beneficial effect on the pediatric patient by decreasing the&#xD;
      stress reaction and may therefore shorten the entire process making it much more efficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are unaware of any studies conducted related to the effect of the use of&#xD;
      medical clowns during ED blood pressure measurements in the triage.&#xD;
