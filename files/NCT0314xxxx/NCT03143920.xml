  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pilot study to determine feasibility for treating patients with two chronic inflammatory&#xD;
      conditions of the urinary bladder: chronic interstitial cystitis and recurrent urinary tract&#xD;
      infections using a standardized hyperbaric oxygen treatment plan. Presently there are no good&#xD;
      treatments for these conditions and hyperbaric oxygen may be a safe and readily accessible&#xD;
      therapy as it has proven successful an another type of chronic inflammatory condition of the&#xD;
      urinary bladder known as &quot;radiation cystitis&quot;. The study will determine if patients will&#xD;
      consider this an acceptable treatment for their conditions and that it is well tolerated.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary object is to determine the feasibility of treating patients diagnosed with either&#xD;
      CIC/PBS or rUTI with daily hyperbaric oxygen for a total of 40 treatment sessions during an&#xD;
      8-10 week time period. We wish to better understand the demand and degree of adherence for&#xD;
      daily HBOT in these two patient populations to inform future planning and design of&#xD;
      randomized, sham controlled and double-blind studies. Given the refractory nature of these&#xD;
      two diagnoses, a secondary objective of this study is to determine if there is symptomatic&#xD;
      improvement following HBOT compared to pretreatment symptoms using standardized patient&#xD;
      symptomology questionnaires' (Global Response Assessment-GRA and Patient's Overall Rating of&#xD;
      Improvement in Symptoms-PORIS questionnaires).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection will be carried out by the respective co-investigators based on standard&#xD;
      disease definitions. CIC/PBS is defined as urinary tract pain or discomfort and dysuria that&#xD;
      is present of &gt; 6 months and is not due to acute urinary tract infection, stones or other&#xD;
      pathology. These patients will be identified and recruited by Dr. C. Lowell Parsons,&#xD;
      Co-investigator for the study. rUTI is defined as greater than 2 urinary tract infections in&#xD;
      6 month or greater than 3 urinary tract infections in one year. These patient will be&#xD;
      identified and recruited by Dr. Emily Lukacz, Co-investigator. Each study will enroll 20&#xD;
      individuals. The study design is an observational pilot study to determine feasibility and&#xD;
      limited efficacy. Thus the primary outcomes will be the number of patients that enroll in the&#xD;
      study relative to the number offered enrollment and the percentage of individuals completing&#xD;
      the prescribed 40 treatment sessions. For the secondary outcome, limited efficacy, each&#xD;
      patient's pre-treatment clinical status will be compared to their post treatment clinical&#xD;
      status. Thus for the CIC/PBS study both the global response assessment (GRA) and the&#xD;
      patient's overall rating of improvement of symptoms (PORIS) will be obtained and comparison&#xD;
      between the pre and post treatment scores will be performed. For the UTI study, the time in&#xD;
      days to subsequent acute urinary tract infection and total number of acute UTI's during one&#xD;
      year following completion of HBOT will be recorded and compared to that individual's prior&#xD;
      clinical history. The dosing algorithm to be used is based on the current standard of care&#xD;
      for the treatment of radiation cystitis for which 2.4 ATA x 90 minutes is provided daily, 5&#xD;
      days per week. The total duration of treatment can range from 30-60 minutes depending upon&#xD;
      the individual patients severity of illness and response to therapy. Patients are routinely&#xD;
      reassessed after every 10-20 treatments. Therefore we are planning to provide 2.4 ATA x 90&#xD;
      minutes with 2 air breaks daily, x 5 days per week x 8 weeks total for both CIC/PBS and rUTI&#xD;
      patient population. We will allow the 40 treatments to be administered over an 8-10 week time&#xD;
      period to provide some degree of scheduling flexibility for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this feasibility study we will determine the demand as measured by the number of patients&#xD;
      accepting the treatment vs the total number of patients offered enrollment. We will determine&#xD;
      the percentage successful completion of the 40 prescribed treatment sessions as the primary&#xD;
      outcome variable. The results of the symptom questionnaires obtained at the conclusion for&#xD;
      HBOT and by follow up telephone survey at 1, 6 and 12 months following completion of HBOT&#xD;
      will be the secondary outcome variable. Finally, adverse events will be gathered on this&#xD;
      patient population as per routine clinical practice. The incidence and severity of otic&#xD;
      barotrauma, hyperoxic myopia, confinement anxiety and generalized seizures will be determined&#xD;
      and compared to the same events experienced by the general hyperbaric patient population&#xD;
      being treated during the same period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptom Survey Instruments Global Response Assessment (GRA) The GRA measures overall&#xD;
      improvement with therapy. It is now used as the primary end point in clinical trials of&#xD;
      therapies for CIC/PBS. The assessment asks: &quot;As compared to when you started the study&#xD;
      [treatment], how would you rate your interstitial cystitis symptoms now?&quot; The seven point&#xD;
      scale is centered at zero (no change): markedly worse; moderately worse; slightly worse; no&#xD;
      change; slightly improved; moderately improved; and markedly improved. Responders will be&#xD;
      defined as those individuals with scores falling in the moderately and markedly improved&#xD;
      categories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's Overall Rating of Improvement of Symptoms (PORIS) The PORIS has three questions&#xD;
      that address the overall change in CIC/PBS, pain, and urgency after treatment as worse, no&#xD;
      better (0% improvement), slightly improved (25%), moderately improved (50%), greatly improved&#xD;
      (75%), or symptoms gone (100% improvement). Responders will be defined as those individuals&#xD;
      with scores falling into the moderately or greatly improved or no symptoms categories.&#xD;
