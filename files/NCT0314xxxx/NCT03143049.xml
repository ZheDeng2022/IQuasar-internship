  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myeloma patients who relapse after prior treatment with bortezomib and lenalidomide have&#xD;
      survival of less than 1 year. Recently, a randomized study of Pomalidomide and dexamethasone&#xD;
      conducted in compared with placebo and dexamethasone showed that pomalidomide can improve&#xD;
      survival of this group of patients. As a result, pomalidomide is now approved by the FDA and&#xD;
      EMA for use in patients with relapsed/refractory myeloma previously treated with bortezomib&#xD;
      and lenalidomide. We have conducted a study using Pomalidomide plus Dexamethasone (PD) in&#xD;
      Asian patients, which showed good efficacy and safety profile. More important for patients&#xD;
      with suboptimal response to PD will achieve a clinically meaningful response with the&#xD;
      addition of oral cyclophosphamide (PCD). In the United States, a small randomised phase 2&#xD;
      study of PCD versus PD showed that PCD have a higher response rates, produce deeper response&#xD;
      and correspondingly longer progression free survival. There is till date no randomised phase&#xD;
      3 study between these regimens. This will be important to determine what is the best&#xD;
      combination including pomalidomide for use in relapse myeloma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will prospectively enrol 120 Asian patients with relapsed myeloma after&#xD;
      prior treatment with bortezomib and lenalidomide, and randomised them between PCD and PD (60&#xD;
      in each arms). Centers in Singapore, Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong will participate in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pomalidomide is a new immunomodulatory drug, which has been shown to be active in myeloma&#xD;
      patients who relapse after bortezomib and lenalidomide. A recent phase III study comparing&#xD;
      pomalidomide plus dexamethasone with placebo plus high dose dexamethasone in patients with&#xD;
      prior exposure to bortezomib and lenalidomide, showed that the use of pomalidomide&#xD;
      significantly improve the overall survival of these patients. In an Asian study, it appears&#xD;
      that the addition of cyclophosphamide can induce further response in patients without a&#xD;
      response to PD. In the United States, a small randomised phase 2 study of PCD versus PD&#xD;
      showed that PCD have a higher response rates, produce deeper response and correspondingly&#xD;
      longer progression free survival. Our hypothesis is therefore that PCD will be better than PD&#xD;
      and should be the standard pomalidomide containing regimen for relapse myeloma patients. This&#xD;
      combination will also be highly relevant to Asian patients because cyclophosphamide is a&#xD;
      relatively cheap drug and the combination will be cost effective if proven to be better than&#xD;
      PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for the Study Purpose There is a relative lack of data on the efficacy and&#xD;
      tolerability of PCD in Asian Patients. The current study will also allow us to test if PCD is&#xD;
      better than PD in the treatment of relapse myeloma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for Study Population The study population will be myeloma patients who have&#xD;
      relapsed following prior treatment with bortezomib and lenalidomide. Pomalidomide is the&#xD;
      current approved treatment choice for this group of patients and a common indication for us&#xD;
      in Asia.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomised phase 3 study in Asian patients with relapse multiple myeloma after prior bortezomib and lenalidomide who will be treated by PD or PCD. Randomisation will be 1:1 using a computer algorithm. There will be no blinding. The patient in the 2 arms will be stratified according to ISS stage 1 or 2 versus stage 3.&#xD;
Cross-over for patients randomised to Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone at progression:&#xD;
Upon progression, patients randomized to pomalidomide and dexamethasone (PD) can cross-over to the PCD arm and have cyclophosphamide added to their regimen according to the PCD regimen. Cyclophosphamide should be added at the beginning of a cycle. They can continue on PCD until further progression. However for these PD patients that cross-over to PCD, the primary endpoint for analysis will be based on response and progression on PD.</intervention_model_description>
