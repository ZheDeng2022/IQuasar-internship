  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aimed to compare the efficacy for bowel cleansing of a split-dose regimen with a low&#xD;
      morning dose of PEG solution (Asymmetric; 25% of the dose is given on the day of the&#xD;
      procedure and 75% of the dose is given on the day before) with the standard split-dose&#xD;
      regimen in patients undergoing screening and surveillance colonoscopy using a low volume&#xD;
      bowel preparation (2L PEG-citrate-simethicone plus Bisacodyl). We enrolled consecutive&#xD;
      outpatients undergoing screening and surveillance colonoscopy in a randomized, single-blind,&#xD;
      non-inferiority clinical trial. Patients were randomly assigned to: group A, asymmetric split&#xD;
      dose regimen (1,5 L of PEG + bisacodyl the day before and 0,5 L 4 hours before colonoscopy);&#xD;
      group B, symmetric split dose regimen (1 L of PEG + bisacodyl the day before and 1 L 5 hours&#xD;
      before colonoscopy). Primary endpoint was the proportion of adequate bowel cleansing.&#xD;
      Moreover, all patients filled in a nurse-administered questionnaire assessing compliance,&#xD;
      tolerability and safety of bowel preparation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Prospective, randomized, single-blind, non-inferiority trial in adult patients undergoing&#xD;
      screening or surveillance colonoscopy. Eligible participants were randomly assigned,&#xD;
      according to a computer-generated list with an allocation ratio of 1:1, to receive either&#xD;
      asymmetric or symmetric split-dose regimen of a low-volume preparation by investigators who&#xD;
      were not involved in the enrolment process. Detailed written instructions were administered&#xD;
      to all patients who accepted to participate. A low-fiber diet was prescribed three day before&#xD;
      colonoscopy; participants in both groups were instructed to have a light lunch on the day&#xD;
      before the colonoscopy and only clear liquid were allowed on the day of the exam. All&#xD;
      endoscopic procedures were scheduled between 9:00 AM and 1:00 PM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preparation used in the study is a combination of a 2 L sulphate-free iso-osmotic&#xD;
      formulation of of PEG-4000 added with citrates and simethicone (PEG-CS) (Lovol-esse;&#xD;
      AlfaWassermann, Bologna, Italy. Kit contains 4 pouches, each containing 64.5gr of PEG, to be&#xD;
      dissolved in 2 L of water.), and bisacodyl 5 mg tablets (Lovodyl; Alfa-Wassermann, Bologna,&#xD;
      Italy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects were instructed to take 4 bisacodyl tablets at 4:00 PM on the day before the&#xD;
      procedure. Subjects allocated to the asymmetric split-dose regimen group were invited to&#xD;
      consume at 6:00 PM on the evening before the colonoscopy 3 sachets of PEG-CS in 1,5 L of&#xD;
      water in a range from 90 to 120 minutes (about 250 mL every 15 min) and 4 hours before the&#xD;
      scheduled procedure 1 sachets in 0,5 L of water in a range from 15 to 30 minutes. Subjects&#xD;
      allocated to the symmetric split-dose regimen group were invited to consume at 6:00 PM on the&#xD;
      evening before the colonoscopy 2 sachets of PEG-CS in 1 L of water in a range from 60 to 90&#xD;
      minutes and 5 hours before the scheduled procedure 2 sachets in 1 L of water in a range from&#xD;
      60 to 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unblinded investigators collected demographic and clinical data with medical history. All&#xD;
      patients filled in a nurse-administered questionnaire to assess compliance, tolerability and&#xD;
      safety of bowel preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinded experencied endoscopists performed endoscopic procedure in accordance with&#xD;
      colonoscopy quality practice. Data on bowel cleansing (evaluated by using Boston Bowel&#xD;
      Preparation Scale), endoscopic procedures and findings (i.e. cancer, polyps, diverticula)&#xD;
      were collected.&#xD;

    <measure>Quality of bowel prepreparation</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of bowel prepreparation/cleanliness scored using the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale. Each segment of the colon received a score from 0 to 3, and these segment scores were summed for a total BBPS score ranging from 0 to 9. The preparation was considered adequate when BBPS score was ≥ 6 with a score with at least 2 points in any segment</description>
