  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well trametinib works in treating patients with epithelioid&#xD;
      hemangioendothelioma that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic), nearby tissue&#xD;
      or lymph nodes (locally advanced), or cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). Trametinib&#xD;
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Estimate the objective response rate (ORR) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
      Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Estimate the 6-month and median progression free survival (PFS) rates. II. Estimate the&#xD;
      2-year and median overall survival (OS) rates. III. Evaluate the safety of trametinib in&#xD;
      patients with epithelioid hemangioendothelioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Evaluate patient-reported symptoms using National Institutes of Health Patient Reported&#xD;
      Outcomes Measurement Information System (NIH PROMIS) global health; pain intensity,&#xD;
      interference and behavior short form inventories prior to, after 4 weeks and after 6 months&#xD;
      (if stable or better disease) of treatment, and on evidence of disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare the rates of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma progression prior to starting&#xD;
      trametinib to rates on treatment by central review of radiology images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the effect of trametinib on change in tumor volume and compare to RECIST 1.1&#xD;
      response through central imaging review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate the effect of trametinib on markers of inflammation including c-reactive&#xD;
      protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and plasma connective tissue growth&#xD;
      factor (CTGF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive trametinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      28 days for up to 52 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 6 months.&#xD;

    <description>Will be assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. Will be summarized with a scatterplot. The Pearson correlation coefficient (or Spearman, if more appropriate) will be assessed to determine the strength of the agreement. Agreement of the tumor classifications (response versus no response) will be summarized as the raw agreement and with a Kappa Statistic. The association of the change in tumor volume with survival will be evaluated in two ways. The first will be to use the change in tumor volume as a time dependent variable in a Cox model. The second will be a landmark analysis (done at either the first radiographic assessment or at the second radiographic assessment) to compare the survival of patients classified as a responder (based on tumor volume) to those who have not responded by the selected landmark time. Patients who died prior to the landmark time point will be omitted from analysis.</description>

             to those resulting in exposures approximately 0.3 times the human exposure at the&#xD;
             recommended clinical dose. Therefore, the study drug must not be administered to&#xD;
             pregnant women or nursing mothers; women of childbearing potential should be advised&#xD;
             to avoid pregnancy and use effective methods of contraception; men with a female&#xD;
             partner of childbearing potential must have either had a prior vasectomy or agree to&#xD;
             use effective contraception; if a female patient or a female partner of a patient&#xD;
             becomes pregnant while the patient receives trametinib, the potential hazard to the&#xD;
             fetus should be explained to the patient and partner (as applicable)&#xD;
