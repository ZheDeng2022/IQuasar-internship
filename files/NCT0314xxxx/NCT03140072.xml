  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this integrated, multi-part, Phase I study, the safety, tolerability, food effect,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of single and repeated doses of&#xD;
      AZD9898 will be investigated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a Phase I, randomized, placebo-controlled study in healthy subjects and&#xD;
      asthma patients, performed at 2 study centers. The study will consist of 3 parts (Part 1 [SAD&#xD;
      in healthy subjects]; Part 2 [SAD in asthma patients]; Part 3 [MAD in healthy subjects under&#xD;
      fasted conditions, with one cohort participating under fed conditions during one day as&#xD;
      well]). The SAD cohorts in Parts 1 and 2 of the study will include male and women of&#xD;
      non-childbearing potential (WONCBP) until the exposure limit for males has been reached. If&#xD;
      an additional cohort for Parts 1 and 2 with a dose exceeding exposure limits in males is&#xD;
      warranted (to explore the upper end of the dose response curve), this will be conducted in&#xD;
      WONCBP only. Cohorts in Part 3 will include male subjects and WONCBP, depending on&#xD;
      recruitment feasibility. All cohorts in the study will be single-blinded.&#xD;
