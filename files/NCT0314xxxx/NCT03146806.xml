      The main purpose of this study is to determine the safety, feasibility, and utility of&#xD;
      intranasal (NAS) ketamine in persistent uncontrolled cancer related pain. In this prospective&#xD;
      clinical trial the researchers will investigate the use of NAS ketamine in patients with pain&#xD;
      related to cancer or cancer treatment. The researchers plan to enroll at least 25 patients&#xD;
      meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria, to achieve a minimum of 10 patients who complete the&#xD;
      study. Participants will be recruited from the supportive oncology clinic, oncology clinics,&#xD;
      the pain clinic and Acute Pain Service at Emory. Participants will be asked to return to the&#xD;
      Phase I unit of the Winship Cancer Building C for a total of 5 study visits, each two to five&#xD;
      days apart. During these visits participants will complete questionnaires, have blood samples&#xD;
      drawn and will have study medication administered to them in escalating doses. For safety&#xD;
      monitoring participants will be contacted by telephone 14 days after the last dose of&#xD;
      medication administered.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are about 11.9 million Americans affected with cancer. 53% of patients with cancer&#xD;
      experience pain at all stages of cancer. These patients often require high doses of opioids&#xD;
      with uncontrolled pain that makes them too sedated to effectively participate in day-to-day&#xD;
      activities and have a good quality of life. Depression often co-exists with cancer pain due&#xD;
      to the nature of the disease. The researchers are searching for improved therapies for&#xD;
      chronic cancer pain and ketamine with its novel mechanism of action may be a promising&#xD;
      solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine is an FDA approved anesthetic with the ability to effect memory loss, pain relief&#xD;
      and sedation. Safety and efficacy of ketamine as an anesthetic and analgesic agent is well&#xD;
      documented. Low doses of ketamine have minimal adverse impact on circulatory or breathing&#xD;
      functions but can reduce pain. Research has shown that ketamine is effective in controlling&#xD;
      breakthrough pain and reducing depression in a randomized double blind controlled trial.&#xD;
      There is limited data regarding the use of ketamine for pain management in cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the challenges with ketamine is the route of administration, most commonly given&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM). It has also been given by mouth and rectally, but&#xD;
      absorption is very poor. Intranasal (NAS) administration may be a promising method of&#xD;
      delivery and can be ordered by a physician from a compounding pharmacy. From other research&#xD;
      the investigators expect absorption to be higher than oral or rectal administration and this&#xD;
      method of delivery as needle-free is a patient-friendly route of administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to determine the safety, feasibility, and utility of&#xD;
      intranasal (NAS) ketamine in persistent uncontrolled cancer related pain. In this prospective&#xD;
      clinical trial the researchers will investigate the use of NAS ketamine in patients with pain&#xD;
      related to cancer or cancer treatment. The researchers plan to enroll at least 15 patients&#xD;
      meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria, to achieve a minimum of 10 patients who complete the&#xD;
      study. Participants will be recruited from the oncology clinic, pain clinic and Acute Pain&#xD;
      Service at Emory. Participants will be asked to return to the Phase I unit of the Winship&#xD;
      Cancer Building C for a total of 5 study visits, each two to five days apart. During these&#xD;
      visits participants will complete questionnaires, have blood samples drawn and will have&#xD;
      study medication administered to them in escalating doses. For safety monitoring participants&#xD;
      will be contacted by telephone 14 days after the last dose of medication administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data obtained from this study will help determine if ketamine provides a reduction of pain&#xD;
      using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale and a reduction in the use of opioid consumption and&#xD;
      other rescue medications. Additionally the researchers will study the bioavailability,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of ketamine and the safety profile of NAS ketamine.&#xD;

    <measure>Bioavailability of Ketamine</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Minutes 2, 30, 60, and 240 during Study Visits 1 through 4, up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were obtained at the study visits where ketamine was administered to measure the bioavailability (a pharmacokinetic characteristic) of intranasal and intravenous ketamine. Bioavailability is assessed as nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) of ketamine circulating in blood. Each study participant received each dose of ketamine during separate study visits. Samples were obtained prior to ketamine administration, and at 2, 30, 60 and 240 minutes after medication administration, during study visits 1 through 4. The baseline sample was not collected at the first study visit as assessing prior intake of ketamine was not necessary.</description>

    <description>Blood samples were obtained at the study visits where ketamine was administered to measure the peak concentration (Cmax) of intranasal and intravenous ketamine. Peak concentration is assessed as the maximum ng/mL of ketamine circulating in blood. Each study participant received each dose of ketamine during separate study visits. Samples were obtained at 2, 30, 60 and 240 minutes after medication administration.</description>

    <measure>Area Under the Curve of Ketamine</measure>
    <time_frame>Minute 2 through Minute 240 during Study Visits 1 through 4, up to 4 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were obtained at the study visits where ketamine was administered to measure the elimination (a pharmacokinetic characteristic) of intranasal and intravenous ketamine. Elimination of the drug disappearing from the body is assessed as the area under the curve (AUC). Each study participant received each dose of ketamine during separate study visits. Samples were obtained at 2, 30, 60 and 240 minutes after medication administration. Each subject did not have quantitative levels at all time points. There were not enough data to construct a curve for each participant and therefore calculate an AUC. Data from all participants were naively pooled to calculate one AUC for the entire population (i.e., across all participants' data).</description>

    <measure>Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Minutes 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180, and 240 during Study Visits 1 through 4, up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) was used to evaluate patient reported pain. Pain scores were recorded prior to and at 5,10,15, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180 and 240 minutes after administration of ketamine. The NPRS asks participants rate their current level of pain intensity on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). In general, improvements of pain severity of 1.5 points or less on NPRS could be seen as clinically irrelevant. Above that value, the cutoff point for &quot;clinical relevance&quot; depends on patients' baseline pain severity, and ranges from 2.4 to 5.3. Higher baseline scores require larger raw changes to represent clinically important differences.</description>

          <title>Ketamine Treatment</title>
          <description>On the first study visit, 10mg of intranasal ketamine was given to make sure that the study patients could tolerate a small dose of intranasal ketamine. On the second visit, 10 mg of intravenous (IV) ketamine was given to compare the two routes of ketamine administration, with patients serving as their own controls. On the third and fourth visit, higher doses of intranasal ketamine, 30 mg and 50 mg respectively, were given, if the patients did not have severe adverse events with the smaller dosage. Participants returned for a fifth visit, 24 hours after Visit 4, to provide a blood sample and complete questionnaires.</description>

        <title>Bioavailability of Ketamine</title>
        <description>Blood samples were obtained at the study visits where ketamine was administered to measure the bioavailability (a pharmacokinetic characteristic) of intranasal and intravenous ketamine. Bioavailability is assessed as nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) of ketamine circulating in blood. Each study participant received each dose of ketamine during separate study visits. Samples were obtained prior to ketamine administration, and at 2, 30, 60 and 240 minutes after medication administration, during study visits 1 through 4. The baseline sample was not collected at the first study visit as assessing prior intake of ketamine was not necessary.</description>

        <title>Area Under the Curve of Ketamine</title>
        <description>Blood samples were obtained at the study visits where ketamine was administered to measure the elimination (a pharmacokinetic characteristic) of intranasal and intravenous ketamine. Elimination of the drug disappearing from the body is assessed as the area under the curve (AUC). Each study participant received each dose of ketamine during separate study visits. Samples were obtained at 2, 30, 60 and 240 minutes after medication administration. Each subject did not have quantitative levels at all time points. There were not enough data to construct a curve for each participant and therefore calculate an AUC. Data from all participants were naively pooled to calculate one AUC for the entire population (i.e., across all participants' data).</description>

        <title>Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) Score</title>
        <description>The Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) was used to evaluate patient reported pain. Pain scores were recorded prior to and at 5,10,15, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180 and 240 minutes after administration of ketamine. The NPRS asks participants rate their current level of pain intensity on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). In general, improvements of pain severity of 1.5 points or less on NPRS could be seen as clinically irrelevant. Above that value, the cutoff point for &quot;clinical relevance&quot; depends on patients' baseline pain severity, and ranges from 2.4 to 5.3. Higher baseline scores require larger raw changes to represent clinically important differences.</description>

          <description>To evaluate self-reported mood change, participants completed the Side Effect Rating Scale for Dissociative Anesthetics (SERSDA). During visits 1 through 4, side effects were documented by SERSDA prior to administration of medication and 30, 60 and 240 minutes after ketamine administration. Participants indicated the severity of this side effect by selecting 0 (side effect is absent), 1 (weak side effect), 2 (modest side effect), 3 (bothersome side effect), or 4 (side effect is very bothersome).</description>

        <description>Depression was assessed on the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) during each study visit, before medication administration and 180 minutes after medication administration. The MADRS is designed to be particularly sensitive to treatment effects. The MADRS is a 10-item scale where the survey administrator rates the participant on a variety of aspects related to depression (such as apparent sadness, tension, and pessimistic thoughts) based on a clinical interview. Responses are provided on a scale of 0 to 6 where 0 signifies no difficulties in this area and 6 signifies severe difficulty. Total scores range from 0 to 60 with higher scores indicating greater severity of depression.</description>

        <description>The PROMIS Global Health questionnaire, version 1.1, consists of 10 items assessing general domains of health and functioning. Items are scored on a 5-point scale where 1 = poor and 5 = excellent. Total scores are standardized to a T-score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Scores above 50 indicate better health and functioning, while scores below 50 indicate physical, mental and social health that is below average.</description>
