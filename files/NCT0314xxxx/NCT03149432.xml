  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of the mirror therapy on phantom pain for&#xD;
      patients with amputation after vascular etiology. the secondary aim are to measure the impact&#xD;
      of the mirror therapy on quality of life, sleep disorders, and predictive factors for&#xD;
      effectiveness. the design is a prospective study, randomised, blindly evaluated, monocentric.&#xD;
      There will be 2 groups: 1) rehabilitation and gabapentine; 2) rehabilitation and gabapentine&#xD;
      + mirror therapy during the first 4 weeks. The assessment are going to be preformed at the&#xD;
      inclusion day and then every 2 weeks during 8 weeks. the primary evaluation criterion will be&#xD;
      the phantom pain measured on a VAS. the delay for inclusion is 18 months in order ton include&#xD;
      40 patients. The length of the study is 20 months.&#xD;

      Several variables at the beginning collected to study the predictive factors of effectiveness&#xD;
      of mirror therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sex&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Delay from amputation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Etiology: neuropathy associated or not&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VAS of preoperative pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VAS phantom pain at baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Localization of pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ability to mobilize the phantom limb&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healing obtained or not&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of stump: defective or not&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of amputation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Circumstance of amputation: programmed / not programmed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychological experience: Montgomery and Asberg Depression Scale score (MADRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Socio-economic level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The initial analgesic neuropathic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Possible previous prosthesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was also collected at week 4 and 8 :&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The level of advancement of the equipment by prosthesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient with the inclusion criteria, who agreed to participate in the study after&#xD;
      reading the information note and signed consent, will be included in one of the two groups&#xD;
      after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group Reference Analgesic: receiving a reference antalgic management according to the&#xD;
      protocol of the service: traditional management and treatment with Gabapentin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group Reference Analgesic and mirror therapy: receiving the reference antalgic management&#xD;
      according to the protocol of the service: traditional management and treatment with&#xD;
      Gabapentin as well as a management by mirror therapy during the first 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group Reference analgesic and Mirror therapy, the mirror therapy will be performed by a&#xD;
      physiotherapist trained in practice and already applying this technique in the center. Each&#xD;
      patient receives, during the first week of treatment, 5 sessions of 20 minutes each&#xD;
      decomposed as follows: 15 minutes of motor exercise and 5 minutes of sensory exercise. The&#xD;
      content of the session was decided and put in place by the physiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the following 3 weeks the patients must practice self-rehabilitation at the rate of 5&#xD;
      sessions per week with a weekly re-evaluation session by the physiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before inclusion, the patient should be weaned as far as possible from neuropathic&#xD;
      neuropathic treatments other than Gabapentin introduced for the treatment of phantom pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, patients receive the reference treatment according to the protocol of the&#xD;
      service: titration of Gabapentin up to 3600 mg or maximum tolerated dose for 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereafter, depending on the patient's response and tolerance, the dose may be increased in&#xD;
      increments of 300 mg / day every 2-3 days to a maximum dose of 3600 mg / day. A slower&#xD;
      titration of gabapentin may be appropriate in some patients. The minimum time to reach a dose&#xD;
      of 1800 mg / day is one week, to reach 2400 mg / day it is 2 weeks in total and to reach 3600&#xD;
      mg / day it is 3 weeks in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No other analgesic neuropathic treatment could be introduced or increased (PREGABALINE,&#xD;
      AMITRIPTYLINE, DULOXETINE, MORPHINIC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A punctual treatment (PARACETAMOL, CODEINE, NSAID, NEFOPAM) on acute pain without action on&#xD;
      neuropathic type pain, linked to a different pathology is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If in Reference Analgesic group, the phantom limb pain was not sufficiently relieved at the&#xD;
      end of the protocol, and the mirror therapy seems to be effective, a treatment by mirror&#xD;
      therapy can be proposed to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VAS and the details of the analgesic treatment will be collected every 2 weeks, blinded&#xD;
      by an independent evaluator. Patients should not tell the evaluator which group they are&#xD;
      assigned to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advancement of the prosthesis were collected at 4 and 8 weeks. Moreover, this is an&#xD;
      observational study, following routine procedures already practiced systematically in the&#xD;
      institution with this patient population. There are no additional procedures for diagnosis or&#xD;
      additional medical supervision in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      16 subjects per group make it possible to demonstrate a size 1 effect with a risk of first&#xD;
      species of 5% and a power of 80%. In order to take into account the risk of exiting the&#xD;
      trial, we plan to include 20 patients in each group, sp a total of 40 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will use Sigma PlotÂ® 12.5 for Windows Systat Software, Inc. or R&#xD;
      software. Quantitative data will be reported in terms of mean, standard deviation and / or&#xD;
      median and interquartile range. Qualitative data will be reported in terms of numbers and&#xD;
      percentages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The groups will be compared by Chi2 tests, or Fisher tests in case of insufficient numbers,&#xD;
      for the qualitative variables. For quantitative variables the groups will be compared by T&#xD;
      tests, or Wilcoxon tests if the variables do not have a normal distribution.&#xD;
