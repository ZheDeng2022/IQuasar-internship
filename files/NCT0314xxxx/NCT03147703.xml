      The purpose of this investigation is to test the hypothesis that in humans, eating late may&#xD;
      induce changes in saliva microbiota daily rhythms towards a more obesogenic and a less&#xD;
      responsiveness to dietary treatments profile. These changes in microbiota may partly explain&#xD;
      the weight loss difficulties that characterized late eaters in previous studies. Thus, the&#xD;
      aim is to analyze the effect of the timing of food intake in humans' saliva microbiome daily&#xD;
      rhythms in a randomized, crossover interventional study, in order to achieve.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity can currently be considered a major threat to human health. Recent&#xD;
      studies suggest that not only &quot;what&quot; we eat, but also &quot;when&quot; we eat may have a significant&#xD;
      role in obesity treatment. The importance of caloric distribution across the day on weight&#xD;
      loss therapy was supported by a 12-weeks experimental study showing that subjects assigned to&#xD;
      high caloric intake during breakfast lost significantly more weight than those assigned to&#xD;
      high caloric intake during the dinner. These results suggest that eating late may affect&#xD;
      obesity and impair the success of weight loss therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Novel evidence from animal and human studies indicates that the composition of the gut&#xD;
      microbiota may also be involved in obesity and weight loss. Moreover, studies performed in&#xD;
      extreme obese subjects have demonstrated that weight loss improves the obesity-associated gut&#xD;
      microbiota composition towards a lean microbiome phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study has shown that the timing of food intake influences microbiota in mice model.&#xD;
      This study reported that obesity dampens the cyclical changes in the gut microbiome of mice&#xD;
      while time-restricted feeding (TRF), in which feeding is consolidated to the nocturnal phase,&#xD;
      partially restores these cyclical fluctuations. Furthermore, TRF which protects against&#xD;
      obesity and metabolic diseases affects bacteria and has shown to influence host metabolism.&#xD;
      Then, feeding pattern and time of food intake, in addition to diet, are important parameters&#xD;
      when assessing the microbiome's contribution to mice metabolism. However, to our knowledge no&#xD;
      human studies are available showing the effect of timing of food intake in microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the aim was to analyze the effect of the timing of food intake in humans' saliva&#xD;
      microbiome, in order to achieve a better understanding of the relationship between food&#xD;
      timing, obesity and weight loss in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This goal will be achieved through a specific approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Interventional (randomized, cross-over controlled trials) (Aim 1): To study that, eating&#xD;
      late may induce changes in saliva microbiota daily rhythms towards a more obesogenic pattern&#xD;
      and a less responsiveness to dietary treatments profile in women (n=10).&#xD;
