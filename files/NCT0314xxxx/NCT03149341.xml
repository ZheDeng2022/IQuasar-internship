  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to (1) quantify cardiovascular anatomy and physiology using&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging under both resting and exercise conditions in patients who have&#xD;
      congenital heart disease and in age-matched normal volunteers, (2) use computer models to&#xD;
      reproduce and simulate blood flow in these patients, and then (3) to combine the imaging data&#xD;
      and computer models to estimate values which cannot be directly measured and to predict&#xD;
      physiological changes induced by exercise and medical or surgical therapies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Investigators hope to gain a greater understanding of the hemodynamics of congenital heart&#xD;
      disease and their associated operations as they pertain to real-life situations (i.e. upright&#xD;
      and non-sedentary, rest and exercise). With this knowledge, investigators would look to&#xD;
      optimize the geometry and physiology of the patients, potentially reducing several of the&#xD;
      long-term complications found in congenital heart disease patients such as cardiomyopathy,&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension, arrhythmias, thrombosis and heart failure.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients will have congenital heart disease or acquired cardiopulmonary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  normal volunteers will be willing to undergo MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients unable to receive intravenous contrast material (this does not apply to&#xD;
             normal volunteers)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  subjects with arrhythmias which will prevent MRI cardiac gating&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  subjects with illnesses which make participation inappropriate. In addition, patients&#xD;
             who would normally be excluded from an MRI study because of pacemaker implant,&#xD;
             aneurysm clip, severe claustrophobia, or any other condition which, based on the&#xD;
             Investigator's judgment, would preclude proximity to a strong magnetic field will be&#xD;
             excluded from this study as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NORMAL VOLUNTEERS may be excluded if they are not able to remain still during the exam&#xD;
             or follow the instructions of the investigators.&#xD;
