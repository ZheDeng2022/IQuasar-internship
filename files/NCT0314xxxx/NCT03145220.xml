    <textblock>
      EA-230 is a newly developed synthetic compound with anti-inflammatory properties, it is a&#xD;
      linear tetrapeptide derived from the human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (hCG). Recently,&#xD;
      its immunomodulatory effects in humans were confirmed in a phase I trial and an optimal dose&#xD;
      was established. To establish this anti-inflammatory effect in a selected patient population&#xD;
      and assess clinical outcome, a combined phase IIa/IIb trial will be conducted with patients&#xD;
      undergoing cardiac surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic inflammation is a condition in which the innate immune system is activated due to a&#xD;
      variety of causes such as sepsis, trauma, and major surgical interventions. The clinical&#xD;
      condition in which the body responds to such stimuli by the release of circulating&#xD;
      inflammatory mediators is well known as the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)&#xD;
      and is defined by tachypnoea, tachycardia, leucocytosis or leucopenia and hyper- or&#xD;
      hypothermia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although this activation of the immune system is essential for survival, the often subsequent&#xD;
      overwhelming pro-inflammatory response may be detrimental. Of the many downstream&#xD;
      consequences of this exaggerated inflammatory response, organ injury and failure is the most&#xD;
      serious, most often involving the kidneys. Multiple organ failure (MOF) is associated with&#xD;
      high morbidity and mortality, whereas failure of kidneys is an independent prognostic factor&#xD;
      for mortality in critically ill patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This exaggerated systemic pro-inflammation also occurs during major surgical procedures,&#xD;
      especially in cardiac surgery procedures. Multiple stimuli during these procedures, such as&#xD;
      sternotomy, extra-corporal cardio-pulmonary bypass (ECC) and aortal cross-clamping, account&#xD;
      for substantial systemic inflammatory activation. The extent of inflammation following this&#xD;
      procedures is directly associated with patient outcome, as high post-operative levels of IL-6&#xD;
      have been proven to correlate with adverse outcome and mortality. Also at organ level, the&#xD;
      incidence of inflammation associated development of acute kidney injury (AKI) following&#xD;
      cardiac surgery is high and correlates with adverse outcome and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no immunomodulatory treatments, aimed at dampening the (acute) systemic inflammatory&#xD;
      reaction following cardiac surgery with cardio-pulmonary bypass, have shown to improve&#xD;
      essential outcome. Current strategies consist of prevention and supportive treatment; new&#xD;
      strategies aiming at attenuating this exaggerated pro-inflammatory response are therefore&#xD;
      warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EA-230 is a novel pharmacological compound, developed for the treatment of systemic&#xD;
      inflammation and associated organ dysfunction. It is a linear tetrapeptide derived from the&#xD;
      human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (hCG). It has shown anti-inflammatory properties and&#xD;
      protects against organ failure and associated mortality in several pre-clinical models of&#xD;
      sepsis or systemic inflammation. As EA-230 attenuates the pro-inflammatory response in&#xD;
      neutrophils and monocytes ex vivo, and neutrophil influx in tissues during systemic&#xD;
      inflammation in vivo is abrogated, it is thought that EA-230 acts by protecting the host&#xD;
      against the detrimental effects of neutrophils during acute systemic inflammatory diseases,&#xD;
      thereby preventing organ damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recently performed phase I study into the safety and tolerability of EA-230 in 24 subjects&#xD;
      showed that continuous administration of EA-230 up to 90 mg/kg/hour infused intravenously is&#xD;
      well tolerated and has an excellent safety profile. This profile was confirmed in a&#xD;
      consequent executed phase IIa study in which 36 healthy subjects received the same dosages of&#xD;
      EA-230 during human experimental endotoxemia. In this human model of controlled systemic&#xD;
      inflammation elicited by the administration of a low dose of endotoxin, the anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      effects of EA-230 shown in pre-clinical studies were confirmed and the optimal dose was&#xD;
      established. Subjects treated with the highest dose (90 mg/kg/hour) showed less flu-like&#xD;
      symptoms, development of fever was suppressed, and reduced levels of pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators (among others Interleukin-6 and Interleukin-8) were observed compared to&#xD;
      placebo-treated subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This current study is a combined phase IIa/IIb, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind,&#xD;
      clinical trial. In the first part, phase IIa, the study aims to confirm safety and&#xD;
      tolerability in a patient population (n=60, 30 active and 30 placebo) with systemic&#xD;
      inflammation elicited by on-pump cardiac surgery. In the second part, phase IIb, the&#xD;
      immunomodulatory effect of EA-230 is studied in a same patient population (n=180, 90 active&#xD;
      and 90 placebo, including patients from part 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After inclusion of 90 patients, halfway the study, an additional adaptive power analysis will&#xD;
      be performed to re-evaluate group size and power. Efficacy and sample size re-determination&#xD;
      will be performed by the statistician of the Data Safety Management Board (DSMB).&#xD;
