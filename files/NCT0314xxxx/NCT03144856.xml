  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to see whether Apatinib is effective in treating patients with&#xD;
      advanced refractory biliary tract cancers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Biliary tract cancers (BTC) includes cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder carcinoma (GBC). The&#xD;
      systematic treatment based on gemcitabine plus cisplatin is recommended as the current&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy for unresectable or metastatic BTC. There is no standard recommendation&#xD;
      for second line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor&#xD;
      2(VEGFR-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of Apatinib in patients with&#xD;
      advanced refractory BTC who had received first-line chemotherapy.&#xD;
