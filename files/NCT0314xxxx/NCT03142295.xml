  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this pilot study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      controlled human urine transfusion in female patients with recurrent UTI's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seconday and exploratory objectives are to evaluate the diversity of the urine microbiome&#xD;
      after urine transfusion, to assess the longevity of changes in the urine microbiome in&#xD;
      patients after urine transfusion over a period of 6 months and to assess the frequency of&#xD;
      UTI's after the transfusion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infections in nursing&#xD;
      homes, in acute care and the general practice. Increasing antibiotic resistance of&#xD;
      enterobacteriaciae poses a challenge to the treatment of UTIs. Unlike previously thought, the&#xD;
      bladder is colonized with bacteria, which together form the urine microbiome. Recurrent&#xD;
      urinary tract infections are associated with a decreased urinary microbiota diversity,&#xD;
      potentially making recolonization by bacterial interference in the bladder an alternative&#xD;
      therapy for UTI. Pioneering studies showed that local bacterial interference in the bladder&#xD;
      can be performed safely and has potential as prophylactic intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We now propose to expand this bacterial interference to a polymicrobial inoculum to increase&#xD;
      adherence of the donor microbiome and as such expand the prophylactic effect. This pilot&#xD;
      trial will investigate the safety and tolerability of urine transfusion from healthy donors&#xD;
      to the bladders of patients with recurrent UTIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this pilot study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      controlled human urine transfusion in female patients with recurrent UTI's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary and exploratory objectives are to evaluate the diversity of the urine microbiome&#xD;
      after urine transfusion, to assess the longevity of changes in the urine microbiome in&#xD;
      patients after urine transfusion over a period of 6 months and to assess the frequency of&#xD;
      UTI's after the transfusion.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is premenopausal, aged ≥ 18 and ≤45 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject had recurrent UTI's (≥3 documented UTI's in the last year with documented&#xD;
             symptom-free interval of at least 2 weeks) following the definition of a urinary tract&#xD;
