    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single arm, 3-cohort, open-label trial of high dose Vitamin C&#xD;
      intravenous infusion in subjects with solid tumor malignancies who are eligible for resection&#xD;
      (cohort A) or with extended RAS (e.g.KRAS or NRAS) or BRAF mutation metastatic cancer who&#xD;
      have received prior systemic treatment (cohort B). Cohort C will involve patients with&#xD;
      colorectal cancer having an extended RAS or BRAF mutation who are amenable for localregional&#xD;
      therapy of hepatic metastases with Yttrium-90 radioembolization.&#xD;

      This clinical trial is for men and women with resectable or metastatic solid tumor&#xD;
      malignancies. The objective of the study is to investigate whether high dose vitamin C&#xD;
      infusion leads to pathological tumor response in resectable colorectal, pancreatic, and lung&#xD;
      cancer (cohort A) or objective tumor response in KRAS or BRAF mutant solid tumors (cohort B).&#xD;
      For Cohort C, the primary objective is to determine that maximal tolerated dose of the&#xD;
      combination of high dose vitamin C with Y90 radioembolization for patients solid tumor&#xD;
      malignancies and liver metastases amenable to local-regional therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in cohort A receive a high dose vitamin C infusion for 4 days per week for 2-4&#xD;
      consecutive weeks prior to surgery. Patients in cohort B receive high dose vitamin C infusion&#xD;
      for 4 days per week for up to 6 months or disease progression. Cohort C will receive high&#xD;
      dose vitamin C for 1-3 weeks. During week 1 vitamin C infusion and Y90 radioembolization of&#xD;
      hepatic metastases will occur same day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A tumor sample will be resected after completion of study drug (high dose vitamin C infusion)&#xD;
      treatment to examine the effects of study drug (Cohort A only). In addition, organoids will&#xD;
      be grown in vitro and continue to be treated with vitamin C added in culture medium to&#xD;
      examine tumor response. The resected tumor in this study will&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Men and women age 18 and older&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with histologically proven early stage or locally advanced colorectal&#xD;
           adenocarcinoma, lung cancer or pancreatic cancer, who are eligible for resection, and&#xD;
           have not received chemotherapy or radiotherapy (cohort A) Patients with inoperable,&#xD;
           metastatic, KRAS or BRAF mutant colorectal adenocarcinoma, lung cancer and pancreatic&#xD;
           cancer, who have received at least 1 line of treatment for metastatic disease (cohort B)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with metastatic cancer with an extended RAS (e.g. KRAS or NRAS) or BRAF&#xD;

        lining. There are few known interactions with high dose intravenous vitamin C. We recommend&#xD;
        not using deferoxamine as there may be an association with ventricular dysfunction (unknown&#xD;
