      This research study is comparing two different combinations of androgen deprivation therapy&#xD;
      (ADT) used together with radiation as a treatment for rising PSA after radical prostatectomy&#xD;
      (prostate cancer).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that an intervention is being&#xD;
      studied. In this study, the investigational agents are apalutamide and abiraterone acetate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the best standard treatment for men with this type of prostate cancer includes&#xD;
      radiation therapy combined with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). ADT blocks the function&#xD;
      of hormones including testosterone which prostate cancer uses to grow and spread. All&#xD;
      participants in this study will receive the main standard form of ADT called a luteinizing&#xD;
      hormone-releasing hormone agonist (LHRHA). Physicians often also use another drug called&#xD;
      bicalutamide to help the LHRHA block hormone function. The investigators are testing whether&#xD;
      using two newer anti-hormonal drugs called abiraterone acetate and apalutamide with LHRHA can&#xD;
      improve cure rates compared to using bicalutamide plus LHRHA. These two drugs work together&#xD;
      to suppress both testosterone and the receptor where testosterone binds thereby providing&#xD;
      more potent hormone suppression.&#xD;
