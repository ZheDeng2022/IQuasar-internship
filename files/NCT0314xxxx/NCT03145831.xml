      This study is a multi-center, open-label safety study assessing long-term somavaratan&#xD;
      administration. It is open to subjects completing a somavaratan Japanese Phase 2/3 study&#xD;
      (Protocol J14VR5) in children with growth hormone deficiency (GHD), as well as approximately&#xD;
      20 new children currently receiving daily rhGH therapy for GHD (switch subjects). For switch&#xD;
      subjects, the first dose of somavaratan will be administered approximately 48 hours after the&#xD;
      last dose of the daily rhGH. All subjects will receive somavaratan 3.5mg/kg twice-monthly.&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at approximately 40 medical institutions in Japan.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Chronological Age ≥ 3.0 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pre-pubertal status: Absent breast development in girls, testicular volume &lt; 4.0 mL in&#xD;
             boys.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with GHD (diagnosed according to the current diagnostic guidelines) who are&#xD;
             receiving treatment with daily rhGH.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Normal thyroid function at screening visit in subjects not being treated for&#xD;
             hypothyroidism. Subjects requiring thyroxine replacement must be considered adequately&#xD;
             treated by the PI and Medical Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Normal adrenal function (morning cortisol and/or local stimulation test) at screening&#xD;
             visit or within 6 months of the screening visit, in subjects not being treated for&#xD;
             adrenal insufficiency. Subjects with adrenal insufficiency must receive glucocorticoid&#xD;
             treatment for a minimum of 4 weeks before study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pathology relating to cause of GHD must be stable for at least 6 months prior to&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Willingness to discontinue daily rhGH therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Legally authorized representatives must be willing and able to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Prior (in the last 12 months) or concomitant treatment with a growth promoting&#xD;
             agent other than rhGH [e.g., IGF-I, GH releasing hormone (GHRH), sex steroids (except&#xD;
             when used as primer for GH stimulation test), aromatase inhibitors and/or GnRH&#xD;
             agonist].&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Current significant disease (e.g., diabetes, cystic fibrosis, renal insufficiency).&#xD;
             In all cases of concurrent disease, screening must be approved in writing by the&#xD;
             medical monitor.&#xD;

&#xD;
             4. Birth weight and/or birth length less than 5th percentile for gestational age using&#xD;
             local gestational age growth charts.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Prolonged daily (&gt; 14 days) use of anti-inflammatory doses of oral glucocorticoids.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Prior history of malignancy. 7. Treatment with an investigational drug in the 30&#xD;

             retinopathy at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
             10. Significant spinal abnormalities including scoliosis, kyphosis, Chiari&#xD;
             malformation, and spina bifida variants.&#xD;
&#xD;
             11. Significant abnormality in screening laboratory studies (as assessed by PI and&#xD;
             medical monitor).&#xD;
&#xD;
             12. Current social conditions which would prevent completion of study activities&#xD;
             (e.g., planned family move to a distant location).&#xD;
&#xD;
             13. History of pancreatitis or undiagnosed chronic abdominal pain. 14. History of&#xD;
             spinal or total body irradiation. 15. Presence of other pituitary hormone deficiencies&#xD;
             that are not properly treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
             16. Unwillingness to provide consent for participation in all trial activities&#xD;
