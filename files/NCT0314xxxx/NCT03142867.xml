  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a global health concern with a suspected&#xD;
      increasing prevalence due to the rise in obesity and diabetes mellitus. The vast majority of&#xD;
      patients will have isolated steatosis or steatosis with mild inflammation that is very&#xD;
      unlikely to progress in severity. However, about 25% of patients with NAFLD have&#xD;
      non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the more aggressive form of the disease that is&#xD;
      associated with fibrosis progression and potential risk for cirrhosis and end-stage liver&#xD;
      disease complications. Additionally, multiple studies have demonstrated an association&#xD;
      between NAFLD and the presence of coronary artery disease by either coronary CT angiography&#xD;
      (CCTA) or coronary artery calcium (CAC) score. Cardiovascular disease is the most important&#xD;
      cause of mortality in patients with the entire spectrum of NAFLD. In the era of advanced&#xD;
      imaging and functional vascular assessment it is possible that novel risk assessments are&#xD;
      poised to refine overall prognostic estimation in this population. Multiple analyses have&#xD;
      suggested that NAFLD is an independent and strong predictor of significant CAD independent of&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors, including a significant burden of high risk CCTA findings in one&#xD;
      analysis of symptomatic patients in the emergency department. Given the multiple metabolic&#xD;
      derangements inherent in the NAFLD population, endothelial dysfunction is also an important&#xD;
      contributor to global cardiovascular dysfunction. Furthermore, data suggests that patients&#xD;
      with NAFLD may be at increased risk of adenomatous polyp formation and colorectal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma. In addition, it is suboptimal to require a liver biopsy to diagnose NASH.&#xD;
      Recent imaging advances have made it possible to assess liver fibrosis but have yet to be&#xD;
      fully studied in NAFLD. The purpose of this study is to assess the current prevalence and&#xD;
      severity of NAFLD in adult subjects. Secondary endpoints include correlation to new vascular&#xD;
      function (cine scan of the abdominal aorta) and echocardiographic imaging modalities&#xD;
      available at BAMC and to circulating biomarker panels as well as to determine the prevalence&#xD;
      and severity of CAD by multidetector coronary CT angiography with subject outcomes being&#xD;
      monitored prospectively. Additionally, correlation of NAFLD diagnosis to colonoscopy findings&#xD;
      will be performed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective study, adult patients ranging in age from 18-80, routinely seen in the&#xD;
      Brooke Army Medical Center Gastroenterology clinics will be eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
      Approximately 950 adult patients will be enrolled. In phase I the prevalence of NAFLD and&#xD;
      NASH will be determined, non-invasive imaging techniques for the diagnosis of NAFLD and NASH&#xD;
      will be explored, and the relationship between colon polyps and NAFLD will be evaluated.&#xD;
      Phase II will be offered to participants that qualified for a liver biopsy. In phase II the&#xD;
      prevalence and severity of CAD, endothelial dysfunction, and diastolic dysfunction within the&#xD;
      population of subjects with NAFLD will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent and confirming that the subject has met inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria for the study, the study will employ a questionnaire to be completed by&#xD;
      the subject. This questionnaire will include data such as race and ethnic group, past medical&#xD;
      history, current medications, etc. The subject will then have routine labs (liver function&#xD;
      tests, fasting insulin, glucose, and a pregnancy test for all female subjects), FibroScan®&#xD;
      and MRE/MRI done to assess for the presence or absence of hepatic steatosis, inflammation,&#xD;
      fibrosis, iron quantification and diameter and luminal characteristics of the abdominal&#xD;
      aorta. Subjects will be called by the PI or an AI to return to the clinic for additional&#xD;
      study procedures to include a core liver biopsy if they are identified to have one or more of&#xD;
      the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  greater or equal to 5% steatosis on MRI or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  liver stiffness greater than 7 kPa on Fibroscan®, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evidence of fibrosis on MRE or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LIF score of 2.0 or greater&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI/AI will let the subject know that he/she qualifies for further diagnostic testing as&#xD;
      part of the trial and will discuss tests results with them in detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FibroScan examination will be performed to assess liver stiffness according to the&#xD;
      manufacturer's recommendation and in accordance with the device's FDA clearance. The device&#xD;
      is equipped with two probes (M and XL) dedicated to different morphology and operating at&#xD;
      different measurement depths. The M probe operates between 25 and 65 mm below the skin&#xD;
      surface and the XL probe operates between 35 and 75 mm. The device's software automatically&#xD;
      recommends which probe is the most appropriate during examination based on the real time&#xD;
      assessment of the skin to liver capsule distance (automatic probe selection tool). The&#xD;
      FibroScan used in this study will be equipped with a software allowing, in addition to liver&#xD;
      stiffness, measurement of the Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP) which is related to&#xD;
      liver steatosis with different algorithm. This additional software feature is FDA approved.&#xD;
      Operators will be trained and certified by the manufacturer or its local representative.&#xD;
      Recommendation from the Automatic Probe Selection tool will be followed. At least ten valid&#xD;
      measurements should be obtained. De-identified acquisition files will be reviewed by the&#xD;
      device's manufacturer (Echosens) to confirm the operator's choice of measurement depths and&#xD;
      eventually change them as well as analyze the additional ultrasonic signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the Fibroscan, a second non-invasive imaging technique, MRE/MRI Liver&#xD;
      MultiScan for detecting steatosis, inflammation and liver fibrosis or stiffness will be&#xD;
      conducted. This data will be used to correlate with the presence of NAFLD/NASH. MRI-Liver&#xD;
      MultiScan is a post MRI processing software. It involves a specialized magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) technique/sequences that measures fat, iron and fibrosis in the liver using T1&#xD;
      mapping. The procedure has no need for intravenous contrast. LiverMultiScan is currently&#xD;
      approved by the FDA for use with Siemens 3T MRI with E11 software. However, this MRI model is&#xD;
      not being used at BAMC. Therefore, the use of LMS locally will conducted under an IDE&#xD;
      exemption for diagnostic devices (21 CFR 812.2(c))(3). The LMS software will not be used to&#xD;
      clinically diagnose subjects. Rather, data will be collected and analyzed by the site and&#xD;
      manufacturer (Perspectum) with the knowledge that MRI is not performed in accordance with LMS&#xD;
      labeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BAMC Radiology will work in collaboration with Perspectum to complete the post processing&#xD;
      review of the MRI image data to correlate with the presence of NAFLD/NASH. The BAMC Radiology&#xD;
      Department AI's will de-identify the image data (remove all PHI), load on a secure server and&#xD;
      have Perspectum Diagnostics complete the post-processing interpretations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MR elastography scan will be conducted in conjuncture with the MRI scan and&#xD;
      post-processed by AIs within the BAMC Radiology Department. In addition, AIs in the BAMC&#xD;
      Radiology Department will conduct a safety read of all scans. The results of the MRE and the&#xD;
      safety read will be placed in the subject's electronic medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants that qualify for a core liver biopsy based upon the results from the FibroScan&#xD;
      and MRE/MRI LiverMultiScan will be asked to return to specimen collection for additional&#xD;
      blood work prior to the liver biopsy. This will consist of a complete blood count (CBC),&#xD;
      coagulation panel, fasting lipid panel, GGT, vitamin D level, renal function panel, ferritin,&#xD;
      hemoglobin A1C, and chronic hepatitis panel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then undergo a percutaneous liver biopsy to establish diagnosis of NASH. This&#xD;
      will occur in the Gastroenterology Clinic at Brooke Army Medical Center. The liver tissue&#xD;
      will be submitted to BAMC Pathology Department for evaluation by an AI, an experienced&#xD;
      hepatopathologist. The pathology results will be used to identify subjects who have the more&#xD;
      severe form of NAFLD, NASH. The pathologist will provide an overall diagnostic interpretation&#xD;
      based on the criteria reported by Brunt et al. and by the NAFLD Activity Score (NAS).&#xD;
      According to this scoring system, the degree of steatosis and inflammatory activity is&#xD;
      measured using a zero to eight scale (steatosis=0-3; lobular inflammation=0-3;&#xD;
      ballooning=0-2). The NAS is the unweighted sum of steatosis, lobular inflammation, and&#xD;
      hepatocellular ballooning scores. The stage of fibrosis will be assessed using a zero to four&#xD;
      scale (0=no fibrosis; 1=mild/moderate zone three perisinusoidal fibrosis, or&#xD;
      portal/periportal fibrosis only; 2= perisinusoidal and portal/periportal fibrosis; 3=&#xD;
      bridging fibrosis; 4= cirrhosis). Additionally, at the time of liver biopsy, 4 additional&#xD;
      unstained slides will be prepared for morphometry analysis by Echosens. The liver&#xD;
      histological diagnosis will be established by an experienced pathologist blinded to the&#xD;
      clinical characteristics of the subjects, radiographic studies and the serum biomarkers. The&#xD;
      outside expert pathologist will use the same scoring system as the local pathologist. If&#xD;
      there is a discrepancy between the two pathology results for a subject the final&#xD;
      determination will be made by the local BAMC pathologist. An addendum will be placed in the&#xD;
      electronic medical record by the BAMC pathologist. The subject will be informed of the change&#xD;
      and documentation of the new diagnosis and any further treatments will be made in AHLTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echosens will use the liver biopsy slides to correlate the FibroMeter™ NAFLD/VCTE test with&#xD;
      liver fibrosis and the presence of NAFLD and NASH. FibroMeter™ is a non-invasive diagnostic&#xD;
      test that evaluates the level of fibrosis in the liver using patient clinical data (age and&#xD;
      weight) and a proprietary selection of standard clinical lab results including platelets,&#xD;
      AST, ALT, ferritin, glucose and Alpha-2-macroglobulin levels. The results of these locally&#xD;
      run tests will be entered into the Echosens FibroMeter website for FibroMeter NAFLD/VCTE&#xD;
      calculation. This test is approved in Europe and provides means for detection of significant&#xD;
      fibrosis, detection of cirrhosis (screening for esophageal varices and hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma) and a quantitative estimate of fibrosis staging, thereby providing opportunity for&#xD;
      serial monitoring of fibrosis in suspected cases. The FibroMeter test result will then be&#xD;
      used by Echosens to correlate with the morphometry analysis. All results are identified with&#xD;
      only the subject study number. Results from the FibroMeter test will not be used to support a&#xD;
      FDA marketing application. Additionally, the results of the FibroMeter will not be used&#xD;
      clinically nor to determine the performance of any subsequent research procedure. The results&#xD;
      will not be placed in the subject's medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional 5 ml of whole blood and 5 ml of serum will be collected and stored by a&#xD;
      research coordinator, nurse, research assistant, or investigator for analysis of specific&#xD;
      biomarkers to include Hyaluronic acid, CK-18 (M30), FGF-21, Mac-2BP, FAS, AFP, YKL-40,&#xD;
      Alpha-2-macroglobulin and a panel of 46 fatty acids during the liver biopsy appointment.&#xD;
      Phlebotomies will be performed in Hepatology Research. The stored serum will be kept in the&#xD;
      BAMC Gastroenterology Clinic in a -80 degree freezer and batch shipped to an outside lab&#xD;
      periodically for analysis. Specimens will be identified by a designated research code only&#xD;
      available to the local study team, thereby removing any personal identifiers on specimens&#xD;
      prior to shipment to an outside lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to address aim 3, subjects enrolled in the study who have undergone or will undergo&#xD;
      colonoscopy during study participation as part of their routine clinical care will have their&#xD;
      AHLTA/CHCS records reviewed and those with colon polyps or colon masses will be evaluated&#xD;
      against their imaging study findings. The correlation between colon polyp number/severity and&#xD;
      the presence of NAFLD will be ascertained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects qualifying for a liver biopsy will be referred to the study team members in the&#xD;
      Cardiology clinic with the option to enroll in Phase II of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II will consist of three cardiology procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Coronary CT angiography: All subjects who meet inclusion criteria for a percutaneous&#xD;
           liver biopsy, are consented to phase II, and do not have known CAD defined as prior&#xD;
           percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or have&#xD;
           not undergone CCTA within the previous 12 months, will undergo a CCTA with CAC score.&#xD;
           Subjects undergoing this portion of the analysis will need a renal function panel within&#xD;
           30 days of the scan date with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of ≥ 60 mls/min/1.73m2&#xD;
           by the Cockcroft-Gault equation, no prior history of an allergic reaction to intravenous&#xD;
           CT contrast, and no contraindications to administration of sublingual nitroglycerin and&#xD;
           nodal blocking agents. All CCTA scans will be analyzed by a cardiologist with level III&#xD;
           ACC/ACR certified imaging expertise in accordance with the Society of Cardiovascular&#xD;
           Computed Tomography (SCCT) guidelines. Scans will be performed in accordance with SCCT&#xD;
           guidelines. Studies will be obtained utilizing a 128-slice dual source scanner with a&#xD;
           high pitch, single heart beat image acquisition capabilities (Somatom Definition Flash&#xD;
           CT®, Siemens, Erlagen, Germany). CAC scanning will occur first at a standard tube&#xD;
           voltage of 120 keV and 3 mm slice acquisition and CareDose® modulation of tube current&#xD;
           enabled for all scans. CT technologist will be responsible for contacting the on-call CT&#xD;
           imaging specialist for CAC score ≥400 prior to proceeding to CCTA acquisition.&#xD;
           Continuation to CCTA will be at the discretion of the CT imaging specialist. Tube&#xD;
           voltage and image acquisition protocoling will be selected by the CT technologist in&#xD;
           consultation with the on-call cardiac CT imaging specialist in accordance with the&#xD;
           flowsheet depicted in Appendix 3. Tube voltage of 120keV will be used for BMI &gt; 30 and&#xD;
           lowered to 100keV for BMI ≤ 30. CareDose® modulation of tube current will be enabled for&#xD;
           all scans. Pretreatment with nodal blocking agents will be as follows: for HR &lt; 70 bpm&#xD;
           and systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt; 100 mm Hg will be given 50mg orally, for HR &gt; 70 bpm&#xD;
           and SBP &gt; 100 mm Hg will be given 100mg orally, and nodal blocker will be held for&#xD;
           patients with HR &lt; 50 bpm or SBP &lt; 100 mm Hg at the time of evaluation. Additional nodal&#xD;
           blocker will be administered following initial dosing at the discretion of the cardiac&#xD;
           imaging specialist. All subjects with SBP &gt; 90 mm Hg and without a history of&#xD;
           phosphodiesterase inhibitor usage in the preceding 72 hours received nitroglycerin spray&#xD;
           0.4-0.8 mg within 2 minutes of scan acquisition. High-pitched, prospective,&#xD;
           ECG-triggered helical scanning will be performed with heart rate (HR) &lt; 60 bpm and HR&#xD;
           variability &lt; 5 beats or with HR &lt; 60 bpm at the discretion of the imaging specialist.&#xD;
           The remaining scans will be performed using prospective, ECG triggering acquisition&#xD;
           centered at 70%-phase with between 10-20% padding (40-80% of the R-R interval).&#xD;
           Visapaque® intravenous (IV) contrast will be used for all scans. A triphasic injection&#xD;
           protocol consisting of 75mL of IV contrast followed by 40 mL of 50% contrast mixed with&#xD;
           normal saline chased with normal saline at a flow rate of 5 mL/second will be used for&#xD;
           all scans with total IV contrast volume of 105-125 mL. Contrast flow rates will be&#xD;
           increased to 6 ml/second for patients with BMI &gt; 30. Coronary artery stenosis by CCTA&#xD;
           will be determined on a per-patient and per-vessel basis using an 18 segment model in&#xD;
           accordance with SCCT guidelines for interpretation. The major epicardial coronary&#xD;
           arteries (left main, left anterior descending, left circumflex, and right coronary&#xD;
           arteries) will be graded for severity of CAD, defined as obstructive CAD (&gt;50%&#xD;
           stenosis), non-obstructive CAD (≤50% stenosis), or no CAD (vessels free of angiographic&#xD;
           evidence of disease), respectively. The posterior descending artery will be included in&#xD;
           the left circumflex or right coronary artery groups depending on its origin. The subject&#xD;
           will have the option of declining the CCTA and CAC scan. Subjects with known CAD as&#xD;
           defined on recent prior CCTA (within last 12 months) will not undergo CCTA, but their&#xD;
           CAD history and/or prior CCTA results will be included in the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE): All subjects who meet inclusion criteria for a&#xD;
           percutaneous liver biopsy and consented to phase II will undergo an assessment of&#xD;
           cardiovascular diastolic performance measured using 2D and 3D transthoracic&#xD;
           echocardiography (TTE) with Doppler technology. The TTE will be performed during a&#xD;
           scheduled outpatient time slot at the convenience of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. EndoPAT: Endothelial function will be measured in subjects who qualify for liver biopsy&#xD;
           and consent to phase II using the EndoPAT 2000®.. Every effort will be made to conduct&#xD;
           the EndoPat test on the same day as the CCTA for subject convenience. The EndoPAT 2000®&#xD;
           uses digital pulse amplitude tonometry. The EndoPAT device comprises a pneumatic&#xD;
           plethysmograph that applies uniform pressure the surface of the distal finger.&#xD;
           Throughout the test, the inflation pressure of the device will be set at 10 mmHg below&#xD;
           the diastolic blood pressure or 70 mmHg, whichever is lower. Baseline pulse amplitude&#xD;
           measurements will be taken for 5 minutes. Arterial flow will then be transiently&#xD;
           interrupted by inflating a pneumatic cuff placed on the patient's forearm. The cuff will&#xD;
           be inflated to 200 mmHg or 60 mmHg plus the systolic blood pressure, whichever is&#xD;
           higher. The pulse amplitude will be recorded for 5 minutes during the occlusion phase.&#xD;
           The blood pressure cuff is then deflated and post test measurements are recorded for 5&#xD;
           additional minutes. Pre and post test pulse amplitudes are compared to assess the degree&#xD;
           of reactive hyperemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects found to have evidence of coronary artery calcium, endothelial dysfunction,&#xD;
      diastolic dysfunction and/or presence of non-calcific atherosclerosis on CCTA with maximal&#xD;
      stenosis &lt; 50% will be referred to the cardiology clinic for assessment of cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk and aggressive medical and lifestyle risk factor modification. Patients with stenosis ≥&#xD;
      50% will also be referred to the cardiology clinic to be evaluated further for the need for&#xD;
      additional ischemic testing at the discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
