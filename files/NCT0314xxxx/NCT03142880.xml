      BACKGROUND: One previous study has confirmed that the marginally hyperbaric solutions of&#xD;
      bupivacaine can maintain good quality of anesthesia and get a more steadily hemodynamic&#xD;
      status than commonly hyperbaric solutions, some authors confirmed the plain ropivacaine for&#xD;
      cesarean section have a higher failure rate and commonly hyperbaric solutions of ropivacaine&#xD;
      have a higher incidence of side reaction. It is unclear what the efficacy of spinal&#xD;
      marginally hyperbaric ropivacaine for elective cesarean delivery.We hypothesized that the&#xD;
      marginally hyperbaric ropivacaine will get a similar efficacy to commonly hyperbaric&#xD;
      solutions but a more steadily hemodynamic status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE In this prospective, randomized, double-blinded study, Investigator will compare&#xD;
      the clinical efficacy and adverse effect of spinal anesthesia with commonly hyperbaric and&#xD;
      marginally hyperbaric ropivacaine for elective cesarean delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measures: The maximum cephalad sensory block level; the change of continuous&#xD;
      cerebral oxygen desaturation (ScO2) over time; the incidence of hypotension and nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting; the change of invasive arterial pressure; the consumption of ephedrine; the&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One previous study has confirmed that the marginally hyperbaric solutions of bupivacaine can&#xD;
      maintain good quality of anesthesia and get a more steadily hemodynamic status than commonly&#xD;
      hyperbaric solutions, some authors confirmed the plain ropivacaine for cesarean section have&#xD;
      a higher failure rate and commonly hyperbaric solutions of ropivacaine have a higher&#xD;
      incidence of side reaction such as hypotension. It is unclear what the efficacy of spinal&#xD;
      marginally hyperbaric ropivacaine for elective cesarean delivery.The investigator of this&#xD;
      study hypothesized that the marginally hyperbaric ropivacaine would get a similar efficacy to&#xD;
      commonly hyperbaric solutions but a more steadily hemodynamic status.In this prospective,&#xD;
      randomized, double-blinded study, Investigator will compare the clinical efficacy and adverse&#xD;
      effect of spinal anesthesia with commonly hyperbaric and marginally hyperbaric ropivacaine&#xD;
      for elective cesarean delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval for this clinical trial (Ethical Committee No.) was provided by the Ethics&#xD;
      Committee of Qilu Hospital of Shandong University (Qingdao), Qingdao, China on 1 February&#xD;
      2016. Informed written consent will be obtained from all patients. Investigator expected to&#xD;
      recruit 120 Pregnant women who will scheduled for elective cesarean section and meet the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A computer-generated random number sequence will be used for group allocation. To ensure the&#xD;
      study will be double blinded, the anesthesiologist who will administer the anesthesia will&#xD;
      take no other part in the study, whilst another anesthesiologist blind to the allocation will&#xD;
      collected intraoperative and postoperative data. The patients would be unaware of the&#xD;
      treatment allocation. Women will be randomised into two groups: the commonly hyperbaric group&#xD;
      (CH) will receive ropivacaine solution with 8.3% glucose; group marginally hyperbaric group&#xD;
      (MH) will receive ropivacaine solution with 0.83% glucose; Density will be determined by&#xD;
      using a digital density meter (DMA4500M; Anton Paar GmbH, Graz, Austria) at 37°C.Fifteen&#xD;
      minutes prior to administration of anesthesia, the ropivacaine solution will be prepared by&#xD;
      one nurse who is blind to the patient allocation.Commomly hyperbaric ropivacaine solutions&#xD;
      will be made of 0.75% ropivacaine + 50% glucose + isotonic saline and Marginally hyperbaric&#xD;
      solutions will be made of 0.75% ropivacaine +5% glucose + isotonic saline. The doses of&#xD;
      ropivacaine and the volume of spinal solution will be same and only the density of the&#xD;
      solution will be different.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the patient arrived at the operating room, an IV cannula will be inserted in one&#xD;
      forearm. Standard monitoring with electrocardiography and pulse oximetry and cerebral oxygen&#xD;
      saturation(ScO2) and invasive blood pressure (IBP) will be attached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the operation, the room temperature will be kept at 24°C. The body temperature of each&#xD;
      patient will be maintained by an electric warming blanket and infusion heating device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data of systolic pressure and ScO2 wil be recorded at 5-6 second intervals on the&#xD;
      device's accessory disk drive for later analysis. To establish a baseline for blood pressure&#xD;
      and ScO2. No prehydration will be given. Lactated Ringers' solution at 0.4 ml kg-1 min-1 will&#xD;
      be infused after anesthesia. Supplemental oxygen is planned to be administered in case SpO2&#xD;
      values would be below 91%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSEA) would be performed in the lateral position at&#xD;
      the intervertebral space between L3 and L4. Then, spinal solution will be injected&#xD;
      intrathecalley after CSF releas. The epidural catheter will be inserted. The patient will be&#xD;
      immediately placed in a supine position with 15° left tilt. Completion of the spinal&#xD;
      injection would be considered as time zero. The sensory block will be determined by pinprick&#xD;
      along both sides of the midclavicular line at 2 min intervals post injection. The sensory&#xD;
      block had not reached T8 before surgery, or there was moderate pain during the skin incision,&#xD;
      spinal anesthesia would be considered to have failed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of anesthesia would be evaluated using three criteria: lower limb motor block,&#xD;
      muscle relaxation and pain during skin incision and abdominal exploration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To treat intraoperative hypotension, 6mg ephedrine will be injected followed by 3 mg every 2&#xD;
      min until the blood pressure was restored to normal. Instances of nausea, vomiting, shivering&#xD;
      and pruritus will be also recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After delivery, Apgar scores will be assessed at 1 and 5 min by the attending pediatrician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of the results of a pilot study, 40 patients in each group were needed to&#xD;
      compare a two-segment difference in the upper sensory level and 30 % difference in the&#xD;
      incidence of hypotension at a significance level of P less than 0.05 with 80% power. However,&#xD;
      We expect to enroll 120 patients to get a more precise result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For IBP and ScO2 the median value of the sliding averages of the 30-second period before&#xD;
      spinal induction will be used as the baseline value for the figures and statistical analyses.&#xD;
      Time 0 for hemodynamic analyses will be defined as the end of spinal injection. This two&#xD;
      variables analyses will be run for the first 15 minutes, which almost equaled to the interval&#xD;
      from induction of spinal anesthesia to delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPSS 16.0 will be used for data analysis. T-test would be used to assess the difference in&#xD;
      sensory block level amongst the groups, The linear mixed model to analyze the continuous&#xD;
      changes in systolic pressure and ScO2 over time. X2 test for trends would be used to test the&#xD;
      association between adverse effects of anesthesia and the groups. In all cases, a P value&#xD;
      less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
