      This Cross-sectional Study Included Patients that diagnosed with schizophrenia, aged 18-55,&#xD;
      20 of which hospitalized in mental health department and 20 in medical follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different test will be administered, in two or three sessions, to evaluate cognitive ability,&#xD;
      function ability and participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the VIS shopping task performance (statically &amp; dynamically) and its&#xD;
      correlation with the cognitive and function tests as well as the participation questionnaire&#xD;
      will be examined. These findings will indicate whether the shopping task is valid to assess&#xD;
      executive functions for people with schizophrenia and whether it is ecologically valid.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schizophrenia often reflect by decrease in executive functions that may cause difficulty in&#xD;
      Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL). We've found it very difficult to simulate&#xD;
      these functions with the existing tools in the clinic and to assess IADL accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of Virtual Reality (VR) became popular in the last decade to overcome these&#xD;
      limitations in clinical practice and assessment of functioning in IADL. VR is a computer&#xD;
      program that simulates a functional environment in which the subject impacts on events&#xD;
      through various actions. Recent studies indicated that VR can be used to assess cognitive&#xD;
      abilities and functioning of population with schizophrenia. As far as we know, no researches&#xD;
      were performed using Virtual Interactive Shopping (VIS) in this population, nor did dynamic&#xD;
      evaluation was used to identify potential learning abilities. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      examine the validity of the shopping task in the VIS, performed statically and dynamically,&#xD;
      in order to assess executive function, and the ability to reflect cognitive, functional and&#xD;
      participation ability among people that diagnosed with schizophrenia.&#xD;
