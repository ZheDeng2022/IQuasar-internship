  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In very preterm infants with severe respiratory distress syndrome(RDS), invasive&#xD;
      ventilation(IV) , besides nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) and&#xD;
      early/selective pulmonary surfactant administration, is one key cornerstone to reduce&#xD;
      neonatal mortality. However, IV is related to increased risks of bronchopulmonary dysplasia&#xD;
      (BPD) and abnormal developmental outcomes in the survival.Weaning from IV is therefore a key&#xD;
      procedure to reducing these risks above, and if extubation does not success, repeated&#xD;
      intubation and/or prolonged duration of IV will result in increased medical burden and&#xD;
      intubation-associated complications and death. How to minimize the need for endotracheal&#xD;
      ventilation and subsequent complications constitutes a challenge for neonatologists.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early weaning from invasive ventilation and avoiding re-intubation remains a focus. Nowadays,&#xD;
      early use of noninvasive respiratory support strategies has been suggested to be the most&#xD;
      effective pathway to reduce those risks. NCPAP is a widely used way of noninvasive&#xD;
      ventilation strategies in preterm infants. However, there is only 60% success rate in&#xD;
      avoiding intubation. Supplying with the combined advantages of HFOV and NCPAP with high CO2&#xD;
      removal, no need for synchronisation, less volume/barotraumas, non-invasion and increased&#xD;
      functional residual capacity, nasal high frequency oscillation ventilation (NHFOV) is&#xD;
      considered as a strengthened version of NCPAP. Thus, NHFOV may be more effective as&#xD;
      post-extubation respiratory support to avoid re-intubation and subsequent&#xD;
      complications/sequelae comparing with NCPAP in preterm infants. To date, NHFOV was used&#xD;
      increasingly in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) around the world due to its convenient&#xD;
      operation and no consideration of synchronisation, and several small studies have reported&#xD;
      the beneficial effects of NHFOV in preterm infants. However, there were rare randomized&#xD;
      controlled studies compared NHFOV with NCPAP as post-extubation respiratory support&#xD;
      strategies in preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study was to compare NHFOV with NCPAP as post-extubation&#xD;
      respiratory support on the need for endotracheal ventilation and subsequent complications in&#xD;
      preterm infants.&#xD;
