      The research seeks to determine the relative effectiveness and cost effectiveness of&#xD;
      alternative supplementary foods in the treatment of moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) in&#xD;
      normal program settings. The results of this study will guide decisions about what&#xD;
      commodities to use in supplementary feeding programs in particular contexts and populations,&#xD;
      and what factors need to be addressed to ensure maximum effectiveness in the treatment of&#xD;
      moderate malnutrition.&#xD;

      The proposed research seeks to determine the relative effectiveness and cost effectiveness of&#xD;
      alternative supplementary foods in the treatment of moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) in&#xD;

      Tufts University, Washington University in St. Louis, School of Medicine, Sierra Leone&#xD;
      Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MoHS), Project Peanut Butter, Caritas Bo, World Food&#xD;
      Programme (WFP), and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) are&#xD;
      collaborating to conduct an assessment of the effectiveness, cost, and cost-effectiveness of&#xD;

&#xD;
        4. Ready-to-use Supplementary Food (RUSF, lipid-based)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of study: This will be a prospective, cluster-randomized, controlled clinical&#xD;
      effectiveness trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral Health Units (PHU) will be selected within the Pujehun District in Sierra Leone.&#xD;
      These 29 PHUs and the villages they serve will be used as the study sites to test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of four supplementary foods in the treatment of MAM. The PHUs will be grouped&#xD;
      into 4 to represent each food or arm of the study. The study is targeting 6000 children in&#xD;
      total: 1500 children per arm. Children will be enrolled and graduated based on mid-upper arm&#xD;
      circumference (MUAC); weight and height will be recorded as well and also used in final&#xD;
      analysis. Locations (communities, clinics) will be assigned to one of the four arms (that is,&#xD;
      foods to be tested). The foods distributed as part of the study will require a safe storage&#xD;
      location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplementary food rations will be delivered for up to 12 weeks from enrollment (enrollment&#xD;
      takes place when a child is diagnosed with MAM in accordance with a&#xD;
      mid-upper-arm-circumference [MUAC] &gt;11.5 cm and ≤12.5 cm). Children will be asked to return&#xD;
      to the PHU every two weeks for follow-up, where caretakers report on the child's clinical&#xD;
      symptoms and use of the food at home, growth measurements are re-assessed, until they reach&#xD;
      one of the primary outcomes listed below. A ration of supplementary food sufficient for two&#xD;
      weeks (14 days) will be distributed at each visit. Children will be monitored for relapse&#xD;
      after discharge and be interviewed for basic IYCF information at graduation, 1-month and&#xD;
      3-month follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures are graduation from MAM (achieving MUAC ≥ 12.5 cm by 12 weeks)&#xD;
      once or failure (death, development of severe acute malnutrition, transfer to hospital for&#xD;
      inpatient care, failure to graduate from MAM by 12 weeks, default).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional analysis will consider achievement of WHZ =&gt; -2 among children treated for either&#xD;
      up to 12 weeks or until reaching graduation based on MUAC. Secondary outcome measures include&#xD;
      rates of weight, height, and MUAC gain, change in WHZ, LAZ, and HAZ , WHZ ≥ -2, time to&#xD;
      graduation, and any possible adverse effects from the supplementary foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost effectiveness will assess differences among the four study arms in cost per case of MAM&#xD;
      graduated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The field research team will randomly select a subsample of caregivers of enrolled children&#xD;
      for in-depth interviews and in-home observations, which will take place in the participants'&#xD;
      home. In addition, the field research team will conduct focus group discussions with a&#xD;
      smaller subsample of caregivers, to take place in a central and convenient location. The&#xD;
      purpose of the in-home observations is to observe aspects of the family's preparation and&#xD;
      consumption of the ration that they would be unlikely to be able to report during focus&#xD;
      groups or individual interviews, because respondents may not be conscious of their actions.&#xD;
      We will also collect data on behaviors, demographics and other factors contributing to&#xD;
      effectiveness, including: ration collection, preparation, consumption, sharing, and selling&#xD;
      behaviors, knowledge and communication of social and behavior change communication (SBCC)&#xD;
      messages regarding ration use among health workers and beneficiary mothers, other health&#xD;
      behaviors such as breastfeeding, dietary diversity and hygiene practices, and demographics&#xD;
      such as household food insecurity and number of young children. All interviews, observations,&#xD;
      and focus group discussions will be administered by trained research assistants. The team&#xD;
      will also conduct interviews with community health volunteers working in the PHUs and the&#xD;
      catchment villages they serve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will implement three sub-studies that aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare the effect of four supplementary foods on changes in body composition of 6-59&#xD;
           month-old children with MAM after four weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine whether EED modifies the effect of four supplementary foods on 6-59 month-old&#xD;
           children with MAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine the effects of MAM and 4 supplementary foods on neurocognitive function in 6-24&#xD;
           month-old children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will benefit the food assistance community by providing new research on the cost&#xD;
      and cost-effectiveness of supplements to treat MAM, where effectiveness is measured in terms&#xD;
      of growth outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides the long term and broader benefits, this work will benefit a large number of young&#xD;
      children in the Sierra Leone population. This study will directly benefit Sierra Leone by&#xD;
      improving the nutrition of its children and providing education on children's nutrition. The&#xD;
      enrolled child will have enough study food provided at home for the recovery from moderate&#xD;
      acute malnutrition when consumed along with the regular diet and will be monitored regularly&#xD;
      during treatment. This may result in fewer complications (diarrhea, respiratory illnesses) as&#xD;
      the child recovers.&#xD;
