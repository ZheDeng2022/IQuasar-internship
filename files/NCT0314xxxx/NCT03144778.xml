  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies how well durvalumab with or without tremelimumab works in treating&#xD;
      participants with stage II-IVA oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer. Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab and tremelimumab, may help the body's immune system&#xD;
      attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the differences between CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes evaluated by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry staining in the post-treatment surgical specimens as compared to&#xD;
      baseline in patients treated with durvalumab single agent compared with patients receiving&#xD;
      durvalumab plus tremelimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Safety and toxicity of durvalumab single agent or combined with tremelimumab administered&#xD;
      every 4 weeks for 2 doses in the preoperative setting according to the National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Objective Response rate at 8 weeks, as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in&#xD;
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Percentage of patients undergoing the initially proposed surgery at 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Percentage of patients undergoing the initially proposed surgery at 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Percentage of viable tumor cells in the surgical specimen. VI. Patient-reported outcomes&#xD;
      (PRO) during treatment with checkpoint inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess pre- and post- treatment tumor, blood and oral rinse based immune biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Correlate tissue and blood-based biomarkers with human papillomavirus (HPV) status,&#xD;
      outcomes and toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized into 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT I: Participants receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1 and 29 in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity. Between days 52 and 72,&#xD;
      participants undergo standard of care surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT II: Participants receive durvalumab IV over 1 hour and tremelimumab IV over 1 hour on&#xD;
      days 1 and 29 in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity. Between days 52&#xD;
      and 72, participants undergo standard of care surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 28 and 42 days, 4 and 6&#xD;
      months, and then periodically for up to 5 years.&#xD;
