  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about how type of exercise influences measures of appetite&#xD;
      regulation. In this study, investigators will be evaluating a resistance exercise session&#xD;
      (using weight machines and free weights) and an aerobic exercise session (using a treadmill).&#xD;
      Participants will also complete a sedentary control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary purpose is to compare sex-based differences in appetite-indices in response to&#xD;
      exercise. Therefore, the responses to aerobic and resistance exercise will also be compared&#xD;
      between men and women.&#xD;

    <description>The overall aim of this study is to compare how acute exercise modality (e.g. resistance exercise vs. aerobic exercise) differentially influence hormonal and behavioral indices of appetite regulation and ad libitum energy intake. Both conditions will also be compared to a non-exercise control condition.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All ethnic groups and both genders&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age: 18-55 yrs (changed in September 2018 because trial we are modeling enrollment&#xD;
             criteria on [NCT02047721] changed age range, so we adjusted for this trial as well)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI: 18.5-40 kg/m2 (changed in June 2018 from original range of 27-35 kg/m2 in order&#xD;
             to improve recruitment. This is because recruitment within our prior BMI range had&#xD;
             been slower than anticipated and potential participants that have expressed interest&#xD;
             have screened out because of this. Given that we are still limiting enrollment&#xD;
             criteria to adults who are inactive, it is likely that most will have body fat levels&#xD;
             above normative standards, and therefore still be classified as having excess&#xD;
             adiposity, even if their BMI is below 25 kg/m2. Furthermore, given the pilot nature of&#xD;
             this work we believe it is important to complete the trial in a timely manner. We&#xD;
             anticipate alterations to the enrollment criteria helping with this effort.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Weight stable within Â±5% in the last 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Physically inactive (not meeting current physical activity guidelines, by self-report,&#xD;
             no resistance training in previous 12-months)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled hypertension&#xD;
             (defined as: systolic blood pressure &gt;160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;100mmHg,&#xD;
             as measured during the screening visit with participants seated quietly, following&#xD;
             established guidelines39), renal disease (e.g. chronic kidney disease, polycystic&#xD;
             kidney disease, nephritis, etc.), hepatic disease (e.g. cirrhosis, liver failure,&#xD;
             fatty liver, jaundice, etc.), untreated thyroid disease (e.g. Grave's disease,&#xD;
             Hashimoto's disorder, goiters, thyroid cancers, etc.), or any other medical condition&#xD;
             affecting weight or energy metabolism. Participants who are deemed ineligible based&#xD;
             upon uncontrolled hypertension criteria will be referred to their primary care&#xD;
             physicians for treatment. If this conditions become controlled they will be allowed to&#xD;
             be re-evaluated for inclusion in the current trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptoms suggestive of CVD: chest pain, shortness of breath at rest or with mild&#xD;
             exertion, syncope.&#xD;

          -  Treatment with medications known to significantly affecting appetite, weight, energy&#xD;
             metabolism, energy intake or energy expenditure in the last 6 months (e.g. systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroids, appetite suppressants, lithium, stimulants, anti-psychotics,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Major psychiatric disorder (e.g. diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or&#xD;
             other psychotic disorders).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current severe depression or history of severe depression within the previous year&#xD;
             (based on reported history, study physician examination findings, and/or a score &gt;21&#xD;
             on the CES-D). Participants meeting any of these criteria will be referred to their&#xD;
             primary care physician and/or the emergency department (based upon study physician&#xD;
             determined level of severity).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant food intolerances/allergies that cannot be accommodated by the CTRC&#xD;
             Metabolic Kitchen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently participating in or planning to participate in any formal weight loss or&#xD;
             physical activity programs or clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other medical, psychiatric, or behavioral limitations that may interfere with&#xD;
             participation (as determined by study physician).&#xD;
