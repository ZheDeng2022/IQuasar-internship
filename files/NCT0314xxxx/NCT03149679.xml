      Single center, open labeled, phase 2 clinical trial, where patients with metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer are selected for treatment with dose dense Cyclophosphamide every second&#xD;
      week based on TP53 mutation status; i.e. only patients with TP53 mutated tumors may be&#xD;
      included in the treatment arm.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Single center, open labeled, phase 2 clinical trial, where patients are selected for treatment based on upfront TP53 mutation status; i.e. only patients with TP53 mutated tumors may be included in the single treatment arm. The informed consent, however needs to be signed prior to a biopsy for TP53 mutation analyses; thus, all patients are formally enrolled in the study prior to tissue collection, and the full population tested will be accounted for despite the fact that only patients with TP53 mutated tumors may enter the single treatment arm.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metastatic colorectal cancer patients for whom conventional therapy has failed;&#xD;
             defined as 2 lines of chemotherapy including oxaliplatin or irinotecan- containing&#xD;
             regimens as well as an EGFR inhibitor if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumor lesion suitable for biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically or radiologically measurable tumor deposits according to the RECIST&#xD;
             criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  WHO performance status 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiology studies (CT thorax/abdomen/pelvis) and echo cor and ECG must be performed&#xD;
             within 28 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Before patient registration in the trial, written informed consent must be given&#xD;
             according to national and local regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood test requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Neutrophils &gt; 1.0 e9/L Platelets &gt; 75 e9/L Bilirubin &lt; 20 µmol / L. Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5&#xD;
        x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Co-morbidity including, but not limited to, impaired renal-, liver or bone marrow&#xD;
             function, that based on the assessment of the treating physician, may preclude the use&#xD;
             of cyclophosphamide at actual doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to the study drug, its metabolites or any excipients in the&#xD;
             infusion solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition(s) potentially&#xD;
             hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those conditions&#xD;
             should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating patients cannot be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical evidence of serious coagulopathy. Prior arterial/venous thrombosis or&#xD;
             embolism does not exclude patients from inclusion, unless patient is considered unfit&#xD;
             by study oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient not able to give an informed consent or comply with study regulations as&#xD;
             deemed by study investigator.&#xD;
