      This is a pilot study to test a hypothesis that a greater increase in serum chromogranin A&#xD;
      (CgA) after a definitive radiotherapy (RT) with or without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)&#xD;
      is associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer recurrence after RT. Serum CgA level is&#xD;
      measured before the start of RT and/or the start of neoadjuvant ADT for patients undergoing a&#xD;
      definitive RT with or without ADT. CgA is also measured at various pre-defined post-RT time&#xD;
      points. The study will analyze the followings: 1. Change in CgA level at various pre-defined&#xD;
      post-RT time points from the baseline, 2. Correlation between the extent of post-therapy CgA&#xD;
      change and Gleason score of malignancy, 3. Correlation between the extent of post-therapy CgA&#xD;
      change and treatment outcome.&#xD;

      Neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) in prostate cancer is a well-recognized phenotypic&#xD;
      change by which prostate cancer cells transdifferentiate into neuroendocrine-like (NE-like)&#xD;
      cells. Accumulated evidences have suggested that the prevalence of NE-like cells is&#xD;
      associated with disease progression and poor prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NED can be induced by a therapeutic agent. Such therapeutic agents include RT and ADT.&#xD;
      RT-induced NED represents a novel pathway by which prostate cancer cells survive radiotherapy&#xD;
      and contribute to treatment failure and tumor recurrence. Chromogranin A is the serum&#xD;
      biomarker for NED and correlates well with CgA-positive staining in biopsy specimens. It has&#xD;
      been reported that elevated serum CgA is associated with poor therapeutic response,&#xD;
      androgen-independent growth, and biochemical recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study tests whether the extent of serum CgA increase by RT +/- ADT, which reflects&#xD;
      radiation-induced NED, is correlated with the risk of prostate cancer recurrence following RT&#xD;
      and a Gleason score of prostate carcinoma.&#xD;
