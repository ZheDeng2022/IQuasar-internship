  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study of investigational drug niraparib and TSR-042 in patients with&#xD;
      advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer. The purpose of this study is to determine whether&#xD;
      blocking a protein called poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) with niraparib provides&#xD;
      clinical benefit in patients with recurrent endometrial cancer, as well as to explore the&#xD;
      possible impact of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss (loss of function of the PTEN&#xD;
      gene) on blocking PARP with niraparib.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to elucidate whether the PARP inhibition approach with&#xD;
      niraparib, or the combination of niraparib and TSR-042, provides clinical benefit in patients&#xD;
      with recurrent endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is designed as a multicenter, open-label, phase II study of niraparib in&#xD;
      monotherapy or in combination with anti-PD1 inhibitor TSR-042 in recurrent endometrial&#xD;
      cancer. Patients must have received prior platinum based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will initially enroll patients with recurrent endometrial cancer to the niraparib&#xD;
      monotherapy cohort not selected according to the PTEN status (cohort I).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the initial assessment with niraparib monotherapy is completed (inclusion of 22&#xD;
      evaluable patients),Additional 22 patients will be enrolled in the combination arm with&#xD;
      niraparib and TSR-042 (cohort II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will take niraparib capsules or tablets by mouth 300/200 mg, once a&#xD;
      day, every day of every 21 day cycle.Participant will receive TSR-042 500 mg( intravenously)&#xD;
      on the first day of each cycle for cycle 1 to 4. Followed by 1000 mg every 2 cycle for every&#xD;
      6 weeks for maximum of 2 yrs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While receiving the study treatment, participants will be asked to visit the study site on&#xD;
      Days 1, 8, 15 of Cycle 1.Cycle 2 onward Days 1 and 15 and future cycles for safety tests and&#xD;
      procedures. If, at any time, participants develop (or is suspected to have developed)&#xD;
      MDS/AML, a mandatory bone marrow aspirate/biopsy will be done for testing to confirm&#xD;
      diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When participants are taken off the study treatment permanently, they will be asked to return&#xD;
      to the study site for an End of Study Treatment visit to have tests and procedures done for&#xD;
      safety purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are taken off the study treatment for any reason other than disease&#xD;
      progression will continue to have radiological assessments every 8 weeks until disease&#xD;
      progression. Participants will continue to be followed up for side effects weekly in the&#xD;
      first 4 weeks, then monthly until resolution.&#xD;
