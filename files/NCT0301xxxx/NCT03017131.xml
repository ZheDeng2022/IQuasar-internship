      This phase I trial studies the side effects of genetically modified T cells and decitabine in&#xD;
      treating patients with recurrent or refractory epithelial or non-epithelial ovarian, primary&#xD;
      peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer that has come back or has not responded to previous&#xD;
      treatments. White blood cells called T cells are collected via a process called&#xD;
      leukapheresis, genetically modified to recognize and attack tumor cells, then given back to&#xD;
      the patient. Decitabine may induce and increase the amount of the target protein NY-ESO-1&#xD;
      available on the surface of tumor cells. Giving genetically modified T cells and decitabine&#xD;
      may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of the autologous NY-ESO-1 redirected T cell&#xD;
      therapy in combination with decitabine and low-dose IL-2 in patients with treatment&#xD;
      refractory or recurrent epithelial or non-epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian&#xD;
      tube carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the persistence of genetically modified cells in the peripheral blood, and at&#xD;
      tumor sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To examine the effect of the treatment on tumor as measured by objective tumor response&#xD;
      and progression free survival, both assessed by immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria&#xD;
      in Solid Tumors (irRECIST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the occurrence of target antigen and/or major histocompatibality complex (MHC)&#xD;
      loss variants upon disease recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the post treatment phenotype and functionality of genetically modified T cells&#xD;
      isolated from peripheral blood and from tumor sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess changes in immunoscore, Tregs, Myeloid cell subsets, and antigen spreading in&#xD;
      peripheral blood and tumor site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the influence of demographic and disease molecular characteristics on&#xD;
      treatment outcomes of complete response (CR) and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      COURSE 1: Patients receive decitabine IV daily over 1 hour on days -8 to Day -6,&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -4 and -3, and genetically engineered&#xD;
      NY-ESO-1-specific T lymphocytes IV and intraperitoneally (IP) on day 0. Followed by low-dose&#xD;
      IL-2 for 2 weeks from Day 1 to Day 14..&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly at 3-9 months, every 6&#xD;
      months for 4 years, and then annually for up to 15 years.&#xD;
