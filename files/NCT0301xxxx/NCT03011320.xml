    <textblock>
      This study looks to enroll subjects with ovarian cancer who will be having standard of care&#xD;
      surgery to remove ovarian cancer tumors. The main aim of this study is to be able to observe&#xD;
      how EC1456 has been taken in and broken down inside tumors. The effect of EC1456 on the tumor&#xD;
      will also be studied. This study will also help us compare the amount of EC1456 seen in&#xD;
      tumors and how the tumors are imaged by the 99mTc-etarfolatide single-photon emission&#xD;
      tomography (SPECT) or single-photon emission tomography with in-line x-ray computed&#xD;
      tomography (SPECT/CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo a 99mTc-etarfolatide SPECT or SPECT/CT scan within 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
      EC1456 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual subjects will then receive 1 of the following 2 doses of EC1456 pre-operatively:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4 mg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  8 mg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
      EC1456 will be administered at 1 of the following 2 time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &lt;8 hours before planned surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  48±4 hours before planned surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be collected for pharmacokinetic (PK) studies right after EC1456 dosing and again&#xD;
      right before surgery. At the time of surgery, tumor samples will be removed and sent to&#xD;
      Endocyte for analysis.&#xD;

      Study EC1456-02 is an exploratory, open-label study that seeks to enroll subjects with&#xD;
      ovarian cancer who will be undergoing therapeutic debulking surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo a 99mTc-etarfolatide scan within 2 weeks prior to EC1456&#xD;
      administration. Briefly, prior to the 99mTc-etarfolatide imaging procedure, all subjects will&#xD;
      receive one intravenous (IV) injection of folic acid or unlabeled etarfolatide, followed&#xD;
      within 1 to 3 minutes by an injection of 99m Tc-etarfolatide (i.e., etarfolatide labeled with&#xD;
      740 to 925 megabecquerels (MBq) [20 to 25 millicuries (mCi)] of sodium pertechnetate Tc-99m&#xD;
      injection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual subjects will receive 1 of the following 2 doses of EC1456 pre-operatively:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4 milligrams (mg)/meter (m)2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  8 milligrams (mg)/meter (m)2&#xD;
&#xD;
      EC1456 will be administered at 1 of the following 2 time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &lt;8 hours before planned surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  48±4 hours before planned surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 4 mg/m2 dose of EC1456 administered &lt;8 hours prior to surgery will be the first dose&#xD;
      cohort to enroll. Once enrollment to this cohort is complete, the remaining cohorts will be&#xD;
      open for enrollment. Assignment to specific cohorts will be determined by the Sponsor based&#xD;
      on data assessed from previously enrolled subjects. Two to six subjects will be enrolled per&#xD;
      cohort as shown below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: 4 mg/m2 EC1456 &lt;8 hours prior to surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: 4 mg/m2 EC1456 48±4 hours prior to surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: 8 mg/m2 EC1456 &lt;8 hours prior to surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 4: 8 mg/m2 EC1456 48±4 hours prior to surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of unexpected results, lower, intermediate or higher EC1456 levels up to 12.5&#xD;
      mg/m2, the highest determined safe dose of EC1456 as defined by the parallel phase I study&#xD;
      EC1456-01, may be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first on-study procedure will be SPECT or SPECT/CT with 99mTc-etarfolatide. SPECT or&#xD;
      SPECT/CT scans will be acquired within 2 weeks prior to EC1456 administration as specified in&#xD;
      the Imaging Operations Manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EC1456 will be administered pre-operatively as an intravenous (IV) bolus infusion at 1 of 2&#xD;
      time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. &lt; 8 hours preceding surgery or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 48±4 hours preceding surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 2 time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. within approximately 15 (±5) minutes post-EC1456 administration and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. at the start of surgery, approximately 5 mL of whole blood will be drawn for EC1456&#xD;
           analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissues to be collected at surgery, if present, include: sample of 1 or both ovaries,&#xD;
      endometrium, omentum, ascitic fluid and/or selected lesions as identified by the surgeon or&#xD;
      sponsor. The location of each sample will be annotated such that the ex vivo analysis may be&#xD;
      correlated with the SPECT/CT image post-surgery. Samples of tumor tissue will be collected at&#xD;
      the time of surgery, aliquoted into collection vials, and placed on dry ice or in buffered&#xD;
      formalin.&#xD;
