    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, non-randomised, open-label, multicentric study to investigate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of nivolumab monotherapy in 6 cohorts of patients with specific rare cancers who&#xD;
      have unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease, which is resistant or refractory to&#xD;
      standard therapy, or for which standard therapy does not exist, or is not considered&#xD;
      appropriate, and for which no other experimental treatment options are available.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study plans to enrol up to 300 patients in total. Eligible patients who have provided&#xD;
      their written informed consent for study participation will be assigned to one of 6 cohorts&#xD;
      determined by indication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: Non-clear cell RCC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: Rare head and neck cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: Rare skin cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 4: non-colorectal cancers with microsatellite instability (MSI-nonCRC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 5: Penile cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 6: POLE exonucleasic domain mutated cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 20 and 50 patients will be enrolled in each cohort, with the exception of the cohort&#xD;
      1 (Non-clear cell RCC) and cohort 3 (Rare skin cancer). Following the amendment 6, up to a&#xD;
      maximum of 20 additional patients may be included in the cohort 1 (Non-clear cell RCC) or&#xD;
      cohort 3 (Rare skin cancer), within the limit of 300 patients to be included in total, due to&#xD;
      potential signals observed in some subsets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use a two-stage Bayesian enrichment design. The first stage treats all&#xD;
      patients from the different cohorts with the investigational product and identifies possibly&#xD;
      sensitive indications. The second stage will compare outcomes among subsets of patients in&#xD;
      the identified cohorts to distinguish between subpopulations of patients who may benefit from&#xD;
      the treatment and patients for whom there is no evidence of efficacy.&#xD;

             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated vaccines and are&#xD;
             allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Active alcohol or drug abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Psychological, familial, sociological or geographical factors potentially hampering&#xD;
             compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Any condition which in the Investigator's opinion makes it undesirable for the subject&#xD;
             to participate in the trial or which would jeopardize compliance with the protocol.&#xD;
