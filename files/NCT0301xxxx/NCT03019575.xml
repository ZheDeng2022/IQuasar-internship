  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate whether corifollitropin alfa (MK-8962),&#xD;
      administered alone for 12 weeks and then in combination with human chorionic gonadotropin&#xD;
      (hCG) for 52 weeks, increases the testicular volume in adolescent males aged 14 to &lt;18. In&#xD;
      addition, the study will evaluate participants for safety, tolerability and for the&#xD;
      development of corifollitropin alfa antibodies. No formal hypothesis will be tested for this&#xD;
      estimation study&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Log-Transformed Testicular Volume (TV) to Week 64</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 64</time_frame>
    <description>Participants underwent testicular ultrasound of left and right testes at pre-specified time points to measure TV. TV was measured as the sum of volumes of left and right testes. The linear mixed model with a fixed effect for baseline and Week 64 and a random effect for participant was used to calculate the mean change in log-transformed TV and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from baseline to Week 64. The geometric mean ratio and its 95% CIs for TV were obtained by exponentiation. The ratio &gt; 1 indicated an increase in TV from baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Log-Transformed Testicular Volume (TV) to Week 64</title>
        <description>Participants underwent testicular ultrasound of left and right testes at pre-specified time points to measure TV. TV was measured as the sum of volumes of left and right testes. The linear mixed model with a fixed effect for baseline and Week 64 and a random effect for participant was used to calculate the mean change in log-transformed TV and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from baseline to Week 64. The geometric mean ratio and its 95% CIs for TV were obtained by exponentiation. The ratio &gt; 1 indicated an increase in TV from baseline.</description>

        <description>Male participants were assessed clinically for pubertal development using the TS for pubic hair (range: Tanner I-V). TS describes sexual maturity stages (no better or worse outcome) as: Tanner I: prepubertal state, Tanner II: small amount of long, downy hair with slight pigmentation at the base of the penis and scrotum, Tanner III: hair becomes more coarse and curly, and begins to extend laterally, Tanner IV: adult-like hair quality, extending across pubis but sparing medial thighs and Tanner V: hair extends to medial surface of the thigh. The number of participants in each Tanner stage at baseline and categorical change from baseline in Tanner stages to Weeks 12, 36 and 64 were reported.</description>

          <description>Male participants were assessed clinically for pubertal development using the TS for pubic hair (range: Tanner I-V). TS describes sexual maturity stages (no better or worse outcome) as: Tanner I: prepubertal state, Tanner II: small amount of long, downy hair with slight pigmentation at the base of the penis and scrotum, Tanner III: hair becomes more coarse and curly, and begins to extend laterally, Tanner IV: adult-like hair quality, extending across pubis but sparing medial thighs and Tanner V: hair extends to medial surface of the thigh. The number of participants in each Tanner stage at baseline and categorical change from baseline in Tanner stages to Weeks 12, 36 and 64 were reported.</description>
          <population>All participants who received at least 1 dose of study treatment who had a baseline and at least 1 post baseline TV value, had LH level ≤3 IU/L anytime in the study, had at least 12 weeks of CFA and 24 weeks of CFA plus hCG treatment, have last TV value within 4 weeks from last dose of CFA were analyzed.</population>

        <description>Testicular Echogenicity was determined by evaluating the sonographic patterns obtained on testicular ultrasound of right and left testes at baseline, Week 12, Week 36 and 64. The sonographic patterns were assessed by central imaging unit by an independent radiologist and categorized as Hypoechoic (decreased echogenicity as compared to echogenicity at baseline), Isoechoic (same echogenicity as compared to echogenicity at baseline) and Hyperechoic (increased echogenicity as compared to echogenicity at baseline). The number of participants with a sonographic pattern at Weeks 12, 36 and 64 were reported.</description>

        <description>SHBG is a blood protein that controls the amount of T body tissues in males. SHBG is regulated by the ratio of T and E2 levels in addition to other factors (thyroid hormone status, dietary factors, certain diseases and medications). Blood samples were collected at baseline, Week 12, Week 36 and Week 64 to report the mean change from baseline in SHBG level to Weeks 12, 36 and 64.

          <title>Change From Baseline in Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG) to Week 12, Week 36, and Week 64</title>
          <description>SHBG is a blood protein that controls the amount of T body tissues in males. SHBG is regulated by the ratio of T and E2 levels in addition to other factors (thyroid hormone status, dietary factors, certain diseases and medications). Blood samples were collected at baseline, Week 12, Week 36 and Week 64 to report the mean change from baseline in SHBG level to Weeks 12, 36 and 64. A negative value indicated a lower SHBG level.</description>
