  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, non-randomised, open-label, multicentric study to investigate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of pembrolizumab monotherapy in 7 cohorts of patients with specific rare cancers&#xD;
      who have unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease, which is resistant or&#xD;
      refractory to standard therapy, or for which standard therapy does not exist, or is not&#xD;
      considered appropriate, and for which no other experimental treatment options are available,&#xD;
      in order to identify subsets of patients that may benefit from treatment&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study plans to enrol up to 350 patients in total. Eligible patients who have provided&#xD;
      their written informed consent for study participation will be assigned to one of 7 cohorts&#xD;
      determined by indication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: Rare sarcoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: Rare ovarian cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: Primary central nervous system lymphomas&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 4: Rare thyroid cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 5: Rare malignant neuroendocrine cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 6: Germ-cell cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 7: NK/T-cell lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 20 and 50 patients will be enrolled in each cohort with the exception of the cohort 1&#xD;
      for which up to 80 patients may be enrolled (extension introduced under amendment 5 of this&#xD;
      protocol). Following the amendment 6, up to a maximum of 50 additional patients may be&#xD;
      included in the Sarcoma (cohort 1), Rare ovarian cancer (cohort 2) or Primary central nervous&#xD;
      system lymphoma (cohort 3) cohorts, within the limit of 350 patients to be included in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use a two-stage Bayesian enrichment design. The first stage treats all&#xD;
      patients from the different cohorts with the investigational product and identifies possibly&#xD;
      sensitive indications. The second stage will compare outcomes among subsets of patients in&#xD;
      the identified cohorts to distinguish between subpopulations of patients who may benefit from&#xD;
      the treatment and patients for whom there is no evidence of efficacy.&#xD;

             trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no&#xD;

&#xD;
         16. Active alcohol or drug abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Psychological, familial, sociological or geographical factors potentially hampering&#xD;
