      Sleep apnea is a condition in which the throat air passage closes during sleep and repeatedly&#xD;
      interrupts breathing. The standard treatment of sleep apnea is air pressure applied to the&#xD;
      nose, so-called nasal CPAP, but it is not suitable for all patients. Another treatment is to&#xD;
      use a dental appliance while asleep. In this treatment, an appliance covers the upper and&#xD;
      lower teeth and acts to pull the jaw forward, which opens the throat passage. This allows the&#xD;
      patient to breathe normally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental appliance treatment does not work effectively in all patients. In order to identify&#xD;
      those in whom dental appliance therapy will be effective, the study sponsor has invented the&#xD;
      remotely controlled mandibular positioner, MATRx. The MATRx is an FDA cleared motorized&#xD;
      dental appliance which is used overnight in hospital sleep studies and works by pulling the&#xD;
      jaw outward under the control of a technician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to eliminate the need for an overnight in hospital sleep study, the sponsor has&#xD;
      invented a new device that allows for the identification of individuals who are suitable&#xD;
      candidates for dental appliance therapy from the comfort of the home. Like with MATRx,&#xD;
      participants will sleep with a motorized mandibular positioner in place. But, it is&#xD;
      controlled by a computer, rather than a sleep technician, making it a computer controlled&#xD;
      mandibular positioner (CCMP). The feasibility and predictive accuracy of multi night testing&#xD;
      using the CCMP will be evaluated through participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor has carried out two previous research trials leading to the development of the&#xD;
      CCMP. The first established the predictive accuracy of the remotely controlled mandibular&#xD;
      positioner at identifying candidates suitable for oral appliance therapy and their effective&#xD;
      therapeutic setting. The second established the accuracy of the algorithms used by the CCMP&#xD;
      to similarly identify successful candidates in a clinical setting. No significant problems&#xD;
      were identified in conjunction with our previous research protocol, and no significant risks&#xD;
      were identified. This third protocol is to establish the feasibility and accuracy of the CCMP&#xD;
      when used in the home setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will utilize data collected over a series of nights to formulate a prediction of&#xD;
      therapeutic outcome with an oral appliance. The prediction will be tested by comparing the&#xD;
      degree of airway obstruction without treatment (from data collected prior to the study) to&#xD;
      the degree of airway obstruction with oral appliance therapy. A custom fit oral appliance&#xD;
      will be provided to participants as part of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to test the predictive accuracy of the CCMP in identifying&#xD;
      favorable candidates for oral appliance therapy and in determining an efficacious protrusive&#xD;
      position. Another purpose is to evaluate the convenience and possibility of carrying out a&#xD;
      multi-night CCMP study in the home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no known risks or side effects to the CCMP studies, to the home studies, or to the&#xD;
      oral appliance therapy. It is possible that participants will have some discomfort during the&#xD;
      nights of the CCMP studies but this will be transient and not cause any long term damage.&#xD;
      Participants may experience soreness of the teeth or jaw joint during adjustment of the oral&#xD;
      appliance by the dentist. There is no risk of jaw dislocation or problems with the&#xD;
      temporomandibular joint (TMJ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have the benefit of receiving a dental appliance for treating their sleep&#xD;
      apnea at no charge. This will be supplied to participants by a dentist who is an expert in&#xD;
      this field. Participation in the study will also allow the further development and ultimately&#xD;
      commercialization of the CCMP device which may help individuals who have sleep apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental appliance therapy is just one of two therapies for sleep apnea. If participants choose&#xD;
      not to have the dental appliance therapy, they may wish to try nasal continuous positive&#xD;
      airway pressure. Participants may withdraw at any time during the study without compromising&#xD;
      their health care in any way. To withdraw, participants should simply notify one of the&#xD;
      physicians or the research assistant. If the sponsor obtains new information that might&#xD;
      affect an individual's willingness to participate in the study, they will be informed&#xD;
      immediately.&#xD;

      I. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disease that carries significant risks for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, mortality, and economic costs. Almost thirty years ago, initial&#xD;
      population studies found the prevalence of OSA to be five to nine per cent of the adult&#xD;
      population. Excess body weight is a risk factor for the development of OSA, and the recent&#xD;
      rise in prevalence of obesity has led to revised estimates of OSA prevalence, now at&#xD;
      seventeen per cent of the adult population. OSA is poorly recognized clinically; currently&#xD;
      85% of apneics remain undiagnosed and untreated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OSA derives fundamentally from structural abnormalities of the pharynx that cause pharyngeal&#xD;
      narrowing or closure during sleep and produce recurrent apneas and hypopneas. During&#xD;
      wakefulness compensatory neuromuscular reflexes protect the pharynx from collapse. These&#xD;
      reflexes are lost during sleep, leaving the collapsible human pharynx susceptible to&#xD;
      narrowing or closure. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), comprised of an air&#xD;
      generator and nose mask, is the standard therapy for OSA. CPAP delivers positive pressure to&#xD;
      the pharyngeal lumen, thereby dilating it and eliminating obstruction. While this therapy is&#xD;
      highly efficacious, it is cumbersome and its effectiveness is compromised by a relatively low&#xD;
      adherence rate. Adherence depends on the methods used to initiate therapy and on the severity&#xD;
      of OSA, being higher in subjects with more severe hypoxemia and excessive daytime sleepiness.&#xD;
      In current practice, CPAP adherence rate appears to approximate fifty per cent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only currently available alternative to CPAP is oral appliance (OA) therapy. Oral&#xD;
      appliances maintain patency of the airway during sleep by stabilizing and protruding the&#xD;
      mandible and/or the tongue. The most commonly used type of OA is a custom-made mandibular&#xD;
      repositioner (MR) which protrudes the mandible. Mandibular protrusion in paralyzed subjects&#xD;
      dilates both the velopharynx and the oropharynx. In clinical practice, a specialist dentist&#xD;
      fabricates a custom-fitted appliance covering upper and lower teeth. The appliance is then&#xD;
      empirically adjusted to progressively protrude the mandible until a therapeutic end-point is&#xD;
      reached. OA therapy is better accepted by the OSA subject than nasal CPAP, and self-reported&#xD;
      adherence rates are high. Unfortunately, OA therapy is not uniformly effective in OSA.&#xD;
      Reported effectiveness ranges from 50 to 70 percent, and our recent study found a 58% percent&#xD;
      success rate. In short, two therapies are currently available for treating OSA, and each has&#xD;
      its own shortcomings: 1) CPAP is efficacious but not uniformly tolerated by subjects; and 2)&#xD;
      OAT is not highly efficacious but is better tolerated than CPAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. CURRENT STATUS OF MEDICAL PRACTICE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the uncertainties regarding use of OA therapy for treating OSA, current practices&#xD;
      in North America focus primarily on the use of nasal CPAP. Virtually all subjects found to&#xD;
      have OSA receive a trial of nasal CPAP. If they prove non-adherent with this therapy, they&#xD;
      may then be offered OA therapy. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends OA therapy&#xD;
      as a CPAP alternative in subjects with OSA of mild to moderate severity. However, lacking a&#xD;
      valid test for clinically selecting subjects with OSA who will have a favorable response to&#xD;
      OA therapy, reimbursement for OA therapy is usually provided only for apneics who fail CPAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of OA therapy could be improved by screening OSA subjects and prospectively&#xD;
      identifying those suitable for this therapy. Unfortunately, at the present time, a method for&#xD;
      selecting favorable candidates for OA therapy is lacking. Moreover, even if a subject were&#xD;
      known to be a favorable candidate, the dentist currently has no way to determine the target&#xD;
      therapeutic protrusive position. Studies of the passive pharynx indicate that the response of&#xD;
      the pharynx to mandibular protrusion is 'dose dependent'; incremental mandibular protrusion&#xD;
      produces corresponding pharyngeal enlargement. However, clinical experience shows that&#xD;
      excessive mandibular protrusion is undesirable, producing side effects, such as, pain and&#xD;
      tooth movement that lead to discontinuation of therapy. In some cases, over-protrusion can&#xD;
      worsen OSA. Current practice is for the dentist to progressively protrude the mandible until&#xD;
      a symptomatic response occurs, and then reassess the subject to determine if OSA has&#xD;
      resolved. Thus, prospective identification of suitable candidates and of a target protrusive&#xD;
      position would greatly facilitate treatment of OSA with OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Owing largely to its association with excess body weight, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has&#xD;
      become arguably the most prevalent chronic non-communicable disease in industrialized&#xD;
      societies, assuming that obesity is not classified a disease. In addition to impairing&#xD;
      quality of life, OSA conveys an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and vehicular&#xD;
      accidents. Finally, the majority of apneics remain undiagnosed and untreated. Thus, OSA has&#xD;
      all the hallmarks of a major public health problem, affecting all age groups and increasing&#xD;
      in epidemic proportions. Unfortunately, current medical practices seem ill suited to dealing&#xD;
      with the challenges posed by OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perhaps the most unsettling aspect of present medical practices relates to the cumbersome,&#xD;
      uninviting and expensive methods currently used to diagnose and treat the disease. Common&#xD;
      clinical experience indicates that individuals often resist undergoing the standard&#xD;
      diagnostic test, an overnight in-hospital polysomnogram, because of the extensive attachments&#xD;
      to the body surface and because, if OSA is present, continuous positive airway pressure&#xD;
      (CPAP) will be administered during the latter half of the night. In other words, as public&#xD;
      awareness of sleep apnea has increased so also has the negative impression of current testing&#xD;
      and treatment. Any effective solution to the public health challenges posed by sleep apnea&#xD;
      will have to consider the need for less cumbersome and off-putting clinical methods. In other&#xD;
      words, the current approach to OSA, i.e., overnight polysomnogram plus CPAP, simply will not&#xD;
      deal with the problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While simpler, less expensive home monitoring appears to be gaining acceptance of sleep&#xD;
      physicians, CPAP continues to be virtually the only therapy offered to most patients, despite&#xD;
      the low adherence rated documented in numerous studies. The dominant alternative, at the&#xD;
      present time, is mandibular repositioner (MR) therapy, using a custom fitted dental appliance&#xD;
      that protrudes the mandible during sleep. Despite overwhelming patient preference for OA over&#xD;
      CPAP, only 5% of patients diagnosed with OSA receive this therapy. The likely reason for the&#xD;
      physician bias in favor CPAP therapy is that it is benign and highly efficacious. OA therapy,&#xD;
      while similarly benign, is efficacious in only 50-70% of unselected cases. Thus, the&#xD;
      clinician prefers prescribing the more reliable therapy, having less concern about the low&#xD;
      adherence rate. To summarize, current practice of diagnosis and treatment of OSA in North&#xD;
      America emphasizes expensive in-hospital testing and initiation of a therapy which is&#xD;
      difficult for many patients to accept and use regularly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. NEW TECHNOLOGIES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research evaluates new technology that could contribute to ameliorating the&#xD;
      difficulties outlined above by allowing accurate selection of patients for OA therapy using a&#xD;
      test that is performed in the home. This home technology is, in turn, derived from a device&#xD;
      that Zephyr Sleep Technologies has invented, developed and now have brought to market, called&#xD;
      remotely controlled mandibular positioner (RCMP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to have a more convenient and less expensive method for selecting favorable&#xD;
      candidates for OA therapy, Zephyr Sleep Technologies has developed a companion technology for&#xD;
      use in the home. Like the RCMP, the patient sleeps with the motorized mandibular positioner&#xD;
      in place. However, the position of the mandibular protruder is controlled by a computer,&#xD;
      rather than a sleep technician, making it a computer controlled mandibular positioner (CCMP).&#xD;
      As in the RCMP study, respiratory airflow and oxygen saturation are recorded, and the CCMP&#xD;
      accurately detects apneas and hypopneas in real time. However, bioelectric signals necessary&#xD;
      for sleep staging are not recorded. The CCMP protrudes the mandible when apneas or hypopneas&#xD;
      are detected. In addition, it conducts proactive testing, moving the mandible and evaluating&#xD;
      the effect on airflow. Using both types of information, the controller decides whether or not&#xD;
      to move the mandible, in which direction, and by how much. Finally, Zephyr Sleep Technologies&#xD;
      has developed an analytical algorithm that examines the response of the moving apnea hypopnea&#xD;
      index (AHI, the sum of apneas and hypopneas per unit time) to mandibular protrusion and makes&#xD;
      a prediction of therapeutic success with OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CCMP uses the same motorized mandibular protruder used for the MATRx product. The motor&#xD;
      is enclosed in a housing which is attached to the upper and lower appliances. The movement of&#xD;
      the linear actuator exerts a force on the lower jaw to either protrude or retrude it. A&#xD;
      series of dental trays for upper and lower teeth have been fabricated. This allows a close&#xD;
      fitting of the tray to the subject's teeth so that a minimum amount of tray material occupies&#xD;
      the inner surface of the teeth. A highly flexible, thin wire connects the motor in the&#xD;
      mandibular protruder to a controller on a bedside table which, in turn, is connected to a&#xD;
      laptop computer. As well, an input signal box on the bedside table is connected to two naris&#xD;
      catheters that are positioned in the patient's nose and a commercially available finger&#xD;
      oximeter. The input signal box is connected to the laptop and these two signals (oxygen&#xD;
      saturation and airflow) are used by the computer algorithms to decide how to move the&#xD;
      mandible. The MATRx controller receives commands from the computer that cause it to protrude&#xD;
      or retrude the mandible in small, defined steps. The controller also has a wired output&#xD;
      connection to the input box of computer, continuously providing the computer with information&#xD;
      regarding the position of the mandible. The limits of excursion by the actuator are set by&#xD;
      the technician in the software, according to the full retrusion and full protrusion values&#xD;
      noted by the dentist. Thus, the computer can move the mandible only between predefined limits&#xD;
      during the CCMP study. The signal box also receives input signals from a microphone and a&#xD;
      position sensor mounted on the mandibular positioner as well as an input from a force&#xD;
      transducer inside the positioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. STUDY PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a two night in-home cardio-pulmonary evaluation during sleep using&#xD;
      the Snore Sat Recorder. The results will provide baseline data. Prior to the in-home CCMP&#xD;
      study, the subject will be assessed by the dental co-investigator to ensure suitability for&#xD;
      the trial and use of the device. They will then be fitted with an upper and a lower dental&#xD;
      tray by the dental co-investigator. The dentist fills each tray with a silicone impression&#xD;
      material and applies them to the upper and lower teeth. The relative position of upper and&#xD;
      lower trays is documented by the numerical reading from a linear scale imprinted on the&#xD;
      sliding strut of the lower tray. The subject moves the mandible to the rest position, the&#xD;
      most retruded position, and the most protruded position. The scale is read by the dentist at&#xD;
      each position. The data collected is provided to the research coordinator and will be input&#xD;
      into the device to control the range of protrusion tested by the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical coordinator will visit the subject in the home during the day of the first night&#xD;
      test and set up the computer equipment and mandibular positioner. To attach the subject's&#xD;
      dental trays, the upper and lower trays are clipped to the actuator housing with the actuator&#xD;
      piston fully retracted. The maximum allowable protrusive position as determined by the&#xD;
      dentist will be entered in the computer to prevent excessive protrusion of the mandible. The&#xD;
      computer controls movement of the linear actuator in protrusive or retrusive directions in&#xD;
      increments of 0.2 mm through the keyboard on the computer. The position of the actuator is&#xD;
      connected as an input to the computer. Just prior to starting the study, the subject will lie&#xD;
      supine in bed and insert the dental trays into the mouth with the trays in the rest position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical coordinator will also provide the subject with full instruction on how to use&#xD;
      the device during the study. The subject will be instructed to properly insert the trays,&#xD;
      connected to the mandibular positioner, in the mouth. The subject will also learn to apply&#xD;
      the finger oximeter probe, and the naris cannula. The subject will be taught how to start the&#xD;
      CCMP test, pause it and terminate it at the end of the study. At bedtime, the subject will&#xD;
      apply the naris cannula and the probe, insert the tray in the mouth and initiate the CCMP&#xD;
      study by the appropriate command on the laptop. The subject then falls asleep, and as apneas&#xD;
      and/or hypopneas appear, the computer will protrude the mandible from rest position in 0.2 mm&#xD;
      steps. Once all respiratory disturbances are eliminated (absence of apneas, hypopneas),&#xD;
      proactive testing is performed in which the mandible is protruded or retruded 0.6 mm. If the&#xD;
      latter causes a decrease in peak inspiratory airflow or if the former causes an increase in&#xD;
      this variable, the mandible is protruded 0.6 mm, and so on. The following morning, the&#xD;
      subject will awaken and remove the oral appliance, terminate the CCMP program and transmit&#xD;
      the night's data to the server by a mouse click on a send button. The subject will complete a&#xD;
      Device Satisfaction Questionnaire each morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data from the first night titration will be retrieved and automatically analyzed to judge&#xD;
      the efficaciousness of the mandibular protrusion in eliminating pharyngeal obstruction and to&#xD;
      identify the effective target protrusive position that will be required for successful&#xD;
      therapy. If the predicted success criterion is not met, the subject is tentatively predicted&#xD;
      to be a therapeutic failure, and a target of 90% of full protrusion is selected. After the&#xD;
      analysis has been completed, the clinical coordinator will return to the subject's home and&#xD;
      set the target position for the second night CCMP study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the home visit prior to the second night study, the clinical coordinator will discuss&#xD;
      with the subject his/her experience during the first night, and will carefully inquire&#xD;
      regarding any discomfort or problems the subject may have experienced. The coordinator sets&#xD;
      the CCMP for the Refinement and Verification program and enters the appropriate target&#xD;
      distance. At bedtime the subject prepares for the study as on the first night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CCMP algorithm moves the mandible to the target position and holds it there for the&#xD;
      entire night, if the moving AHI (i.e. AHI for the time after the target is reached, initially&#xD;
      measured over at least 2 hr) remains below 10 hr-1, ±0.6 mm. Otherwise the computer will&#xD;
      protrude the mandible in 0.2 mm steps and repeat the test at a higher protrusive level. The&#xD;
      following morning, the subject will awaken and remove the oral appliance, terminate the CCMP&#xD;
      program and transmit the night's data to the Zephyr server by a mouse click on a send button.&#xD;
      The subject will complete the Device Satisfaction Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The computer calculates an AHI for the full night. The results from the first and second&#xD;
      night titration studies will be provided to a sleep physician who will review the results and&#xD;
      refine the prediction to arrive at a final prediction of therapeutic outcome and target&#xD;
      protrusive setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target protrusive position determined from the analysis of the combined titration studies&#xD;
      will then be sent to the dentist. For patients predicted to be a success, the minimum&#xD;
      effective position will be provided. For patients predicted to be a failure, the scale&#xD;
      reading at 70 percent of maximum protrusion will serve as a sham target value. The dentist&#xD;
      will be blinded to whether the CCMP test results were &quot;positive&quot; or &quot;negative&quot;. The subject&#xD;
      will be referred to the dental co-investigator, and fitted with a custom oral appliance at no&#xD;
      cost while blinded to the results of the CCMP studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up portable cardio-pulmonary monitoring will be performed on two consecutive nights&#xD;
      with the oral appliance at target protrusive distance. If the AHI is greater than 10 hr-1,&#xD;
      the subject will be referred to the dental co-investigator for further mandibular protrusion.&#xD;
      This adjustment will be performed in a minimum period of 3 weeks. The subject will be&#xD;
      retested and the therapy judged successful according to the criteria outlined above. If the&#xD;
      AHI is greater than 10hr-1, once maximum clinical protrusion of the mandible has been&#xD;
      achieved, the OA therapy will be considered a failure.&#xD;
