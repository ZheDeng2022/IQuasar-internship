    <textblock>
      Autonomic dysfunction is a common complication of stroke that may lead to poor rehabilitation&#xD;
      outcomes and to increase in mortality. The severity of the autonomic dysfunction can be&#xD;
      measured in many ways, but the most common way is assessment of the&#xD;
      sympathetic-parasympathetic equilibrium by heart rate variability analysis. It is known that&#xD;
      the plasticity of the brain can influence the autonomic nerve system and that providing&#xD;
      appropriate stimuli encourages these changes. It was found that stimulation of rhythm,&#xD;
      stimulation of cognitive tasks and stimulation of activity, influence the autonomic nerve&#xD;
      system in healthy subjects. Thus, we can ask if an integrated task (activity, cognitive,&#xD;
      rhythm) may influence the autonomic nervous system and cause an increase in brain activity,&#xD;
      therefore contributing to the rehabilitation of stroke patients. Taken together, the purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to examine the influence of stimulation of rhythm, stimulation of cognition,&#xD;
      stimulation of activity and combined stimulation, on the autonomic nerve system. This effect&#xD;
      will be tested by measuring heart rate variability in chronic stroke patients and in a&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;

      background and Rationale: Autonomic dysfunction is a common complication of stroke that may&#xD;
      lead to poor rehabilitation outcomes and to increase in mortality. Although this dysfunction&#xD;
      is a common symptom of stroke, both in the acute phase and in the chronic phase, it is not a&#xD;
      specific therapeutic target yet. The severity of the autonomic dysfunction can be measured in&#xD;
      many ways, but the most common way is assessment of the sympathetic-parasympathetic&#xD;
      equilibrium by heart rate variability analysis. It is known that the plasticity of the brain&#xD;
      can influence the autonomic nerve system and that providing appropriate stimuli encourages&#xD;
      these changes. It was found that stimulation of rhythm, stimulation of cognitive tasks (in&#xD;
      particular, stimulation of executive functions) and stimulation of activity, influence the&#xD;
      autonomic nerve system in healthy subjects. Thus, we can ask if an integrated task (activity,&#xD;
      cognitive, rhythm) may influence the autonomic nervous system and cause an increase in brain&#xD;
      activity, therefore contributing to the rehabilitation of stroke patients. Taken together,&#xD;
      the purpose of this study is to examine the influence of stimulation of rapid or slow rhythm,&#xD;
      stimulation of cognition by cognitive tasks, stimulation of activity by pedaling a fitness&#xD;
      bike and combined stimulation, on the autonomic nerve system. This effect will be tested by&#xD;
      measuring heart rate variability in chronic stroke patients and in a control group with&#xD;
      equivalent age and lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Medical Device:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart rate and heart rate variability will be monitored by Polar RS800CX watch (PolarElectro&#xD;
      OY, Kempele, Finland(. A transmitter placed on the patient's chest will collect the data.&#xD;
      This data will be stored in the watch's computer and then analyzed in a specific Polar&#xD;
      software (Polar Protrainer 5 inc.). An appropriate filtration will be made after a&#xD;
      preliminary study. Pedaling capability, RPM, will be collected from cadence sensor with&#xD;
      Bluetooth smart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Purpose of this Medical Research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of stimulation of rapid or slow rhythm,&#xD;
      stimulation of cognition by cognitive tasks, stimulation of activity by pedaling a fitness&#xD;
      bike and combined stimulation, on the autonomic nerve system in chronic stroke patients and&#xD;
      in a control group with equivalent age and lifestyle.&#xD;
