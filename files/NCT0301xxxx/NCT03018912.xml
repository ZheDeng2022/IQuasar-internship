      Sleep disorders are commonly under-recognized in the primary care setting and available&#xD;
      screening tools are often are limited. The study inestigators hypothesize that the use of a&#xD;
      novel subjective sleep vital sign (VS) will improve recognition of patients with sleep&#xD;
      disorders and can be utilized to track outcomes to sleep therapy.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to identify patients with sleep disorders is recognized as increasingly important&#xD;
      given its association with cardiovascular disease and impact on daytime functioning and&#xD;
      quality of life. The Center for Disease Control recently characterized insufficient sleep as&#xD;
      a public health issue, while also estimating that 1 in 25 adults admit to falling asleep&#xD;
      while driving in a given month. 50 to 70 million Americans are affected by chronic sleep&#xD;
      disorders and intermittent sleep problems, yet sleep problems are under-recognized; for&#xD;
      example, 80 to 90% of adults with sleep disordered breathing remain undiagnosed. Sleep&#xD;
      disorder screening tools are available, but are often limited by the following factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Surveys may be extensive and thereby limit utilization&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Screening tools are often targeted for specific sleep disorders (e.g. obstructive sleep&#xD;
           apnea (OSA)) rather than to more comprehensively screen for a wide range of sleep&#xD;
           disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Screening tools may not be useful in assessing outcomes during follow-up care&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose the development of a sleep vital sign (VS) constructed as a simple-to-use survey&#xD;
      tool that can assist primary care in identifying patients with sleep disorders and&#xD;
      potentially useful to assess response to treatment. Improved identification of sleep&#xD;
      disorders can potentially result in a benefit to the individual patient, to the health&#xD;
      system, and to the greater public health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Proposal We plan to investigate the use of a sleep VS (subjective patient reported&#xD;
      metric) as a potential tool to identify patients with sleep disorders and to measure outcomes&#xD;
      during follow-up care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study is structured as a 2-arm randomized, prospective clinical trial with the&#xD;
      following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether subjective sleep vital signs can improve the rate of identifying&#xD;
           patients with sleep disorders in a primary care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if subjective sleep vital signs can track patient therapy response for&#xD;
           various sleep disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To correlate subjective sleep vital sign results with validated sleep measurements (e.g.&#xD;
           sleep surveys, Continuous Positive Airway (CPAP) usage)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a 2-arm randomized clinical trial. Patients checking into Kaiser Fontana&#xD;
      Medical Center primary care clinics (Internal Medicine), will be randomized into one of the&#xD;
      following pathways: Sleep Vital Sign (VS) Pathway or Usual Care (refer to Workflow Figure).&#xD;
      We intend to use the first day of recruitment to identify challenges with protocol&#xD;
      implementation in a primary care clinic. Data collected during this day will only be used to&#xD;
      compare sleep VS to the other validated sleep questionnaires in the survey packet; however,&#xD;
      this data will not be used to compare rates of identifying sleep disorders between sleep VS&#xD;
      and usual care pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep VS Pathway When enrolling, we plan to inform the patients that we are performing a&#xD;
      study pertaining generally to overall well-being and quality of life, while withholding&#xD;
      information that the study pertains specifically to screening for sleep disorders. We believe&#xD;
      it is necessary to withhold information (incomplete disclosure) that the study is&#xD;
      specifically about sleep disorders in order to limit the risk of selection bias. If &quot;sleep&#xD;
      disorders&quot; was provided as full disclosure as the topic of the study, it may incentivize&#xD;
      patients with sleep problems to participate in the study (while dis-incentivizing those&#xD;
      without sleep problems from participating), thus introducing a potential selection bias.&#xD;
      Selection bias could affect the determined accuracy of the sleep VS in identifying sleep&#xD;
      disorders which is the primary aim of this study, and negatively affect the scientific and&#xD;
      educational value of this study. Furthermore, it would limit our understanding on proper&#xD;
      practical implementation into healthcare delivery workflows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At check-in, a research associate will ask patients if they are interested in participating&#xD;
      in a research study. If patient expresses interest, the research associate will explain the&#xD;
      study and give an informational sheet utilizing an anticipated IRB approved script. Those who&#xD;
      have given verbal consent, after reviewing the information sheet, will be provided a Sleep VS&#xD;
      survey packet (packet includes: Sleep VS, sleep-wake assessment, ESS, FOSQ-10, and ISI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Debriefing process: immediately after the patient completes this &quot;Sleep VS survey packet&quot;,&#xD;
      the investigator will inform the patient that the purpose of this study specifically pertains&#xD;
      to discovering tools that may help medical providers better identify patients with sleep&#xD;
      disorders and will provide patient with contact for Dr. Dennis Hwang, the study's primary&#xD;
      investigator, in the event that the patient wishes to withdraw their data from inclusion in&#xD;
      study analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed Sleep VS is based on the following 2 questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How many days a week are you not satisfied with your sleep?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How many days a week is sleepiness a problem?&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purposes of this study, the Sleep VS will be considered a positive screen if patients&#xD;
      response to 1) or 2) is â‰¥4 days. Investigators or research associates will review the Sleep&#xD;
      VS, and patients that screen positive will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Asked an extended set of sleep questions (refer to Triaging Algorithm Figure)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Brought to the attention of the primary care physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A triaging algorithm will be available based on answers to the extended sleep questions to&#xD;
      assist the primary care physician with assessment and triaging care (refer to Triaging&#xD;
      Algorithm Figure). Patients will primarily be triaged to sleep medicine (for OSA assessment,&#xD;
      complex insomnia patients, and other patients with more complex sleep disorders), to health&#xD;
      education 4-week cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program for less complex insomnia or&#xD;
      remain under the care of the primary care physician. If the patient is referred to sleep&#xD;
      medicine, the sleep VS will be performed at each sleep center appointment (it is already part&#xD;
      of our standard usual clinical care). The triaging algorithm is a tool to assist the primary&#xD;
      care physician with management suggestions, but the physician has the flexibility to manage&#xD;
      the patient according to best clinical judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that screen &quot;negative&quot; will not be asked the extended sleep questions nor will they&#xD;
      be brought to the attention of the primary care physician. They will proceed with &quot;usual&#xD;
      care.&quot; If during the course of &quot;usual care&quot;, a potential sleep disorder is discussed, the&#xD;
      extended sleep questions with triaging algorithm can still be utilized to assist in&#xD;
      determining management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual Care Pathway Patients will not be provided the sleep VS packet during check-in. If&#xD;
      during the course of usual care, a potential sleep disorder is discussed, the extended sleep&#xD;
      questions with triaging algorithm can still be utilized to assist in determining management&#xD;
      at the discretion of the primary care physician.&#xD;
