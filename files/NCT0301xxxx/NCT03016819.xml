      THIS STUDY IS CURRENTLY RECRUITING PATIENTS WITH ALVEOLAR SOFT PART SARCOMA ONLY AND IS NO&#xD;
      LONGER RECRUITING PATIENTS WITH SYNOVIAL SARCOMA OR LEIOMYOSARCOMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of AL3818 (anlotinib) hydrochloride in the&#xD;
      treatment of metastatic or advanced alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS), leiomyosarcoma (LMS),&#xD;
      and synovial sarcoma (SS). All participants with ASPS will receive open-label AL3818. In&#xD;
      participants with LMS or SS, AL3818 will be compared to IV dacarbazine. Two-thirds of the&#xD;
      participants will receive AL3818, one-third of the participants will receive IV dacarbazine.&#xD;

      THIS STUDY IS CURRENTLY RECRUITING PATIENTS WITH ALVEOLAR SOFT PART SARCOMA ONLY AND IS NO&#xD;
      LONGER RECRUITING PATIENTS WITH SYNOVIAL SARCOMA OR LEIOMYOSARCOMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APROMISS is a phase 3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of AL3818 (anlotinib)&#xD;
      hydrochloride in the treatment of metastatic or advanced alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS),&#xD;
      leiomyosarcoma (LMS), and synovial sarcoma (SS). Population pharmacokinetics and exploratory&#xD;
      exposure-response analyses will also be conducted in subjects receiving AL3818.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indication A: 56 subjects with metastatic or advanced ASPS not amenable to surgical resection&#xD;
      will receive open-label AL3818 at a dose of 12 mg once daily in 21-day cycles (14 days on&#xD;
      treatment, 7 days off treatment) until disease progression (defined by RECIST version 1.1) ot&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR), secondary&#xD;
      endpoint is duration of response (DOR). - OPEN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indication B: 68 subjects with metastatic or advanced LMS who have failed at least one prior&#xD;
      line of approved therapy will be enrolled and randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either&#xD;
      AL3818 (12 mg once daily in 21-day cycles) or IV dacarbazine until disease progression&#xD;
      (defined by RECIST version 1.1) or unacceptable toxicity. Subjects randomized to dacarbazine&#xD;
      will have the option to crossover and receive AL3818 at the time of documented disease&#xD;
      progression. The primary endpoint is progression free survival (PFS), the secondary endpoint&#xD;
      is objective response rate (ORR). - CLOSED&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indication C: 95 subjects with with metastatic or advanced SS who have failed at least one&#xD;
      prior line of approved therapy, including first-line anthracycline-containing chemotherapy,&#xD;
      will be enrolled and randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either AL3818 (12 mg once daily in&#xD;
      21-day cycles) or IV dacarbazine until disease progression (defined by RECIST version 1.1) or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Subjects randomized to dacarbazine will have the option to crossover&#xD;
      and receive AL3818 at the time of documented disease progression. The primary endpoint is&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS), the secondary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR). -&#xD;
      CLOSED&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indication D - LMS: 106 subjects with histologically proven, unresectable, recurrent, locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic leiomyosarcoma (of soft tissue, cutaneous origin, and vascular origin&#xD;
      who have failed at least one prior line of standard therapy (including anthracycline-based&#xD;
      therapy) and are ineligible for or refuse standard second-line therapy or are suitable for&#xD;
      third- and further-line treatment will be enrolled. Subjects will be randomized with a 2:1&#xD;
      ratio to receive either blinded AL3818 or placebo with approximately 71 subjects in the&#xD;
      AL3818 group and 35 subjects in the placebo group until disease progression (defined by&#xD;
      RECIST version 1.1) or unacceptable toxicity. Subjects randomized to placebo will have the&#xD;
      option to crossover and receive AL3818 at the time of documented disease progression (and&#xD;
      after crossover unblinding). The primary endpoint is progression free survival (PFS), the&#xD;
      secondary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR). - CLOSED&#xD;
