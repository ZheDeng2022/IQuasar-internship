    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of brentuximab vedotin and&#xD;
      cyclosporine when given together with verapamil hydrochloride in treating patients with&#xD;
      Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory).&#xD;
      Brentuximab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody, brentuximab, linked to a toxic agent called&#xD;
      vedotin. Brentuximab attaches to CD30 positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers&#xD;
      vedotin to kill them. Immunosuppressive therapies, such as cyclosporine, may improve bone&#xD;
      marrow function and increase blood cell counts. Verapamil hydrochloride may increase the&#xD;
      effectiveness of brentuximab vedotin by overcoming drug resistance of the cancer cells.&#xD;
      Giving brentuximab vedotin, cyclosporine, and verapamil hydrochloride may work better in&#xD;
      treating patients with Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of brentuximab vedotin (BV) plus&#xD;
      MDR1 inhibitors cyclosporine (CsA)/verapamil hydrochloride (verapamil [VRP]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Obtain estimates of overall response rate (ORR), complete response (CR) rate, and response&#xD;
      duration in patients treated with the combination of BV plus CsA/VRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Estimate overall and progression-free survival in patients treated with the combination&#xD;
      of BV plus CsA/VRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Characterize pharmacokinetics of plasma monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) in cycle 1 (for&#xD;
      expansion cohort only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of brentuximab vedotin and cyclosporine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cyclosporine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-5, verapamil&#xD;
      hydrochloride PO four times daily (QID) on days 1-5, and brentuximab vedotin intravenously&#xD;
      (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients who have not progressed are followed up every 6&#xD;
      months until disease progression, start of a new lymphoma therapy, 2 years post treatment, or&#xD;
      study completion, whichever is earlier. Patients who progress are followed up periodically.&#xD;
