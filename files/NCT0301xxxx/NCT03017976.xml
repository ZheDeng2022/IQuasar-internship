&#xD;
        2. In relation to swimming pool environment 2.1. To assess water and air quality through&#xD;
           the analysis of several chemical (DBPs and other), physicochemical and microbiological&#xD;
           parameters and the associated short-term variation of their levels (hourly and daily);&#xD;
           2.2. To assess microbiological contamination of highly used surfaces; 2.3. To assess&#xD;
           mutagenicity of indoor chlorinated and brominated swimming pool water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting Chlorinated and brominated public indoor municipal swimming pools in the North&#xD;
      of Portugal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will follow two distinct approaches:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A cross-sectional analysis to assess swimming pool physicochemical and microbiological&#xD;
           characteristics and the association between each parameter measured as an indicator of&#xD;
           water and air quality, contamination of surfaces and the health parameters assessed in&#xD;
           recreational users, swimming teachers and pool attendants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. An uncontrolled, before and after study to assess acute and chronic environmental&#xD;
           exposure effects on respiratory biomarkers of competitive swimmers:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Assessment of acute changes: regular competitive swimmers will be asked to swim for&#xD;
                40 minutes in a single, indoor, 50 m-long chlorinated swimming pool. Before and&#xD;
                after swimming, a battery of measurements will be assessed to evaluate respiratory&#xD;
                health biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Assessment of chronic changes: regular and na√Øf competitive swimmers will be&#xD;
                followed for a mean period of 90 days. A battery of measurements and biological&#xD;
                samples will be collected at the baseline evaluation and 90 days after, in order to&#xD;
                evaluate long-term changes in respiratory health biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and data collection procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cross-sectional study. The cross-sectional analysis will be performed in fifty municipal&#xD;
           indoor swimming pools in the North of Portugal on a voluntary basis. The administrative&#xD;
           boards of each swimming pool will be approached by the research team to present the&#xD;
           study's purposes and procedures and to obtain their consent to perform the study. Upon&#xD;
           acceptance, recreational users, swimming coaches/teachers and pool attendants will be&#xD;
           contacted and invited to participate. All subjects will receive a written description of&#xD;
           the study (appendix I-a) and the informed consent form (appendix II-a). Those who&#xD;
           provide an informed consent signed by both the subject and legal tutor (if a minor) will&#xD;
           be included in the study. Recreational swimmers, swimming teachers and pool attendants&#xD;
           will be asked to complete a self-administered standardized home questionnaire comprising&#xD;
           sociodemographic and health-related information, with a major focus on respiratory&#xD;
           health. Participants will also be asked to provide information on their food&#xD;
           consumption, physical activity levels and psychological well-being. Subjects should&#xD;
           return the completed questionnaires at the swimming pool facilities. A medical&#xD;
           examination will also be performed by trained health professionals and will include&#xD;
           anthropometric measurements, blood pressure evaluation, urine sample collection, skin&#xD;
           prick testing, exhaled breath condensate collection, lung function evaluation by&#xD;
           spirometry with bronchodilation, in a period conveniently scheduled with the&#xD;
           participating subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The assessment of swimming pool chemical (DBPs and others), physicochemical and&#xD;
           microbiological characteristics will include sampling in the water, air and eventually&#xD;
           selected surfaces, that include: pool edges, stairs and starting blocks, floors (pool&#xD;
           and bathhouse), walls (concrete and glass of the pool and bathhouse) and highly touched&#xD;
           surfaces such as bathhouse benches. We will measure different chemical, physicochemical&#xD;
           and microbiological parameters in multiple locations within the pool structure in order&#xD;
           to characterize the exposure and its spatial and temporal distribution both within a&#xD;
           specific swimming pool and also between the different swimming pools studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Uncontrolled, before and after study. A single, indoor, 50-meter-long chlorinated&#xD;
           swimming pool in Porto, Portugal, will be selected for this study. The administrative&#xD;
           board will be approached by the research team to present the study's purposes and&#xD;
           procedures and to obtain their consent to perform the study. Upon acceptance, the&#xD;
           competitive swimming team will be asked to participate in the study. All subjects will&#xD;
           receive a written description of the study (appendix I-b) and the informed consent form&#xD;
           (appendix II-b). Competitive swimmers with 12 years of age or older who provide an&#xD;
           informed consent signed by both the subject and legal tutor (if a minor) will be&#xD;
           included in an uncontrolled before and after study to assess acute and chronic&#xD;
           respiratory symptoms after a regular training session. This assessment will be executed&#xD;
           following two approaches:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Assessment of acute changes: in a period conveniently scheduled with the swimmers&#xD;
                and their coaches, a medical examination will be performed in order to assess&#xD;
                baseline respiratory biomarkers of competitive swimmers. This examination will&#xD;
                include the assessment of exhaled breath condensate and lung function evaluation.&#xD;
                The same biological measurements will be performed after a single regular training&#xD;
                session and an interviewer-administered questionnaire will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Assessment of chronic changes: Competitive swimmers will also be followed through a&#xD;
                90-day period in order to evaluate long-term changes in respiratory and cancer&#xD;
                biomarkers. The baseline evaluation will consist in the assessment of biological&#xD;
                measurements, namely anthropometric measurements, blood pressure evaluation, sample&#xD;
                collection (i.e. blood and urine samples and buccal swab), skin prick testing,&#xD;
                pupillometry, capsaicin challenge, exhaled breath condensate collection, lung&#xD;
                function evaluation (namely, spirometry with bronchodilation, impulse oscillometry,&#xD;
                methacholine challenge and fractional concentration of orally exhaled nitric oxide)&#xD;
                and transepidermal water loss assessment. Participants will also be asked to&#xD;
                provide information on sociodemographic characteristics, personal and family&#xD;
                history of disease, use of medication, frequency of self-reported respiratory,&#xD;
                ocular and cutaneous symptoms, data on health-related behaviors, namely tobacco&#xD;
                use, physical activity levels and food consumption, through an&#xD;
                interviewer-administered questionnaire. A full examination will be performed only&#xD;
                at baseline and at the follow-up assessment (90 days after).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This evaluation will be performed by trained health professionals in a room inside the&#xD;
      swimming pool facilities but separated from the swimming pool area, in a period conveniently&#xD;
      scheduled with the swimmers and their coaches. Due to the possibility of experiencing&#xD;
      transient symptoms, participants will be asked to visit the research department in order to&#xD;
      perform the methacholine challenge. Participants will be reimbursed for any travel expenses.&#xD;
