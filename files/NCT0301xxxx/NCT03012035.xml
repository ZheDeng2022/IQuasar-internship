      This study evaluates the role of treatment success expectation in spider fearful individuals&#xD;
      on the actual treatment success. Half of participants will have positive treatment success&#xD;
      expectations, while the other half will have neutral treatment outcome expectations.&#xD;

      The investigator plan to conduct a randomized, single blind study with two parallel groups.&#xD;
      Both groups undergo the same standardized psychotherapeutic intervention, i.e. exposure&#xD;
      training. All participants will receive the same exposure training in groups of maximum three&#xD;
      participants of the same study group. The two study groups only differ regarding the induced&#xD;
      treatment expectations towards the effects of the exposure training. While the experimental&#xD;
      group will get an open administration of treatment and be informed in order to have a&#xD;
      positive treatment expectation, the comparator group will receive a hidden administration of&#xD;
      treatment and get neutral information, thus treatment expectations will be neutral. Study&#xD;
      members conducting the exposure training with the participants will not be aware of the&#xD;
      allocation of the study participants. Study participants will be informed about the aim of&#xD;
      the allocated condition, but they will be blind to the aim of the study in order to induce&#xD;
      the specific expectation. Differences in treatment outcomes are compared between both groups&#xD;
      to investigate the association with treatment expectation.&#xD;

    <description>Before participants undergo the exposure training their expectation of treatment efficacy is manipulated with different information regarding the following treatment.
