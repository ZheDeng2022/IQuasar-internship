      A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of dried&#xD;
      cranberry at 500 mg daily in women with overactive bladder for 6-months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 6 month, randomized, prospective, single-center trial that will be conducted in an&#xD;
      outpatient setting at a tertiary care facility. This will be a double-blind, randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled parallel study of dried cranberry for OAB symptoms in women. Eligible&#xD;
      subjects will be female outpatients aged ≥18 years who have been diagnosed with OAB. All&#xD;
      patients will be provided written informed consent before entering the study. The study&#xD;
      protocol and all amendments will be approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Board.&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited for the study from the office of Dr. Bilal Chughtai, from within&#xD;
      Weill Cornell Medical College, including referral by WCMC-affiliated primary care and other&#xD;
      physicians not involved with the study, as well as recruited from advertisement (Craigslist,&#xD;
      newspapers, posters, etc.). Recruitment will also take place within New York Presbyterian&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have a complete history and physical examination in the office; the&#xD;
      participants will complete the validated questionnaires and informed consent, as well as&#xD;
      urinalysis. Eligible participants will be enrolled in the study and randomized to receive&#xD;
      either a dried cranberry or placebo. The primary endpoint is the mean change in number of&#xD;
      voids per day as measured using a three-day voiding diaries from baseline to&#xD;
      end-of-treatment. Patients will complete voiding diaries for 3 consecutive days prior to each&#xD;
      clinic visit. Secondary endpoints will include a comparison of the patient's baseline OAB&#xD;
      symptom bother and quality of life, and sexual function as measured by 4 validated&#xD;
      questionnaires: the OABQ-SF, PPBC, SQOL-F, and PFDI-20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be given a device to measure their urinary volume throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration will be 6 months. Follow-up visits will be conducted at 12 and 24 weeks.&#xD;
      Adverse reactions and complications will be obtained and recorded by Clavien-Dindo Grading&#xD;
      System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator seeks to determine if dried cranberry powder changes the microbiome of women&#xD;
      with Overactive Bladder symptoms versus placebo. At visit two (baseline) and visit four (end&#xD;
      of study visit) stool and urine samples will be collected from up to 40 study participants&#xD;
      out of the 76 participants enrolled in the study. The stool and urine samples will be&#xD;
      collected and the microbiome of each specimen will be analyzed by Genomics Core or&#xD;
      Epigenomics Core at Weill Cornell Medical College.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the study will provide urine samples. The urine sample will be collected in&#xD;
      sterile containers. Participants in the study will provide one urine sample during visit 2&#xD;
      (Baseline visit) and another sample during visit 4 (end of study). These samples will be&#xD;
      subsequently analyzed for the presence/ absence of microbiota. This includes DNA extraction,&#xD;
      library preparation, shotgun next-generation sequencing, and follow-up metagenomics and&#xD;
      microbiome analysis using bioinformatics alignment tools, in order to identify microbial&#xD;
      species and strains. Participants in the study will provide one stool sample during visit 2&#xD;
      of the study and another during visit 4 of the study. Stool samples will be self-collected&#xD;
      using a clean catching receptacle (e.g. plastic inverted hat) and plastic scoop to transfer&#xD;
      feces into 6 sterile tubes.&#xD;
