      Percutaneous cholecystostomy is a minimally invasive technique for treatment of&#xD;
      cholecystitis. The cholecystostomy can be inserted transhepatically or transabdominally. The&#xD;
      transhepatic route is preferred due to lower risk for bile leakage. The drainage decompresses&#xD;
      the gallbladder and drains the bile. This decompression reduces the inflammatory process in&#xD;
      the gallbladder. Percutaneous cholecystostomy is often applied in patients not fit for&#xD;
      emergency surgery who are in need of intervention due to deterioration of their clinical&#xD;
      status. However, even though cholecystostomy is widely practised, it is not fully evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percutaneous cholecystostomy has a high success rate, a low procedure-related mortality but a&#xD;
      30 day mortality of 15%. Furthermore, recurrence rates within one year after a&#xD;
      cholecystostomy are reported to range between 4 to 22%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time duration of the drainage differ between different studies and range from three to&#xD;
      six weeks. Optimal timing for drainage has not been studied. Two weeks seem to be sufficient&#xD;
      for a maturation of the tract for the transhepatic route and 3 weeks for the transabdominal&#xD;
      route. It has been suggested that a prolonged drainage duration is associated with increased&#xD;
      risk for recurrence of inflammation due to local irritation of the gallbladder mucosa by the&#xD;
      drain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percutaneous cholecystostomy is often considered as a bridge to surgery. However, less than&#xD;
      half of patients treated with PC are treated with cholecystectomy. This suggests that this&#xD;
      treatment is often chosen in a group not fit for surgery and often turns out to be a&#xD;
      definitive treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percutaneous gallbladder aspiration is a technique used for purposes similar to percutaneous&#xD;
      cholecystostomy. This technique is an alternative that may be more convenient than&#xD;
      percutaneous cholecystostomy. The aspiration is performed with a small gauge needle under&#xD;
      ultrasound guidance without leaving a drain. The aspiration leads to a decompression of the&#xD;
      gallbladder, which facilitates recovery. However, it has only been described in a few studies&#xD;
      and need more evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One single aspiration may be sufficient to relief symptoms for the majority of patients, but&#xD;
      if two aspirations are performed the success rate increases substantially. One randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial has been presented where PC is compared to gallbladder aspiration. In this&#xD;
      trial PC was superior to gallbladder aspiration in terms of effectiveness. In this trail,&#xD;
      however, only one aspiration was performed. No major complications occurred in either group&#xD;
      and minor complications were equal between the groups. In a retrospective study comparing&#xD;
      aspiration with PC it was found that gallbladder aspiration is safer than PC and has a&#xD;
      comparable clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is believed that single decompressions are sufficient for reduction of the intraluminal&#xD;
      pressure. Only a minority of patients have positive bile cultures which, indicates that&#xD;
      infection is not a key mechanism in development of cholecystitis, which indicates that a&#xD;
      continuous drainage may not be necessary. As lower rates of complications are reported for&#xD;
      aspiration due to usage of smaller needle and no drain left that can dislocate and cause bile&#xD;
      leakage which is feared complication of PC. It is suggested that PC can have a role as a&#xD;
      salvage method when aspiration is not successful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to compare percutaneous cholecystostomy and leaving a drain in situ with&#xD;
      percutaneous gallbladder aspiration we plan to undertake a double-blind randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
