  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM) is an idiopathic disease affecting approximately 3% of the world&#xD;
      population, primarily diagnosed in middle-aged women. Although FM is mainly characterized by&#xD;
      chronic pain and fatigue, reduced muscular strength and flexibility are common symptoms&#xD;
      associated with the presentation of the disorder. Interestingly, the etiology and underlying&#xD;
      mechanism of FM are not completely understood, but previous findings suggest that autonomic&#xD;
      dysfunction may explain some of the FM symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to age-matched healthy individuals, patients with FM have an attenuated autonomic&#xD;
      function which is associated with a reduction in vagal tone and increase in sympathetic&#xD;
      activity. Therefore, autonomic function is a worthwhile target intervention in individuals&#xD;
      with FM. Although traditional exercise ( both aerobic and resistance) has been shown to&#xD;
      effectively improve HRV parameters and FM symptoms, most FM patients display a decline in&#xD;
      adherence to traditional exercise and continue to experience considerable pain and fatigue&#xD;
      years after the original diagnosis ultimately requiring medication to control their&#xD;
      symptoms.Thus, new approaches are needed to improve autonomic function and clinical symptoms&#xD;
      in patients with FM, which will ultimately improve their physical and emotional functioning&#xD;
      leading to a better quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tai Chi (TC) is a form of ancient Chinese martial art which integrates slow movements,&#xD;
      controlled breathing and mental concentration. TC training is safe for special populations&#xD;
      and has previously shown to decrease pain, fatigue as well as other FM related&#xD;
      symptoms.However, the potential role of TC training on autonomic function is largely&#xD;
      unexplored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis is that 12 weeks of TC training would improve our primary&#xD;
      outcome of autonomic function through improvements in sympathovagal balance, and the&#xD;
      secondary outcomes measures of FM symptoms (pain, fatigue and sleep quality), strength and&#xD;
      flexibility.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of 12 weeks of TC training on on cardiac&#xD;
      autonomic function, FM symptoms (pain, fatigue and sleep quality), strength and flexibility.&#xD;
      The specific aim of the study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the effects of 12 weeks of TC training on autonomic function arterial function&#xD;
      by assessing heart rate variability&#xD;
