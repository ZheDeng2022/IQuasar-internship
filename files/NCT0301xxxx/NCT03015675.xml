  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Linus Pauling and Dr Ewan Cameron have published two retrospective studies about using high&#xD;
      dose vitamin C to treat cancer patients forty years ago. Their studies have shown that high&#xD;
      dose vitamin C usage could significantly prolong overall survival of patients with advanced&#xD;
      cancer. Recently, preclinical study has shown that human colorectal cancer cells harboring&#xD;
      KRAS or BRAF mutations are selectively killed by high levels of ascorbic acid (AA). High dose&#xD;
      of AA impairs tumor growth in Apc/KRASG12D mutant mice. Previous phaseⅠclinical trials have&#xD;
      found that high dose (1.5g/kg or 90g/m2) iv AA is well tolerated in cancer patients. This&#xD;
      protocol is a phase Ⅲ, study of ascorbic acid (AA) infusions combined with treatment with&#xD;
      mFOLOX6 versus mFOLOX6 alone as first-line therapy in patients with recurrent or advanced&#xD;
      gastric cancer.&#xD;
