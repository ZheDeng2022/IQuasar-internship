  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recent finding that early introduction of peanut can prevent ~70-90% of peanut allergy is&#xD;
      a major step towards prevention of food allergy. However, because that finding was from a&#xD;
      clinical trial in a very select population, there are several major questions that must be&#xD;
      answered in order to implement these findings into clinical practice without causing more&#xD;
      harm than good. These questions include who, if anyone, should be screened prior to early&#xD;
      introduction for peanut allergy, how this screening should be done, and what quantity of&#xD;
      peanut ingestion is needed to prevent peanut allergy. The goal of this project is to answer&#xD;
      these critical questions so that the potential of these recent findings can be realized. To&#xD;
      that end, 400 infants at high-risk of peanut allergy will be enrolled. These infants will be&#xD;
      given a peanut skin prick test, peanut food challenge and have blood drawn for measurement of&#xD;
      peanut IgE, and then will be followed for assessment of peanut consumption and development of&#xD;
      peanut allergy until 3 years of age.&#xD;

      400 infants aged 4-11 months from three high risk groups will be enrolled in a prospective&#xD;
      observational study. All subjects will have a baseline research clinic visit, where they will&#xD;
      be given a peanut skin prick test, peanut food challenge and have blood drawn for measurement&#xD;
      of peanut immunoglobulin E (IgE). Based on the baseline oral food challenge, the participants&#xD;
      will be advised to begin introducing peanut following the current practice guidelines.&#xD;
      Participants will then be followed until 30 months of age with two clinic visits and regular&#xD;
      monitoring of peanut consumption.&#xD;
