      Robust I study is a feasibility study for evaluating the safety and efficacy of DCB.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to determine the safety and effectiveness for drug coated balloon&#xD;
      (DCB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 50 subjects is planned to be enrolled and treated with the study device at up to 5&#xD;
      clinical sites outside of US. Due to significantly higher prevalence of strictures in men vs.&#xD;
      women and the etiology of those strictures being different, the study will focus on male&#xD;
      subjects with single anterior urethral stricture. Subjects will be followed up post-treatment&#xD;
      to one year and then annually for up to 5 years. The annual follow up after the first year is&#xD;
      optional.&#xD;
