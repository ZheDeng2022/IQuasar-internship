    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a clinical Decision Aid that will help patients and&#xD;
      providers determine if pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the right decision. The Decision&#xD;
      Aid will be tested in both clinical and non-clinical settings with 80 patient-provider dyads.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the use of the Decision Aid will reduce patient decisional&#xD;
      conflict. The investigators predict that it will increase patient and provider knowledge of&#xD;
      and intent to initiate PrEP.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess if a clinical Decision Aid (DA) that integrates a&#xD;
      decision-support tool for patients and a risk-prediction tool for providers can facilitate&#xD;
      shared decision making (SDM) and reduce decisional conflict regarding pre-exposure&#xD;
      prophylaxis (PrEP) use. The patient tool was developed through an iterative process using the&#xD;
      Ottawa Decision Support Framework (ODSF). The provider tool is a validated model that uses&#xD;
      patient-reported data to estimate HIV risk for individual men who have sex with men (MSM).&#xD;
      The DA includes information on the harms associated with HIV, a list of treatment options,&#xD;
      which includes doing nothing, a patient's individualized risk of acquiring HIV, positive and&#xD;
      negative features of PrEP, exercises to clarify patient values, and interactive exercises to&#xD;
      help patients weight the risks and benefits of PrEP use. The Health Communications Core at&#xD;
      the Dana-Farber Cancer Center, a Core that receives NIH funding to provide web-design&#xD;
      services to Harvard-affiliated investigators, is building a web-based version of the Decision&#xD;
      Aid under the investigator's direction, as the investigators have learned from qualitative&#xD;
      research that patients and providers would prefer a web-based version. Presentation of the&#xD;
      DA's content will be done in a manner to enhance comprehension and minimize bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DA will be tested with 20 patient-provider dyads to determine acceptability, and then an&#xD;
      additional 60 provider-dyad visits will be conducted. The study will involve Boston-area MSM&#xD;
      and primary care providers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and Fenway Health.&#xD;
      The investigators believe it will be important to capture the perspectives of clinicians at&#xD;
      Fenway (which specializes in the care of sexual and gender minorities), BIDMC (a large,&#xD;
      academic medical center), as well as those who practice at other clinical sites in the&#xD;
      community who may be less knowledgeable about and experienced with PrEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To pilot test the DA, MSM-provider dyads will be scheduled for a simulated 20 minute clinic&#xD;
      visit at BIDMC or Fenway Health. Providers will complete a verbal consent procedure prior to&#xD;
      the visit. Providers will be emailed the Decision Aid for review, as well as a pre-study&#xD;
      questionnaire to complete on their own time.MSM will arrive 60 minutes before the visit. At&#xD;
      this time, the MSM participant will complete an informed consent procedure followed by a&#xD;
      brief demographic and behavioral survey. The survey will be administered using either pen and&#xD;
      paper or a web-based format. This survey will be reviewed by a study staff member to confirm&#xD;
      eligibility. MSM Participants will then have the opportunity to view the DA before meeting&#xD;
      with providers. Using a computer or touch screen tablet, both the participant and provider&#xD;
      will complete the DA, which will be online, and enter the patient-reported data that are&#xD;
      needed for the risk-prediction tool. The website will not store any answers to the questions&#xD;
      in the DA. The questions that are used to obtain these sensitive data will be presented in a&#xD;
      culturally-sensitive manner. Both MSM participant and provider will be able to explore the DA&#xD;
      website, which will include information about HIV, PrEP and next steps for providers that are&#xD;
      interested in prescribing PrEP. After the visit, MSM and providers will complete&#xD;
      acceptability surveys and brief exit interviews with a member of the study staff.&#xD;
      Acceptability will be pre-specified as &gt;70% of participants and providers indicating that the&#xD;
      DA is acceptable for use. Based on the surveys and feedback, the investigators will refine&#xD;
      the DA, website content, and visit process in preparation for testing with an additional 60&#xD;
      dyads. If the MSM participant is interested in learning more about the study, staff will&#xD;
      provide instructions to access information about PrEP on the Fenway Institute's website. If a&#xD;
      participant would also like to speak to a healthcare professional about obtaining a&#xD;
      prescription for PrEP, the study staff will recommend scheduling a visit with a provider at&#xD;
      Fenway Health or the BIDMC Infectious Disease clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once acceptability has been established, and additional 60 MSM-provider dyads will be&#xD;
      scheduled either for a simulated or in-clinic 20 minute visit at BIDMC or Fenway Health,&#xD;
      depending on availability of providers during clinic hours. These visits will follow the same&#xD;
      protocol as the pilot testing visits, with possible adjustments made based on pilot testing&#xD;
      feedback. In addition to the initial study visit, there will be a 3 month follow up survey&#xD;
      provided to MSM participants. This survey will be available online through RedCap, and the&#xD;
      link to complete the survey will be emailed to MSM participants. Alternatively, participants&#xD;
      can complete these surveys in person or by phone according to their preferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming a standard deviation of 12 for both pre- and post-DA primary outcome measures of&#xD;
      Decisional Conflict Scale scores, a null hypothesis of no difference in pairs pre- and&#xD;
      post-DA, a 2-sided significance level of 0.05, and correlation of 0.23 between pre- and&#xD;
      post-DA scores, and adjusting sample size for non-parametric test (using worst case of 86.5%&#xD;
      efficiency) in case of non-normal data, a sample size of 60 MSM (each with a pair of&#xD;
      evaluations pre- and post-DA) will provide approximately 80% power to detect a difference&#xD;
      between pre- and post-DA scores of 6 (~1/2 SD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptability surveys will be analyzed with descriptive statistics to determine the&#xD;
      percentage of participants who find the DA to be acceptable. The paired t-test (or Wilcoxon&#xD;
      Signed Rank test if data are non-normal) will be used to determine if there are changes in&#xD;
      the following measures pre- and post-use of the DA: (1) MSM Decisional Conflict Scale scores;&#xD;
      (2) MSM and provider knowledge; (3) intentions to initiate PrEP; (4) decisional regret; and&#xD;
      (5) sexual risk behaviors. The proportion of MSM reporting HIV or sexually transmitted&#xD;
      disease testing in the 3 months prior to use of the DA will be compared to the proportion who&#xD;
      report testing in the 3 months after use of the DA using a paired (1-sample) exact test of&#xD;
      rate/proportion against the null value of 0. Kruskal-Wallis tests (multi-group extension to&#xD;
      Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test) will be used to determine if the distribution of post-DA Decisional&#xD;
      Conflict Scale scores differs between/among groups defined by level of adherence.&#xD;
