      Morning hyperglycemia plays a role in the future development of insulin resistance and type 2&#xD;
      diabetes (T2D) (8) and is associated with numerous microvascular and cardiovascular&#xD;
      complications and renal disease. These augmented morning glucose levels are due to an&#xD;
      elevated endogenous glucose production (EGP), as a result of a loss of coordination between&#xD;
      glucose levels and insulin secretion, and possibly hyperglucagonemia during the overnight&#xD;
      period. Exercise stimulates glucose uptake and increases insulin sensitivity acutely, and may&#xD;
      be the best lifestyle intervention to minimize the nocturnal rise in glucose levels.&#xD;
      Prescription of the timing of exercise relative to a meal and/or to the overnight period may&#xD;
      be particularly critical for individuals that have impaired fasting glucose (IFG) levels.&#xD;
      Surprisingly little is known about the overnight period when elevated EGP and the synchrony&#xD;
      between glucose and c-peptide/glucagon levels becomes disturbed. This novel study will&#xD;
      provide insight into the hormonal/metabolic milieu of a dinner meal, the evening and&#xD;
      overnight period that occurs in non-obese, OB and OB+IFG individuals; it will also establish&#xD;
      if the timing of exercise can attenuate nocturnal glucose elevations, and if this is&#xD;
      associated with improved hormonal synchrony. This project will compare EGP, β-cell function&#xD;
      and hormonal responses between morning and evening exercise on the postprandial and overnight&#xD;
      period in obese individuals with/without IFG levels. Fifty-four subjects will be studied&#xD;
      during the evening meal (EGP and β-cell function), postprandially and through the overnight&#xD;
      period (1600-0700 h), allowing us to examine some of the potential mechanisms for the&#xD;
      elevation in overnight glucose levels. This is the first study that will examine this issue&#xD;
      from pre-dinner through the night while previous studies have only examined chronically&#xD;
      fasted individuals and this study will lay the groundwork for understanding the pathology of&#xD;
      the predawn phenomena in OB+IFG individuals. These potentially translational findings may&#xD;
      impact the efficiency of physician communication to patients concerning exercise. These&#xD;
      investigators are one of the few groups that study subjects through the overnight period and&#xD;
      have the facilities and capability to do this research.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D), chronically elevated glucose and insulin levels&#xD;
      result in numerous health complications. Maintaining tight glucose control is difficult for&#xD;
      individuals with T2D, particularly in the postprandial period and in the morning period just&#xD;
      prior to waking. In the postprandial period, the combined effect of insulin resistance and&#xD;
      beta cell dysfunction results in a prolonged elevation in glucose levels, and augmented&#xD;
      insulin levels in an attempt to reduce the circulating glucose levels. In the overnight&#xD;
      period, there is evidence of enhanced endogenous glucose production and of a disruption of&#xD;
      the interaction between glucose levels and insulin secretion. Early work in individuals with&#xD;
      T2D demonstrated that with continued fasting, glucose levels stopped declining in the evening&#xD;
      and subsequently rose throughout the night to reach a morning maximum, and this elevation&#xD;
      persisted till noon. Additionally these authors demonstrated that insulin levels and insulin&#xD;
      secretion rates did not parallel the nocturnal glucose changes in individuals with T2D, while&#xD;
      in the controls the nocturnal glucose and insulin secretion rates coincided. Evidence is also&#xD;
      emerging that hyperglucagonemia may be occurring in the setting of deficient insulin&#xD;
      secretion, and may be playing a role in the elevated postprandial glucose levels and in the&#xD;
      overnight period. These studies provide preliminary evidence that there is disruption in the&#xD;
      fine coordination between glucose levels and glucagon and insulin secretion, and that this is&#xD;
      exacerbated more in the overnight period than during the waking hours. Previous studies&#xD;
      examining the overnight period have been conducted following prolonged fasting (~24-34 h),&#xD;
      however, most people do not fast for extended periods of time prior to going to bed.&#xD;
      Additionally, individuals with T2D often know that meal composition the evening prior can&#xD;
      exacerbate the elevated fasting glucose levels the following morning, thus highlighting the&#xD;
      need to examine the effect of meal composition on overnight glucose control. To date, very&#xD;
      little is known about the pathology of why fasting glucose levels are elevated in many obese&#xD;
      individuals. There appears to be asynchrony between glucose and insulin levels in the&#xD;
      overnight period but very little research has focused on this phenomenon or how meal&#xD;
      composition affects overnight glucose levels. This study will provide evidence of potential&#xD;
      mechanisms for the elevation in overnight glucose levels and the findings will be&#xD;
      translatable for individuals with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) levels to understand the&#xD;
      importance of meal composition in the evening period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine the hormonal responses (glucagon, c-peptide, insulin, incretins) in response&#xD;
           to a meal in the postprandial period and the synchronization between glucose and&#xD;
           insulin/glucagon during the overnight period in non-obese individuals and obese&#xD;
           individuals with impaired fasting glucose levels (IFG).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if the meal composition (standard meal: 55% carbohydrate, 20% protein, 25%&#xD;
           fat vs. high fat/fructose: 40% carbohydrate- 25% fructose, 40% fat, 20% protein) will&#xD;
           alter the hormonal responses (glucagon, insulin, incretin) in the postprandial period,&#xD;
           and if this change in meal composition will impact glucagon levels and glucose/c-peptide&#xD;
           synchrony in the overnight period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design: Subjects will participate three times; 1) no exercise, 2) 2 hr post&#xD;
      dinner exercise, and 3) morning exercise (~7am). The order in which subjects undergo each&#xD;
      treatment will be randomized prior to study enrollment. Eligible subjects will initially&#xD;
      undergo baseline testing for assessment of body composition, exercise stress test and blood&#xD;
      screening. All subjects will have impaired fasting glucose levels. All subjects will undergo&#xD;
      3 study days that will start at ~1600 h and continue until 0700 h the following morning. They&#xD;
      will receive a standard meal (55% carbohydrate, 20% protein, 25% fat) at 1800 h and blood&#xD;
      samples will be taken from ~4:30 pm until 7 am.&#xD;
