      We aim to show that systematic ultrasonography performed in ventilated patients suspected of&#xD;
      ventilation-acquired pneumonia could improve the accuracy of diagnostic of pneumonia, and&#xD;
      helps defining the diagnostic of tracheobronchitis when lower respiratory tract infection is&#xD;
      considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest CT scan is often performed before or just after admission in ICU, and usually show&#xD;
      abnormalities that are revealed later on standard radiographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This last exam is traditionally considered as the gold standard to prove new pulmonary&#xD;
      infiltrates, but the correlation with parenchymal consolidation is pretty low, and lead to&#xD;
      over-diagnosing pneumonia, thus leading to a massive and maybe sometimes unconsidered&#xD;
      prescription of antibiotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung ultrasonography conducted systematically within the 3 first days after suspcion of&#xD;
      pneumonia could help making the difference between real infection-linked lesions, and banal&#xD;
      abnormalities following the hydric inflation of intra-thoracic organs, for instance pulmonary&#xD;
      edema or pleural effusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent evaluation using lung ultrasound, and analysis of CT scan acquisition when&#xD;
      performed, compared with the physician in charge of the patient appreciation by suggesting&#xD;
      him to provide his own probability of pneumonia upon routine clinical and biological datas.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diagnostic of VAP and tracheobronchitis is often difficult in UC under mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, and usually occuring quite early after initial phase of hemodynamic instability,&#xD;
      and characterized by needs of massive fluids supports and drugs infusion. The goldstandard is&#xD;
      still standard chest X-ray, providing a picture of the whole abnormalities due to cardiac&#xD;
      failure, and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The high rate of water in chest of the patients&#xD;
      under ventilation assistance and hemodynamic support is responsible of a misinterpretation of&#xD;
      the abnormalities visualized on the radiographs. It is often considered that Lung&#xD;
      ultrasonography is useful to appreciate the involvement of pleural effusion, explaning&#xD;
      etiologies of hypoxemia, where cardiac failure is excluded by the simultaneous&#xD;
      ultrasonographic evaluation. However, it is not well recognized that pulmonary parenchyma can&#xD;
      be explored through echography, and that it provides a lot of information about the amount of&#xD;
      liquid inside it, and the default of aeration. Thus, it can in real time help the physician&#xD;
      to guide the therapeutics and manage the ventilation better. Moreover, the suspicion of&#xD;
      infection, clinically and biologically leads to the early prescription of antibiotics, given&#xD;
      that the radiography is abnormal. Knowing that there is now parenchymal consolidation but&#xD;
      rather effusion or a certain degree of pulmonary edema could help avoiding treating falsely a&#xD;
      respiratory infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same thoughts can be held concerning Chest CT Scan, an exam often realized at the early&#xD;
      stage of management in a critical situation. We can take for granted that when occurring in&#xD;
      the 48 first hours of resuscitation, this exam shows in a certain number of cases preexisting&#xD;
      abnormalities, that are revealed severla hours later by Chest radiograph, when the suspicion&#xD;
      of respiratory infection acquired under ventilation emerge. If we take into account that&#xD;
      these abnormalities seen on radiographs are just correlated to those that could be seen on&#xD;
      CT, but with a certain delay, and are not de novo, it could lead to an overestimating of&#xD;
      ventilation acquired pneumonia, because the criteria of a new radiographic infiltrate won't&#xD;
      be valid anymore. The diagnostic of tracheobronchitis could then be more appropriated in a&#xD;
      certain number of situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim is to verify retrospectively by an adjudication committee, that this early CT Scan,&#xD;
      within the 2 first days after admission if patient is ventilated and/or suspicion of lower&#xD;
      respiratory tract infection, and a systematic lung ultrasonographic evaluation, provided by&#xD;
      an independent operator, could change our appreciation of the frequency of&#xD;
      ventilation-acquired pneumonia, comparing to the appreciation of th physician in charge of&#xD;
      the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are thus conducting a repeated evaluation, at day 0, day 3 and day 7 with ultrasonography,&#xD;
      in order to give a probability of pneumonia or tracheobronchitis by the echographist&#xD;
      operator, and suggesting the physician to give his own probability based on clinical and&#xD;
      biological routine datas. We then measure the rate of agreement between the two parts, to see&#xD;
      how far the systematic evaluation using pleural ultrasonography could help defining the&#xD;
      probability of infection, and validating the diagnostic of pneumonia. The impact should be to&#xD;
      improve the accuracy within the first days 2 or 3 days after suspicion, when repeated, if&#xD;
      possible by the same operator. One of the main benefit could be the reduction or better&#xD;
      reevaluation of antibiotic therapy, if diagnostic of pneumonia is rejected secondary,&#xD;
      eventually shorter course of treatment could be chosen, even if this point deserve to be&#xD;
      evaluated in further studies.&#xD;
