      The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of naloxone (IV or IM administration) and&#xD;
      methylnaltrexone (subcutaneous administration) on esophageal sensitivity, in a group of&#xD;
      healthy volunteers in order to evaluate the role of endogenous opiods in symptom perception&#xD;
      in gastro-esophageal reflux disease. Esophageal sensitivity was assessed by using a&#xD;
      multimodal esophageal stimulation protocol where sensitivity to thermal, mechanical,&#xD;
      electrical and chemical stimulation was tested.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), defined as the presence of symptoms or&#xD;
      lesions that can be attributed to the reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus, is an&#xD;
      increasingly prevalent condition in Western societies. The most typical symptoms are&#xD;
      heartburn and regurgitation, but GERD can manifest itself through a variety of esophageal and&#xD;
      extra-esophageal symptoms (e.g. chronic cough).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In humans, pain is a multimodal experience composted of sensory, physiological and&#xD;
      psychological aspects. In order to mimic the clinical situation, experimental models should&#xD;
      be based on multimodal testing regimens in which different receptors and central nervous&#xD;
      system mechanisms are activated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advances in esophageal sensory stimulation have established that both typical and atypical&#xD;
      symptoms may not only arise from acid reflux, but also from reflux events with less acidic pH&#xD;
      (pH 4-7). In GERD patients with symptoms that persist in spite of PPIs, ongoing weakly acidic&#xD;
      reflux is now well established as the main underlying factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basis for symptom generation during weakly-acidic reflux events remains to be determined,&#xD;
      but acid sensitivity in the pH range 4-7, mechanical distention (enhanced by air in the&#xD;
      refluxate), sensitivity to other chemical factors (e.g. bile) and esophageal hypersensitivity&#xD;
      to physiological levels of reflux have all been proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS The investigators speculated that visceral hypersensitivity plays an important&#xD;
      role in symptom perception. This is suggested by the reflux parameters that are usual within&#xD;
      the physiological number during PPI therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Naloxone is indicated for the complete reversal of opioid depression, including respiratory&#xD;
      depression, induced by natural and synthetic opioids. Naloxone is also indicated for&#xD;
      diagnosis of suspected or known acute opiod overdosage. Off label it is also used for&#xD;
      alcoholic coma, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, opioid addiction and narcotic induced&#xD;
      pruritis. Methylnaltrexone bromide (Relistor) is indicated for the treatment of&#xD;
      opioid-induced constipation in patients with advanced illness who are receiving palliative&#xD;
      care, when response to laxative therapy has not been sufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of naloxone (IV or IM administration)&#xD;
      and methylnaltrexone (subcutaneous administration) on esophageal sensitivity, in a group of&#xD;
      healthy volunteers in order to evaluate the role of endogenous opiods in symptom perception&#xD;
      in gastro-esophageal reflux disease..&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Studies were performed in 12 healthy volunteers, to have sufficient data to compare&#xD;
      subjects mutual and to be able to make conclusions. Since this concerns measurements with&#xD;
      drugs that were never tested in this field of work, the investigators did not have&#xD;
      information regarding esophageal sensitivity after administration of these different&#xD;
      substances. Because of previous experience with these types of measurements (i.c. multimodal&#xD;
      stimulation with other substances), the investigators concluded that a number of 12 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers was sufficient to detect a 30% difference with a 5% significance level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For safety reasons, subjects were prohibited to drive a vehicle or work with heavy machinery&#xD;
      on the day of the study. Each subject that was willing to participate was submitted to a&#xD;
      physical examination. Medical history was taken and the use of medication was inquired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies were performed using a multimodal esophageal stimulation probe which allows chemical,&#xD;
      mechanical, electrical and thermal stimulations of the esophagus in one single protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each stimulation, subjects were instructed to record perception of symptoms using an&#xD;
      electronic VAS meter. This device allows the subject to scale perception and pain on a scale&#xD;
      from 0 to 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First perception (VAS=1), pain perception threshold (VAS=5) and pain tolerance threshold&#xD;
      (VAS=7) were recorded. All types of esophageal stimulations were immediately terminated when&#xD;
      the pain tolerance threshold was reached. At the time when the pain tolerance threshold was&#xD;
      reached (VAS=7), the subjects were asked to draw the referred pain area, to identify where&#xD;
      the pain was located.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thermal stimulation Thermal stimulation was performed by re-circulating a saline solution&#xD;
      (NaCl 0.09%), heated by a water bath, through the balloon mounted on the probe. Stimulation&#xD;
      temperature was steadily increased by increasing the flow rate from the water bath to the&#xD;
      balloon. Flow rate will be controlled by a computer operated pump. The volume in the balloon&#xD;
      was kept constant at 5ml to avoid mechanical stimulation of the esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A temperature sensor present in the balloon montinuously monitored the stimulation&#xD;
      temperature, which was displayed on a computer display throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical stimulation Mechanical stimulation was performed by distention of the balloon&#xD;
      mounted on the probe. The flow of saline (NaCl 0.09%) into the balloon, inducing the&#xD;
      distention, was regulated by a computer controlled pump. The volume in the balloon was&#xD;
      displayed on the computer screen throughout the stimulation. Mechanical stimulations were&#xD;
      performed with water of 37°C, to avoid thermal stimulation of the esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical stimulation was preceded by a preconditioning period during which the balloon was&#xD;
      distended until the pain perception threshold (VAS=5) was reached. This preconditioning&#xD;
      period was used to precondition the esophageal tissue and to allow the subject to get used to&#xD;
      the feeling of mechanical distention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrical stimulation Electrical stimulation was performed by 2 stimulation electrodes&#xD;
      mounted on proximal to the balloon. Electrical block pulses were given using a standard&#xD;
      electrical stimulator. Single burst pulses were given with duration of 1ms at 200Hz. The&#xD;
      amplitude of the pulses was steadily increased, with steps of 0.5mA and an interval of 15sec.&#xD;
      The maximum intensity is limited to 60 mA, as previous studies have shown atrial capturing&#xD;
      with higher intensities. ECG monitoring was performed as a safety measure during the&#xD;
      electrical stimulations of the esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemical stimulation Chemical stimulation was performed in distal esophagus by infusing an&#xD;
      acidic solution (HCl 0.1N) in the esophagus. Chemical stimulations were controlled by a&#xD;
      peristaltic infusion pump with a flow rate of 2ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Naloxone/Methylnaltrexone or placebo administration As test solutions, naloxone (bolus of 0.4&#xD;
      mg followed by continuous infusion 20 µg/kg/h) or methylnaltrexone bromide (12 mg s.c.,&#xD;
      Relistor 0.6ml administrated subcutaneously) were administered. During placebo sessions, a&#xD;
      physiological solution (saline 0.9%), was administered IV and SC. Over time, each participant&#xD;
      received placebo or naloxone or methylnaltrexone bromide in the first session in a random&#xD;
      sequence. In the second and third session, the subject received one of the other products&#xD;
      that he/she did not receive the first time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OUTLINE After an overnight fast subjects were expected at the endoscopy unit of the UZ&#xD;
      Gasthuisberg, where the study was performed. Three sessions were scheduled for every subject:&#xD;
      one placebo, one naloxone session and one methylnaltrexone session, with at least one week&#xD;
      interval between each of them. Sessions were run in a double blind way, as far as the placebo&#xD;
      or drugs are concerned. The order of placebo and drug administration was randomized by&#xD;
      drawing cards from a box of cards determining the sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteer received placebo, naloxone or methylnaltrexone at the beginning of the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multimodal stimulation probe was positioned through the mouth. After the probe was&#xD;
      positioned in the esophagus, it was fixed to the chin and the subject remained in a bed, in&#xD;
      semi-recumbent position for the entire study period. Esophageal stimulation was performed&#xD;
      immediately after intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the actual stimulations started, there was an adaptation period for the subjects, to&#xD;
      get used to the feeling of the probe and to provide instructions for the correct use of the&#xD;
      VAS meter since VAS scores were monitored during each type of stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All stimulations were immediately stopped at the moment the subject reached the pain&#xD;
      tolerance threshold (VAS=7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS Temperature, volume, and electrical current will be measured at VAS=1 (first&#xD;
      perception), VAS=5 (pain perception threshold) and VAS=7 (pain tolerance threshold) and were&#xD;
      used to determine esophageal sensitivity. Esophageal sensitivity for the four different&#xD;
      stimuli (temperature, mechanical, electrical and chemical) were compared between the three&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
