      Melatonin is well known for its role in the sleep-wake cycle but it is less well known as an&#xD;
      effective antioxidant. It has been reported to be synthesised in the placenta and may have&#xD;
      both receptor mediated and non-receptor mediated protective functions during pregnancy.&#xD;
      Severe pre-eclampsia has been reported to be associated with low levels of melatonin in the&#xD;
      placenta although it is not known if the placental melatonin contributes to circulating&#xD;
      levels. There is little reported on the circulating levels of melatonin or oxidative stress&#xD;
      at different stages of normal pregnancy. More information on the role of melatonin and&#xD;
      metabolism of melatonin in pregnancy as well as any significant association with adverse&#xD;
      pregnancy outcomes would inform planning of larger research studies to investigate the&#xD;
      potential role for melatonin as a biomarker for obstetric disease and potentially as a&#xD;
      therapeutic agent in future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational pilot study aims to measure serum melatonin levels and 6-hydroxymelatonin&#xD;
      sulphate (the major metabolite of melatonin) during each trimester of pregnancy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Melatonin, a substance produced by the pineal gland, is well known for its role in the&#xD;
      sleep-wake cycle but it is less well known as an effective antioxidant. It is able to access&#xD;
      all parts of the cell, and can cross the blood-brain and placental barrier. Melatonin has&#xD;
      been reported to be synthesised in the placenta and may have both receptor mediated and&#xD;
      non-receptor mediated protective functions during pregnancy. Severe pre-eclampsia has been&#xD;
      reported to be associated with low levels of melatonin in the placenta although it is not&#xD;
      known if the placental melatonin contributes to circulating levels. Despite this, melatonin&#xD;
      levels have been proposed as a biomarker of pre-eclampsia. A further study suggested pregnant&#xD;
      women with hypertensive or diabetic conditions had lower melatonin levels and less circadian&#xD;
      variation, again suggesting the potential protective role melatonin may have during&#xD;
      pregnancy. Due to its antioxidant effects melatonin has also been proposed as a protective&#xD;
      substance for women undergoing assisted reproduction techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for study There is little reported on the circulating levels of melatonin or&#xD;
      oxidative stress at different stages of normal pregnancy. More information on the role of&#xD;
      melatonin and metabolism of melatonin in pregnancy as well as any significant association&#xD;
      with adverse pregnancy outcomes would inform planning of larger research studies to&#xD;
      investigate the potential role for melatonin as a bio-marker for obstetric disease and&#xD;
      potentially as a therapeutic agent in future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational pilot study aims to measure serum melatonin levels and 6-hydroxymelatonin&#xD;
      sulphate (the major metabolite of melatonin) during each trimester of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES Objectives Primary Objective To determine if serum melatonin and&#xD;
      6-hydroxymelatonin sulphate levels differ in each trimester of pregnancy and how these&#xD;
      compare to non-pregnant women Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine level of oxidative stress at time of serum sample by measuring lipid&#xD;
           peroxide levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore whether levels of serum melatonin and 6-hydroxymelatonin sulphate vary in&#xD;
           women who develop antenatal complications (pre-eclampsia or hypertensive diseases of&#xD;
           pregnancy, preterm labour or gestational diabetes)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES Primary Outcome Serum melatonin and 6-hydroxymelatonin sulphate levels Secondary&#xD;
      Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Level of oxidative stress at time of sampling (lipid peroxide levels)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Outcome of pregnancy (live birth or not, development of preeclampsia / hypertensive&#xD;
           disease of pregnancy, gestational diabetes or preterm labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN Study Description&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty healthy women in their first pregnancy will be recruited at their first antenatal&#xD;
      (scan) visit at 11-13 weeks gestation. Recruitment will continue throughout the medical&#xD;
      student's allocated project time period to allow recruitment of as many women as possible,&#xD;
      but at least twenty pregnant women. A venous blood sample to measure serum melatonin and&#xD;
      6-hydroxymelatonin sulphate levels will be obtained using aseptic technique. Sampling, when&#xD;
      possible, will be carried out at the same time as for routine clinical screening. The first&#xD;
      blood sample will be done at 11-13 weeks gestation (first trimester) and could be done along&#xD;
      with routine antenatal screening blood tests. A second blood sample will be taken when women&#xD;
      attend for their detailed ultrasound scan at approximately 20 weeks (2nd trimester). The&#xD;
      participant may not need other routine blood tests at this time, therefore this blood sample&#xD;
      would only be for the purpose of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third and final blood sample will be obtained at around 28 weeks gestation (third&#xD;
      trimester). This could be done at the routine 28 week appointment with the participant's&#xD;
      community midwife when routine pregnancy blood tests will already be undertaken. Consent will&#xD;
      be sought from the participant to contact the applicable community midwife to arrange to&#xD;
      attend the midwifery appointment at around 28 weeks. The third blood sample will be taken&#xD;
      either at Aberdeen Maternity Hospital or at the participant's GP practice depending on&#xD;
      preference and convenience of appointment location for the participant and community midwife.&#xD;
      The researchers will not contact the participant directly. If the woman is attending the&#xD;
      obstetric antenatal clinic at that gestation the blood sample could alternatively be obtained&#xD;
      there along with the routine antenatal screening blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-pregnant controls will be recruited by advertising using posters around the University of&#xD;
      Aberdeen/Aberdeen Royal Infirmary campus, aiming for 20 non pregnant women, aged between 16&#xD;
      and 45 to have blood samples taken for serum melatonin and 6-hydroxy-melatonin sulphate&#xD;
      levels. Samples will be taken at the same time of day and year as pregnant subjects to&#xD;
      account for any seasonal effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum melatonin will be measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and&#xD;
      6-hydroxymelatonin sulphate will be measured using enzyme immunoassay. Lipid peroxides will&#xD;
      be measured using a colorimetric assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. Women will be asked for&#xD;
      their age, body mass index, gestation stage, smoking status, name of their community midwife&#xD;
      and a series of screening questions to determine eligibility according to inclusion criteria.&#xD;
      Once recruited, an anonymous code will be assigned and all data will be kept separately from&#xD;
      identifiable information.&#xD;
