      The availability of novel therapies with DAAs might prompt clinicians caring for HSCT&#xD;
      recipients with HCV infection to prescribe the treatment more frequently and possibly earlier&#xD;
      after HSCT. Since numerous possible therapeutic combinations exist, the choice of the most&#xD;
      appropriate one is not straightforward. It depends not only on its efficacy, toxicity and&#xD;
      rate of pharmacological interactions, but also on availability (both through healthcare&#xD;
      system and in expanded access programs), and cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational prospective study will focus on treatment strategies in HSCT recipients&#xD;
      with HCV infection. The main focus will be the therapeutic approach, the combination of drugs&#xD;
      chosen, the length of treatment and the outcome. The main reasons for treating or not&#xD;
      treating HSCT recipients with HCV infection will be also explored. Compared to previous&#xD;
      cohorts, this study might provide additional data in the area of non-invasive assessment of&#xD;
      fibrosis, HCV-RNA levels and genotyping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to get as much data as possible on HCV treatment, patients with chronic HCV&#xD;
      infection transplanted during the last 10 years will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally the prevalence of HCV-RNA positive patients among those transplanted in the year 2016&#xD;
      will be reported.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to previous EBMT studies, approximately 6% of HSCT recipients were HCV-positive&#xD;
      (Locasciulli et al. Transplantation 1999). Despite the fact that HSCT recipients with chronic&#xD;
      HCV infection are prone to HCV-morbidity (end stage liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma,&#xD;
      the need for liver transplant), only about half (44% and 61%) of long term survivors of HSCT&#xD;
      were offered specific treatment (Ljungman et al. BMT 2012; Peffault de Latour et al. BMT&#xD;
      2005). The median time from HSCT to treatment was long and the efficacy was far from&#xD;
      satisfactory (approximately 50%) (Ljungman et al. BMT 2012). Since 2011 novel oral directly&#xD;
      acting antiviral agents (DAA) have been developed and marketed. DAAs offer the advantage of&#xD;
      higher efficacy, shorter duration and reduced treatment toxicity; together with the&#xD;
      possibility of exclusively oral, interferon- or interferon/ribavirin-free regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short description of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The availability of novel therapies with DAAs might prompt clinicians caring for HSCT&#xD;
      recipients with HCV infection to prescribe the treatment more frequently and possibly earlier&#xD;
      after HSCT. Since numerous possible therapeutic combinations exist, the choice of the most&#xD;
      appropriate one is not straightforward. It depends not only on its efficacy, toxicity and&#xD;
      rate of pharmacological interactions, but also on availability (both through healthcare&#xD;
      system and in expanded access programs), and cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational prospective study will focus on treatment strategies in HSCT recipients&#xD;
      with HCV infection. The main focus will be the therapeutic approach, the combination of drugs&#xD;
      chosen, the length of treatment and the outcome. The main reasons for treating or not&#xD;
      treating HSCT recipients with HCV infection will be also explored. Compared to previous&#xD;
      cohorts, this study might provide additional data in the area of non-invasive assessment of&#xD;
      fibrosis, HCV-RNA levels and genotyping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to get as much data as possible on HCV treatment, patients with chronic HCV&#xD;
      infection transplanted during the last 10 years will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally the prevalence of HCV-RNA positive patients among those transplanted in the year 2016&#xD;
      will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the period of 24 months, all HCV-RNA positive patients who received autologous or&#xD;
      allogeneic transplant from any time to May 2017 and are followed at transplant centres will&#xD;
      be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data regarding the patients who are receiving (or has recently received) HCV treatment (group&#xD;
      1) will be collected in Form 1 (FORM 1 - HCV TREATMENT) and 6 months after the end of&#xD;
      treatment in Form 4 (FORM 4 - POST HCV TREATMENT FOLLOW UP FORM)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data regarding the baseline characteristics of HCV-RNA positive patients who are not being&#xD;
      treated (group 2) will be collected in Form 2 (FORM 2 - HCV-RNA positive patients - BASELINE)&#xD;
      and then at the end of the recruitment period (December 2017 +/- 3 months) in Form 3 (FORM 3&#xD;
      - HCV-RNA positive patients - FOLLOW UP FORM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients from group 2 start treatment, their data thereafter should be reported in Form 1&#xD;
      and then Form 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Including: Duration of the study Recruitment period (visits date for HCV-RNA+ patients)&#xD;
      starts December 2015 till November 2017. All the patients will be followed for a minimum&#xD;
      additional period of 6 months from the end of recruitment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, in whom HCV treatment started before December 2015, will be also included if&#xD;
      followed during the study period with the aim of establishing the efficacy of the recent&#xD;
      HCV-treatment (HCV-RNA testing to establish SVR at 12 and 24 weeks after EOT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
