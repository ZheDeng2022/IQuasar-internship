  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II clinical trial aimed at evaluating the efficacy of PD-L1 inhibition with&#xD;
      atezolizumab in advanced squamous and non-squamous NSCLC patients previously treated with&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 therapy with either nivolumab or pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to account for the variability of response kinetics to PD-1 directed therapy,&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled in 3 parallel cohorts based on the best overall response to PD-1&#xD;
      directed therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1 (progressive disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2 (stable disease with minimum 12 weeks of therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3 (partial to complete response followed by progressive disease)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atezolizumab will be given on day 1 of a 21-day cycle at 1200 mg IV. Radiographic assessments&#xD;
      for disease response will occur every 6 weeks while on treatment. Confirmatory scans should&#xD;
      be obtained ≥ 4 weeks following initial documentation of objective response or progressive&#xD;
      disease on atezolizumab therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atezolizumab will be given as long as the patient continues to experience clinical benefit in&#xD;
      the opinion of the investigator or until unacceptable toxicity, symptomatic deterioration&#xD;
      attributed to disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for 12 months or until death as per standard of care after&#xD;
      discontinuation of Atezolizumab or until death, whichever occurs first.&#xD;

Any pathological lymph nodes (target or non-target) with reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Partial Response (PR): ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.

             given during influenza season only (approximately October to March). Patients must not&#xD;
             receive live, attenuated influenza vaccine (e.g., FluMist) within 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             enrollment, at any time during the study, or for 5 months after the last dose of&#xD;
             Atezolizumab.&#xD;

          -  Malignancies other than the disease under study within 5 years prior to Cycle 1, Day&#xD;
             1, with the exception of those with a negligible risk of metastasis or death and with&#xD;
             expected curative outcome (such as adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix,&#xD;
             basal or squamous cell skin cancer, localized prostate cancer treated surgically with&#xD;
             curative intent, or ductal carcinoma in situ treated surgically with curative intent)&#xD;
             or undergoing active surveillance per standard-of-care management (e.g., chronic&#xD;
             lymphocytic leukemia Rai Stage 0, prostate cancer with Gleason score equal to/less&#xD;
             than 6, and prostate-specific antigen equal to/less than10 mg/mL, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1 (or within&#xD;
             five half lives of the investigational product, whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medications (including but not limited to&#xD;
             prednisone, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and anti-tumor&#xD;
             necrosis factor [anti-TNF] agents) within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who have received acute, low dose, systemic immunosuppressant&#xD;
                  medications (e.g., a one-time dose of dexamethasone for nausea) may be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The use of inhaled corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone)&#xD;
                  for patients with orthostatic hypotension or adrenocortical insufficiency is&#xD;
                  allowed.&#xD;
