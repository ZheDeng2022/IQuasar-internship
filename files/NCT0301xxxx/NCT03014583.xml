  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Back and/or Leg Pain (CBLP) after spinal surgical procedures, a condition commonly&#xD;
      labelled Failed Back Surgery Syndrome (FBSS), affects between 15% and 40% of patients after a&#xD;
      spine surgery. Treatment of this chronic condition by further operation or medical management&#xD;
      has a heavy financial impact on health care systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have demonstrated the efficacy and economic value of Spinal Cord Stimulation&#xD;
      (SCS) for chronic neuropathic pain, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown SCS to&#xD;
      be a clinically effective adjunct to medical management. SCS has the advantages of being&#xD;
      reversible and less invasive than surgery and may cause fewer issues over time than long-term&#xD;
      pharmacological treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite variable levels of success in the literature, approximately 30-55% of the patients&#xD;
      treated with traditional SCS for neuropathic pain disorders will not receive adequate long&#xD;
      term pain relief. Therefore, technical SCS system refinements, as well as new techniques have&#xD;
      emerged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two new stimulation waveforms based on traditional SCS technology have appeared to further&#xD;
      optimize the outcome for specific painful conditions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Burst stimulation mode: which generates constant-current stimuli with 5 spikes at 500 Hz&#xD;
           per burst and pulse width and interspike intervals of 1 ms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High-frequency stimulation (from 1 to 10 kHz) mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have demonstrated the potential interest of these 2 new waveforms to treat&#xD;
      FBSS patients compared to traditional SCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Precision Spectra™ system allows MultiWave Technology by offering a broad spectrum of&#xD;
      waveform options (from Tonic Conventional Stimulation (TCS), BURST stimulation to High&#xD;
      Frequency stimulation (HF)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, literature data comparing these 3 stimulation patterns is lacking but it is&#xD;
      suggested the pain relief in some of non-responsive patients can be &quot;recaptured&quot; by&#xD;
      increasing the SCS frequency to 500 Hz by BURST stimulation or beyond by HF stimulation. It&#xD;
      seems important to conduct RCT in crossover, thanks to the new Precision SCS Stimulator, to&#xD;
      compare the effects of these 3 different SCS modalities in FBSS patients and to determine&#xD;
      which concept is the most effective in terms of pain reduction and energy consumption.&#xD;

    <description>EQ-5D is a generic quality of life scale that is not specific for low back pain. The scale comprises 5 questions assessing mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression.

    <description>The self-report measure Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) reflects a patient's belief about the efficacy of treatment. Although widely used in chronic pain clinical trials, PGIC's validity has not been formally assessed. PGIC is a 7 point scale depicting a patient's rating of overall improvement. Patients rate their change as &quot;very much improved,&quot; &quot;much improved,&quot; &quot;minimally improved,&quot; &quot;no change,&quot; &quot;minimally worse,&quot; &quot;much worse,&quot; or &quot;very much worse.&quot;</description>
