    <textblock>
      It is well documented that both balance and resistance training have the potential to&#xD;
      mitigate intrinsic fall risk factors in older adults. Recently, it was shown that a&#xD;
      simultaneously executed balance and resistance training, namely resistance training on uneven&#xD;
      surfaces is an eligible, effective and safe alternative training program to mitigate&#xD;
      intrinsic fall risk factors in older adults. However, knowledge about the effects of specific&#xD;
      adductor and abductor training has advantages over traditional resistance training and&#xD;
      resistance training on unstable surfaces regarding forward propulsion. Further, the effects&#xD;
      of different kinds of resistance training on cognition, especially embodiment is&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;

      Introduction: In the course of ageing, physical abilities decline and consequently there is&#xD;
      an increase in risk of falling and fall incidences. Notwithstanding, the fact that causes of&#xD;
      falls are multifactorial, losses in lower-extremity muscle strength, power and balance seem&#xD;
      to be the most prominent intrinsic (i.e., person-related) fall risk factors in older adults.&#xD;
      Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses highlighted the positive effects of resistance&#xD;
      and balance training when applied as a single means, on measures of leg muscle strength,&#xD;
      power and balance in older adults. Recently, it was shown that a simultaneously executed&#xD;
      balance and resistance training, namely resistance training on uneven surfaces is an&#xD;
      eligible, effective and safe alternative training program to mitigate intrinsic fall risk&#xD;
      factors in older adults. Based on several investigations, it can be safely assumed that&#xD;
      exercises conducted on unstable devices activate smaller muscles and stabilising function of&#xD;
      bigger muscle groups. This facilitates torque and power transfer from lower to upper&#xD;
      extremeties and is possibly responsible for similar effects as compared to stable resistance&#xD;
      training despite lower loads. However, it is unknown if resistance training targeting&#xD;
      adductor and abductor muscles induces similar results as compared to resistance training&#xD;
      conducted on uneven surfaces. Moreover, physical activity has proven to affect cognitive&#xD;
      measures positively, especially executive functions. It has yet to be determined to what&#xD;
      extent different kinds of resistance training affect executive functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/Design: This study is a three-arm, 10-week RCT with a 10-week no-contact follow-up.&#xD;
      Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to either: 1) machine-based stable resistance&#xD;
      training (M-SRT); 2) free-weight unstable resistance training (F-URT); 3) machine-based&#xD;
      adductor and abductor resistance training. The design and reporting of this study follows the&#xD;
      CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) 2010 Statement for parallel group&#xD;
      randomised trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting Participants are recruited from the communities in and around Kassel, Germany.&#xD;
      Screening visits, measurement sessions, and the interventions are held at the Insitute of&#xD;
      Sports and Sports Science / University of Kassel, Germany.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment strategies: Recruitment is carried out by placing 1) an advertisement in the&#xD;
      local newspaper, 2) during a public information meeting at the local town hall and 3) word of&#xD;
      mouth. Interested individuals contact the study coordinator by phone, where they are provided&#xD;
      with a brief description of the study. If responses suggest study eligibility then interested&#xD;
      individuals are invited to attend a formal in-person screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:Older adults are eligible if they: 1) are aged between 65 and 80 years old 2)&#xD;
      and able to walk independently for more than 10m. An a priori power analysis using G*Power&#xD;
      3.1 with an assumed type I error of .05 and a type II error of .10 (90% statistical power,&#xD;
      correlation among groups: .5, nonsphericity correction: 1) was computed to determine an&#xD;
      appropriate sample size to detect medium (.50 ≤ d ≤ .79) interaction effects. The&#xD;
      calculations were based on a study assessing the effects of core strength training using&#xD;
      unstable devices on older adults. The analysis revealed the requirement of 54 participants&#xD;
      (18 per group) to obtain medium &quot;time x group&quot; interaction effects. Considering the&#xD;
      likelihood of dropouts, at least 83 participants are going to be recruited to compensate for&#xD;
      a possible dropout rate of ~20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: All intervention groups train for ten weeks, twice per week on non-consecutive&#xD;
      days for 60 minutes each. The 10-week intervention period consistes of a one week&#xD;
      introductory phase and three major training blocks lasting three weeks each. Training&#xD;
      intensity is progressively and individually increased over the 10-week training program by&#xD;
      modulating load and sets for all groups and level of instability for F-URT. After week one&#xD;
      (50 %), four (60%), and seven (70%) the training load (weight) is increased following one&#xD;
      repetition maximum (1-RM) testing for each major exercise. M-SRT followes a 'traditional'&#xD;
      machine-based stable resistance training program, including squats with a smith-machine and a&#xD;
      leg press. F-URT conducts squats and front lunges on unstable devices. M-ART uses adductor&#xD;
      and abductor strength training machines. All three intervention groups conduct a resistance&#xD;
      training program consisting of two main exercises, a preparation and cool-down phase.&#xD;
      Participants perform ten minutes of low-intensity stepping on a stair-walker as a brief&#xD;
      warm-up at the beginning of each training session, followed by the resistance exercises and&#xD;
      walking on a treadmill as cool-down. Training under unstable surface conditions, especially&#xD;
      with additional weight, implies a certain degree of accident risk. Due to this factor, all&#xD;
      instability exercises are observed by instructors and secured with additional aids like&#xD;
      boxes. Training is supervised by skilled instructors at all times. For the first two weeks&#xD;
      the participant to instructor ratio will be 5:1, thereafter 10:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome assessment: Outcomes are measured at baseline, 10 weeks (intervention endpoint) and&#xD;
      20 weeks (study endpoint). Measurement sessions are conducted on one day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data: Baseline measurements are obtained prior to randomisation. In addition to the&#xD;
      measurements described below, the following are also collected: demographic and general&#xD;
      health characteristics; medical history and medications; anthropometrics and rate of falls /&#xD;
      near falls.&#xD;
