  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of Juvenile Probation Officers&#xD;
      (JPOs) delivering Contingency Management (CM) to teens on their caseload who have problems&#xD;
      with drug use. CM has already been shown to be effective at helping teens with drug problems&#xD;
      but CM has never been delivered by JPOs. This study will test how well it works to have JPOs&#xD;
      deliver CM during their regular meetings with teens.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The overarching purpose of this study is to increase justice-involved youths' access to an&#xD;
      evidence-based practice for substance abuse, specifically Contingency Management (CM). This&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial will examine the effectiveness of using juvenile probation&#xD;
      officers (JPOs) to deliver CM to youth (aged 12-17 years) on their caseloads. CM is an&#xD;
      evidence-based practice for substance abuse. The Investigators posit that JPOs are in an&#xD;
      ideal position to deliver an evidence-based practice such as CM to youth because of their&#xD;
      intensive involvement and frequent contact with the youth offenders under their supervision.&#xD;
      The study randomizes 36 JPOs to 2 conditions: CM versus control (usual JPO services), and&#xD;
      then randomizes 504 drug-abusing adolescent probationers across those 2 conditions. The&#xD;
      research team will work with JPOs employed by the Department of Youth Services (DYS) in&#xD;
      various counties in Oregon. JPOs will participate in focus groups and research interviews and&#xD;
      will submit monthly audio-tapes of sessions with participating youth. JPOs randomized to the&#xD;
      CM condition will receive training in how to deliver CM. As stated, participating youth will&#xD;
      also be randomized to CM or control and assigned to a JPO in the same condition. For those in&#xD;
      the CM group, the delivery of CM will be added to their regular meetings with their JPO.&#xD;
      Research data will be collected from families via audio-taped interviews and questionnaires&#xD;
      from youth and one caretaker. Urine samples for drug testing will also be collected from&#xD;
      youth. Lastly, arrest records will be collected on youth for the 18 months pre- and&#xD;
      post-entry into the study. The study involves 2 types of participants: youth (n=504) and&#xD;
      juvenile probation officers (n=36), for a total of 540 anticipated participants.&#xD;

    <description>Contingency Management (CM) utilizes behavior modification &amp; cognitive behavioral strategies to target adolescent alcohol or other drug (AOD) use. Protocol components are as follows: (a) The provider introduces CM to the family and engages them in the intervention; (b) The provider conducts Antecedent-Behavior-Consequence (ABC) assessments of the youth's AOD use with the youth and caregiver; (c) Based on the results of the ABC assessments, self-management planning and drug refusal skills training are implemented by the provider in collaboration with the caregiver; (d) Concurrently, a point and level system contract is filled in by the family, which provides rewards/privileges for negative drug and alcohol tests and disincentives (e.g., extra chores) for positive tests. Until continued abstinence is achieved, components &quot;b&quot; through &quot;d&quot; are repeated; (e) The provider collaborates with the family to develop plans for sustaining long-term abstinence. Typical duration of CM is 12-16 weeks.</description>
