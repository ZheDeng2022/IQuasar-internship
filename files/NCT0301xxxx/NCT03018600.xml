  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glucocorticoid is widely used in clinical treatment. Recently, there was research about&#xD;
      glucose fluctuations under low-dose and pulse steroid therapy in elderly patients with active&#xD;
      autoimmune diseases. Through this prospective trial, the investigators wanted to know the&#xD;
      blood glucose characteristics under high dosage glucocorticoid (1-2 mg/kg/day prednisone or&#xD;
      equivalent) in young patients (30-40 years) with active autoimmune diseases with or without&#xD;
      low-dose glucocorticoid maintenance. The investigators used continuous glucose monitoring for&#xD;
      72 hours to get a better understanding of the glucose levels.&#xD;

      As known to all, the dosage and duration of glucocorticoid influences the glucose levels in&#xD;
      different diseases. Continuous glucose monitoring becomes a newly effective technology to&#xD;
      better understand the glucose level. In this study,the investigators enrolled 25 patients&#xD;
      with certain active autoimmune diseases during high-dosage glucocorticoid therapy at Peking&#xD;
      Union Medical College Hospital. It was done by monitoring three-day continuous glucose levels&#xD;
      by holding continuous glucose monitoring system underneath the skin, which helped to show a&#xD;
      unique picture of fluctuations. The participants were divided into two groups according to&#xD;
      the glucocorticoid therapy. Group 1 enrolled subjects who were newly commenced 1-2mg/kg/day&#xD;
      prednisone-equivalent (intravenous/oral methylpredisolone or oral prednisone) for at least&#xD;
      five days. Group 2 enrolled subjects who had underwent less than 15mg/day&#xD;
      prednisone-equivalent glucocorticoid maintenance for at least 3 months but treated with&#xD;
      high-dose glucocorticoid for the relapse during the study This finding is useful for the&#xD;
      suitable treatment to control the hyperglycemia in young patients.&#xD;
