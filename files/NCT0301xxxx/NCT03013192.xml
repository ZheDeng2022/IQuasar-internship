  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are prescribed physical therapy exercises for their shoulder will have increased&#xD;
      compliance to their PT exercises, an increased ASES score, and will have increased range of&#xD;
      motion (or reach maximum range of motion earlier) at the end of the 3 month&#xD;
      EpxPhysicalTherapy intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient compliance to their prescribed physical therapy (PT) exercises is reported to be&#xD;
      22-40% in various studies. Further, Vasey et al. found that about 8% of patients do not even&#xD;
      schedule a follow up PT appointment after it is prescribed. Low adherence presents a problem&#xD;
      since long term completion of prescribed home exercises has been correlated with improved&#xD;
      health outcomes. Sluijs et al. found that low adherence to PT exercises can be primarily&#xD;
      attributed to three factors: (1) the barriers patients perceive and encounter, (2) the lack&#xD;
      of positive feedback, and (3) the degree of helplessness. An automated phone/texting system&#xD;
      can help with these three points by increasing positive feedback, increasing compliance, and&#xD;
      monitoring patient progress. The system can continually remind the patient that their end&#xD;
      goal is possible, which will decrease their feeling of helplessness in their condition.&#xD;
&#xD;

      *?HELP?*&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient compliance to their prescribed physical therapy (PT) exercises is reported to be&#xD;
      22-40% in various studies [1-4]. Further, Vasey et al. found that about 8% of patients do not&#xD;
      even schedule a follow up PT appointment after it is prescribed [5]. Low adherence presents a&#xD;
      problem since long term completion of prescribed home exercises has been correlated with&#xD;
      improved health outcomes. Sluijs et al. found that low adherence to PT exercises can be&#xD;
      primarily attributed to three factors: (1) the barriers patients perceive and encounter, (2)&#xD;
      the lack of positive feedback, and (3) the degree of helplessness [2]. An automated&#xD;
      phone/texting system can help with these three points by increasing positive feedback,&#xD;
      increasing compliance, and monitoring patient progress. The system can continually remind the&#xD;
      patient that their end goal is possible, which will decrease their feeling of helplessness in&#xD;
      their condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) created a survey form that evaluates the&#xD;
      shoulder function of a patient. The survey is scored out of 100 points (100 being best&#xD;
      possible shoulder function and 0 being worst possible shoulder function). The form can be&#xD;
      filled out on an iPad online, and the score recorded by a member of the medical team. This&#xD;
      screening form has been validated by numerous studies, and has been specifically validated&#xD;
      for patients with non-operative rotator cuff pain/abnormalities (the population that this&#xD;
      study is proposing to study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telemedicine shows promise in improving the outcomes of orthopedic interventions. Medication&#xD;
      adherence and patient outcomes have been shown to improve in interventions that include&#xD;
      reminders. Also, because the adoption of cell phones is nearly ubiquitous worldwide and the&#xD;
      vast majority of cell phone users text message, a text-message-based intervention seems&#xD;
      particularly promising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have shown that SMS text messaging has increased treatment compliance. PT&#xD;
      adherence to prescribed exercises seems to be limited by compliance, so Epharmix along with&#xD;
      several orthopedic surgeons set out to develop an intervention. The result,&#xD;
      EpxPhysicalTherapy (EpxPT), is an automated system that ensures that patients have both&#xD;
      scheduled their physical therapy appointment and have performed their home exercises. It also&#xD;
      sends motivational text messages to the patient to encourage the participant to perform their&#xD;
      exercises since a lack of positive reinforcement has been correlated with decreased&#xD;
      compliance. When a patient identifies that they have been unable to schedule a PT appointment&#xD;
      or have not completed their exercises for multiple days in a row, an alert is sent to the&#xD;
      healthcare team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The system was designed to deliver either voice or text-based automated messages to patients&#xD;
      in a way that avoids an additional burden on the healthcare team. EpxPT offers numerous&#xD;
      advantages to strictly app-based or text message-based systems in both older and&#xD;
      underprivileged patient populations. Older patients, who may be more comfortable with voice&#xD;
      messages, have that option, and patients without a smartphone will still be able to receive&#xD;
      the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients identified to be eligible for this study and have consented will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of two groups: Group 1 will receive the standard of care alone (control) and&#xD;
      Group 2 will receive the EpxPT intervention. In Group 2, EpxPT will remind the patient to&#xD;
      schedule their first PT appointment. Group 2 patients will also be asked if they have&#xD;
      completed their prescribed PT exercises every other day. They will then be sent a&#xD;
      motivational text messages or voice call in order to highlight the importance of completing&#xD;
      their PT regimen. Group 2 patient compliance will be tracked through the text responses&#xD;
      recorded in the Epharmix database. Both Group 1 and Group 2 patients will be seen at a follow&#xD;
      up appointment once a month for three months. At this appointment, patients in both groups&#xD;
      will be asked about their PT compliance (this will be the measurement of compliance for Group&#xD;
      1), and range of motion and a ASES score will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1: To compare control and intervention group compliance to their prescribed physical&#xD;
           therapy home exercise regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 2: To compare control and intervention group shoulder range of motion after a 3&#xD;
           month intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 3: To compare control and intervention group ASES scores after a 3 month&#xD;
           intervention&#xD;
