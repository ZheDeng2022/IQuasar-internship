      Observer-blind, partially randomized, multi-center dose escalation Phase I study in healthy&#xD;
      adults below 40 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      180 subjects will be enrolled in 6 treatment groups (different doses; different formulation:&#xD;
      with/without adjuvant); vaccinations will be given I.M.(intramuscular) into the deltoid&#xD;
      region on Days 0, 28 and 56. Study participants will be followed up until one year after&#xD;
      first vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Booster Extension:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the 48µg and 90µg Treatment groups who received a complete Primary immunization&#xD;
      schedule will be included into a Booster Extension 13 months after the first immunization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observer-blind, partially randomized, multi-center dose escalation Phase I study&#xD;
      which aims to assess the safety, immunogenicity and dose response of VLA15 in healthy adults&#xD;
      aged below 40 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall 180 subjects will be enrolled in 6 treatment groups: VLA15 12µg with and w/o&#xD;
      (without) Alum, VLA15 48µg with and w/o Alum, VLA15 90µg with and w/o Alum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first 24 subjects, the study will be open-label and subjects will not be randomized&#xD;
      but included into a staggered dose escalation scheme for safety precaution. Thereafter, the&#xD;
      study will be conducted observer-blind in respect to the investigators and site staff&#xD;
      involved in clinical evaluation of subjects, subjects will be blinded as well. Remaining 156&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized into the 6 treatment groups. I.M. vaccinations are administered&#xD;
      on Days 0, 28 and 56 into deltoid region of the non-dominant arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will investigate the safety and tolerability as well as immunogenicity of VLA15.&#xD;
      The primary objective addresses safety and tolerability of the vaccine up to three months&#xD;
      after enrollment, i.e. 84 days after first vaccination. The study includes 1 screening visit&#xD;
      and 8 outpatient visits from day 0 through day 365. In addition, safety phone calls will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Booster Extension:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the 48µg and 90µg dose Groups at the Belgian site, who received a complete&#xD;
      primary immunization schedule (three vaccinations), will be included into a Booster Extension&#xD;
      to investigate the safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of VLA15 administered 13&#xD;
      months after the first immunization. An extension analysis on safety and immunogenicity will&#xD;
      be performed after the last subject has completed the last study visit at Month 19.&#xD;
      Additionally a M14 interim analysis on immunogenicity data will be performed, when all&#xD;
      subjects completed Month 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For inclusion in the Booster Extension of this study only subjects are eligible, who were&#xD;
      enrolled in Belgium, completed the primary immunization schedule (three vaccinations) and&#xD;
      were randomized into 48µg or 90µg dose groups with or without alum. Subjects included in the&#xD;
      staggered dose escalation phase will not be asked to participate in the Booster Extension for&#xD;
      operational reasons.&#xD;
