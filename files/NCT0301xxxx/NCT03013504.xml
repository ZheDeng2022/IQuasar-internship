  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the TROIKA study, the proposed biosimilar HD201 will be compared to its reference product&#xD;
      Herceptin®. The aim of the study is to demonstrate equivalence of HD201 and Herceptin® in&#xD;
      terms of efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, parallel group, equivalence, multicentre Phase III study.&#xD;
      500 patients with HER2+ early breast cancer (EBC) will be randomised (1:1) to receive either&#xD;
      HD201 in combination with chemotherapy (n=250) or Herceptin® in combination with chemotherapy&#xD;
      (n=250).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HD201 or Herceptin® will be administered every 3 weeks for 8 cycles(24 weeks). After&#xD;
      administration of the final neoadjuvant study drug dose, surgery will be done within 3-8&#xD;
      weeks followed by an adjuvant treatment period for 10 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients completing the 18 cycles of treatment and those discontinuing the study will attend&#xD;
      an End of Treatment (EOT) visit 4 weeks (+/- 2 days), after last administration of study&#xD;
      medication, followed by a follow-up period of 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will attend study visits every 3 weeks. At each visit, patients will undergo a&#xD;
      complete physical examination, vital signs, weight, performance status, clinical laboratory&#xD;
      tests and adverse events (AEs), concomitant medication will be recorded. After the EOT visit&#xD;
      patients will be followed every 6 months for an additional 24 months or until death,&#xD;
      whichever occurs first, to collect data on cardiac safety and disease status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac safety will be assessed by echocardiography or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan to&#xD;
      evaluate the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (at screening, before cycle 5, before&#xD;
      surgery, before cycles 12 and 16, EOT visit, and at 6 and 12 months after the completion of&#xD;
      trastuzumab (more frequent if necessary)) and by means of a 12-lead ECG (at screening, before&#xD;
      cycle 5, before surgery, before cycles 12 and 16, EOT visit, and at 6 and 12 months after the&#xD;
      completion of trastuzumab).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint, total pathological complete response (tpCR) will be assessed&#xD;
      at the time of surgery after neoadjuvant treatment completion after 24 weeks. tpCR will be&#xD;
      assessed both by local and by central reading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling for pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis (determination of Ctrough values) will be&#xD;
      performed in all patients before cycle 5 and cycle 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An Independent Data Monitoring Committee will be implemented that reviews accumulating data&#xD;
      of the clinical trial with respect to any potential safety issues, study progress and&#xD;
      critical efficacy endpoints. The members will be selected on the basis of relevant experience&#xD;
      and understanding of clinical research and the issues specific to the therapeutic area, as&#xD;
      well as previous data monitoring committee experience.&#xD;
