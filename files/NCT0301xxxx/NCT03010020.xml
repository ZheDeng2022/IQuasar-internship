  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to develop and pilot an HIV prevention intervention based on rectal&#xD;
      STI testing, counseling, and treatment for MSM in Peru. The investigators will use nucleic&#xD;
      acid testing to screen 750 behaviorally high-risk MSM for rectal gonorrheal and/or chlamydial&#xD;
      (GC/CT) infection. GC/CT-positive subjects will receive single-dose antibiotic treatment and&#xD;
      single-session Personal Cognitive Counseling (PCC) (n=50) or standard post-test counseling&#xD;
      (n=50). A GC/CT-negative control group (n=50) will also be enrolled to compare biological&#xD;
      outcomes including changes in levels of inflammatory cytokines following rectal STI. The&#xD;
      intervention is based on three interrelated objectives: 1) To use periodic rectal STI nucleic&#xD;
      acid testing to identify the members of the MSM population at greatest short-term risk for&#xD;
      HIV infection; 2) To provide single-dose antibiotic treatment to control the immune&#xD;
      activation and mucosal inflammation caused by rectal GC/CT infection that increase cellular&#xD;
      risk for HIV transmission; and 3) To use Personal Cognitive Counseling (PCC) to understand&#xD;
      and modify recent high-risk sexual practices that led to rectal STI acquisition and that&#xD;
      increase future HIV risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to screen 750 behaviorally high-risk MSM for rectal GC/CT infection&#xD;
      to enroll 100 GC/CT-positive individuals (using a conservative 15% prevalence estimate) and&#xD;
      50 GC/CT-negative controls (matched by age and baseline frequency of URAI). GC/CT-infected&#xD;
      participants will be given single-dose antibiotic therapy and randomized to receive&#xD;
      single-session PCC (n=50) or standard post-test counseling (n=50). The primary outcome will&#xD;
      be the impact of PCC on self-reported sexual risk behavior (URAI). Secondary outcomes will&#xD;
      assess: 1) Feasibility/Acceptability of the STI screening program; 2) Impact of GC/CT&#xD;
      infection and treatment on levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-αand IL-1β) in&#xD;
      rectal mucosa; 3) Prevalence of persistent/recurrent rectal GC/CT; and 4) HIV incidence in&#xD;
      GC/CT-infected and -uninfected MSM.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Overview. The investigators plan to screen 750 behaviorally high-risk, HIV-uninfected MSM in&#xD;
      order to enroll 100 subjects with rectal GC/CT infection and 50 uninfected controls.&#xD;
      GC/CT-infected participants will receive single-dose antibiotic therapy and be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either PCC or standard-of-care post-test counseling. GC/CT-negative participants will&#xD;
      receive standard post-test counseling. Behavioral and biological assessments will be&#xD;
      conducted at Baseline, 3-month and 6-month Follow-up visits. The primary outcome will be the&#xD;
      effect of PCC on the prevalence of URAI with an HIV-infected or unknown status partner in the&#xD;
      preceding 3-months. Secondary outcomes include feasibility/acceptability of the intervention,&#xD;
      prevalence of persistent or recurrent GC/CT infection, change in rectal cytokine levels, and&#xD;
      incidence of HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment. Participants will be recruited from local HIV testing sites using the methods&#xD;
      described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit. The investigators will screen 750 MSM reporting at least one recent episode&#xD;
      of unprotected receptive anal intercourse (URAI) for rectal GC/CT infection with a goal of&#xD;
      identifying 100 GC/CT-positive participants (using a conservative 15% prevalence estimate and&#xD;
      assuming 10% loss to follow-up over 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Rapid HIV Testing: After providing informed consent, all potential participants will&#xD;
      undergo rapid HIV testing. Study staff will provide pre- and post-test risk reduction&#xD;
      counseling based on the CDC's RESPECT-2 model (24) and screen for HIV at point of care using&#xD;
      a 4th Generation Rapid HIV-1/2 assay (Alere Determine, Alere).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) Physical Examination: Potential participants will undergo routine physical examination to&#xD;
      assess for signs of STI. Participants with evidence of proctitis (rectal discharge or&#xD;
      inflammation) will be treated with Ceftriaxone 250 mg injection and Azithromycin 1 g oral and&#xD;
      invited to enroll in the study based on symptomatic criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) Syphilis Testing: Potential participants will undergo syphilis testing by RPR&#xD;
      (RPRnosticon, Biomerieux), with positive results confirmed by TPPA (Serodia TPPA, Fujirebio).&#xD;
      Results will be provided within 14 days and individuals with latent syphilis infection will&#xD;
      be treated with three weekly doses of Penicillin G 2.4 Million IU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv) Rectal NAT Screening: All potential participants, regardless of symptoms, will be tested&#xD;
      for rectal GC/CT infection at the screening visit. A rectal swab will be obtained by clinical&#xD;
      staff and tested for GC/CT using a transcription mediated assay (TMA) (GenProbe Aptima,&#xD;
      Hologic). Results will be provided within 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      v) Antibiotic Therapy: Participants with symptomatic proctitis at the screening visit will be&#xD;
      provided with appropriate antibiotic treatment (Ceftriaxone 250 mg IM and Azithromycin 1g PO&#xD;
      once), advised of the importance of partner notification, and offered antibiotic therapy&#xD;
      packets to deliver to their recent sexual partners (maximum of 5 packets per participant).&#xD;
      Each packet will include a single dose of Cefixime 400 mg and Azithromycin 1g PO as well as&#xD;
      printed information about GC/CT infection and local testing and treatment resources for HIV&#xD;
      and other STIs (including free partner testing and treatment at the Via Libre site).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment Visit. Based on results of nucleic acid testing and/or symptomatic criteria, we&#xD;
      will enroll 100 HIV-uninfected MSM with rectal GC/CT infection who will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either PCC (n=50) or standard post-test counseling (n=50). An additional 50&#xD;
      GC/CT-uninfected control subjects will also be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Antibiotic Therapy: Participants diagnosed with rectal GC/CT by nucleic acid testing will&#xD;
      receive antibiotic therapy and up to 5 partner treatment packets as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) Randomization: Participants diagnosed with rectal GC/CT infection and/or symptomatic&#xD;
      proctitis will be randomized to receive either PCC or standard of care post-test counseling.&#xD;
      Randomization assignments will be constructed in a random permuted block allocation (block&#xD;
      size = 7, alternating 4/3 ratio). Computer-generated assignments will be stored in opaque,&#xD;
      sealed envelopes and opened sequentially at the time of allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) Behavioral Survey: GC/CT-infected participants in both arms will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      CASI-administered behavioral survey. The survey instrument will be self-administered using an&#xD;
      iPad device and will ask participants about their sexual practices during the previous 3&#xD;
      months, including number and type of sexual partners (primary/stable partner,&#xD;
      casual/recurrent contact, casual/single contact, anonymous contact, and commercial sex client&#xD;
      or worker), frequency of sexual intercourse (oral, anal, and vaginal), frequency of&#xD;
      unprotected intercourse, and frequency of unprotected intercourse with HIV-infected or&#xD;
      unknown serostatus partners. To collect additional detail on partner-level risk factors,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to provide information about their most recent sexual contacts (up&#xD;
      to a maximum of three contacts within 6 months). For each contact, participants will be asked&#xD;
      to describe the partner's age, gender, sexual orientation, sexual role, partnership type,&#xD;
      length of partnership, partner HIV serostatus, and sexual practices, including act-specific&#xD;
      condom use. Additional questions will address demographics, STI symptoms (e.g., dysuria,&#xD;
      urethral or rectal discharge, etc.), drug and alcohol use, depression, anxiety, and&#xD;
      self-efficacy for negotiating condom use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv) Personal Cognitive Counseling (PCC): After completing the survey, participants diagnosed&#xD;
      with GC/CT-infection will receive either PCC or standard of care post-test counseling,&#xD;
      according to randomization arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCC Procedures: i) SJEI Completion: Participants will first be asked to complete the SJEI&#xD;
      instrument independently. ii) SJEI Review: A study counselor will meet with the participant&#xD;
      to review their responses to the SJEI and ask them to recount a recent sexual encounter&#xD;
      involving URAI. Participants will be asked to tell their story in context, paying attention&#xD;
      to the environmental cues, interpersonal interactions, and individual emotions and cognitive&#xD;
      processes occurring at each step of the encounter. After narrating their story, the&#xD;
      participant will review together with the counselor the self-justifications employed during&#xD;
      the interaction, using objective, &quot;offline&quot; analysis to explore the &quot;online&quot; cognitive&#xD;
      processes they used to justify sexual risk behavior during the episode. iii) Risk Counseling:&#xD;
      The counselor will work with the participant to highlight moments where critical behavioral&#xD;
      decision points occurred, identify the self-justifications used for engaging in risk behavior&#xD;
      at those moments, and develop a strategy to control risk behavior in future interactions. A&#xD;
      key component of the counseling will involve linking the prior episode of URAI with the&#xD;
      current diagnosis of rectal GC/CT, as a strategy to highlight flaws in previously used&#xD;
      self-justifications. iv) Role-Play: The counselor and the participant will rehearse risk&#xD;
      reduction strategies by role-playing typical interactions where high-risk sexual behavior may&#xD;
      occur. After completing the session, the participant will be asked to discuss their&#xD;
      satisfaction with the PCC model, including their comfort in discussing the cognitive&#xD;
      processes occurring during a sexual encounter, the perceived usefulness of the counseling,&#xD;
      and any important issues that were not addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      v) Standard of Care Post-Test Counseling. GC/CT-infected participants in the standard of care&#xD;
      arm (and all GC/CT-negative participants screened for infection) will receive standard&#xD;
      post-test counseling in accordance with Peruvian Ministry of Health guidelines. Counseling&#xD;
      will include a discussion of recent sexual risk behavior, condom use to reduce the risk of&#xD;
      future HIV/STI acquisition, partner notification, and follow-up testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      vi) Rectal Cytokine Measurements. GC/CT-infected participants randomized to the standard&#xD;
      post-test counseling arm will be matched 1-to-1 with GC/CT-negative controls. Matching will&#xD;
      be based on age and number of episodes of URAI reported in the previous 30 days (categorized&#xD;
      as 1, 2-3, or &gt;3 episodes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      GC/CT-infected participants and matched GC/CT-negative controls will be asked to provide a&#xD;
      swab sample of the rectal mucosa to monitor changes in levels of inflammatory cytokines from&#xD;
      the time of diagnosis to after antibiotic treatment. To collect the sample, a physician will&#xD;
      insert a sponge swab 4 cm into the participant's rectum and leave it in place for 30 seconds&#xD;
      prior to removal. Samples will be stored in liquid transport media at -4°C until completion&#xD;
      of the study, at which time all samples will be sent to the UCLA Mucosal Immunology Core&#xD;
      (MIC) Laboratory. Levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α in rectal mucosa will be measured.&#xD;
      Repeat measurements will be collected at 3- and 6-month Follow-up visits to assess changes&#xD;
      from initial diagnosis to post-treatment. Results will be used to establish baseline values&#xD;
      and changes in levels of key cytokines following STI treatment to define the parameters for&#xD;
      intermediate biological outcomes in a projected RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Visits. All participants will be asked to return for 3-month and 6-month Follow-up&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Behavioral Survey. All participants diagnosed with rectal GC/CT infection at Enrollment&#xD;
      will be asked to complete a CASI-administered Follow-up survey at each visit. Similar to the&#xD;
      Baseline survey, the Follow-up instrument will assess sexual risk behavior, substance use,&#xD;
      and other mediating factors (depression, anxiety, condom self-efficacy) over the previous&#xD;
      3-month period as well as partner notification and treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) Repeat HIV Testing. Rapid HIV testing will be provided at each follow-up visit using the&#xD;
      above procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) Repeat GC/CT Testing. All participants will receive repeat nucleic acid testing for&#xD;
      rectal GC/CT at each follow-up visit. Results of repeat testing will be provided by telephone&#xD;
      or in person within two weeks. Participants with new, recurrent, or persistent infection will&#xD;
      be treated with Ceftriaxone 250 mg IM and Azithromycin 1g PO once. Post-test counseling for&#xD;
      new, persistent, or recurrent infection will be provided according to the participant's&#xD;
      original randomization assignment (PCC or standard of care counseling).&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv) Repeat Cytokine Testing. Rectal swab measurements will be obtained from GC/CT-positive&#xD;
      participants randomized to the standard of care arm and matched GC/CT-negative controls at&#xD;
      each follow-up to monitor changes in inflammatory cytokine levels in rectal mucosa after&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment and in GC/CT-negative controls over the same time period. Samples will&#xD;
      be stored for testing in the UCLA MIC laboratory.&#xD;
