  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Latrogenic infertility as a result of cancer treatment has a profound effect on long-term&#xD;
      quality of life in survivors of reproductive-age cancers. Oocyte cryopreservation prior to&#xD;
      cancer treatment has been associated with improved quality of life, with a potential ability&#xD;
      to reduce long-term decision-related regret in cancer survivors. Though letrozole plus&#xD;
      gonadotropin and and tamoxifen plus gonadotropin are currently routinely used worldwide in&#xD;
      ovarian stimulation cycles for fertility preservation in patients with&#xD;
      estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer, it is not clear which of the two might lead to&#xD;
      improved oocyte yield. Improved knowledge about the efficacy of these medications, with&#xD;
      regard to oocyte yield, has the potential to significantly improve quality of life in&#xD;
      reproductive-age breast cancer survivors.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary objective is to determine whether concomitant administration of tamoxifen 20 mg&#xD;
      oral with gonadotropins (tamoxifen-gonadotropin) versus a starting dose of letrozole 5 mg&#xD;
      oral with gonadotropins (letrozole-gonadotropin) will result in a difference in mature oocyte&#xD;
      yield during our routine ovarian stimulation protocol for fertility preservation for&#xD;
      Estrogen-Receptor-Positive (ER+) breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: Each of the following aims will include a primary comparison and secondary&#xD;
      comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim: The primary aim will be to compare patients with ER+ breast cancer who are&#xD;
      treated with letrozole-gonadotropin versus patients with ER+ breast cancer who are treated&#xD;
      tamoxifen-gonadotropin with regard to ovarian stimulation outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary comparison:&#xD;
&#xD;
           1) To determine if the assigned stimulation regimen will result in a difference in&#xD;
           mature (meiosis II) oocyte yield in patients with breast cancer who undergo ovarian&#xD;
           stimulation for fertility preservation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary comparison:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To compare estrogen, progesterone, and androgen levels during the ovarian&#xD;
                stimulation cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. To compare estrogen, letrozole, and tamoxifen levels in follicular fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. To compare duration of stimulation (days) and total gonadotropin dose&#xD;
                (international units of FSH).&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. To assess embryo quality, if applicable, on day 3 and day 5 of embryo culture, a&#xD;
                measure of the developmental competence of the oocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental comparison:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To compare clinical pregnancy rates when cryopreserved tissue is eventually&#xD;
                utilized among patients from the assigned stimulation regimens. This comparison is&#xD;
                labeled experimental because of the remoteness of such an outcome from our present&#xD;
                study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim: We will repeat the above comparisons among patients with ER+ breast cancer who&#xD;
      are treated with tamoxifen-gonadotropin versus a prospectively-obtained reference group of&#xD;
      patients with Estrogen-Receptor-Negative (ER-) breast cancer who are treated gonadotropin&#xD;
      alone. We will then again repeat the above comparisons among patients with ER+ breast cancer&#xD;
      who are treated letrozole-gonadotropin versus patients with ER- breast cancer who are treated&#xD;
      gonadotropin alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target population is reproductive-age women who have been recently diagnosed with ER+&#xD;
      breast cancer and choose to undergo oocyte or embryo cryopreservation prior to chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatment. All eligible women will be asked to join the study at their initial University of&#xD;
      California, San Francisco (UCSF) fertility preservation consult. Study participants will be&#xD;
      recruited from the Reproductive Endocrinology Clinic at University of California, San&#xD;
      Francisco Center for Reproductive Health. A consecutive sample with ER- disease will also be&#xD;
      recruited at the same type of visit. They will be asked to take part in the gonadotropin only&#xD;
      stimulation group, which will be used for a secondary aim.&#xD;

    <description>To determine if the assigned stimulation regimen will result in a difference in mature (meiosis II) oocyte yield in patients with breast cancer who undergo ovarian stimulation for fertility preservation. An Effect Size of 3 mature oocytes, based on clinically significant difference of 2 embryos to transfer. An average of 2 embryos are transferred per freeze-thaw cycle. If ~75% of mature oocytes will become embryos that can be frozen, then 3 mature oocytes should yield ~2 embryos for transfer. This effect size would effectively mean an additional event of embryos transferred.</description>
