    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open label, phase I study involving grade I-III&#xD;
      gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, consisting of a dose escalation Part A followed&#xD;
      by an expansion cohort Part B. On Part A Patients will be treated with daily oral everolimus.&#xD;
      Fosbretabulin will be administered IV either q3 weekly or q weekly based on PO CRM cohort.&#xD;
      Part B: Once the investigators have established an MTD in Part A, the investigators will be&#xD;
      treating 15 more patients at that dose combination. The primary and secondary objectives of&#xD;
      the expansion cohort will be similar to Part A of the study, i.e., to establish a safety&#xD;
      profile of the experimental drug combination and to collect and assess efficacy data.&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with concurrent everolimus and fosbretabulin for 12 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A variety of treatment options are available for NETs with carcinoid syndrome including&#xD;
      surgical and medical therapies. Most subjects require somatostatin analogs to control the&#xD;
      symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. Subjects who no longer respond to somatostatin and other&#xD;
      liver-directed therapies, who experience progression of disease and increasing symptoms have&#xD;
      limited options, including participation in a clinical trial. Recently everolimus and&#xD;
      sunitinib have been approved for the treatment of subjects with progressive locally advanced&#xD;
      or metastatic neuroendocrine tumors. Based on the preclinical data in models of NETs and the&#xD;
      clinical activity seen in NETS and other tumor types that have existing tumor vascculature,&#xD;
      this study will examine the effectiveness of fosbretabulin given in combination with&#xD;
      everolimus in subjects with GI-NETs and PNETs.The vasoconstrictive effect of fosbretabulin is&#xD;
      potent, though short-lived (4-8 hours), with no cumulative adverse effect. Everolimus&#xD;
      inhibits angiogenesis, slows tumor growth and has a prolonged half-life (30 hours). Combining&#xD;
      these two agents with distinctly different mechanisms of action may improve tumor control&#xD;
      without additional toxicities, and has the potential of reducing drug resistance.&#xD;

             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform&#xD;
             her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after&#xD;
             completion of fosbretabulin and everolimus administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had prior everolimus but were not able to tolerate a 10 mg daily&#xD;
             dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or&#xD;
             mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse&#xD;
             events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Child Pugh Class B or greater hepatic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases because of their poor prognosis and likelihood to&#xD;
             develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of&#xD;
             neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to fosbretabulin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (HTN); sustained blood pressure (BP) greater than 150/100&#xD;
             mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must not have had any unstable angina or myocardial infarction within 4 months prior&#xD;

             arrhythmias, sick sinus syndrome, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia&#xD;
             or Grade 3 conduction system abnormalities unless subject has a pacemaker.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must not have any evidence of other clinically active cancer and have no history of&#xD;
             prior malignancy within the past 3 years with the exception of: a) adequately treated&#xD;
             basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell skin cancer, or thyroid cancer; b) carcinoma in&#xD;
             situ of the cervix or breast; c) prostate cancer of Gleason Grade 6 or less and with&#xD;
             stable prostatespecific antigen levels; or d) cancer considered cured by surgical&#xD;
             resection or unlikely to impact survival for the duration of the study, such as&#xD;
             localized transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder or benign tumors of the adrenal&#xD;
             glands or pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or&#xD;
             inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly&#xD;
             changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as&#xD;
             http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx; medical reference texts such as&#xD;
             the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the&#xD;
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of&#xD;
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be&#xD;
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal&#xD;
             product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because everolimus and fosbretabulin have&#xD;
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown&#xD;
             but potential risk for adverse events to nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with these agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is&#xD;
             treated with everolimus and fosbretabulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with everolimus and fosbretabulin. In&#xD;
             addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrowsuppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be initiated for patients&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of prior cerebrovascular event, (including transient ischemic attack) within 6&#xD;
             months of start of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current thrombotic or hemorrhagic disorder/event or history of prior event within 6&#xD;
             months of start of Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Corrected QT interval ([QTc] Fridericia) &gt; 480 ms&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant vascular disease or recent peripheral arterial thrombosis&#xD;
