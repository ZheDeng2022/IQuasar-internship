      This Phase 1b study in adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) in steady-state (non-acutely&#xD;
      ill) aims to evaluate safety and toxicity of NVX-508 in a multi-dosing paradigm as well as to&#xD;
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in this population. The information gained from&#xD;
      this study will be used in making decisions about the appropriate dose(s) and dosing schedule&#xD;
      in future multicenter studies of the efficacy of NVX-508 in the treatment of vaso-occlusive&#xD;
      episodes (VOE).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder of hemoglobin that affects millions of&#xD;
      individuals worldwide, with sub-Saharan Africa bearing the greatest burden of disease. The&#xD;
      leading causes of hospitalization and death in individuals with sickle cell disease are&#xD;
      painful VOE (associated with tissue injury from reduced oxygen supply) and &quot;acute chest&#xD;
      syndrome&quot; respectively. Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a form of acute lung injury unique to&#xD;
      SCD that arises de novo or during the course of painful VOE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A safe, reliable therapeutic deployed early in the course of painful VOE (with or without&#xD;
      ACS) that restores oxygen supply to tissues, could potentially attenuate tissue injury,&#xD;
      resolve pain and improve patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NVX-508 is a liquid fluorocarbon which transports oxygen. Stoichiometrically, NVX-508 has 200&#xD;
      times the oxygen carrying capacity of human hemoglobin.Oxygen is taken up by NVX-508 as it&#xD;
      circulates through the alveolar capillary bed in the lungs and is released in blood and&#xD;
      tissues with low oxygen content. Consequently, if it were administered intravenously (IV) and&#xD;
      passed through the lungs of patients, it would take up oxygen, increasing the oxygen&#xD;
      concentration in blood in a dose-dependent manner and release it to tissues with low oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active component of NVX-508 was originally developed as an ultrasound contrast agent. It&#xD;
      has been tested as such in over 2200 patients to whom it was safely administered as a bolus&#xD;
      IV injection.The pharmacokinetics of NVX-508 in humans exhibits a biphasic decline after an&#xD;
      iv bolus dose; a rapid initial decline followed by a slow terminal phase. The terminal phase&#xD;
      t1/2 (half- life) ranges from 81-99.5 min for doses of 0.15-0.35 ml/kg. NVX-508 is not&#xD;
      metabolized in humans, it is removed from the body unchanged in the breath (expired air) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for studying NVX-508 for SCD is based on data from preclinical studies in the&#xD;
      mouse model of ACS. NVX-508 when used as rescue therapy in the mouse model, restored oxygen&#xD;
      saturation to baseline in mice experiencing hypoxemia, with 100% survival. NVX-508 reduced&#xD;
      pulmonary vascular congestion in SCD mice experiencing ACS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Intravenous delivery of 4 doses of NVX-508 of up to 0.17 ml/kg per dose, infused&#xD;
      over 30 minutes will be well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design: Dose-ranging study in adults with diagnosis of SCD (SS, SC, S-Beta +&#xD;
      thalassemia, S-Beta0 thalassemia, and SS/S-Hemoglobin D (SD)or S in combination with another&#xD;
      variant hemoglobin) , who are in steady state (no painful episode, hospitalization or blood&#xD;
      transfusion in the preceding 4 weeks) will be recruited from a single institution (Ghana&#xD;
      Institute of Clinical Genetics, Korle-Bu, Accra, Ghana) to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has a 3 + 3 design. The first cohort of 3 subjects enrolled in the study shall be&#xD;
      administered one dose (0.05 mL/kg) of NVX-508, the next cohort of 3 will be treated using two&#xD;
      doses of NVX-508 at 0.05 mL/kg and subsequent cohort will be assigned to four doses of&#xD;
      NVX-508. Higher doses of 0.1ml/kg and 0.17ml/kg will be administered Intra-patient dose&#xD;
      escalation will not be allowed. Each dose shall be administered as slow IV push over 5-10&#xD;
      minutes with the next dose administered no less than 90 minutes after cessation of the prior&#xD;
      infusion, but not more than 120 minutes later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within each cohort, when the first subject is treated, there will be a 72 hour observation&#xD;
      interval before the next two subjects are treated at the same dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 24 adults with sickle cell disease aged 18 years and above will be recruited&#xD;
      into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening - After giving informed consent, potential study participants will undergo&#xD;
      screening which comprises a standardized history and physical examination, lab tests (blood&#xD;
      counts, serum chemistries) and electrocardiogram( EKG). Eligible participants will return&#xD;
      within a week to be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention - Study participants will go to a designated staffed phase I center for&#xD;
      administration of the study drug. They will have baseline evaluations (arterial blood gas&#xD;
      evaluation, hemoglobin and EKG) done prior to administration of the study drug. They will&#xD;
      receive 1, 2 or 4 doses of the study drug depending They will be continuously monitored by&#xD;
      medical research staff and the principal investigator prior to, during and in the 4 hour&#xD;
      observation period post intervention, with physical examination, labs ( complete blood&#xD;
      counts, serum chemistries, coagulation profile and blood samples drawn for blood gas&#xD;
      evaluation and EKGs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be discharged from the clinical trials facility after the 4 hour observation&#xD;
      period if they have had no adverse events requiring further clinical management. There will&#xD;
      be a one week post-intervention observation period for dose-limiting toxicity for each&#xD;
      subject, at the end of which they will have a follow up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up - 1 week after administration of NVX-508, subjects will have a follow-up visit at&#xD;
      the clinical trial facility which includes history, physical exam and labs. If there are no&#xD;
      adverse events or problems requiring continued clinical care and monitoring, subjects will&#xD;
      exit the study once the lab and clinical data from the visit have been completely reviewed.&#xD;
