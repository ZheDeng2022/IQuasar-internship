  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to examine the use of a personal health record to improve&#xD;
      medication adherence among patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation taking dabigatran&#xD;
      for primary prevention of embolic stroke.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three brief newsletters will be sent by the research staff to the study patients in the form&#xD;
      of secure messages through their MyChart account. The newsletters will describe dabigatran&#xD;
      tolerability, adverse effects, patient monitoring, warnings/precautions, and administration.&#xD;
      Newsletters will be developed through a review of the FDA-approved prescribing information,&#xD;
      general tertiary references, and a search of PubMed and drafted with guidance from a Drug&#xD;
      Information Specialist at Manchester University College of Pharmacy as well as reviewed by&#xD;
      the research staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analysis will be used to analyze the survey to assess patient attitudes and&#xD;
      beliefs about dabigatran and personal health records, as well as to assess the level of&#xD;
      patient engagement. Difference-in-difference regression analysis will be used to evaluate the&#xD;
      impact of the personal health record on dabigatran adherence by comparing the differences&#xD;
      between times (pre-post) and interventions. Patient medication adherence will be correlated&#xD;
      from the Pharmacy refill data to determine if the Intervention Group is more compliant than&#xD;
      the Control Group. Multivariate analysis will be used to explore factors influencing personal&#xD;
      health record use and dabigatran adherence.&#xD;
