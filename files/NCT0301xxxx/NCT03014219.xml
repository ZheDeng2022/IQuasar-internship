  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to study the safety of autologous mesenchymal stromal cell transfer&#xD;
      using a biomatrix (the Gore Bio-A Fistula Plug) in a Phase I study using a single dose of 20&#xD;
      million cells. 20 patients (age 12 to 17 years) with Crohns perianal fistulas will be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo standard adjuvant therapy including drainage of infection and placement&#xD;
      of a draining seton. Six weeks post placement of the draining seton, the seton will be&#xD;
      replaced with the MSC loaded Gore fistula plug as per current clinical practice. The subjects&#xD;
      will be subsequently followed for fistula response and closure for 24 months. This is an&#xD;
      autologous product derived from the patient and used only for the same patient.&#xD;

      Visit 1: Patients will be evaluated for eligibility (inclusion/exclusion checklist) and&#xD;
      written, informed consent will be obtained. Patients will undergo general exam with vital&#xD;
      signs. Patients will be scheduled for a fat biopsy to collect the tissue needed to grow MSC.&#xD;
      In the event there is no cell growth from the tissue obtained from the first biopsy, one&#xD;
      further attempt will made from a second tissue sample from this patient. However, if the&#xD;
      second attempt fails to grow cells, no further attempts will be made, and the subject will&#xD;
      not continue in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be subsequently followed for fistula response and closure for 24 months.&#xD;
      Study visits are Day 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 24, Week 52, and Week 104. This&#xD;
      is an autologous product derived from the patient and used only for the same patient.&#xD;
