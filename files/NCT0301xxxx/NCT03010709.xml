    <textblock>
      Aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH) affects up to 10,000 individuals per year in the&#xD;
      UK. It accounts for ~5% of strokes, but is responsible for about 25% quality-adjusted life&#xD;
      years (QALYs) lost due to stroke. Although early repair of ruptured aneurysms and aggressive&#xD;
      postoperative management has improved overall outcomes, it remains a devastating disease with&#xD;
      mortality approaching 50%. Survivors are left with neurological injuries that range from&#xD;
      subtle cognitive deficit to disabling cerebral infarctions, less than 60% them returning to&#xD;
      functional independence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAH triggers a series of pathological processes resulting in neuronal damage and consequent&#xD;
      neurological deficit termed early brain injury (EBI). Many of the patients who survive the&#xD;
      initial bleed, deteriorate days later from delayed ischaemic neurological deficit (DIND),&#xD;
      which causes poor outcome or death in up to 30% of patients with SAH. Both of these&#xD;
      pathological processes are still poorly understood which limits the number of treatment&#xD;
      options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DIND is treated with blood pressure augmentation to ensure adequate blood flow in the brain.&#xD;
      In awake patients, response can be easily and accurately assessed by performing a thorough&#xD;
      neurological examination. In patients whose clinical condition demands sedation, intubation&#xD;
      and ventilation, assessing response to treatment using the neurological examination is&#xD;
      virtually impossible. Multimodality monitoring (MM), primarily microdialysis and brain tissue&#xD;
      oxygen tension with catheters inserted into the relevant parts of the brain offer direct&#xD;
      assessment of both delivery and utilisation of metabolic substrates at the cellular level.&#xD;
      These can be used for early detection of DIND as well as monitoring during blood pressure&#xD;
      augmentation. The aim of this study is to establish and validate a clinical protocol for MM&#xD;
      derived management of SAH patients, to determine optimal therapies for correcting&#xD;
      abnormalities in brain metabolism and explore the relationship between MD and other&#xD;
      monitoring modalities.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study of patients with poor grade subarachnoid&#xD;
      haemorrhage (SAH) caused by a ruptured brain artery aneurysm. The investigators aim to&#xD;
      include 100 patients over a 5-year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAH is diagnosed using computer tomography imaging of the brain and the presence of a&#xD;
      ruptured aneurysm by means of computer tomography angiogram of the vessels of the head. These&#xD;
      two investigations are part of the standard clinical practice for every patient with&#xD;
      suspected SAH. Term ''poor grade'' is used for cases of SAH where the patient is unconscious&#xD;
      i.e. in a coma as a consequence of this disease and whose clinical condition requires&#xD;
      intubation and ventilation (with or without sedation) and thus admission to an intensive care&#xD;
      unit. All patients with poor grade SAH admitted to the neurosciences critical care unit will&#xD;
      be screened for participation in this study. All poor grade SAH patients are unconscious and&#xD;
      thus unable to give informed consent. Therefore, the next-of-kin of all eligible patients&#xD;
      will be approached to discuss and consider patient's involvement in the study. If there is no&#xD;
      next-of-kin, the treating clinician will be approached as a professional consultee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once consent is obtained from next-of-kin, the participants will have the following&#xD;
      monitoring instituted:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. An intracranial access device will be inserted under general anaesthesia with an&#xD;
           intracranial pressure (ICP), a Licox partial tension of tissue oxygen (PbtO2) probe and&#xD;
           a microdialysis (MD) catheter. Neuromonitors will be inserted into the part of the brain&#xD;
           that is supplied by the affected artery. This procedure will be performed on the&#xD;
           neurocritical care unit or in theatre if patients are undergoing other operative&#xD;
           procedures at the same time. Continuous neuromonitoring will commence. Hourly MD samples&#xD;
           will be processed and the leftover samples stored in -80oC for cytokine analysis at a&#xD;
           later date. Neuromonitoring will continue for as long as clinically needed and up to 21&#xD;
           days from ictus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All participants will be fitted with a near-infrared spectroscopy monitor (NIRS) . This&#xD;
           non-invasive monitor is used to measure tissue haemoglobin concentration and oxygen&#xD;
           content continuously and at the bedside.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Daily transcranial Doppler (TCD) examinations will be performed at the bedside to assess&#xD;
           the caliber of large cerebral arteries. This procedure is used in regular clinical&#xD;
           practice to diagnose large vessel spasm which is one of the pathological substrates for&#xD;
           delayed cerebral ischaemia (DCI) All participants will have a CT brain perfusion scan&#xD;
           between day 3 and day 5 from the initial haemorrhage (ictus) or when clinically needed&#xD;
           to assess brain perfusion and possibility of DCI which is part of standard clinical&#xD;
           practice. These scans are reviewed and reported by consultant neuroradiologists. If they&#xD;
           identify an area (or areas) of reversible ischaemia, researchers will review the&#xD;
           position of invasive brain monitors - if these are outside of the area of DCI,&#xD;
           additional monitors will be inserted into the identified area of reversible ishaemia.&#xD;
           Researchers will then use invasive brain monitors (MD and LiCox) and non-invasive&#xD;
           monitoring (NIRS and TCD) to assess the response to standard treatment of cerebral&#xD;
           reversible ischaemia which is hypertensive therapy i.e. mean arterial pressure (MAP)&#xD;
           augmentation with vasoactive medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeat CT brain perfusion scan will be performed between days 7 and 10 from the initial&#xD;
      haemorrhage or earlier if clinically indicated to assess response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a 6 month period, researchers will see the patients in outpatient clinic to assess&#xD;
      functional outcome. This is part of the patient's standard clinical care as all our patients&#xD;
      are offered clinical follow up in this way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will collect any biological samples that are available as part of the standard&#xD;
      clinical care of the participant and will not subject the participants to any additional&#xD;
      procedures. This would consist of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  left over microdialysate samples that are not used for the standard clinical care of the&#xD;
           participant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  daily blood samples if the participant has an arterial line or central venous catheter&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) if the participant has an external ventricular&#xD;
           drain&#xD;
