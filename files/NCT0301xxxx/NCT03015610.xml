      This study will evaluate the effect of CYP2C19 and ABCB1 genes on pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      lansoprazole in children with mild gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and uncontrolled asthma. It&#xD;
      will determine if genotype-guided lansoprazole dosing of lansoprazole improves GER and asthma&#xD;
      control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: Poorly controlled asthma especially in children remains a major public health&#xD;
      problem. Many children with poor asthma control experience gastroesophageal reflux (GERD).&#xD;
      The effect of mild GERD on asthma remains controversial despite studies involving proton-pump&#xD;
      inhibitors (PPIs) assessing their effect on asthma. Past inconsistent findings regarding the&#xD;
      effect of PPIs on asthma control may have resulted from ineffective dosing strategies of&#xD;
      proton-pump inhibitors employed in these studies. Drug levels and efficacy vary widely in the&#xD;
      population and depend on genetics. Dosing in children which adjusts for the gene CYP2C19 may&#xD;
      improve efficacy and reduce side-effects leading to improved asthma control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: #1: The investigators hypothesize that genotype-tailored lansoprazole dosing will&#xD;
      reduce asthma symptoms in children with mild symptoms of GERD compared to placebo. #2:&#xD;
      CYP2C19 and ABCB1 genetic variants influence the pharmacokinetics (drug levels) of&#xD;
      lansoprazole as determined by population pharmacokinetic modeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: The investigators will conduct a 6-month randomized controlled trial comparing&#xD;
      genotype-tailored lansoprazole dosing versus matched placebo in the control of asthma&#xD;
      symptoms in 6-17 year olds with asthma and mild reflux. All participants will have baseline&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics analysis following a single genotype-tailored dose to assess the effects of&#xD;
      CYP2C19 and ABCB1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPACT: These results would be a major advance in the science of safe dosing of proton-pump&#xD;
      inhibitors in children and for the management of the millions of children struggling with&#xD;
      reflux and asthma.&#xD;
