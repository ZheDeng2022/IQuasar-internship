  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with elevated blood pressure are at higher risk of having a heart attack or stroke&#xD;
      than people with lower blood pressure. Losing a modest amount of weight-such as 15 or 20&#xD;
      pounds-can reduce the risk of having a heart attack or stroke. However, it can often be a&#xD;
      struggle to maintain weight loss over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study examines whether two behavioral weight-management programs can help people&#xD;
      maintain weight loss over time. In this study, 346 adults will be randomly assigned (like&#xD;
      flipping a coin) to one of the 12-month programs and followed for 36 months (i.e., 3 years)&#xD;
      to see how their body weight may change.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized trial will test the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of novel modules&#xD;
      administered prior to weight loss that are explicitly designed to enhance enjoyment of&#xD;
      healthy lifestyle behaviors independent of any longer-term health effects, and thus escalate&#xD;
      the proportion of individuals sustaining ≥7% weight loss over the long-term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overweight/obese individuals with elevated blood pressure will be randomized to one of two&#xD;
      12-month weight-management interventions (Fun First or Weight Watchers) and followed for 36&#xD;
      months. For Aim 1 (Primary outcome), we will test whether Fun First is more efficacious than&#xD;
      Weight Watchers using a mediator-intervention interaction model with sufficient a priori&#xD;
      statistical power for the interaction effect as well as the intervention and mediator main&#xD;
      effects. The posited mediator assesses participants' change in enjoyment for four key healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle behaviors (healthy eating, physical activity, weighing and self-nurturing) via&#xD;
      online survey from 0-2 months. The primary outcome is the proportion of participants who lose&#xD;
      a clinically significant amount of initial body weight and maintain it during the trial&#xD;
      (i.e., lose &gt;=7% of their initial body weight from 0-12 months and gain &lt;=5 lbs from 12-36&#xD;
      months), assessed on clinic scales during in-person visits at the research clinic. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include the proportion of individuals sustaining ≥7% weight loss over the trial&#xD;
      assessed by digital cellular scales in participants' homes and participants' change in&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure over the trial assessed at the research clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Aim 2 (Other pre-specified outcomes), we will test whether Fun First is more cost&#xD;
      effective than Weight Watchers using both individual-level trial data and systems science&#xD;
      modeling for long-term, population-level hypertension and cardiovascular disease incidence,&#xD;
      health care and disability costs, and quality-adjusted life-years over the life course.&#xD;
