  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with cardiovascular risk (CV) factors (obesity, diabetes, etc...) or established heart&#xD;
      disease (such as coronary heart disease or chronic heart failure) often have cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction as compared to people without CV risk factors or heart disease. Among the&#xD;
      mechanisms, a reduced cardiac output and cerebral blood flow in those people have been&#xD;
      suggested. The aim of this study was to compare resting cognitive function, maximal&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary function, cardiac output and cerebral hemodynamics during exercise in&#xD;
      patients with metabolic syndrome, coronary heart disease, or heart failure vs. healthy&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

      All subjects will underwent a baseline evaluation including a medical history, physical&#xD;
      examination with measurement of height and weight, body composition and fasting blood sample.&#xD;
      All subjects will performed a cognitive testing at rest and a maximal cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      exercise test (CEPT) with gas exchange analysis. During CEPT, cerebral oxygenation (measured&#xD;
      by near-infra red spectroscopy) and cardiac hemodynamics responses (impedance cardiography)&#xD;
      will be measured continuously.&#xD;
