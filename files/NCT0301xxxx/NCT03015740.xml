  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects of sitravatinib and how well it works with&#xD;
      nivolumab in treating patients with kidney cancer that has spread to other places in the&#xD;
      body. Sitravatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed&#xD;
      for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the&#xD;
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to&#xD;
      grow and spread. Giving sitravatinib and nivolumab may work better in treating patients with&#xD;
      kidney cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the toxicities (defined as a grade 3 or 4 National Cancer Institute [NCI]&#xD;
      non-hematologic or hematologic adverse event, within 12 weeks from treatment initiation), and&#xD;
      efficacy (defined as achieving complete remission, partial remission, or stable disease&#xD;
      within 6 weeks) of sitravatinib (MGCD516) when administered orally (PO) daily in combination&#xD;
      with standard dose nivolumab 240 mg/kg every 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) times, objective&#xD;
      response rates (ORR), and quality of life (QOL) of patients with advanced clear cell renal&#xD;
      cell cancer (RCC) treated with the combination of MGCD516 and nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate potential biomarkers for patient stratification and treatment response,&#xD;
      including genetic analysis, serum cytokines and chemokines, as well as tumor antigen-specific&#xD;
      immune responses, such as antibody and T cell responses, as surrogates for anti-tumor&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive sitravatinib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-14 and receive nivolumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1 starting cycle 2. Cycles repeat every 14 days for&#xD;
      cycles 1-6 and then every 28 days for subsequent cycles in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who receive at least 6 infusions of nivolumab with no dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicities (DLTs) related to nivolumab, may then receive nivolumab every 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
