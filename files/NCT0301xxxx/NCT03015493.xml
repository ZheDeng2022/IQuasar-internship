  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:Cervical radiculopathy (CR) is a disorder of the peripheral nervous system where&#xD;
      the resulted cervical nerve root (CNR) pathology produces a chronic pain and disability.&#xD;
      Based on some epidemiological findings, CR is a common clinical diagnosis since its annual&#xD;
      incidence has been estimated to be 83 cases per 100,000, with an increased prevalence noted&#xD;
      in the fifth decade of life. In addition, C6 and C7 nerve roots are most commonly involved in&#xD;
      this disorder, mainly due to the high range of motion occurring between cervical vertebrae&#xD;
      C5-C6 and C6-C7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CR is caused by a disc herniation, or a space-occupying lesion that can result in CNR&#xD;
      inflammation, impingement, or both. In normal situations, CNRs ensure the normal function of&#xD;
      sensation, movement and motor coordination of the upper limb. Therefore, the development of&#xD;
      CR can produce sensory and motor deficits in the involved limb, including pins and needles,&#xD;
      numbness and muscle weakness, along with a neuropathic pain described as a burning or&#xD;
      shooting pain. These symptoms lead patients to exhibit severe functional limitations such as&#xD;
      difficulties to work, to sleep or to participate in hobbies. Studies on this topic identified&#xD;
      several socioeconomic and psychological deficits, from lost work and wages to prolonged pain&#xD;
      and impaired social functioning, leading patients with CR to express symptoms of anxiety and&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of CR has been the subject of debate between physiotherapists and researchers.&#xD;
      Several non-operative treatment approaches have been advocated to reduce CR pain and their&#xD;
      analgesic effect has been recognized in a number of randomized clinical trials with these in&#xD;
      turn being analyzed in few systematic reviews. Based on these studies, patients with CR can&#xD;
      benefit from a multimodal treatment approach including the application of postural education,&#xD;
      cervical traction and manual therapy techniques (mobilization, thrust manipulation etc.)&#xD;
      applied to the cervical spine. However the small number of these studies as well as their&#xD;
      poor methodological quality due to the short-term follow ups, lack of patient's homogeneity,&#xD;
      randomization or control group etc., raise several questions about the validity of research&#xD;
      findings and therefore much more studies are necessary. Among manual therapy techniques that&#xD;
      have been recommended to improve the patient's pain and functional limitations, neural&#xD;
      mobilization (NM) has been advocated as an effective treatment option. NM introduced as an&#xD;
      intervention for pain relief more than 25 years ago are techniques that involve a specific&#xD;
      sequence of joint movements to mobilize the involved peripheral nerve in order to facilitate&#xD;
      the reduced nerve gliding and reduced the increased neural mechanosensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application of NM is common but since now little research attention has been given to&#xD;
      support its usage in patients with CR. Recently, a case study and a randomized controlled&#xD;
      study concluded that neural mobilization applied simultaneously with cervical traction can&#xD;
      produce clinically meaningful improvements over a 4-week period, in terms of pain,&#xD;
      disability, function, grip strength and cervical spine range of motion. However, both&#xD;
      methodological designs did not allow determining whether NM provided these benefits. Thus,&#xD;
      the purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of cervical traction with or&#xD;
      without the addition of NM, in patients with CR.&#xD;
