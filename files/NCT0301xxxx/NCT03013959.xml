      As is reported, NSAIDs(pranoprofen ,bromfenac) eye drops can suppress herpes simplex&#xD;
      virus（HSV-1） reactivation and reduce inflammatory reaction in vitro and in vivo. In Clinical,&#xD;
      there is no risk of corneal tissue melting, glaucoma, cataract by topical application of&#xD;
      NSAIDs. To explore more effective clinical treatment of viral keratitis patients to control&#xD;
      the inflammatory damage, save the visual function and reduce the recurrence of the virus ,we&#xD;
      observe the effect of anti-inflammatory and inhibition of recurrence on the herpes simplex&#xD;
      virus after topical NSAIDs administration.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Viral keratitis has now become the highest incidence and the most severe-caused blindness&#xD;
      corneal disease in the worldwide, as is superior to bacterial keratitis and fungal keratitis.&#xD;
      At present, clinical treatments mainly depend on local and systematic use of antiviral drugs&#xD;
      for viral keratitis, which can inhibit replication of viruses in corneal tissues and directly&#xD;
      damage viral action. However, basal studies for viral keratitis have suggested that&#xD;
      pathological immune injury produced by the body also play an important role in the formation&#xD;
      of corneal ulcer, the damage of visual function in patients, during the necrotic stromal&#xD;
      inflammation phase, endotheliitis phase and even serious combination of iridocyclitis phase&#xD;
      of viral keratitis. There is, however, a larger controversy in the hormone therapy for this&#xD;
      disease clearly caused by pathological immune injury in medical world. Patients with&#xD;
      infectious keratitis caused by viral infection, who receive hormone treatment, may cause&#xD;
      viral replication enhanced and out of control, and hormone itself could also cause&#xD;
      spontaneous corneal tissues fusion; hence, treatments combined with hormone have a certain&#xD;
      risks. In clinical treatments, permanent corneal opacity caused by corneal inflammation&#xD;
      responses will cause patients permanent visual acuity loss, after patients' corneal lesions&#xD;
      were controlled with simple use of antiviral drugs. Another important reason is the high&#xD;
      incidence of blindness caused by viral keratitis: herpesvirus, such as herpes simplex virus&#xD;
      and herpes zoster virus, will involve trigeminal ganglia and hide after primary infection,&#xD;
      and will repeatedly recur under the stimulation of excessive drinking, menstruation, taking a&#xD;
      cold and operation etc.. Viral keratitis often does not cause patients severe visual&#xD;
      impairment at initial onset. But, viruses in patients with herpes simplex virus keratitis&#xD;
      show extremely high recurrence rates. As suggested in epidemiologic studies in the&#xD;
      Euro-American countries, its recurrence rate could be up to 30% in the first year, and 46% in&#xD;
      the second years. In most cases, transparent corneal tissues develop nephelium and even&#xD;
      macular nebula opacities after repeated recurring, and patients eventually lose visual&#xD;
      acuity, becoming people with blindness and disabilities. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs,&#xD;
      such as pranoprofen and bromfenac sodium, show significant inhibition of virus recurrence and&#xD;
      relief of corneal inflammation responses in experiments in vitro and animal experiments,&#xD;
      which indicated in previous studies. In clinical, local application of nonsteroidal&#xD;
      antiinflammatory drugs does not result in spontaneous corneal tissue fusion, drug-induced&#xD;
      glaucoma, drug-induced cataract and other risks. In order to seek more effective clinical&#xD;
      treatments for viral keratitis patients in terms of controlling inflammation injury,&#xD;
      preserving visual functions and reducing virus recurrence, this study observed that&#xD;
      pranoprofen, a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, inhibits pathological immune injury of&#xD;
      viral keratitis and prevents this disease recurring, according to the basal research&#xD;
      background of viral keratitis.&#xD;
