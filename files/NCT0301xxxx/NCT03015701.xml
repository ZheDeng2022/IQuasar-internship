        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have a histologically documented primary, recurrent or residual&#xD;
             meningioma which is unresectable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have active meningioma, which is defined to be one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Progressive disease within the past 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Recurrent Disease, as defined by the reappearance of a previously completely&#xD;
                  resected meningioma, within the past two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. New disease, defined as a diagnosis of meningioma within the previous two years&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease which is documented on CT or MRI&#xD;
             scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients should have already received radiotherapy unless radiotherapy is&#xD;
             inappropriate due to tumor location(s) or unless radiotherapy, after discussion with&#xD;
             the patient's physician, has been refused. If patients have received prior&#xD;
             radiotherapy, this treatment must have been completed more than one year prior to&#xD;
             study entry with documented progressive disease since completion of radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must be 18 years or older, and must have a performance status 0-2 by&#xD;
             Southwest Oncology Group criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must not have received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for meningioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must have serum creatinine, SGOT, and bilirubin â‰¤ 2 x IULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients requiring simultaneous administration of corticosteroids for cerebral edema&#xD;
             must have been receiving a stable dose of corticosteroids for at least 4 weeks prior&#xD;
             to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients receiving anti-epileptic medications are eligible. However barbiturates&#xD;
             should be avoided if possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients with meningiomatosis (diffuse meningeal infiltration resulting in only&#xD;
             nonevaluable meningeal thickening) are not eligible. However, patients with multiple&#xD;
             measurable or evaluable meningioma tumor masses are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients with malignant meningioma are not eligible. Malignant meningioma is defined&#xD;
             as meningioma that demonstrates hypercellularity, loss of architecture, nuclear&#xD;
             pleomorphism, numerous mitoses, focal necrosis, and brain invasion.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients who have had additive or ablative modulation of sex hormone or glucocorticoid&#xD;
             pathways within the preceding 3 months (not including stable corticosteroid therapy&#xD;
             for cerebral edema) are not eligible. Such modulations include but are not limited to&#xD;
             birth control pills, bilateral oophorectomy or orchiectomy, progestational inserts,&#xD;
             oral or vaginal exogenous estrogens, androgens or antiandrogens, progestational&#xD;
             agonists, tamoxifen, aminoglutethimide, o,p-DDD, ACTH, glucocorticoids not for&#xD;
             cerebral edema, and leuprolides (or other LH-RH inhibitors). Patients must not have&#xD;
             received prior mifepristone therapy for meningioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients must not have serious intercurrent medical illness; that is, any illness that&#xD;
             in the opinion of the investigator would prevent following the study regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients with clinical adrenal insufficiency requiring exogenous corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patients with a known allergy to mifepristone are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Patients with base of brain, cavernous sinus or optic nerve meningiomas or with visual&#xD;
             symptoms must have a formal visual field examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Pregnant or lactating women may not participate. Pre-menopausal women and men of&#xD;
             reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective&#xD;
             local contraceptive method (such as a condom, diaphragm, or IUD) or abstinence during&#xD;
             and for 3 months after study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Patients with other prior or concurrent malignancy within the preceding 5 years,&#xD;
             except surgically treated squamous or basal cell skin cancer or cervical cancer in&#xD;
             situ, are not eligible.&#xD;
