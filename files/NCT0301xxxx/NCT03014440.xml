  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if cannabidiol is safe and effective at different&#xD;
      doses as an additional treatment for pediatric drug-resistant epilepsy. Pure cannabidiol has&#xD;
      potentially therapeutic properties, such as anti-convulsant effects, that may reduce seizure&#xD;
      frequency. There are only a few open label studies that have demonstrated the safety and&#xD;
      tolerance of cannabiodiol in both adult and pediatric epileptic populations--these studies&#xD;
      were performed either retrospectively or with varying cannabidiol preparations. There are no&#xD;
      well-documented studies and completely analyzed data for pediatric epileptic patients.&#xD;

             following):&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Failure to control seizures despite appropriate trial of 3 or more AEDs at&#xD;
                  therapeutic doses&#xD;

             tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Epilepsies associated with an inborn error of metabolism, including mitochondrial&#xD;
             disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Felbatol initiated within the past 12 months&#xD;
