  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The focus of this application is on the improvement of services for African American (AAs)&#xD;
      Veterans afflicted with an alcohol use disorder. The project focuses on the use of topiramate&#xD;
      as a treatment for alcohol use disorders. Despite having lower rates of heavy drinking than&#xD;
      European Americans (EAs), AAs have significantly higher rates of mortality from a variety of&#xD;
      alcohol-related conditions, including liver cirrhosis, accidents, and violence. Despite the&#xD;
      higher rates of morbidity and mortality, pharmacological treatments are understudied in this&#xD;
      population and there is some evidence that medications are less preferred and less effective&#xD;
      in AAs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Objective(s): Despite having lower rates of drinking and heavy drinking than European&#xD;
           Americans (EAs), African Americans (AA) have significantly higher rates of mortality&#xD;
           from a variety of alcohol-related conditions, including liver cirrhosis, accidents, and&#xD;
           violence. The current proposal aims to improve alcohol treatment in AA Veterans, who&#xD;
           comprise 12% of the Veteran population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Research Design: The proposed study is a two-arm, randomized 12-week, parallel-groups&#xD;
           comparison of topiramate versus placebo to reduce the frequency of heavy drinking days&#xD;
           and increase the number of abstinent days in 160 AA patients with AUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Methodology: The following specific aim is used to direct the methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Specific Aim 1. Understanding health disparities. Aim 1 will focus on the screening&#xD;
           process, using the screening outcomes data, including reasons for patients declining to&#xD;
           participate in the trial, to conduct descriptive analyses of the screening process and&#xD;
           recruitment efforts. We will supplement this description by examining changes in&#xD;
           drinking and motivation for treatment before and during the pandemic. In the resultant&#xD;
           manuscript, we will also discuss strategies for recruiting a minority population to&#xD;
           participate in addiction treatment studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Specific Aim 2. Future study planning with safety results. Aim 2 will focus on assessing&#xD;
           the safety and tolerability of topiramate dosing, which will provide the basis for&#xD;
           evaluating the risks associated with topiramate treatment for reducing heavy drinking in&#xD;
           AAs. The additional participants will greatly improve our effect size estimate, pooling&#xD;
           across sites; for example, the width of a confidence interval on a difference in means&#xD;
           at the end of the study based on a sample of size 80 will be 61% of the width of a&#xD;
           corresponding confidence interval based on a sample of size 30. In addition, two sites&#xD;
           will also provide information on treatment-by-site heterogeneity, which will be useful&#xD;
           for informing the design of a multi-site trial, which we believe is the best option for&#xD;
           recruiting an adequate sample for a well powered efficacy trial. To increase the number&#xD;
           of subjects exposed to topiramate treatment, we will randomize participants to a 2:1&#xD;
           ratio of topiramate to placebo treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Specific Aim 3. Combined analysis with available RCT datasets. We have data available&#xD;
           from two completed RCTs of topiramate that used a design almost identical to that of the&#xD;
           present study (n's = 138 and 170, including 16 AAs). We plan to conduct an analysis that&#xD;
           combines the data from the three trials, to test for differences in efficacy by&#xD;
           population group (i.e., AAs and EAs), and to compare adverse event profiles across&#xD;
           population groups. Combining the datasets will allow analyses that incorporate&#xD;
           individual-level heterogeneity, in contrast to meta-analyses, where typically only group&#xD;
           comparisons would be possible. This will be accomplished using de-identified data from&#xD;
           each study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Impact/Significance: The proposal is innovative in that it will focus on AAs with AUD,&#xD;
           an understudied and underserved population for whom no such data currently exist. Given&#xD;
           the far-reaching effects of AUD and its high prevalence among Veterans, added evidence&#xD;
           based treatments may realize reduced health care costs from unnecessary ED visits and&#xD;
           reduced complications of illnesses such as hepatitis C and congestive heart failure.&#xD;
