      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the effect of the Trust-building weight&#xD;
      Self-management Together (TRUST) intervention on weight self-management behaviors and neural&#xD;
      processing in overweight/obese adolescents. Study aims include comparing the effects of the&#xD;
      TRUST intervention with Enhanced Usual Care on BMI and quality of life in overweight/obese&#xD;
      early adolescents and exploring differences in neural processing (DMT/TPN switching and&#xD;
      reward activation).&#xD;

      Background Adolescent obesity is a serious concern in the US, placing young people at risk&#xD;
      for multiple chronic conditions. Family-based interventions are most effective with this&#xD;
      challenge1, but adolescents' trust of their parents diminishes around age 14 as a result of&#xD;
      developmental brain changes2-4. This distrust may thwart family-based weight self-management&#xD;
      interventions; therefore, in this study the investigators will assess the effects of building&#xD;
      trust between adolescents ages 10-12 and their parents, alongside weight self-management&#xD;
      skills. Trust is a reciprocal quality between dyads that crosses the cognitive, affective,&#xD;
      and behavioral domains and consists of honesty, receptivity to disclosures, and perceived&#xD;
      compatibility between one's actions and words, which results in a sense of psychological&#xD;
      safety from criticism, embarrassment, or harm.5 Because of its central role in&#xD;
      adolescent-parent social interactions/relationships, trust may be a key factor in acquiring&#xD;
      and sustaining healthy behaviors. Despite literature supporting the importance of&#xD;
      interpersonal social interactions in making behavior change1,6, no studies to date have&#xD;
      simultaneously examined both the biological and behavioral pathways through which trust in&#xD;
      interpersonal interactions elicits behavior change. Thus, we employ a study design that&#xD;
      includes basic research on the role of trust as a putative intervention target for behavior&#xD;
      change in the context of an ongoing experimental clinical study testing the effects of a&#xD;
      family trust-building behavioral intervention designed to reduce BMI in overweight/obese&#xD;
      adolescents. We posit that adolescent-parent trust is a unique and potentially important&#xD;
      interpersonal communication putative target to engage behavior change to improve healthy&#xD;
      eating, physical activity, and sleep in overweight/obese adolescents, which will in turn&#xD;
      reduce BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research in the area of cognitive processing has identified two broad cortical neural&#xD;
      networks, the Task Positive Network (TPN), which is involved with using skills, knowledge and&#xD;
      self-monitoring for problem solving and goal-directed action, and the Default Mode Network&#xD;
      (DMN), which focuses on emotion-management, self-awareness and relationships. Neural network&#xD;
      activity is consistently observable on fMRI. These broad networks tend to be antagonistic,&#xD;
      such that when one network is activated, the other is inhibited; this inhibition/activation&#xD;
      of the two modes may have important implications for self-management efforts, since an&#xD;
      individual can only efficiently adopt one mode-processing either tasks or emotions--at a&#xD;
      given time.7,8 The Analytic v. Emotional network theory suggests that flexible and balanced&#xD;
      activity between modes is optimal9-11 and may be modified by learning/training, including&#xD;
      practices such as meditation.12&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the work of one of the SMART Center Core leaders 7,13, Dr. Anthony Jack, fMRI revealed&#xD;
      that individuals, when presented with an analytical (mechanical) problem, tended to activate&#xD;
      analytic processing while deactivating empathic (emotional) processing. Conversely, when&#xD;
      presented with a social problem, individuals tended to deactivate the analytic processing&#xD;
      pathways in favor of increased emotional processing. These compelling findings provide an&#xD;
      intriguing new way to examine an individual's approach to health behaviors and provide a new&#xD;
      view into the brain-behavior connection. Jack's work 14,15 has shown that &quot;coaching&quot; exerts a&#xD;
      dose-dependent effect on brain regions associated with motivation. In particular, focused&#xD;
      training increased activity in the ventral-medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC in left side of&#xD;
      Figure 2) and adjacent regions of sub-genual anterior cingulate and nucleus accumbens. These&#xD;
      regions, which are part of the default mode network, are implicated in motivation. In&#xD;
      addition to identifying differences in brain function and connectivity,15 we are also&#xD;
      examining any structural changes in brain anatomy brought about by the interventions. These&#xD;
      are hypothesized to occur in the same regions as functional changes.16,17 Prior studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that residual activity in the DMN, during the performance of tasks sub served by&#xD;
      the TPN, causes errors and lapses of attention.18,19 On the other hand, the DMN plays a key&#xD;
      role in social cognition and motivation, specifically the generation of affective meaning&#xD;
      15,20,21 or purpose in life. A key hypothesis is that effective tuning of DMN function is&#xD;
      essential for effective TPN function, which is required for successful self-management.&#xD;
      Although neural and cognitive capacities which underlie self-management behavior may be&#xD;
      non-specific in nature, identifying key mechanisms and signatures of effective interventions&#xD;
      will better inform theoretical frameworks of self-management science.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance Our premise is that self-management interventions that target both analytic and&#xD;
      emotional components of neurocognitive processing will be most effective in helping&#xD;
      individuals achieve self-management outcomes. We are using functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (fMRI) to examine the relationship between two large-scale cortical networks, the&#xD;
      default mode network (DMN) and the task positive network (TPN), and their contributions to&#xD;
      behavior. Numerous studies have demonstrated that these networks may suppress each other, as&#xD;
      measured both during task performance and in the resting state, which represents a marker of&#xD;
      psychological health 22. The investigators interpret these findings as the ability to&#xD;
      flexibly move between distinct cognitive modes associated with each network 13. A key&#xD;
      hypothesis is that effective tuning of DMN function is essential for effective TPN function,&#xD;
      and in turn, optimal performance of self-management activities. We posit that the TRUST&#xD;
      intervention will influence the adolescent's emotional (DMT) neural processing through the&#xD;
      trust-building component, while the analytic (TPN) neural processing will be influenced by&#xD;
      the skills building component of the intervention, both of which work together to promote&#xD;
      healthy weight self-management behaviors 23. In addition, the investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      the TRUST intervention will influence the adolescent's neurological reward activation between&#xD;
      social reward and palatable food reward demonstrated in the ventral striatum 24,25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As demonstrated in our model-consistent with the P30 Center of Excellence in Self-Management&#xD;
      Research (SMART) framework being used for all SMART Center studies-the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that an adolescent's weight self-management behaviors are influenced by the&#xD;
      ability of the individual to balance DMT and TPN neural processing. the investigators posit&#xD;
      that a reduction of body mass index (BMI) and an improvement in quality of life (QOL) will&#xD;
      result from weight self-management behaviors (eating, physical activity, sleep) as mediated&#xD;
      by two neural processes (DMT/TPN task-switching, reward activation), adolescent trust of&#xD;
      parent, parent trust of adolescent, adolescent/parent relationship quality, social support,&#xD;
      decision-making, self-efficacy, patient activation, and self-regulation. The influence of&#xD;
      potential moderators (gender, binge-eating, perceived stress, depressive symptoms, executive&#xD;
      functioning, parenting style) will be assessed for their effect on the relationship between&#xD;
      the intervention and the proximal and distal outcomes. The investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      two-group intervention trial to describe the effects of the TRUST intervention on BMI, QOL,&#xD;
      and cognitive task switching between the DMT and TPN neural networks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the findings confirm the hypotheses, the intervention can serve as a model for improving&#xD;
      adolescent weight self-management behaviors. The conduct of this project will also provide&#xD;
      invaluable insights on the neurocognitive underpinnings of trust-building and its role as a&#xD;
      facilitator of adolescent weight self-management. Specifically, the knowledge gained from&#xD;
      this project will provide a foundational evidence on how trust-building in primary&#xD;
      relationships can lead to enhanced states of self-management and reward sensitivity.&#xD;
      Improvements in weight self-managements behaviors have shown to improve health outcomes.&#xD;
      Successful weight self-management behaviors are associated with increased survival and&#xD;
      decreased morbidity. If successful, this trust-building weight self-management will provide&#xD;
      an acceptable and feasible self-management intervention that allows parents and adolescents&#xD;
      to work together to improve the health and well-being of the family. In general, the&#xD;
      potential benefits of this project outweighs the potential risks, and we have an experienced&#xD;
      team of investigators and research staff that are prepared to address the minimal risks that&#xD;
      may occur.&#xD;

      Purpose/Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the effect of the Trust-building weight&#xD;
      Self-management Together (TRUST) intervention on weight self-management behaviors and neural&#xD;
      processing in overweight/obese adolescents. The aims of this two-group randomized trial are&#xD;
      to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare the effects of the TRUST intervention with Enhanced Usual Care on BMI and QOL in&#xD;
           overweight/obese early adolescents;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the extent to which gender, binge-eating, perceived stress, depressive&#xD;
           symptoms, executive functioning, and parenting style moderate the effect of TRUST on BMI&#xD;
           and QOL;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare the effects of the TRUST intervention with Enhanced Usual Care on weight&#xD;
           self-management behaviors (eating, physical activity, sleep);&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine the extent to which gender, binge-eating, perceived stress, depressive&#xD;
           symptoms, executive functioning, and parenting style moderate the effect of TRUST on&#xD;
           weight self-management behaviors (eating, physical activity, sleep); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Explore differences in neural processing (DMT/TPN task-switching, reward activation) in&#xD;
           the TRUST intervention and Enhanced Usual Care group outcomes.&#xD;
