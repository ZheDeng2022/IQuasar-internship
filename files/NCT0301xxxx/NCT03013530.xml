  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new law about the advance directives (AD) has been recently voted in France on February 2,&#xD;
      2016. This &quot; Claeys-Leonetti &quot; law has made the AD more binding, as in other countries. This&#xD;
      should lead to a greater respect of the human autonomy principle. However, the interpretation&#xD;
      of these guidelines is often difficult and may differ between doctors. Indeed, the&#xD;
      subjectivity of these interpretations could lead to different medical decisions by&#xD;
      physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to assess the effect of advance directives (AD) on decision making&#xD;
      in care by intensivists, using a simulated (hypothetical) situation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Observational simulation (hypothetical) study of intensivist decisions for selected real&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient writes advance directives (AD) after receiving clear information (videos and&#xD;
      interview with an independent intensivist).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensivists answer to 5 questions for two simulations (hypothetical) models (scenario) on&#xD;
      pneumonia and occlusive syndrome, in 3 times: without the AD, with AD, and with AD by knowing&#xD;
      the drafting conditions (information from intensivist).&#xD;
