    <textblock>
      The Investigators will examine if DC-STAMP can serve as an early marker of TNFi response in&#xD;
      PsA. Identification of such a biomarker would permit rapid transition to a new agent, a major&#xD;
      treatment advance. TNFi are the most effective therapies in PsA, however, methotrexate is&#xD;
      frequently initiated early in the disease course based on its significantly lower cost.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the efficacy of MTX has not been supported in clinical trials and up to 40% of&#xD;
      patients do not respond to TNFi therapy. Moreover, valid biomarkers to predict MTX or TNFi&#xD;
      responses are currently unavailable. This study may also provide the first data on the&#xD;
      comparative efficacy of MTX and TNFi using clinical, Ultrasound (US) and biomarker outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriatic arthritis (PsA), an inflammatory joint disease associated with psoriasis (Ps),&#xD;
      affects approximately 650,000 adults in the United States and is associated with increased&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Bone damage develops in half these patients within the first two&#xD;
      years of the disease, often leaving them with impaired function and diminished quality of&#xD;
      life. The emergence of anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor therapies (TNFi) has dramatically improved&#xD;
      clinical response and slowed bone and cartilage degradation in PsA patients, however, only&#xD;
      50-60% of patients respond to these agents. To improve these outcomes, the investigators must&#xD;
      address two major gaps: a limited understanding of key events that underlie pathologic bone&#xD;
      destruction and the absence of biomarkers to predict biologic response and identify early&#xD;
      biologic responders to facilitate optimization of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone damage is mediated by osteoclasts which arise from monocyte precursors in the blood.&#xD;
      Osteoclast Precursors (OCPs) are dramatically increased in PsA, compared to controls,&#xD;
      particularly in patients with bone damage on X-ray. The number of these circulating precursor&#xD;
      cells dropped rapidly following treatment with TNFi. OCPs may serve as response biomarkers,&#xD;
      but cost, time and high variability limit these assays. Osteoclast precursors express&#xD;
      Dendritic Cell-Specific Transmembrane Protein (DC-STAMP), which is a seven-pass transmembrane&#xD;
      protein required for fusion of monocytes to form osteoclasts and giant cells. Monocyte&#xD;
      DC-STAMP levels dropped rapidly following treatment with TNFi. TNF receptor-associated factor&#xD;
      3 (TRAF3), an inhibitor of OC formation that correlates with extracellular TNF&#xD;
      concentrations, is elevated in OCPs from PsA patients. These markers may predict TNFi&#xD;
      treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to examine DC-STAMP in Psoriatic Arthritis patients prior to and&#xD;
      after starting standard of care treatment with a TNFi or non-biologic DMARD. We will also&#xD;
      examine PsA patients with low disease activity on standard of care TNFi and PsA patients with&#xD;
      low disease activity on standard of care non-biologic DMARDs will serve as controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three groups of subjects will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Longitudinal: 30 subjects starting out on standard of care treatment with a TNFi or&#xD;
           non-biologic DMARD will take part in the longitudinal section of the study. Subjects may&#xD;
           be asked to have a blood draw at one additional visit before starting therapy for&#xD;
           additional research assays if they are DC-STAMP positive. If the longitudinal subjects&#xD;
           that return for an additional blood draw before starting medication have unusable sample&#xD;
           data, they will be replaced by additional longitudinal subjects out of the 30 enrolled&#xD;
           longitudinal participants to get sufficient data results of two subjects. The subjects&#xD;
           with unusable data will continue in the longitudinal follow up study visits as intended.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cross sectional: 36 patients will take part in the cross-sectional part of the study. 18&#xD;
           patients on stable non-biologic DMARDS and 18 patients on stable TNFi will be compared&#xD;
           in the cross-sectional part. This population should be in good disease state such that&#xD;
           their disease is controlled and treatment will not need to be changed. If longitudinal&#xD;
           subjects fit the cross-sectional criteria and wish to participate, they will be&#xD;
           re-consented for the cross-sectional part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           While 66 subjects will be studied in both the longitudinal and cross-sectional studies&#xD;
           combined, up to 80 PsA subjects may be consented to allow for screen failures and to&#xD;
           replace longitudinal subjects who withdraw or are lost to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assay Development: Up to 40 PsA or healthy subjects may be enrolled for blood draw for&#xD;
           assay development and to test development of techniques for ultrasound comparison and&#xD;
           scoring system validation.&#xD;
