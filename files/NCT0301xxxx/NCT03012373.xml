      This is an open-label, randomized, 2-sequence, cross-over study evaluating the difference of&#xD;
      efficacy between ear acupressure alone and ear acupressure plus electroacupuncture therapy&#xD;
      both combined with methadone treatment services for heroin addicts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Methadone substitution therapy has been the treatment of first choice for opiate dependence,&#xD;
      but patient on Methadone substitution therapy report a wide side effects, and relapse rate is&#xD;
      up to two third of methadone treatment patients between one to two years. Therefore, adjuvant&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions for heroin addiction patients are needed. Since 1996, the World&#xD;
      Health Organization (WHO) has classified acupuncture treatment indications, including drug&#xD;
      abuse. The purpose of this study is to compare the difference of efficacy between ear&#xD;
      acupressure alone and ear acupressure plus electrical acupuncture therapy both combined with&#xD;
      standard methadone maintenance therapy to the heroin addicts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who receive methadone were randomly assigned to sequence A and B. Sequence A(n=20)&#xD;
      receive ear Acupressure combined with electroacupuncture for four weeks, followed by one week&#xD;
      wash-out period. Then ear acupressure alone for another four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequence B(n=20) receive EAR acupressure alone for four weeks first, and followed by one week&#xD;
      wash-out period, then ear acupressure combined with electroacupuncture for another four&#xD;
      weeks. Measures of methadone dosage and using the craving visual analog scale (VAS) to assess&#xD;
      the craving severity for 8 weeks. Using the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the&#xD;
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) to assess improvement of life quality and sleep&#xD;
      quality. Using Beck anxiety and Depression inventory to evaluate emotional problems. Urine&#xD;
      opiate screenings are provided after 4 weeks , 8 weeks treatment and 1 month after end of&#xD;
      treatment, to screen opiate reuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis was acupuncture had more clinical efficacy than ear acupressure upon&#xD;
      craving severity, life quality, mood stability ,reduced methadone dosage and sleep quality&#xD;
      when provided as an adjunct to a standard methadone maintenance treatment.&#xD;
