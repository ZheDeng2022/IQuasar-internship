      1. Name of Investigational Products Huangkui capsule&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Trial Topic A Randomized, Double-blinded, Parallel, controlled, Multicenter Clinical&#xD;
           Trial ofHuangkui Capsule in Treating Type II Diabetic Nephropathy (DKD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Trial Objectives Primary objective: To evaluate HuangKui capsule efficacy for treatment&#xD;
           of type II diabetes ACR.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary objective: To evaluate the efficacy of HuangKui capsule on 24-hour urinary&#xD;
           protein changes、reduce PCR-increase eGFR, improve micro-inflammatory state, and&#xD;
           improving Traditional Chinese medicine clinical efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Trial Design Designed as a block randomized, double-blinded, parallel controlled,&#xD;
           multi-center clinical tria 4.1 Multi-center: The trial is proposed to be conducted in&#xD;
           the department of Nephrology or Endocrinology of nine hospitals simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2 Randomization:Using stratified block randomized design. The randomization numbers&#xD;
           were generated with SAS statistical software.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3 Arms: The study subjects were divided into 3 arms: Huangkui arm, controlled arm and&#xD;
           combined treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.4 Estimation of subject numbers&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study was based on the main indicator ACR to calculate the sample size, according&#xD;
           to the clinical protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
           ①The change of ACR of Irbesartan combined with Huangkui capsule is superior than&#xD;
           Irbesartan monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ②The changes of ACR in the monotherapy group were significantly lower than those in the&#xD;
           irbesartan monotherapy group According to the experience of clinical treatment, it was&#xD;
           found that the change of ACR was about 12.85mg / g before treatment with Irbesartan&#xD;
           combined with Huangkui capsule group and 6.50mg / g before and after treatment with&#xD;
           Irbesartan group, and α = 0.05 (bilateral (1-β) = 80%, the standard deviation of the&#xD;
           change value before and after ACR treatment with irbesartan combined with Huangkui&#xD;
           capsule group was 17.18, Check the sample size calculation formula The number of samples&#xD;
           in each group was calculated as n western medicine group = n combined treatment group =&#xD;
           110 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Another group based on the clinical treatment experience to take the standard deviation&#xD;
           of 17.18, take α = 0.025 (unilateral test), β = 0.2, that is, the degree of control&#xD;
           (1-β) = 80% of the case, the non-inferior boundary value of 6.50mg / g, according to the&#xD;
           non-inferior test sample size calculation formula, The number of samples in each group&#xD;
           was calculated as n western medicine group = n Chinese traditional treatment group = 110&#xD;
           cases.According to the program requirements, the three groups were designed to be 1: 1:&#xD;
           1, taking into account the blanding method and 20% rejection rate. ultimately a total of&#xD;
           414 cases included in the case, each group of 138 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.5 Blinding: double-blinding. Blinding will be conducted by statisticians as two levels&#xD;
           of blinding. Level 1 Blinding: blinding of the investigational products. The&#xD;
           investigational products and comparative products use unified packaging; level 2&#xD;
           blinding: the blinding of the packaging box of investigational products.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Diagnostic criteria The etiology of Diabetic nephropathy is kidney damage, referred to&#xD;
           DN in the past (diabetic nephropathy). But in 2007, the American Foundation for Kidney&#xD;
           Disease (NKF) developed guidelines for the life quality of kidney disease (NKF / KDOQI).&#xD;
           The guidelines recommend that DKD (diabetic kidney disease) instead of DN. In 2014, the&#xD;
           American Diabetes Association (ADA) and NKF reached a consensus that DKD referred to the&#xD;
           chronic kidney disease caused by diabetes, including glomerular filtration rate (GFR)&#xD;
           which is less than 60ml.min-1.1.73m-2 or urine white Protein / creatinine ratio (ACR) is&#xD;
           higher than 30 mg / g for more than 3 months,associated with diabetic retinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During having diagnosis, if one of the following circumstances happened, we should&#xD;
           consider its CKD is caused by (1) no diabetic retinopathy; (2) GFR lower or decreased&#xD;
           rapidly; (3) a sharp increase in proteinuria or nephrotic syndrome; (4) refractory&#xD;
           hypertension; (5) urinary sediment activity;(6) symptoms or signs of other systemic&#xD;
           diseases; (7) glomerular filtration rate decreased by more than 30% within 2-3 months&#xD;
           after initiation of treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or&#xD;
           angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARB).&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2 Table of TCM symptom/signs Diagnostic dosage It is refer to &quot;Clinical research&#xD;
           guidelines of new drug of Traditional Chinese Medicine &quot;(2002 version), which published&#xD;
           by China Medical Science andTechnology Press&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Treatment options 6.1 Basic treatment 6.1.1 Anti-hypotensive We can choose&#xD;
           antihypertensive drugs Monotherapy or combined controling blood pressure expect ACEI and&#xD;
           ARB, control blood pressure in 160 / 90mmHg the following 6.1.2 Anti-hypoglycemic We can&#xD;
           use oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin for hypoglycemic, so that glycosylated&#xD;
           hemoglobin ≤ 8.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.1.3 Anti-hypolipidemic We can choose to use statins or fibrates lipid-lowering drugs.&#xD;
           6.1.4 Diet control Patients with edema should limit the salt and water, daily sodium&#xD;
           intake &lt;5g; high protein diet increased glomerular hyperperfusion, high filtration, and&#xD;
           therefore advocated the principle of high quality low-protein diet. Protein intake&#xD;
           should be a high biological value of animal protein-based, early protein intake should&#xD;
           be limited to 1g/（kg•d） 6.2 Investigational products Huangkui Capsule: produced by SZYY&#xD;

&#xD;
        9. Statistical Methods All statistical calculations were carried out using SAS v9.3&#xD;
           statistical analysis software, hypothesis testing are used bilateral test, unless&#xD;
           otherwise specified, the overall comparison between the test level = 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis includes：Three groups of subjects enrolled No., drop out and excluded&#xD;
      cases, demographic and other baseline characteristics, compliance, efficacy analysis and&#xD;
      safety analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For quantitative data, we conduct descriptive statistical analysis with cases, averages,&#xD;
      standard deviation, minimum, median, maximum, upper quartile (Q1), lower quartile (Q3) and&#xD;
      95% confidence interval (95% CI). Comparisons between treatment groups were performed using&#xD;
      either an analysis of variance or a Wilcoxon rank sum test. If the influence of covariates is&#xD;
      taken into account, a general linear model (GLM) is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistical analysis of qualitative data is given in terms of the number of cases&#xD;
      and their percentages. Count data were compared between each treatment group, using x2 test,&#xD;
      Fisher exact probability method; grade data in each treatment group or between groups before&#xD;
      and after treatment comparison analysis, Wilcoxon rank sum test. If the effects of the center&#xD;
      or other factors are taken into account, a CMH x2 test or Logistic regression is used.&#xD;
