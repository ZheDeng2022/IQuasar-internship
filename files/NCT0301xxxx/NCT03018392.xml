    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the fusion rate and clinical outcomes at 1 year of&#xD;
      20 patients with degenerative disc disease who undergo a Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody&#xD;
      Fusion (TLIF) with the Stryker Tritanium Spinal System. This is an on-label, post-market&#xD;
      outcomes study to build on the body of long-term evidence for the device.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has one or more of the following diagnoses: degenerative disc disease (DDD) at&#xD;
             one level or two contiguous levels from L2 to S1, and may also include up to Grade I&#xD;
             spondylolisthesis at the involved level(s); degenerative scoliosis for which the&#xD;
             Tritanium PL cage will be used as an adjunct to fusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Skeletally mature and ≥ 18 years old at time of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Completed at least 6 months of non-operative therapy prior to surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to sign a study specific consent and comply with the requirements of&#xD;
             the protocol including follow up visits and imaging.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  2 levels requiring surgical intervention&#xD;

          -  Non-degenerative pathology including tumor, trauma, post-laminectomy kyphosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psudeoarthrosis at the index level&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous fusion at the levels to be treated or at adjacent level&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any abnormality present which affects the normal process of bone remodeling including,&#xD;
             but not limited to, severe osteoporosis involving the spine, bone absorption,&#xD;
             osteopenia, primary or metastatic tumors involving the spine, active infection at the&#xD;
             site or certain metabolic disorders affecting osteogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of osteoporotic fracture&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of an endocrine or metabolic disorder known to affect bone and mineral&#xD;
             metabolism&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inadequate tissue coverage over the operative site or taking medications that may&#xD;
             interfere with bony/soft tissue healing including chronic steroid use&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergy to titanium or cobalt chrome or may be sensitive to materials&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune disease or a systemic disorder such as HIV,&#xD;

             posttraumatic, iatrogenic)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active systemic infection or infection at the operative site&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Current smokers&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is class 3 obese (BMI &gt;40) or overweight and can produce loads on the spinal&#xD;
             system which can lead to failure of the fixation of the device or to failure of the&#xD;
             device itself&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any mental or neuromuscular disorder which would create an unacceptable risk of&#xD;
             fixation failure or complications in postoperative care&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any neuromuscular deficit which places an unsafe load level on the device during the&#xD;
             healing period&#xD;
&#xD;
