  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-over design study in which subjects arrived to the lab and were assigned a&#xD;
      supplement to ingest. Prior to ingestion subjects completed baseline reaction time testing&#xD;
      along with a questionnaire. Thirty minutes after ingestion subjects filled out the same&#xD;
      questionnaire, completed a reaction time test, followed by a series of dynamic exercises.&#xD;
      After the last exercise was finished subjects filled out the questionnaire, completed another&#xD;
      reaction time test and repeated the series of dynamic exercises. Following the exercises,&#xD;
      subjects filled out the questionnaire and completed a fourth round of reaction time testing.&#xD;
      In total subjects would complete 2 rounds of dynamic exercises and 4 rounds of reaction time&#xD;
      testing with heart rate being recorded before and after the dynamic exercise rounds. Subjects&#xD;
      were told to wash-out for 7 days and return to the lab to complete the same testing but on&#xD;
      the alternative supplement.&#xD;

      Subjects expressing interest in doing the study, were interviewed in the Human Performance&#xD;
      Lab (HPL) to determine whether they appear to qualify to participate in the study. Qualifying&#xD;
      subjects, were then invited back to the HPL for an entry/familiarization session and be&#xD;
      verbally told all of the requirements of the study. During this session, subjects signed&#xD;
      Informed Consent Statements and completed personal and medical history questionnaires.&#xD;
      Subject were familiarized to the study protocol via a verbal and written explanation&#xD;
      outlining the study design. This included describing the testing sessions to the subjects&#xD;
      about the tests to be performed including the Makoto testing system (reaction time testing).&#xD;
      Subjects practiced several times during this session to eliminate the learning curve of using&#xD;
      new equipment. Subjects were also taken through 1 round of the dynamic exercises to ensure&#xD;
      ability to complete each exercise as needed. Subjects were then given an appointment time to&#xD;
      perform qualifying Makoto testing to achieve greater than or equal to 70% accuracy on 3&#xD;
      towers at a level 7 for three consecutive trails.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the practice session, subjects recorded all food intake via MyFitnessPal for three&#xD;
      days (3-d) prior to baseline testing. Subjects were instructed to refrain from exercise,&#xD;
      caffeine, and alcohol the day prior to baseline testing and to consume their normal breakfast&#xD;
      the morning of testing. Subjects were given a meal replacement bar in place of lunch, to&#xD;
      consume ~2 hours before their testing session. During this time, subjects had body&#xD;
      composition and hemodynamic assessments recorded. Two hours after ingestion of meal bar&#xD;
      subjects reported back to the HPL and completed a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) questionnaire, a&#xD;
      baseline Makoto prior to ingesting their assigned supplement. Thirty minutes after ingestion,&#xD;
      Makoto and dynamic exercisers were completed. This involved subjects doing a standardized&#xD;
      full body workout in 2 different rounds of exercise. After each round of exercise subjects&#xD;
      filled out the VAS and performed Makoto testing. Subject then were instructed to wash-out and&#xD;
      were scheduled for their 2nd testing session ~7 days later.&#xD;
