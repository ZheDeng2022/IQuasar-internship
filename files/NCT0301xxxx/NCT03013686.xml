    <textblock>
      The PeriAPPAC trial is a prospective randomised study comparing interval laparoscopic&#xD;
      appendectomy with follow-up MRI in patients with initially successfully treated&#xD;
      periappendicular abscess.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periappendicular abscess is generally initially treated conservatively with antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy and if necessary, drainage. Operative treatment in the acute abscess phase is&#xD;
      associated with increased morbidity and thus complicated appendicitis with a periappendicular&#xD;
      abscess is initially treated conservatively. However, there is debate on whether interval&#xD;
      appendectomy is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After initial successful conservative treatment of a CT- or MRI-diagnosed periappendicular&#xD;
      abscess, patients enrolled in the PeriAPPAC study are randomised either to interval&#xD;
      appendectomy or to follow-up with MRI at two months after the initial treatment. All patients&#xD;
      also undergo a colonoscopy, appendectomy patients prior to surgery and MRI patients after the&#xD;
      MRI (outpatient visit at endoscopy unit with information on the MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the treatment success in both treatment arms. In the interval&#xD;
      appendectomy evaluated as possible morbidity related to appendectomy and in the follow-up&#xD;
      treatment arm as possible recurrence of the appendicitis and/or abscess during a one-year&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PeriAPPAC study is a multi centre trial and the participating hospitals are Turku&#xD;
      University Hospital, Oulu University Hospital, Tampere University Hospital, Kuopio University&#xD;
      Hospital and Seinäjoki Central Hospital.&#xD;
