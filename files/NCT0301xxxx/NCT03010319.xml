      The study will evaluate the efficacy of PriMatrix Dermal Repair Scaffold in the management of&#xD;
      diabetic foot ulcers in subjects with diabetes mellitus versus the Standard of Care&#xD;
      treatment. Half of patients will be treated using PriMatrix while the other half will receive&#xD;
      Standard of Care treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a major health complication that affects up to 15% of&#xD;
      individuals with diabetes mellitus over their lifetime. The treatment of DFUs is extremely&#xD;
      challenging as these ulcers may not respond to standard of care (SC) treatment and frequently&#xD;
      become infected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advanced wound therapies like PriMatrix have become an important strategy in the treatment of&#xD;
      hard-to-heal chronic DFUs by trapping and binding the patients' own cells to rebuild the&#xD;
      dermis layer of the skin to aid in healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate the efficacy of PriMatrix Dermal Repair Scaffold in the closure of&#xD;
      DFUs in subjects with diabetes mellitus in comparison to Standard of Care treatment.&#xD;

             tissues, or skin substitutes within 30 days of randomization or is scheduled to&#xD;
             receive treatment during the study. (e.g. Regranex, Dermagraft, Apligraf, EpiFix,&#xD;
             GraftJacket, OASIS, Omnigraft, or Integra BMWD).&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subject has been treated with hyperbaric oxygen or topical oxygen therapy within 5&#xD;
             days of the Screening Visit or is scheduled to receive hyperbaric oxygen treatment or&#xD;
             topical oxygen therapy during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Subject has been treated with negative pressure wound therapy within 72 hours of the&#xD;
             Screening Visit or is scheduled to receive negative pressure wound therapy during the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. At the end of the Screening Phase the area of the study ulcer (after sharp&#xD;
             debridement) has decreased by more than 30% over the two week screening period.&#xD;
