      Hydroxychloroquine will be administered on an outpatient basis within 12 weeks after primary&#xD;
      surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy /or radiation therapy (if needed).&#xD;
      Hydroxychloroquine will be administered orally at a dose of 400 mg daily for 90 days.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive HCQ every day.&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed solid tumor that is surgically resected&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have completed all planned adjuvant therapy or are not planned for adjuvant therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤1 (Karnofsky ≥80%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to ingest oral medications (crushing and administering via PEG&#xD;
             tube is acceptable)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  platelets ≥100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  total bilirubin Less than 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min/1.73&#xD;
             m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of hydroxychloroquine on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this&#xD;
             reason, and because anti-malarial agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in&#xD;
             this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a&#xD;
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men&#xD;
             treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and four months after&#xD;
             completion of hydroxychloroquine administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and four months after&#xD;
             completion of hydroxychloroquine administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Approval for hydroxychloroquine treatment by an eye doctor, based on a screening eye&#xD;
             exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with metastatic cancer and/or cancer that is not amenable to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with significant malabsorption as determined by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases are excluded from this clinical trial because of&#xD;
             their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction&#xD;
             that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. Patients&#xD;
             with primary brain tumors amenable to surgery are allowed on this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to hydroxychloroquine or received HCQ in the past six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Caution should be taken with the use of hydroxychloroquine and any drugs known to&#xD;
             interact with it (Appendix B). Because the lists of these agents are constantly&#xD;
             changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently updated list such as&#xD;
             http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illnesses including, but not limited to,&#xD;
             ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina&#xD;
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would&#xD;
             limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that are on enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic medications.&#xD;
