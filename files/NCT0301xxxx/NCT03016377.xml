  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way is effective at&#xD;
      fighting cancer. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease:&#xD;
      antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from disease caused by&#xD;
      bacteria or toxic substances. Antibodies work by binding those bacteria or substances, which&#xD;
      stops them from growing and causing bad effects. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are&#xD;
      special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells or&#xD;
      cells that are infected. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with&#xD;
      cancers. They both have shown promise, but neither alone has been sufficient to cure most&#xD;
      patients. This study combines both T cells and antibodies to try to create a more effective&#xD;
      treatment. This investigational treatment is called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen&#xD;
      receptor cells targeted against the CD19 antigen (ATLCAR.CD19) administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous studies, it has been shown that a new gene can be put into T cells that will&#xD;
      increase their ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. A gene is a unit of DNA. Genes&#xD;
      make up the chemical structure carrying your genetic information that may determine human&#xD;
      characteristics (i.e., eye color, height and sex). The new gene that is put in the T cells&#xD;
      makes a piece of an antibody called anti-CD19. This antibody can flow through the blood and&#xD;
      can find and stick to leukemia cells because these leukemia cells have a substance on their&#xD;
      surface called CD19. Anti-CD19 antibodies have been used to treat people with leukemia but&#xD;
      have not been strong enough to cure most patients. For this study, the anti-CD19 antibody has&#xD;
      been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood a piece of it is now joined to the&#xD;
      surface of the T cells. Only the part of the antibody that sticks to the leukemia cells is&#xD;
      attached to the T cells instead of the entire antibody. When an antibody is joined to a T&#xD;
      cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor. These CD19 chimeric (combination)&#xD;
      receptor-activated T cells kill some of the tumor, but they do not last very long in the body&#xD;
      and so their chances of fighting the cancer are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary results of giving ATLCAR.CD19 cells to leukemia patients have been encouraging;&#xD;
      however, many subjects receiving this treatment have experienced unwanted side effects&#xD;
      including neurotoxicity and/or cytokine release syndrome (also referred to as cytokine storm&#xD;
      or an infusion reaction). Cytokines are small proteins that aract as e signals to other cells&#xD;
      and are the way cells talk to one another. During cytokine release syndromesyndrome, too many&#xD;
      cytokines are released and too many cells in your body react to their release. Symptoms&#xD;
      resulting from cytokine release syndrome vary from flu-like symptoms to more severe side&#xD;
      effects such as cardiac arrest, multi-system organ failure or death. We predict that about&#xD;
      50% of patients on this study will experience mild to severe cytokine release syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To help reduce cytokine release syndrome symptoms in future patients, a safety switch has&#xD;
      been added to the ATLCAR.CD19 cells that can cause the cells to become dormant or &quot;go to&#xD;
      sleep&quot;. The safety switch is called inducible caspase 9 or iC9. The modified ATLCAR.CD19&#xD;
      cells with the safety switch are referred to as iC9-CAR19 cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether receiving the iC9-CAR19 cells is safe and&#xD;
      tolerable (there are not too many unwanted effects). If you experience severe cytokine&#xD;
      release syndrome or moderate to severe cytokine release syndrome that does not get better&#xD;
      once you are given standard treatments, you may be given a second study drug called&#xD;
      rimiducid. Similar studies showed that rimiducid can to turn on the safety switch, iC9 in&#xD;
      other therapies. Using rimiducid to activate the safety switch may be done in addition to&#xD;
      treating you according to hospital guidelines and making all efforts to immediately attend to&#xD;
      your cytokine release syndrome symptoms&#xD;

      OUTLINE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cell Procurement&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood, up to 300 mL total (in up to 3 collections) will be obtained from subjects&#xD;
      for cell procurement. In subjects with inadequate lymphocyte count in the peripheral blood, a&#xD;
      leukopheresis may be performed to isolate sufficient T cells. The parameters for apheresis&#xD;
      will be up to 2 blood volumes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lymphodepleting Regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive a lymphodepleting regimen of fludarabine 25 mg/m2/day administered IV&#xD;
      over 30 min for three consecutive days and a single IV dose of cyclophosphamide 900 mg/m2&#xD;
      administered over 1 hour on the fourth day. If iC9-CAR19 T cell infusion is delayed for &gt;4&#xD;
      weeks, lymphodepletion may be repeated prior to iC9-CAR19 T cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of iC9-CAR19 T Cells&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post lymphodepletion, subjects who meet eligibility criteria for cellular therapy will&#xD;
      receive iC9-CAR19 T cells within 2-14 days after completing the pre-conditioning chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimen. We will administer iC9-CAR19 post lymphodepletion at dose levels specified. A phase&#xD;
      I trial performed by Lee et al established that 1×106 CAR19+ T cells/kg was safe and&#xD;
      associated with significant in vivo expansion and we anticipate similar results with&#xD;
      iC9-CAR19+ T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second Cell Infusion Requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be offered a second infusion based on B-cell recovery and MRD status &gt;4 weeks&#xD;
      after the initial infusion if cells are available or if the subject has sufficient stored&#xD;
      peripheral blood to manufacture additional iC9-CAR19 T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy in LCCC1541-ATL involves 1 infusion of iC9-CAR19 cells. Treatment with one infusion&#xD;
      will be administered unless:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject decides to withdraw from study treatment, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General or specific changes in the subject's condition render the subject unacceptable&#xD;
           for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second infusion with prior lymphodepletion will be given to subjects enrolled in the&#xD;
      expansion cohort and to subjects enrolled in the dose escalation cohort once the RP2D is&#xD;
      reached if they meet the eligibility requirements for lymphodepletion and infusion.&#xD;
      Specifically, only subjects with the following characteristics will be offered a second&#xD;
      infusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  B-cell recovery (defined as absolute CD19+ cell count &gt;50/μL in the blood or bone marrow&#xD;
           within 6 months of initial infusion AND/OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRD positive (defined as ≥0.01% as assessed by multi-parameter flow cytometry) with&#xD;
           CD19+ expression at any time after the initial infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  *Note that subjects who receive dose level 1 in the dose escalation will receive the&#xD;
           RP2D for their second infusion, if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed for up to 15 years after the final iC9-CAR19 T-cell infusion for&#xD;
      RCR evaluation or until death, whichever occurs first. Subjects removed from study for&#xD;
      unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse&#xD;
      event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who receive new therapy (such as hematopoietic stem cell transplant) after a cell&#xD;
      product administration will still be required to complete abbreviated follow up procedures.&#xD;
