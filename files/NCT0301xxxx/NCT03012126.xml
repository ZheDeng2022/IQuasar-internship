    <textblock>
      This project seeks to build on innovative strategies to optimize the care of low-income&#xD;
      children with a BMI â‰¥ 85th percentile. To accomplish this goal, investigators will implement&#xD;
      a new clinical-community intervention, theoretically grounded in the Integrated Clinical and&#xD;
      Community Systems of Care Model, to address obesity through optimized screening and&#xD;
      management known to be effective, e-Referrals, Healthy Weight Clinics, and the YMCA's Healthy&#xD;
      Weight and Your Child weight management program (originally known as MEND). The study will&#xD;
      examine outcomes for children that matter most to a broad group of stakeholders including&#xD;
      parents, clinicians, and public health practitioners as well as inform the care of &gt;7 million&#xD;
      children with obesity covered by the Children's Health Insurance Program or Medicaid.&#xD;

      This is a 2-arm RCT. Enrolled patients are randomized to a pediatric weight management&#xD;
      intervention (PWMI): 1)a Healthy Weight Clinic based at a federally-qualified health center&#xD;
      (FQHC), or 2) a modified Healthy Weight and Your Child intervention delivered in YMCAs. A&#xD;
      comparison sample of children receiving care in eight demographically similar FQHCs serve as&#xD;
      a comparison group.&#xD;

    <description>All families referred to the Healthy Weight Clinic intervention arm will be scheduled for a 30-45 minute orientation clinic visit to orient the child and family to the program. During this visit, the family will meet with the community health worker who will provide a schedule of clinic visits and dietitian contacts. The community health worker will assess the child's social and environmental context to allow treatment tailoring. For the first 6 months, each family will be asked to attend two clinic visits per month and complete weekly 20-30 minute contacts with the dietitian via telephone. The program aims to deliver approximately 30 contact hours in the 6-month period. This will be followed by monthly visits to the Healthy Weight Clinic and monthly calls with their dietitian.</description>

    <description>All families referred to the Healthy Weight and Your Child intervention arm will be scheduled for a 60-minute family information session to orient the child and family to the program. During this visit, the family will receive information about the program and logistics such as program schedule and format and attendance. The program is delivered over 12 months, which includes 16 weekly sessions, followed by 4 sessions delivered every other week and concluding with 5 monthly sessions. Most sessions are 2 hours in length and include a group of about 8-15 children and their caregivers. The first hour is delivered in a classroom setting and the second hour in an additional area conducive for physical activity.</description>
