  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an expanded access protocol designed to provide access of ATA230 to subjects with&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia or disease, who are intolerant to, or failed, standard&#xD;
      antiviral therapy and have no comparable treatment options.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ATA230 (third-party donor-derived CMV-CTLs) are cytotoxic T lymphocytes that specifically&#xD;
      kill cells presenting CMV protein antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an expanded access protocol designed to provide access of ATA230 to subjects with CMV&#xD;
      viremia or disease, who are intolerant to, or failed, standard antiviral therapy and have no&#xD;
      comparable treatment options. This study will enroll subjects regardless of the underlying&#xD;
      susceptibility to CMV, including allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (alloHCT), solid&#xD;
      organ transplant (SOT), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), other immunocompromised states,&#xD;
      and immune competent subjects who require therapy. Subjects must have active CMV viremia or&#xD;
      disease for ≥ 2 weeks despite treatment with antiviral therapy or must be intolerant to&#xD;
      antiviral therapy due to treatment-related toxicity or comorbidities such as renal&#xD;
      insufficiency or myelosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATA230 will be administered in cycles lasting 5 weeks (35 days). During each cycle, subjects&#xD;
      will receive intravenous (IV) ATA230 at a dose of 1×10^6 cells/kg (with an acceptable range&#xD;
      of 0.8-1.0×10^6 cells/kg) on Days 1, 8, and 15, followed by observation through Day 35.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A subject will be considered eligible to participate in the study if the following&#xD;
        inclusion criteria are satisfied:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has a clinically documented condition associated with CMV disease (eg, interstitial&#xD;
             pneumonia, hepatitis, encephalitis, retinitis, colitis) or microbiological evidence of&#xD;
             CMV viremia or tissue invasion with CMV infection (as determined by viral culture or&#xD;
             levels of CMV DNA in blood or body fluids)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The CMV disease or CMV viremia is characterized by at least one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. CMV disease is persistent or clinically progressing despite ≥ 2 weeks of&#xD;
                  antiviral therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. CMV viremia/disease is persistent or increasing (determined by quantitation of&#xD;
                  blood CMV DNA) despite ≥ 2 weeks of antiviral therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. A genetic mutation associated with antiviral drug resistance is present&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Unable to continue antiviral drugs due to drug-associated toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. No other comparable or satisfactory therapies are available for treatment of CMV&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Not eligible for any other trials supporting development of ATA230&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. For subjects who received an alloHCT, the underlying disease for which the alloHCT was&#xD;
             performed is in morphologic remission&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 3× the upper&#xD;
             limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin &lt; 2.5×ULN unless caused by CMV&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Availability of appropriate ATA230 cell lot (ie, HLA partially-matched and restricted&#xD;
             CMV-CTLs)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject or subject's representative is willing and able to provide written informed&#xD;
             consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A subject will not be eligible to participate in the study if any of the following criteria&#xD;
        are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Receiving concomitant investigational therapy (co-enrollment in a non-interventional&#xD;
             study or a study for follow-up or sample collection only is permitted)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Need for antimetabolite agents (eg, methotrexate), or extracorporeal photopheresis&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Antithymocyte globulin or similar anti-T cell antibody therapy ≤ 4 weeks prior to the&#xD;
             first dose of ATA230 (on Day 1 of Cycle 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Need for vasopressor or ventilator support&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pregnancy, except when ATA230 is clearly needed&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Female of childbearing potential or male with a female partner of childbearing&#xD;
             potential unwilling to use a highly effective method of contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Inability to comply with study procedures&#xD;
