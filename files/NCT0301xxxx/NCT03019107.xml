  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether neuromuscular electrical&#xD;
      stimulation applied to the abdominal wall muscles in synchrony with exhalation can increase&#xD;
      the strength of the respiratory muscles in prolonged mechanical ventilation patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the U.S. over 500,000 patients have difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation every&#xD;
      year. These patients cost the health care system $16 billion annually and have an increased&#xD;
      risk of medical complications and morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major factor responsible for weaning failure is the imbalance between decreased respiratory&#xD;
      muscle strength and excessive respiratory load. This study includes an investigational device&#xD;
      that applies electrical stimulation to the abdominal muscles in synchrony with exhalation.&#xD;
      This is hypothesized to improve the strength of the respiratory muscles. The long term goal&#xD;
      of this project is to determine whether this approach can reduce the number of days taken for&#xD;
      patients to wean from mechanical ventilation.&#xD;

Breath synchronized abdominal NMES: VentFree prototype (VF03) that delivers electrical stimulation pulses to the abdominal muscles during exhalation with a frequency of 30 Hz, a pulse width of 350 µs and 90% of the maximum current that the participant can tolerate. These stimulation parameters were selected to cause a tetanic (continuous) contraction of the abdominal muscles, without pain for the patient. Stimulation will be administered for 30 minutes 2 times per day, 5 days per week, for 6 weeks; or until the patient is weaned from mechanical ventilation.</description>

Sham breath synchronized abdominal NMES: Modified VentFree prototype (VF03) that delivers stimulation pulses to the abdominal muscles during exhalation with a frequency of 10 Hz, a pulse width of 100 µs and current set to 10 milliamp. These stimulation parameters were chosen to cause a twitch contraction of the abdominal wall muscles. Stimulation will be administered for 30 minutes, 2 times per day, 5 days per week, for 6 weeks; or until the patient is weaned from mechanical ventilation.</description>

Breath synchronized abdominal NMES: VentFree prototype (VF03) that delivers electrical stimulation pulses to the abdominal muscles during exhalation with a frequency of 30 Hz, a pulse width of 350 µs and 90% of the maximum current that the participant can tolerate. These stimulation parameters were selected to cause a tetanic (continuous) contraction of the abdominal muscles, without pain for the patient. Stimulation will be administered for 30 minutes 2 times per day, 5 days per week, for 6 weeks; or until the patient is weaned from mechanical ventilation.</description>

            <description>Breath synchronized abdominal NMES&#xD;
Breath synchronized abdominal NMES: VentFree prototype (VF03) that delivers electrical stimulation pulses to the abdominal muscles during exhalation with a frequency of 30 Hz, a pulse width of 350 µs and 90% of the maximum current that the participant can tolerate. These stimulation parameters were selected to cause a tetanic (continuous) contraction of the abdominal muscles, without pain for the patient. Stimulation will be administered for 30 minutes 2 times per day, 5 days per week, for 6 weeks; or until the patient is weaned from mechanical ventilation.</description>
