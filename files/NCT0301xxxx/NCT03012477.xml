  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination of drugs as a possible treatment for&#xD;
      triple-negative breast cancer that has spread to other areas of the body. The names of the&#xD;
      study interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cisplatin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AZD1775&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved AZD1775 as a treatment for&#xD;
      any type of cancer. Cisplatin is FDA approved for other cancers and has been shown to be an&#xD;
      active treatment for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZD1775 is a drug that is designed to block a protein called Wee-1 which may control the&#xD;
      ability of certain cancer cells to grow or divide. Cisplatin works by damaging the DNA inside&#xD;
      the cancer cells which prevents them from dividing. By combining AZD1775 and Cisplatin,&#xD;
      cancer cells may potentially be more effectively killed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are looking to determine whether the combination of&#xD;
      AZD1775 and cisplatin is an effective treatment for triple negative breast cancer that has&#xD;
      spread to other parts of the body.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior chemotherapy: Patients may have received 0-1 prior chemotherapeutic regimen for&#xD;
             metastatic breast cancer and must have been off treatment with chemotherapy for at&#xD;

             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Availability of a tissue block from initial breast cancer diagnosis and/or metastatic&#xD;
             recurrence. If a tissue block is not available, 10-20 unstained slides may be provided&#xD;
             as an alternative. If unstained slides will be provided, they should not be sent until&#xD;
             specifically requested by the DFCI study coordinator. If archival tumor tissue is not&#xD;
             available, a fresh biopsy may be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the first stage of the trial, at least 10 patients with biopsy-accessible disease&#xD;
             must be willing to undergo paired research biopsies. These biopsies will occur 5-48&#xD;
             hours after the C1D1 cisplatin dose (ie. C1D2or C1D3) and 5-8hrs (+/- 24hrs) after the&#xD;
             last dose of AZD1775 on C2D3. The exact timing of the biopsy relative to receipt of&#xD;
             study treatment should be accurately recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Biopsies may be done with local anesthesia or intravenous conscious sedation,&#xD;
                  according to standard institutional guidelines.&#xD;

               -  Research biopsies requiring general anesthesia are not allowed on this protocol&#xD;
                  unless a biopsy is being obtained simultaneously for clinical reasons, in the&#xD;
                  judgment of the patients' treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who undergo an attempted on-treatment research biopsy and in whom&#xD;
                  inadequate tissue is obtained are still eligible to continue protocol therapy.&#xD;
                  They will not be required to undergo a repeat biopsy attempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If dosing is delayed placing the biopsy outside of the allowable window, the&#xD;
                  biopsy should be rescheduled to be within the window. If not feasible, the biopsy&#xD;
                  should be obtained as close to within the window as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Fine needle aspirates (FNA) is not allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of AZD1775 on the developing human fetus are unknown. Women of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use enhanced methods of contraception.&#xD;
             All women are considered to be of childbearing potential unless they fulfill one of&#xD;
             the following criteria at screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Post-menopausal defined as age ≥50 and amenorrheic for at least 12 months OR&#xD;
                  Women age &lt;50 if they have been amenorrheic for at least 12 months and have a&#xD;
                  serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) level in&#xD;
                  the postmenopausal range (per institutional standards).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If women have documentation of irreversible surgical sterilisation by&#xD;
                  hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral&#xD;
                  tubal ligation, they are considered post-menopausal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Appropriate contraception should be used from the time of screening, throughout the&#xD;
             duration of study participation, and for four months after the last dose of AZD1775.&#xD;
             Acceptable methods of contraception include abstinence, tubal ligation, intra-uterine&#xD;
             devices, and vasectomised partner. All methods of contraception (with the exception of&#xD;
             total abstinence) should be used in combination with the use of a condom by the male&#xD;
             sexual partner for intercourse. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, the participants&#xD;
             treating physician should be informed immediately. Additionally, male patients should&#xD;
             refrain from donating sperm from the start of dosing until 6 months after&#xD;
             discontinuing AZD1775. If male patients wish to father children they should be advised&#xD;
             to arrange for freezing of sperm samples prior to the start of study treatment.&#xD;

             progression for ≥ 1 month after treatment, or hemorrhage for ≥ 2 weeks after treatment&#xD;
             and no ongoing requirement for corticosteroids, as ascertained by clinical examination&#xD;
             and brain imaging (magnetic resonance imaging or CT scan) during the screening period.&#xD;
             Any corticosteroid use for brain metastases must have been discontinued without the&#xD;
             subsequent appearance of symptoms for ≥2 weeks before the first study drug. Treatment&#xD;
             for brain metastases may include whole brain radiotherapy, radiosurgery, or a&#xD;
             combination as deemed appropriate by the treating physician. Patients with CNS&#xD;

                  weeks prior to Day 1 of dosing and withheld throughout the study until 2 weeks&#xD;
                  after the last dose of study drug. sensitive substrates of CYP2C8, CYP2C9,&#xD;
