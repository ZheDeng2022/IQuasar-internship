  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single arm, open-label, interventional trial of pembrolizumab (MK-3475)&#xD;
      in patients with osteosarcoma who have experienced disease relapse or progression after at&#xD;
      least one line of systemic treatment, and who are not eligible for curative surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with osteosarcoma, who are not eligible for surgery of curative intent and have&#xD;
      completed at least one line of systemic therapy, will be considered for treatment with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab. Patients who are considered medically unfit for chemotherapy and where no&#xD;
      other treatment options are believed to be of major benefit may also be considered. Patients&#xD;
      will receive pembrolizumab for up to 35 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, who have received 35 cycles of pembrolizumab or discontinued study treatment of&#xD;
      another reason than progression, will in the follow-up period be assessed for safety and&#xD;
      treatment-related toxicity (for up to 90 days), progression and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have achieved a clinically meaningful response after 35 cycles of pembrolizumab,&#xD;
      defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and stable disease (SD) assessed by&#xD;
      the Investigator by using RECIST, v1.1, and have not experienced any clinically significant&#xD;
      toxicity of study treatment, may be considered for reintroduction of pembrolizumab, if&#xD;
      progression is detected &gt; 8 weeks after cycle 35.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the low incidence of osteosarcoma, the inclusion rate is expected to be low, thus a&#xD;
      Simon's two-stage design is suggested. Evaluation of efficacy and safety in stage one will be&#xD;
      performed after the first 12 patients have been treated for 18 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In case of ≤2 responders; the trial ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If ≥3 responders, the trial will continue into stage II to a total number of 25&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment.&#xD;

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;

             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit&#xD;
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.&#xD;

             [qualitative] is detected).&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:&#xD;
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and&#xD;
