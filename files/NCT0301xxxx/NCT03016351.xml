    <textblock>
      After the participant meets all inclusion and exclusion criteria, they will be randomized&#xD;
      equally to either the Resistance Training group (RT) or Aerobic Training group (AT). Both&#xD;
      groups will participate in an 8 week initial control period, followed by 8 weeks of&#xD;
      supervised exercise training, followed by 8 weeks of deconditioning. All participants will&#xD;
      undergo the same assessments and procedures one time prior to the initial 8 week control&#xD;
      period, and at each of the three periods. Assessments include: blood draws; arterial&#xD;
      stiffness testing; ultrasounds of the brachial artery to measure flow-mediated dilation&#xD;
      (FMD); gluteal adipose tissue biopsies; exercise testing to determine VO2 max; body&#xD;
      composition analysis via DEXA scans; ambulatory blood pressure measurement; diet analysis via&#xD;
      food journals; medical history questionnaires; urine analysis for pregnancy; and activity&#xD;
      monitoring via accelerometer. Total participation will be 24-26 weeks.&#xD;

      This study is divided into three separate 8-week periods, the Control period, the Exercise&#xD;
      Training period and the De-training period. Testing sessions will be done at Week 0, Week 8,&#xD;
      Week 16, and Week 24 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Period (weeks 0-8): Participants will have a control period of 8 weeks. Participants&#xD;
      will be given a brochure regarding the benefits of regular exercise and nutrition on overall&#xD;
      health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline visit and eligibility assessment, Week 0: After an initial phone interview to&#xD;

             -  Begin 7 days of activity monitoring with accelerometer. V1C (5 minutes):&#xD;
                Integrative Physiology Lab&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will report to the IPL for the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           â€¢ Return the accelerometer after 7 days of activity monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exercise Training Period (weeks 9-16): Participants will participate 3 days a week in&#xD;
           either the Resistance Training group (RT) or the Aerobic Training group (AT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pre-training Testing, Week 8: After the 8 week control period, before training begins,&#xD;
           participants will report for two testing visits, and will undergo the following&#xD;
           procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           V2A (2 hours): Clinical Research Center and/or Integrative Physiology Lab: Same as V1A&#xD;

    <description>Participants will undergo a supervised endurance training program in accordance with established guidelines. Each session will be monitored by a physical therapist or exercise physiologist. Sessions will be carried out 3 times per week. During each session, participants will complete a 5 min warm-up followed by 30-45 min of endurance exercise using cycle ergometry. Intensity will be monitored using heart rate monitors during each exercise session, and each participant will receive an exercise prescription with a heart range equivalent to 65-85% of their heart rate max. Participants will be asked to complete 30 min of exercise during each session in week 1, 35 min in week 2 and 40-45 min weeks 3-8 with a 5 min cool down period.</description>

    <description>Participants will undergo a supervised resistance training program in accordance with established guidelines. Each session will be monitored by a physical therapist or exercise physiologist. Sessions will be carried out 3 times per week, 45 min per session. Muscle strength will be determined once before and once after resistance training by measuring ten repetition maximum (10 RM) for each exercise. Eight exercises (three sets; 8-12 repetitions) will be used on each of the large muscle groups (leg press, leg extension, leg curl, chest press, shoulder extension, biceps curl, abdominal crunch and back extension). In addition, workloads will be progressively increased if the patients can lift the weight more than 12 repetitions.</description>
