  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most people will experience a psychologically traumatic event, such as a life-threatening&#xD;
      accident, at some point in their life. In the initial days after such an event, it is common&#xD;
      to be haunted by intrusive memories: image-based memories of the event that spring to mind&#xD;
      unbidden. Intrusive memories can be distressing in their own right, but are also a hallmark&#xD;
      symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep is important for many functions involved in how people perceive, respond to and&#xD;
      remember events, including stressful/traumatic events. Studies with patients who have&#xD;
      experienced traumatic events indicate that sleep disturbances in the first weeks post-trauma&#xD;
      are associated with later PTSD symptoms. However, in a previous study with healthy volunteers&#xD;
      exposed to experimental trauma (film footage), those who were sleep-deprived in the first&#xD;
      night, compared to those who slept, had fewer intrusive memories in the following week. This&#xD;
      raises the question of how sleep in the first night, but also the first week, after real-life&#xD;
      trauma is related to subsequent intrusive memories and PTSD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is an observational study of patients recruited from a hospital emergency&#xD;
      department after a traumatic event. After completing brief baseline questionnaires in the&#xD;
      emergency department, participants will be asked to fill in a daily diary of their sleep and&#xD;
      intrusive memories over the following week. Post-traumatic stress symptoms, anxiety and&#xD;
      depression will be assessed by post/online at one week and two months. Participants will be&#xD;
      telephoned after two months to complete an interview to assess PTSD symptoms and an optional&#xD;
      feedback interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical study will be the first to assess the relationship between sleep in the first&#xD;
      night and week, and intrusive memories and mental wellbeing after real-life trauma. Findings&#xD;
      may have implications for developing simple sleep-based preventive treatments after trauma in&#xD;
      the future.&#xD;
