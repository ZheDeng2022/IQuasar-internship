  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to track initiation and the first year of clinical use of the&#xD;
      newly FDA approved 670G closed loop insulin delivery system by patients who have requested&#xD;
      this system. Our goal is to evaluate our clinical approach to starting this newly approved&#xD;
      system. Since the investigators are only following patients who have already decided to start&#xD;
      the 670G, the investigator does not assign specific interventions to the subjects of the&#xD;
      study; thus this is a Observational study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      3.1 Initial Procedures After reviewing the patient's interest and eligibility, the&#xD;
      investigators will obtain informed consent and assent as appropriate. The investigators will&#xD;
      start the clinical process for starting an insulin infusion pump. This typically involves&#xD;
      attending a pre-pump class (for those patients naïve to insulin pump therapy) and starting&#xD;
      the process to obtain insurance coverage for the 670G system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to track the insurance approval process, typically the number of calls&#xD;
      and faxes required, as well as the result - approved vs not approved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Pump Run-in (for those patients new to insulin infusion pumps) For patients who are&#xD;
      insulin pump naïve the investigators will start on 670G insulin pump without the glucose&#xD;
      sensor activation as per our existing clinical protocol. This may occur at a group visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Initial Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      During at an initial visit, the following procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A clinically obtained HbA1c assessment, typically done via fingerstick and DCA2000 (but&#xD;
           any equivalent NGSP-certified point-of-care or laboratory based measurement within 2&#xD;
           weeks prior to enrollment acceptable)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of medical history information including&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Demographics (date of birth, gender, race and ethnicity), diabetes history, medical&#xD;
                history, concomitant medications&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Collect data for diabetes devices (eg meters, sensors, pumps)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Brief clinical physical exam including vital signs and skin assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CareLink account creation and sharing of access if this is not already done At this&#xD;
                visit, patients will be taught how to insert and use the system glucose sensor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3.1 Initial Week on the 670G System During the following week, the system (with both pump&#xD;
      and sensor active) will be active with the PLGS on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 System Start Visit After the initial PLGS week, patients will be taught, perhaps as a&#xD;
      group, the closed loop system and the system activated. (Note: multiple days of system data&#xD;
      are required using the pump and sensor prior to the 670G system being capable of delivering&#xD;
      additional insulin for hyperglycemia. Therefore, this stage of the start-up is a function of&#xD;
      the system requirements.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5 Weekly CareLink Download and Calls For each of the next four weeks, the patient/family&#xD;
      will upload data into the CareLink system and the data will be reviewed by a member of the&#xD;
      clinical team. Adjustments to system settings will be suggested to the family as clinically&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.6 Routine 3, 6, 9 and 12 Month Clinical visits At a routine clinical visits the&#xD;
      investigators will obtain an interval medical history, physical examination, collect and&#xD;
      review of diabetes management data from all diabetes devices with an eye towards improving&#xD;
      glycemic control. The investigators will collect adverse event information regarding severe&#xD;
      hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. Patients will be advised of suggested changes in pump&#xD;
      settings&#xD;

    <description>This is an open labeled follow up of a clinical startup of a newly approved FDA closed loop insulin delivery system. It is essentially a &quot;prospective&quot; chart review of the clinically startup of a FDA closed loop system and has many elements of a quality improvement project with additional features of:&#xD;
Questionnaires about the utility and impact of the device&#xD;
