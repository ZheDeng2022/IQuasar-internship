      Generally, subjects will be followed at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 and 12-months after activation with&#xD;
      the RENOVA System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted according the following phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recruitment, baseline assessment and compatibility test: Subjects fulfilling all&#xD;
           inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled to the trial. Study&#xD;
           candidates will sign an informed consent form, complete a standard 3-Day voiding diary,&#xD;
           a quality of life questionnaire and global response assessment. Beck Depression&#xD;
           Inventory II and General quality of life questionnaires will be completed in selected&#xD;
           geographies. Study eligible subjects that have not experienced Posterior Tibial Nerve&#xD;
           Stimulation treatment in the past will undergo a compatibility test to assure proper&#xD;
           nerve conductivity. Data collected will serve as baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implantation: Patients with positive response to the compatibility test (or that&#xD;
           received Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation treatment in the past) will undergo&#xD;
           unilateral implantation 4±1 weeks following recruitment with the BlueWind RENOVA System.&#xD;
           Intra-operative sensory/motor response will be tested to confirm accurate location of&#xD;
           the implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sensation assessment and activation: After a recovery period of approximately 30±7 days,&#xD;
           subjects will complete a Brief 3-Day voiding diary and a quality of life questionnaire&#xD;
           and a sensation assessment will be conducted: subjects will undergo an acute stimulation&#xD;
           session of the tibial nerve to evaluate their sensory reaction to stimulation and&#xD;
           parameters setting will be performed according to their individual sensations.&#xD;
           Eventually, patients will be trained for system home use treatment. Therapy will be&#xD;
           delivered daily for a minimum of 30 minutes once a day and maximum of 1 hour per day (in&#xD;
           2 sessions of 30 minutes), per physician discretion. Following activation of the device,&#xD;
           patient will complete Brief 3-day voiding diaries once a week until the 1 month&#xD;
           follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-ups (1-, 2-, and 3-months post-device activation): A 3-Day voiding diary and QoL&#xD;
           questionnaire will be collected (brief 3-Day diaries on 1-, and 2-months follow up&#xD;
           visits; and a 3-Day standard voiding diary on the 3-month follow up). Global Response&#xD;
           Assessment and Beck Depression Inventory II will be collected on the 3-month follow-up&#xD;
           visit (Beck Depression Inventory in selected geographies). Stimulation parameters will&#xD;
           be checked and adjusted as needed by: (a) changing current amplitude; and/or (b)&#xD;
           changing stimulation frequency; and/or changing pulse width; and/or (c) changing the&#xD;
           number of daily treatment sessions. Location of paresthesia will be recorded in each of&#xD;
           the clinic visits. The visit at 2 months will be performed by phone call to assess the&#xD;
           patient status. Clinic visit may be followed at the discretion of the clinical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continued follow-ups: All subjects in the trial will undergo 4 additional visits (at 4-,&#xD;
           6- ,9- and 12-months post-device activation) until the end of the study at the 12-month&#xD;
           visit. Similar to the visit at 2 months, the visit at 4 months will be performed by&#xD;
           phone call to assess the patient status. Clinic visit may be followed at the discretion&#xD;
           of the clinical team. Three-Day voiding diary, Quality of Life questionnaire, Global&#xD;
           Response Assessment and Beck Depression Inventory II and General quality of life&#xD;
           questionnaires (at selected geographies) will be collected at each of those visits&#xD;
           (except for the 4- and 9-months visit in which only a 3-Day Brief voiding diary will be&#xD;
           collected). General quality of life questionnaire will be completed at the 12-month&#xD;
           visit in selected geographies. Stimulation parameters will be checked and adjusted as&#xD;
           needed. Location of paresthesia will be recorded in each of the clinic visits&#xD;
