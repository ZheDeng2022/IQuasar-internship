      The etiology of OSMF is considered to be multifactorial. However, Role of autoimmunity had&#xD;
      been suggested as one of the factors but remains unproven.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is undertaken to evaluate the presence of auto antibodies in OSMF patients&#xD;
      to pave a way for new arena of treatment with the etiology of this persistent condition&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) is a potentially malignant disorder affecting any part of the&#xD;
      oral cavity, sometimes pharynx associated with juxta epithelial fibrosis causing progressive&#xD;
      trismus leading to dysphagia. It is mainly seen in the Asian countries with more prevalence&#xD;
      in India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Etiology of OSMF is considered to be multifactorial. However, it is strongly associated with&#xD;
      the use of arecanut in various forms and also in combination with other compounding factors.&#xD;
      Autoimmunity had been suggested as one of the factors yet unproven.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies reveal that there is high incidence of Autoantibodies including antinuclear&#xD;
      (ANA), Anti smooth muscle (SMA), Anti thyroid microsomal (TMA), and anti reticulin antibodies&#xD;
      in OSMF patients. These findings have not been consistent in further studies which needs&#xD;
      further more research in this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study concentrated on quantitation of circulating immune complexes (CIC) levels which was&#xD;
      established in patients with oral cancer and oral precancerous lesions. The levels were&#xD;
      compared with that in normal controls and chronic chewers of betel quid with no signs of any&#xD;
      disease. Both patients with oral cancer and oral precancerous lesions had elevated CIC when&#xD;
      compared to both the control groups. The most interesting observations were (a) the CIC&#xD;
      levels in the chewing controls were significantly raised when compared to normal controls;&#xD;
      and (b) the CIC levels in the patients with premalignant lesions were elevated almost to the&#xD;
      same levels as in the oral cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HLA-typing was carried on areca nut chewers. however, it was unable to demonstrate a specific&#xD;
      pattern of HLA-antigen frequencies in chewers with or without the disease. It is not&#xD;
      necessarily a HLA-associated susceptibility in Oral Submucous Fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to less number of articles published on autoantibodies, this study is done to evaluate&#xD;
      the presence of such auto antibodies in OSMF patients thereby paving way for new arena of&#xD;
      treatment on par with the etiology of this persistent condition.&#xD;
