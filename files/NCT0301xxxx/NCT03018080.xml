  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and feasibility of the following&#xD;
      two regimens: Cohort A) phased regimen of pembrolizumab in which paclitaxel is followed by&#xD;
      paclitaxel plus pembrolizumab and Cohort B) concurrent regimen of paclitaxel plus&#xD;
      pembrolizumab. The primary safety objective is to evaluate the overall grade 3 or 4&#xD;
      treatment-related adverse event rate for each cohort and compare them to relevant historical&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label randomized pilot research study to determine if the study drug,&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, is safe to use in combination with a chemotherapy drug called paclitaxel. This&#xD;
      study will have the following two regimens: Cohort A) phased regimen of pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      which paclitaxel is followed by paclitaxel plus pembrolizumab and Cohort B) concurrent&#xD;
      regimen of paclitaxel plus pembrolizumab. A total of 40 evaluable subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
      over an enrollment period of 18-24 months. The study is planned to enroll approximately 20&#xD;
      evaluable subjects in each treatment cohort.&#xD;

                       per investigator discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  INR ≤ 1.5; Patients receiving anticoagulant therapy are eligible if their&#xD;
                       INR is stable and within the recommended range for the desired level of&#xD;
                       anticoagulation per investigator discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 14 days prior to receiving C1D1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate method of&#xD;
             birth control as outlined in Section 8.1.10, be surgically sterile, or abstain from&#xD;
             heterosexual activity for the course of the study and 120 days after the last dose of&#xD;

             surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year. Male subjects of&#xD;
             reproductive potential should agree to use an adequate method of contraception&#xD;
             starting with the first dose of study therapy and 120 days after the last dose of&#xD;
             study therapy. Abstinence is acceptable if this is the established and preferred&#xD;
             contraception for the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Has completed the screening requirement of a core or punch biopsy of a tumor lesion&#xD;
             per Section 5 (bone tissue not acceptable). Biopsy of the breast tumor or other&#xD;
             regional areas is acceptable (i.e. lymph nodes, skin lesions).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects who are unable to meet the screening requirement of a tumor biopsy due&#xD;
                  to inaccessible tumor, subject safety concern, or bone-only disease may submit an&#xD;
                  archived tumor specimen from primary tumor or metastatic biopsy collected within&#xD;
                  12 months from consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects who decline tumor biopsy may submit archived tumor specimen as specified&#xD;
                  above (within 12 months from consent) only after Sponsor-Investigator approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign the written informed consent&#xD;
             document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must not meet any of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Prior chemotherapy within 3 weeks, prior targeted small molecule therapy or radiation&#xD;
             therapy within 2 weeks, or prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) for direct&#xD;
             anti-neoplastic treatment within 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1) from adverse events due to agents previously&#xD;
             administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
             o Note: Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy or alopecia of any grade are an exception&#xD;
             and may qualify for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. More than three prior lines of chemotherapy for HER2-negative metastatic disease or&#xD;
             for locally advanced disease that is not amenable to resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
             o Note: Non-Chemotherapy regimens do not count as prior lines (ex: hormonals,&#xD;
             biologics)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2 agent or with an&#xD;
             agent directed to another co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (e.g. CTLA-4, OX-40, CD137) or&#xD;
             has participated in Merck MK-3475 trial(s) and received MK-3475 as part of protocol&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any&#xD;
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has had major surgery within 3 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has received any other investigational agents within 4 weeks of Cycle 1 Day 1 of study&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Known active uncontrolled or symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases&#xD;
             and/or carcinomatous meningitis as indicated by clinical symptoms, cerebral edema,&#xD;
             and/or progressive growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
             o Note: Subjects with treated CNS metastases are eligible if they are asymptomatic,&#xD;
             have no requirement for steroids, no requirement for anticonvulsants, and stable CNS&#xD;
             radiographic study showing no significant vasogenic edema ≥ 4 weeks since completion&#xD;
             of radiation and ≥ 2 weeks since discontinuation of steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of known allergic reaction to paclitaxel&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the&#xD;
             trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening visit through 120 days&#xD;
             after the last dose of trial treatment. Pregnant women are excluded from this study&#xD;
             because paclitaxel is an agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient&#xD;
             effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing&#xD;
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with paclitaxel, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with paclitaxel. These potential risks also&#xD;
             apply to pembrolizumab being used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or known acquired&#xD;
             immunodeficiency disorder (AIDS). HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with&#xD;
             paclitaxel and pembrolizumab. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of&#xD;
             lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Has known active infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years&#xD;
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs).&#xD;
&#xD;
             o Replacement therapy (i.e., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Has a known additional malignancy that progressed or required active treatment within&#xD;
             the last 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
             o Note: Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
             of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy, or in situ cervical&#xD;
             cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current&#xD;
             pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of Cycle 1 Day 1 of study therapy. o Note:&#xD;
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and&#xD;
             are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live&#xD;
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.&#xD;
