  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use mobile health technologies to provide everyday data to help patients and&#xD;
      their care providers better understand illness dynamics and develop adaptive approaches to&#xD;
      improve health outcomes in diabetes. Specifically, the study will identify strategies to help&#xD;
      patients adapt using multiple types of self-generated diabetes-related data and help&#xD;
      providers guide patients to better self-manage in real-time, when guidance is needed most.&#xD;

      The investigators will conduct a mixed-methods exploratory designed study and recruit 60&#xD;
      adult patients (age ≥ 18) with type 2 diabetes who will track relevant clinical data over 6&#xD;
      months. Participants will be asked to use a wireless glucose monitor, a cellular body scale,&#xD;
      and a wrist-worn accelerometer, and respond to short bi-weekly text message-based surveys on&#xD;
      medication adherence for 6 months. Data generated from the devices will be plotted as&#xD;
      trajectories that will allow us to conduct trajectory analyses and identify missing data&#xD;
      points and trends leading to attrition, in order to assess the feasibility of having patients&#xD;
      engage in this type of self-monitoring for 6 months. A subset of 20 patients will be&#xD;
      interviewed via telephone at the end of their 6 month self-monitoring period to discuss their&#xD;
      adaptive challenges and successes over the study period. The investigators will present the&#xD;
      trajectories of their data during patient interviews using a visual that we will e-mail or&#xD;
      postal mail, depending on patient preference. This will facilitate discussion of the&#xD;
      challenges participants face in self-management and adaptive practices participants use.&#xD;
      Following the 6 months of self-monitoring, we will conduct interviews with health care&#xD;
      providers in which the investigators will present the data trajectories and explore ways to&#xD;
      achieve continual communication and address real-time challenges with diabetes&#xD;
      self-management.&#xD;
