    <textblock>
      This is a clinical investigational plan (CIP) for the &quot;Clinical Study to Confirm MRI Safety&#xD;
      and Effectiveness Using SJM Cardiac Rhythm Management Systems (ASSURE MRI)&quot;. This study&#xD;
      intends to enroll patients who meet standard bradycardia or tachycardia indications and have&#xD;
      already been implanted with one of the SJM device/lead combinations listed in this protocol.&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to confirm the safety and effectiveness of each of the four&#xD;
      SJM device/lead combinations in an MRI environment. This clinical investigation is sponsored&#xD;
      by St. Jude Medical.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center clinical study designed to confirm the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of St. Jude Medical low voltage pacemakers, high voltage dual chamber&#xD;
      Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators (ICD), and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy&#xD;
      Defibrillators (CRT-D) with various leads in an MRI environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll subjects across multiple geographies and sites. Sites in geographies&#xD;
      where MRI labelling is not yet approved may also be included after appropriate IRB/EC and&#xD;
      local regulatory approvals, as applicable, are obtained. A prospective, multi-center study&#xD;
      design is chosen for generalizability of study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical study will be conducted in approximately 40 centers worldwide. Approximately 88&#xD;
      subjects total (with a minimum 22 subjects for each of the four device/lead combinations)&#xD;
      will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment in the study is expected to take approximately 6-8 months. Subjects will be&#xD;
      followed for 1 month following the MRI scan. The total study duration of the study is&#xD;
      expected to be 10 months, depending on the rate of enrollment.&#xD;

        Subjects who meet standard bradycardia or tachycardia indications comprise the target&#xD;
        population for this study. The subject will be considered enrolled in the study after the&#xD;
        consent is signed and the MRI Settings have been programmed at the MRI visit.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are implanted with one of the following SJM device/lead combinations evaluated in this&#xD;
             study for at least 60 days (can include patients with an eligible SJM lead for ≥ 60&#xD;
             days OR patients with a new eligible SJM pacemaker, Implantable&#xD;
             Cardioverter-Defibrillators (ICD), or Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillators&#xD;
             (CRT-D) device and eligible SJM lead implanted for at least 60 days:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Accent MRI™, Assurity MRI™, Endurity MRI™, or Endurity pacemaker with Tendril™&#xD;
                  STS Model 2088 lead&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Accent MRI™, Assurity MRI™, Endurity MRI™, or Endurity pacemaker with IsoFlex™&#xD;
