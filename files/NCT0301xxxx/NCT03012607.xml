    <textblock>
      Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) are critical to&#xD;
      the success of HIV treatment and therapeutic prevention. No accurate, objective point-of-care&#xD;
      test is available to monitor adherence to either ART or PrEP. The inability to accurately&#xD;
      identify poorly adherent patients will lead to more HIV infections (from failed PrEP and&#xD;
      non-suppressive ART), more drug-resistant virus (selected by failing ART), and unnecessary&#xD;
      switching to costly second- or third-line ART (when first-line regimens with virologic&#xD;
      efficacy but non-adherence are stopped inappropriately). To address this critical knowledge&#xD;
      gap, the investigators have developed a novel point-of-care test to detect the presence of&#xD;
      tenofovir-the most common drug in both ART and PrEP treatments worldwide-in fingerprick blood&#xD;
      or urine as an objective measure of ART and PrEP adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our central hypothesis is that the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir in blood and urine will&#xD;
      support point-of-care tenofovir detection as an objective measure of adherence, and that our&#xD;
      point-of-care tenofovir assay will have the ability to discriminate different drug adherence&#xD;
      levels. The investigators will test our central hypotheses by pursuing the following two&#xD;
      specific aims: (1) To assess our novel point-of-care tenofovir (TFV) assay in whole blood and&#xD;
      urine specimens within a controlled pharmacokinetic study of HIV-negative adults receiving&#xD;
      tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) with low, moderate, and perfect adherence; and (2) To&#xD;
      validate our novel point-of-care tenofovir (TFV) assay on blood and urine specimens using an&#xD;
      existing biorepository from a real-world clinical HIV prevention study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work is innovative because it develops an entirely new category of rapid diagnostic&#xD;
      testing for monitoring ART and PrEP adherence at the clinical point of care. Our rapid assay&#xD;
      will help clinicians identify patients in need of more adherence counseling, which when&#xD;
      implemented will prevent HIV acquisition, emergence of drug resistant virus, and unnecessary&#xD;
      ART regimen switching-measures that will improve national HIV programs and help preserve the&#xD;
      global supply of an effective HIV medication.&#xD;

      Objectives of the Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To determine the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir (TFV) in blood, urine and plasma in adults&#xD;
      with perfect, median and low adherence to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the rate of tenofovir washout in blood, plasma and urine among participants&#xD;
           with various levels of TDF adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the steady-state concentrations of TFV in blood and plasma among controlled&#xD;
           levels of TDF adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the agreement between TFV in blood, plasma and urine concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the intracellular tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP) trough concentrations in&#xD;
           peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and dried blood spot (DBS) samples in adults&#xD;
           with perfect, median and low drug adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify possible concentration thresholds for the clinical interpretation of a&#xD;
           binary point-of-care adherence test for measurement of TFV (and/or TFV-DP) in relation&#xD;
           to adherence to TDF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a randomized, open-label pharmacokinetic study in healthy adult&#xD;
      volunteers. The study involves collection of clinical data and biological specimens, and&#xD;
      subjects will provide written informed consent to participate. Healthy adult volunteers (HIV&#xD;
      serology and hepatitis B surface Ag negative) will be enrolled. Once written consent is&#xD;
      obtained, the screening visit will be performed. The study team will obtain each&#xD;
      participant's phone number, address, and relevant contact information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant screening will be performed within 14 days of enrollment. A detailed background&#xD;
      demographic and health questionnaire will be administered. Ten mL of blood will be drawn for&#xD;
      baseline assessments: complete blood count, HIV antibody testing, Hepatitis B surface Ag&#xD;
      testing, renal and liver function tests and storage of blood in the biorepository. The blood&#xD;
      and chemistry tests will be used to exclude subjects with any abnormal laboratory test among&#xD;
      neutrophil count, hemoglobin, platelets, AST, or ALT. An abnormal test will be defined as&#xD;
      Grade ≥3 by DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events,&#xD;
      Version 2.0 Nov. 2014). The results of the clinical examination and baseline laboratory&#xD;
      assessments will be reviewed for inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Entry:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All entry visits will begin on a Monday morning. After receiving in-depth information on the&#xD;
      study schedule, subjects meeting the inclusion criteria will be enrolled and randomized&#xD;
      (1:1:1) into one of 3 groups to receive a controlled number of doses of Truvada® (Gilead&#xD;
      Sciences Inc.), which contains tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF, 300 mg) and emtricitabine&#xD;
      (FTC, 200 mg) for 6 weeks. The participant will be carefully explained about their&#xD;
      drug-dosing schedule, visit schedule and potential medication side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will enroll a total of 30 adults with evaluable PK samples (10 per group). All&#xD;
      participants will start TDF in the morning of the Entry visit. The 6-week treatment period&#xD;
      was chosen in order to ensure concentrations of tenofovir in the different matrices (i.e.&#xD;
      blood, plasma, urine, PBMCs) mimic the expected conditions in patients with chronic dosing of&#xD;
      perfect, median and low drug adherence. The blood/urine sampling schedule is based on the&#xD;
      reported tenofovir plasma half-life and results of previous PK studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tenofovir concentrations will be determined in each participant during three study phases (1)&#xD;
      lead-in period, (2) intensive PK sampling, and (3) wash-out period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Lead-in Period (Entry to 6 weeks) Visit Prior to 2nd Dose: Immediately prior to the&#xD;
      second dose (i.e. Group 1: 24 post-dose (Day #2; Tuesday Morning); Group 2: 48 hours&#xD;
      post-dose (Day #3; Wednesday Morning); and Group 3; 72 hours post-dose (Day #4; Thursday&#xD;
      Morning) the subject will return to the hospital. A single blood sample will be drawn (5 mL).&#xD;
      From this venous blood sample, 5 dried blood spots (50 µL/spot) will be prepared on a Whatman&#xD;
      903 filter paper card. The remaining blood will be centrifuged and the plasma stored. A&#xD;
      single fingerstick whole blood sample will be collected and on a second Whatman 903 filter&#xD;
      paper card 2 dried blood spots (50 µL/spot) will be prepared. A separate 10 mL blood drawn&#xD;
      will be taken to collect PBMCs for determination of intracellular tenofovir-DP&#xD;
      concentrations. Finally, a spot urine sample will be collected (5-10 mL). All samples will be&#xD;
      stored at -70°C to -80°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weeks 3 and 5 (both Monday morning, pre-dose): A single blood sample will be drawn (5 mL)&#xD;
      prior to dose administration. From this venous blood sample, 5 dried blood spots (50 µL/spot)&#xD;
      will be prepared on a Whatman 903 filter paper card. The remaining blood will be centrifuged&#xD;
      and the plasma stored. A single fingerstick whole blood sample will be collected and 2 dried&#xD;
      blood spots (50 µL/spot) will be prepared on a second Whatman 903 filter paper card. A&#xD;
      separate 10 mL blood drawn will be taken to collect PBMCs for determination of intracellular&#xD;
      tenofovir-DP concentrations. Finally, a spot urine sample will be collected (5-10 mL). All&#xD;
      samples will be stored at -70°C to -80°C. Renal and liver function tests will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Intensive PK sampling (starting Monday morning of Week 7 for 24 hours) Week 7&#xD;
      Intensive PK visit: On the Monday morning of Week 7, subjects will return to the hospital in&#xD;
      the early morning. A medical officer will conduct a physical examination and blood will be&#xD;
      drawn for laboratory safety evaluations (AST, and ALT). Following their normal morning daily&#xD;
      schedule of drug intake, a pre-dose blood sample will be drawn and a single Truvada® tablet&#xD;
      will be administered on an empty stomach (at least 6 hour fast beforehand). This will be the&#xD;
      last dose of Truvada® for all subjects. Venous blood (3 mL/time point) will be collected at&#xD;
      1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours post-dose. At each time point, a venous blood DBS (5&#xD;
      spots) and fingerstick (2 spots) will be collected. Renal and liver function tests will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine samples will be collected pre-dose and over the intervals of 0-4 hours, 4-8 hours, 8-12&#xD;
      hours, and 12-24 hours. Subjects will have an additional 10 mL blood drawn pre-dose and PBMCs&#xD;
      will be collected and stored at -70°C to -80°C. After 24 hours, the participant will be&#xD;
      discharged from the hospital. The subject will be asked to collect all their urine until&#xD;
      their next study visit in 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: Wash-out PK sampling (Weeks 7 to Week 10) Week 7 (Wednesday to Saturday): After the&#xD;
      intensive PK sampling is complete, participants will return to the clinic once a day for the&#xD;
      next 4 days (i.e. until the Saturday of Week 7) for a single venous blood draw (5mL),&#xD;
      fingerprick sample collection for dried blood spot, and a spot urine sample (5-10 mL). The&#xD;
      subject will be asked to collect all their urine until their next clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 8 (Monday and Thursday): A single venous blood draw, fingerprick sample collection for&#xD;
      dried blood spot, and a spot urine sample (5-10 mL) will be drawn on Monday and Thursday of&#xD;
      Week 8. A single PBMC sample (10 mL blood) will be collected on Monday morning of week 8&#xD;
      (i.e. 1 week since last TDF dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 9 (Monday): A single venous blood draw, fingerprick sample collection for dried blood&#xD;
      spot, and a spot urine sample (5-10 mL) will be drawn on Monday. A single PBMC sample (10 mL&#xD;
      blood) will also be collected on Monday (i.e. 2 weeks since last TDF dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 10 (Monday): A single venous blood draw, fingerprick sample collection for dried blood&#xD;
      spot, and a spot urine sample (5-10 mL) will be drawn on Monday. A single PBMC sample (10 mL&#xD;
      blood) will also be collected on Monday morning (i.e. 3 weeks since last TDF dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Study visit (i.e. end of Week 10):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single venous blood draw, fingerprick sample collection for dried blood spot, and a spot&#xD;
      urine test (5-10 mL) will be drawn on Monday. A single PBMC sample (10 mL blood) will also be&#xD;
      collected on Monday (i.e. 4 weeks since last TDF dose). A renal and liver function tests will&#xD;
      be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this time the participants will have completed the study and no additional evaluations&#xD;
      will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tenofovir concentrations will be measured using validated liquid chromatography-triple&#xD;
      quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assays at the Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences&#xD;
      at Chiang Mai University. Intracellular tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP) concentrations will be&#xD;
      determined using a validated a LC-MS based assay.&#xD;
