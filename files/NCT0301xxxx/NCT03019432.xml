      In this study, the researchers will investigate whether the E-effect is present in stroke&#xD;
      subjects both on the subjective visual and postural vertical test. In addition, researchers&#xD;
      will investigate the impact of the loss of different sensory information sources on the&#xD;
      sensory reweighting strategies and perception of verticality by measuring the effect of&#xD;
      somatosensory loss on the E-effect.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postural control emerges from the interaction between the task, the environment and the&#xD;
      individual. Within the individual, an efficient interaction between motor, sensory and neural&#xD;
      systems is needed in order to maintain postural control.(1) One of the neural processes is&#xD;
      the integration of afferent information such as visual, vestibular and somatosensory input to&#xD;
      construct a body-centred frame of reference in the gravitational environment.(2) This frame&#xD;
      of reference must be vertically aligned with the gravitational vector to ensure axial&#xD;
      extension of the body keeping the centre of gravity within the base of support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of the sensory modalities has a relative load contribution in the estimation of&#xD;
      verticality depending on the task and the environment.(3) In healthy subjects, when certain&#xD;
      modalities are absent or information seems biased e.g. walking in complete darkness, more&#xD;
      weight is given to other sensory input sources.(1) This reweighting of sensory information is&#xD;
      therefore key in postural responses in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, sensory reweighting is not always adequate when certain modalities are biased. In&#xD;
      verticality perception, when the roll tilt of the head is less than 60°-70°, a contralateral&#xD;
      deviation of the subjective vertical has been reported.(4) This is called the E-effect and&#xD;
      has been observed in both the Subjective Visual Vertical test (SVV) and the Subjective&#xD;
      Postural Vertical test (SPV).(5, 6) Furthermore, studies have shown that also somatosensory&#xD;
      loss has a negative impact on perceiving verticality in patients after stroke.(7) In our&#xD;
      opinion, when less afferent input sources are present, adequate estimation of the earth&#xD;
      vertical will be more difficult. Since, studies show that verticality perception is highly&#xD;
      related to postural control(8, 9), this is of major importance. In neurological conditions&#xD;
      such as stroke sensory input sources are often affected, leading to fewer options in sensory&#xD;
      reweighting strategies.(10) In this study, the researchers will explore verticality&#xD;
      perception and sensory reweighting strategies in stroke subjects. At first, the researchers&#xD;
      will investigate whether the E-effect also occurs in our sample of stroke subjects. Secondly,&#xD;
      they will investigate the effect of somatosensory loss on the extent of the E-effect. It can&#xD;
      be hypothesized that when patients have no sensory loss, more secondary afferent input is&#xD;
      available to improve estimation of the vertical and therefore less misleading by the&#xD;
      head-on-body tilt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods Study design A cohort study was designed to investigate whether the&#xD;
      E-effect occurs in people after stroke. In addition, the effect of somatosensory loss on the&#xD;
      extent of the E-effect will be investigated to provide further insights in the sensory&#xD;
      reweighting strategies. Ethical approval was given by the ethical committee with registration&#xD;
      number B300201630358 in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki 1975, revised Hong Kong&#xD;
      1989 Patients Patients were recruited from the stroke population of the rehabilitation&#xD;
      hospital Revarte, Antwerp, Belgium. All patients with a history of first stroke attending a&#xD;
      rehabilitation program were eligible for inclusion. Patients who had an age above 80; other&#xD;
      neurological and orthopaedic impairments as well as brainstem, cerebellar or multiple lesions&#xD;
      were excluded. Only strokes with an ischemic or hemorrhagic etiology were included. Patients&#xD;
      were also excluded when the subjects had pre-existing co-morbid conditions that may affect&#xD;
      vision and somatosensory function. In addition, patients with visuospatial neglect and pusher&#xD;
      behaviour were also excluded as this can affect verticality perception. This was examined by&#xD;
      a neuropsychologist and the use of the Scale of Contraversive Pushing (SCP)(11). In addition,&#xD;
      patients had to perform the assessment within three months post-stroke. Prior to inclusion,&#xD;
      the participants were asked whether they understand the instructions of tests and to sign a&#xD;
      written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures Rivermead assessment for somatosensory Performance The Rivermead Assessment&#xD;
      for Somatosensory Performance (RASP) measures different somatosensory modalities on the face,&#xD;
      hands and feet and has been noted to be a reliable and standardized assessment. Six tests are&#xD;
      administered on each of the ten (five left and five right) test regions on the face; hands&#xD;
      and feet, two tests are administered on only the face and palm of the hands. During testing&#xD;
      eyes of the participants are closed. These eight tests can be divided into six primary and&#xD;
      two secondary tests of sensation. Six trials are executed on each of the ten test regions,&#xD;
      for two of the tests sham trials were given. Sham trials increase the patient's internal&#xD;
      reliability. Patients were excluded from the statistical analysis if they had more than five&#xD;
      false positive replies, suggested by Winward et al.(12) Subjective Visual Vertical (SVV) The&#xD;
      Difra Vertitest type D107201 (Difra, Welkenraedt, Belgium) was used for SVV assessment. The&#xD;
      device has an accuracy of 0.1°. A laser bar is projected at a distance of 2.5m on an opposing&#xD;
      wall and on an altitude of 1.5m. The patients are seated in front of the device on a chair&#xD;
      without any arm- or backrests. Patients with no adequate sitting balance were assessed while&#xD;
      seated in their wheelchair. The room was darkened and five minutes of waiting period was&#xD;
      given allowing the subject to adjust the darkness. Both researcher and participant obtained a&#xD;
      remote to allow rotating the laser bar either clockwise (right) or counter clockwise (left).&#xD;
      The researcher's remote showed a display with the amount of deviation in relation to the&#xD;
      earth's gravitational vector. The researcher made the laser bar invisible and rotated it in a&#xD;
      specific angle in relation to the earth vertical. Subsequently, the line was shown after&#xD;
      which the patient had to place the line in upright position again with his nonhemiplegic hand&#xD;
      on the remote control. The amount of deviation of each starting roll position was different&#xD;
      for each trial. A specified order was followed: first the line was placed in 20° counter&#xD;
      clockwise, 10° clockwise, 5° counter clockwise and 0° according to the earth vertical,&#xD;
      followed by 5° clockwise, 10° counter clockwise and finally 20° clockwise. This series was&#xD;
      executed three times. During the first series the patient was asked to hold the head in&#xD;
      normal upright position, followed by a series with the head tilted to the left (while the&#xD;
      head was bent the subjects needed to keep their trunk upright) and finally a series with the&#xD;
      head tilted to the right side. The clockwise rotation is shown positively and the counter&#xD;
      clockwise negatively. The patients did not receive any feedback about their performance&#xD;
      during assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective Postural Vertical (SPV) The rotation chair works on hydraulic pumps and has a&#xD;
      height of 1m. On the back of the chair, a Mitutoyo digital protractor pro 3600 (Belgium) was&#xD;
      mounted. This allowed measurement of the deviation in relation to the earth vertical with an&#xD;
      accuracy of 0.01°. Both the researcher and patient were given a remote to rotate the chair&#xD;
      clockwise (right) and counter clockwise (left). Movements were restricted in the frontal&#xD;
      plane. Before the assessment started the patient was blindfolded, depriving the subjects of&#xD;
      visual information when readjusting the chair to earth vertical. The researcher rotated the&#xD;
      chair as in the procedure of SVV (starting roll position of the chair). The head-on-body&#xD;
      position is similar as in the SVV procedure. The subject had to place the chair in upright&#xD;
      position again by placing the seating surface of the chair horizontal. The patient used his&#xD;
      non-hemiplegic hand on the remote control. The clockwise rotation is shown positively and the&#xD;
      counter clockwise rotation negatively.&#xD;
