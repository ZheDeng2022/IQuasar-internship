      This study is a two phase study that aims to evaluate if low-dose Rituximab maintenance&#xD;
      therapy may prolong the the effect of Rituximab in immune thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, international, randomized, two-phase study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First phase (induction phase) is open-label, hypothesis-generating, involving 1:1&#xD;
      randomization into: rituximab (group 1) or rituximab plus dexamethasone (group 2) to&#xD;
      determine if the response to rituximab can be improved by the addition of dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second Phase (maintenance phase) is the main part of the study, involving 1:1 double-blind&#xD;
      randomization into low dose rituximab or placebo to determine if the response achieved in the&#xD;
      first phase can be prolonged by administrating maintenance treatment with low dose rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if maintenance therapy with low-dose rituximab is superior to placebo in&#xD;
      prolonging responses among ITP patients who achieved an initial response with rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To explore if the initial overall response rate, at week 24, can be improved by at least&#xD;
           10% by adding dexamethasone to rituximab (induction phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the safety of study treatment, especially infectious episodes (induction &amp;&#xD;
           maintenance phases).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess bleeding complications during the study (induction &amp; maintenance phases).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the use of rescue medications and other platelet-elevating therapies during&#xD;
           the study (induction &amp; maintenance phases).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To determine rate of Complete Response (CR) during induction phase and sustained CR&#xD;
           during maintenance phase (induction &amp; maintenance phases).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To determine the duration of overall response and CR (induction &amp; maintenance phases).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To assess health-related quality of life and fatigue (induction &amp; maintenance phases).&#xD;
