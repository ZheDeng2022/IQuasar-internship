    <textblock>
      Decontamination procedure is a challenging factor that affects the success of surgical&#xD;
      regenerative therapy (SRT) of peri-implantitis. The purpose of the present study was to&#xD;
      determine the impact of additional ozone therapy for the decontamination of implant surfaces&#xD;
      in SRT of peri-implantitis. A total of 21 patients with moderate or advanced peri-implantitis&#xD;
      were randomly allocated to the test group (ozone group) with the use of sterile saline with&#xD;
      additional ozone therapy or the control group with sterile saline alone for decontamination&#xD;
      of the implant surfaces in SRT of peri-implantitis. Clinical and radiographic outcomes were&#xD;
      evaluated at baseline and 6 months postoperatively&#xD;

      Peri-implant diseases are described as inflammatory processes in the tissues surrounding&#xD;
      implants in response to mainly microbial biofilms on the surface of the implants (Zitzmann&#xD;
      and Berglundh 2008). Peri-implant mucositis is described as an inflammatory reaction&#xD;
      triggered by microbial biofilms without any loss of peri-implant bone, while peri-implantitis&#xD;
      is characterized by bleeding when probed and/or suppuration with further loss of the&#xD;
      peri-implant bone (Lindhe and Meyle 2008; Lang and Berglundh 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since microbial biofilms play a major role in the etiology (Becker et al. 1990; Quirynen et&#xD;
      al. 2002), it has been considered that elimination of microbial pathogens is mandatory in the&#xD;
      treatment of peri-implant diseases (Mombelli and Lang 1994; Schwarz et al. 2006). The&#xD;
      objectives of peri-implantitis therapy are implant surface decontamination to resolve&#xD;
      inflammation resolution while preserving the implant supporting tissues (Lindhe and Meyle&#xD;
      2008; Heitz-Mayfield and Lang 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several implant decontamination methods have been suggested, including mechanical&#xD;
      debridement, chemical therapy (applications of root conditioners, disinfectants, and local&#xD;
      and systemic antibiotic therapy) (Heitz-Mayfield et al. 2012; Wohlfahrt et al. 2012) and&#xD;
      surgical procedures aiming to remove bacteria, and smooth, decontaminate and detoxify the&#xD;
      implant surface (Froum et al. 2012; Schwarz et al. 2013). However, there is as yet no&#xD;
      consensus on the most effective protocol for implant surface detoxification (Suarez et al.&#xD;
      2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ozone has a strong oxidation effect with remarkable antimicrobial potential and can be used&#xD;
      as a disinfectant in clinical applications of dentistry (Iliadis and Millar 2013). A previous&#xD;
      study reported that ozone has powerful antimicrobial activity in response to anaerobic&#xD;
      periodontal pathogenic microorganisms and may have the potential to be used as an adjunctive&#xD;
      tool in non-surgical periodontal therapy in periodontitis patients (Eick et al. 2012). Ozone&#xD;
      therapy can promote haemostasis, enhance the release of growth factors and local oxygen&#xD;
      supply, upregulate cellular antioxidant enzymes and inhibit bacterial proliferation (Ozdemir&#xD;
      et al. 2013). However, current literature has little information regarding the antimicrobial&#xD;
      activity of ozone in the treatment of peri-implant diseases. A previous randomized, clinical&#xD;
      study showed that ozone therapy reduced inflammation in the treatment of peri-implant&#xD;
      mucositis (McKenna et al. 2013). Another in-vitro trial reported that in the reduction of&#xD;
      adherent bacteria on titanium, gaseous ozone showed selective efficacy without any adverse&#xD;
      effect on the surface structures of the titanium surfaces or the adhesion and proliferation&#xD;
      of osteoblastic cells (Huser-Gerspach et al. 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-surgical therapy alone has been reported to be inadequate for the treatment of moderate&#xD;
      and severe forms of peri-implantitis and therefore surgical therapy is frequently required&#xD;
      (Lindhe and Meyle 2008). The goals of surgical therapy of peri-implantitis are mainly to be&#xD;
      able to access areas for mechanical debridement and implant surface decontamination and to&#xD;
      reconstruct the anatomic conditions to improve plaque control and to eliminate the&#xD;
      pathological peri-implant pockets (Esposito et al. 2012; Roos-Jansaker et al. 2014). This can&#xD;
      be achieved with resection or with procedures of bone regeneration such as guided bone&#xD;
      regeneration (Roos-Jansaker et al. 2003; Schou et al 2004; Sahrmann et al. 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have evaluated the combination of various regenerative biological agents and&#xD;
      techniques for surgical regenerative therapy (SRT) of peri-implantitis and clinical and&#xD;
      radiological improvements following different bone augmentation procedures have been reported&#xD;
      (Claffey et al. 2008; Schwarz et al. 2009; Roos-Jansaker et al. 2011; Renvert et al. 2012). A&#xD;
      long-term, clinical study demonstrated that vertical peri-implant bone defects (PBDs) may be&#xD;
      actively treated by regenerative surgical means, using a bone substitute alone or in&#xD;
      combination with a membrane (Roos-Jansaker et al. 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet concentrates are preferred in periodontal surgical procedures for the purpose of&#xD;
      accelerating angiogenesis, stimulating the activity of osteoblasts and fibroblasts, and&#xD;
      obtaining regeneration of hard and soft tissues, including stem cells and growth factors (Del&#xD;
      Fabbro et al. 2011). These materials can be used alone or in combination with bone grafts or&#xD;
      barrier membranes. In studies employing bone grafts with the use of platelet rich fibrin&#xD;
      (PRF) or PRF alone around PBDs it has been reported that PRF leads to increased new bone&#xD;
      formation and a higher bone to implant contact ratio (Lee et al. 2012; Simsek et al. 2016). A&#xD;
      recent study reported that treatment of peri-implantitis using PRF was clinically more&#xD;
      effective than with access flap surgery alone. It was also concluded in the study that PRF&#xD;
      improves the outcomes of surgical peri-implantitis treatment (Hamzacebi et al. 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been recent developments of various techniques using platelet concentrate to&#xD;
      provide different rates of platelets, leukocytes, growth factors, stem cells and fibrin&#xD;
      matrix. Sacco developed concentrated growth factors (CGF) as a therapeutic protocol obtained&#xD;
      by separating the venous blood centrifuged using a special device in the same manner as PRF&#xD;
      (Rodella et al. 2011). It was also argued that centrifugation at a different speed provides a&#xD;
      larger, denser fibrin matrix compared to PRF, which results in improved regenerative capacity&#xD;
      and greater versatility (Sohn et al. 2009). Some recent studies have reported that CGF&#xD;
      accelerates new bone formation related to guided bone regeneration (Sohn et al. 2011; Kim et&#xD;
      al. 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this randomized, controlled clinical study was to evaluate the clinical and&#xD;
      radiological results of implant surface decontamination using sterile saline alone or in&#xD;
      combination with ozone therapy applied as surgical regenerative treatment for&#xD;
      peri-implantitis.&#xD;
