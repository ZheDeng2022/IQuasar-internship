  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The toxicity of traditional prostate cancer therapies including radical surgery and external&#xD;
      beam radiation is well known. This has prompted a move towards focal therapy where only the&#xD;
      cancerous part of the prostate is treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, studies have demonstrated very promising outcomes following focal therapy with the&#xD;
      majority of men maintaining their urinary and sexual function after therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a small proportion of men, disease recurs after focal therapy. The optimal treatment for&#xD;
      men with recurrent disease after focal therapy is yet to be defined. Patients may undergo&#xD;
      further focal therapy to the recurrent disease, undergo radiation therapy, whole-gland&#xD;
      therapy using a minimally invasive approach such as High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU)&#xD;
      or cryotherapy. Alternatively patients may undergo radical surgery where the whole prostate&#xD;
      is removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the side-effects or toxicity of any treatment for recurrent prostate cancer after&#xD;
      focal therapy has not been formally studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, the side effects of surgery and radiation therapy performed in patients that&#xD;
      have already undergone previous prostate cancer treatment have been considerable with high&#xD;
      rates of urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. However, as focal therapy leaves a&#xD;
      significant area of the prostate untreated, the investigators believe surgery after focal&#xD;
      prostate therapy will be associated with a much lower incidence of urinary and sexual&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the RAFT study is to characterise the side effects of prostate cancer surgery in&#xD;
      men that have undergone prior focal ablation therapy. In addition, the investigators wish to&#xD;
      perform a number of basic science studies to attempt to better understand why the patient has&#xD;
      experienced recurrent prostate cancer after focal therapy.&#xD;
