  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ruxolitinib phosphate when given&#xD;
      together with pembrolizumab in treating patients with stage IV triple negative breast cancer&#xD;
      that has spread to other places in the body. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such&#xD;
      as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with&#xD;
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Ruxolitinib phosphate may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving pembrolizumab and&#xD;
      ruxolitinib phosphate together may work better in treating patients with stage IV triple&#xD;
      negative breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ruxolitinib phosphate (ruxolitinib) (JAK2&#xD;
      inhibition) in combination with fixed dosing of pembrolizumab (anti PD-1) in patients with&#xD;
      advanced/metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety profile of pembrolizumab in combination with ruxolitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate clinical tumor response in women with TNBC treated with pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      combination with ruxolitinib as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
      (RECIST) version (v)1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY/CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess tumor response with immune related (ir)RECIST and associations with PDJ&#xD;
      amplification, PD-L1, PD-L2, JAK2 and phosphorylated (p)STAT3 expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the effect of combination targeted blockade on T- and B- cell immunity to&#xD;
      breast cancer tumor antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ruxolitinib phosphate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and ruxolitinib&#xD;
      phosphate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 3 or 6 months for up to 2 years.&#xD;

    <measure>Incidence of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 28 days after last dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by NCI CTCAE version 4.0. The maximum grade for each type of adverse event will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine patterns (by cohort and overall). Additionally, the relationship of the adverse event(s) to the study treatment will be taken into consideration. The rate of grade 3 or higher non-hematologic adverse events, and the rate of grade 4 or higher adverse event (hematologic and non-hematologic) will be computed each with a 95% exact binomial confidence.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Best response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as best objective status recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence. Assessed by modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Will be summarized by simple descriptive summary statistics delineating complete and partial responses as well as stable and progressive disease in this patient population (overall and by dose level).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of PDJ amplification, PD-L1, PD-L2, JAK2 expression and pSTAT3</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will be explored for any associations with response to therapy. Statistical analysis of each biomarker will be primarily descriptive. Continuous biomarker levels will be explored in a graphical manner including mean plots and plots of change and percent change from baseline and other summary measures. Any potential relationships between the baseline level or change in the level of each biomarker and clinical outcome such as overall response will be further analyzed using Wilcoxon rank sum tests or logistic regression methods, as appropriate. Association between a dichotomized biomarker and overall response will be assessed using a chi-squared test. Comparisons with 1-sided p-values =&lt; 0.10 are considered significant.</description>
