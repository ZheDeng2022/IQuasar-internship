      This phase I/II trial studies the side effect and best dose of entospletinib when giving&#xD;
      together with obinutuzumab and to see how well they work in treating patients with chronic&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukemia, small lymphocytic lymphoma, or non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back.&#xD;
      Entospletinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes need for&#xD;
      cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as obinutuzumab, may interfere with the ability of&#xD;
      cancer cells to grow and spread. Giving entospletinib and obinutuzumab together may work&#xD;
      better in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, small lymphocytic lymphoma, or&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of entospletinib administered in combination with&#xD;
      obinutuzumab in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small&#xD;
      lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and identify the dose for&#xD;
      phase 2 expansion. (Phase I) II. To evaluate the efficacy of entospletinib in combination&#xD;
      with obinutuzumab in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL, as measured by complete&#xD;
      response (CR) rate. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Objective response rate (ORR, defined as complete remission, complete response with&#xD;
      incomplete marrow recovery, partial remission and nodular partial response). (Phase II) II.&#xD;
      Event free survival defined as the interval between the date of first study treatment and the&#xD;
      date of objective signs of disease recurrence, subsequent anti-leukemic therapy, or death,&#xD;
      whichever is first reported. (Phase II) III. Safety and tolerability of entospletinib in&#xD;
      combination with obinutuzumab by adverse events (AEs). (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Peripheral blood B-cell depletion and recovery. II. Pharmacodynamics effects of in vivo&#xD;
      administration of entospletinib on NFkappaB activation and expression of anti-apoptotic&#xD;
      proteins in CLL cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Association of established biomarkers (chromosomal abnormalities, immunoglobulin heavy&#xD;
      chain [IGHV] mutational status, p53 mutational status) with response (ORR and event-free&#xD;
      survival [EFS]) to entospletinib (ENTO) in combination with obinutuzumab in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of entospletinib followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive entospletinib orally (PO) either once a day (QD) or twice a day (BID) on&#xD;
      days -7 to -1 (run-in phase) depending on the assigned dose level. Patients also receive&#xD;
      obinutuzumab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 2, 8, and 15 of the first cycle and on day 1 of&#xD;
      all subsequent cycles. Treatment with obinutuzumab repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles&#xD;
      and daily treatment with entospletinib continues every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unexpected toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 12 months&#xD;
      then every 6 months thereafter. In the event of study closure, patients who are receiving&#xD;
      study drug at the time of closure will complete an abbreviated End of Treatment (EOT) visit.&#xD;
      No additional follow up will occur.&#xD;

          -  Fertile men or women of childbearing potential unless 1) permanently sterile or 2)&#xD;
             using a highly effective measure of contraception such as condoms in males and&#xD;
             consistent and correct use of one of the following in females: intrauterine device,&#xD;
             tubal sterilization, Essure micro-insert system, vasectomy in the male partner;&#xD;
             effective contraception is required for males during treatment with study drug and to&#xD;
             continue for 3 months after the last dose of either entospletinib or obinutuzumab,&#xD;
             whichever is later; for women, effective contraception is required to continue for 18&#xD;
             months after the last dose of obinutuzumab or for 30 days after the last dose of&#xD;
             entospletinib, whichever is later&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Definition of childbearing potential: for this study, a female subject is&#xD;
                  considered of childbearing potential until becoming post-menopausal unless&#xD;
                  permanently sterile or with medically documented ovarian failure; women are&#xD;
                  considered to be in a postmenopausal state when &gt;= 54 years of age with cessation&#xD;
                  of previously occurring menses for &gt;= 12 months without an alternative cause;&#xD;
                  women of any age with amenorrhea of &gt;= 12 months may also be considered&#xD;
                  post-menopausal if their follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level is in the&#xD;
                  post-menopausal range and they are not using hormonal contraception or hormonal&#xD;
                  replacement therapy; permanent sterilization in females includes hysterectomy,&#xD;
                  bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy in a female subject of any&#xD;
                  age; permanent sterilization in males include bilateral orchiectomy or medical&#xD;
                  documentation of alternative explanation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition for which participation in the study is judged by the Investigator to be&#xD;
             detrimental to the patient with inter-current illness or psychiatric/social situations&#xD;
             that would jeopardize compliance with study requirements&#xD;
