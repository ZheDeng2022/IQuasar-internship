    <textblock>
      This pragmatic trial focuses on implementation of an evidence based process to increase&#xD;
      person-centered management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in&#xD;
      nursing homes, referred to as EIT-4-BPSD. The findings from this study will add to what is&#xD;
      known about implementation of effective interventions in nursing homes, will serve as a model&#xD;
      for other programs and care approaches, and will help facilities and staff implement quality&#xD;
      person-centered care, which is the goal of the National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care&#xD;
      and Reduce Antipsychotic Use in Nursing Homes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) include aggression, agitation,&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, apathy and hallucinations and are exhibited by up to 90% of nursing&#xD;
      facility residents with dementia. BPSD result in negative health outcomes decline in physical&#xD;
      functioning and high cost of care. In addition, BPSD put residents at risk for inappropriate&#xD;
      use of antipsychotic drugs and other restraining methods that reduce function, increase&#xD;
      social isolation, and increase risk of physical abuse. Prior NIH-funded clinical trials show&#xD;
      that behavioral approaches reduce BPSD. These behavioral approaches are endorsed as the first&#xD;
      line of treatment for BPSD. In fact, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)&#xD;
      National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care and Reduce Antipsychotic Use in Nursing Homes&#xD;
      requires that care for residents with dementia be delivered using person-centered behavioral&#xD;
      approaches. Despite regulatory requirements, less than 2% of nursing homes (also referred to&#xD;
      as facilities) consistently implement these approaches. Established barriers to use of&#xD;
      behavioral approaches include limited knowledge, skills, and experience with&#xD;
      non-pharmacological approaches, beliefs in the superiority of psychotropic medications over&#xD;
      behavioral interventions, and lack of staff motivation to use non-pharmacologic strategies&#xD;
      consistently. The proposed project responds to this gap between knowledge and practice. A&#xD;
      novel implementation approach will be tested to assure that staff in nursing homes [i.e.,&#xD;
      those who provide direct care to residents] use non-pharmacologic, behavioral approaches for&#xD;
      the management of BPSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To advance the CMS National Partnership, a comprehensive compendium of&#xD;
      peer-reviewed/expert-endorsed resources was developed for utilizing person-centered,&#xD;
      behavioral approaches for BPSD (the Nursing Home Toolkit: www.nursinghometoolkit.com). The&#xD;
      Toolkit has resources that support a theoretically-based 4-step approach that we found&#xD;
      effective in prior implementation work. The four steps include: 1. Assessment of the&#xD;
      environment and policies; 2. Education of staff; 3. Establishing person-centered care plans;&#xD;
      and 4. Mentoring and motivating staff. While the Toolkit is free and accessible, staff in&#xD;
      nursing homes need help with implementation. Implementation of the theoretically based 4-step&#xD;
      approach is guided by the Evidence Integration Triangle (EIT) framework. The EIT brings&#xD;
      together evidence and key stakeholders from the facility to influence care practices. EIT&#xD;
      includes: participatory implementation processes, provision of practical evidence-based&#xD;
      interventions, and pragmatic measures of progress toward goals. This implementation framework&#xD;
      was merged with the 4-step approach and the Nursing Home Toolkit resources to develop the&#xD;
      intervention, EIT-4-BPSD. The goal is to demonstrate that EIT-4-BPSD is an implementation&#xD;
      strategy that enables staff in nursing homes to reduce BPSD using behavioral approaches while&#xD;
      optimizing function, preventing adverse events and improving quality of life of residents. A&#xD;
      Hybrid III cluster randomized trial will be done with 50 nursing facilities randomized to&#xD;
      EIT-4-BPSD or Education Only (EO). The aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim 1: To implement and test the implementation of EIT-4-BPSD. Facility Level&#xD;
      Outcome: Research question: Do facilities exposed to EIT-4-BPSD demonstrate evidence of&#xD;
      implementation at 12 months evaluated by the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation,&#xD;
      and Maintenance (RE-AIM) criteria? For evaluation of Effectiveness within RE-AIM: Resident&#xD;
      Level Outcomes: Hypothesis: Residents in EIT-4-BPSD facilities will experience less BPSD,&#xD;
      maintain or improve function, have reduced use of psychotropic medications, experience fewer&#xD;
      adverse events, and have improved quality of life compared to residents in EO facilities. We&#xD;
      will measure these outcomes at baseline, 4 and 12 months post implementation of the&#xD;
      intervention. Facility Level Outcomes: Hypotheses: (1) EIT-4-BPSD facilities will demonstrate&#xD;
      improvements in Environment and Policy assessments that reflect support for behavioral&#xD;
      approaches for BPSD, and will have a greater percentage of residents with behavioral&#xD;
      approaches incorporated into their care plans at 12 months post-implementation when compared&#xD;
      to EO facilities; (2) We will examine Maintenance of EIT-4-BPSD facility outcomes at 12&#xD;
      months and then at 24 months post-implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim 2: Evaluation of the Feasibility, Utility and Cost of EIT Approach in EIT-4-BPSD&#xD;
      Facilities. Using descriptive and qualitative data captured during the intervention and from&#xD;
      focus groups at 12 months,use of the EIT strategy and the participatory implementation&#xD;
      process with the Stakeholder Team and facility staff will be evaluated. In addition a&#xD;
      description of the costs of implementation using an activity-based costing method will be&#xD;
      completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will add critical knowledge to what little is known about implementation of&#xD;
      effective interventions in nursing facilities. It will serve as an implementation model with&#xD;
      potential to be widely disseminated. In addition, the study will demonstrate how facilities&#xD;
      can implement person-centered dementia care and decrease BPSD, the ultimate goal of the CMS&#xD;
      National Partnership.&#xD;
