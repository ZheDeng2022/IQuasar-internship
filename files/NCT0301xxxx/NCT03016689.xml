      While the maternal-newborn exchange of airway microbiota is well-documented, no studies have&#xD;
      examined within-subject relationships among the mouth, sinuses, nasopharynx and lungs and the&#xD;

&#xD;

      bacterial communities at each anatomical site. Beginning at birth, a time-series of swabs&#xD;
      will be collected from each subject, and monitor changes in the development of microbiota&#xD;
      over time. By doing so, our studies will illuminate airway trafficking of both beneficial and&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study of microbial community dynamics is critically important to human health, including&#xD;
      how to maintain or restore a healthy microbiome. Metagenomic studies have revolutionized&#xD;
      microbiology by addressing these issues in a culture-independent manner, and have defined&#xD;
      essential roles of the microbiota in host development. The initial development of gut&#xD;
      microbiota begins in utero and is strongly influenced by exposures at birth (e.g. vaginal vs&#xD;
      caesarean birth). The initial seeding by the mother's microflora and its ensuing bacterial&#xD;
      succession is thought to have critical long-term impacts on human health. Recent longitudinal&#xD;
      studies have documented a gradual increased in bacterial diversity, non-random community&#xD;
      assembly, the effects of breast milk and introduction of table foods, and large taxonomic&#xD;
      shifts as a result of antibiotics and environmental stresses that occur during infancy. Since&#xD;
      perturbations of these early events have been linked to diabetes, cancer, mental health and a&#xD;
      range of other maladies, efforts are underway to learn how manipulation of the infant&#xD;
      microbiome to a &quot;healthy&quot; state translates into long-term clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By contrast, little attention has been paid to factors that govern the early-life development&#xD;
      of respiratory tract microbiota, including the oral cavity. At birth, the oral and&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal flora resemble those of the maternal vaginal tract or skin (depending on mode&#xD;
      of delivery). Preliminary datasets suggest that during the first year of life, the airway&#xD;
      microbiome evolves into a rich, adult-like microbial ecosystem. The keystone colonizers of&#xD;
      the airways are thought to condition the subsequent colonization by over 600 species, some of&#xD;
      which serve to establish robust bacterial communities characteristic of human health. Other&#xD;
      secondary colonizers are frequently implicated in oral and respiratory infections, including&#xD;
      chronic sinusitis, pneumonia, and periodontal diseases. As an example, infant colonization by&#xD;
      Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important risk factor for childhood middle ear disease. Early&#xD;
      microbial communities, therefore, represent major factors that govern the colonization of the&#xD;
      airways by both pathogenic and protective microbes during infant microbiome development.&#xD;
      Understanding the acquisition of infant airway microbial communities and the factors that&#xD;
      alter their composition is critical to the promotion of human health and the prevention of&#xD;
      airway diseases that represent an annual multi-billion dollar burden on the US healthcare&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the maternal-newborn exchange of airway microbiota is well-documented, no studies have&#xD;
      examined within-subject relationships among the mouth, sinuses, nasopharynx and lungs and the&#xD;
      relative abundance of bacterial taxa at those sites. Recent evidence suggests the oral cavity&#xD;
      may serve as a reservoir for pathogens that trans-locate to non-oral locations;&#xD;
      oral-associated microbes infect most other body sites as evidence by 16S sequencing. However,&#xD;
      two caveats make this bacterial metastasis controversial. First, that oral bacteria are not&#xD;
      located solely in the mouth but are also found elsewhere in the airways makes their origin&#xD;
      difficult to establish. Thus, the directionality of microbial exchange between airway niche&#xD;
      spaces is not known. Secondly, most 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) surveys only reveal bacterial&#xD;
      composition at the genus or phylum level, providing little information about strain lineages,&#xD;
      and whether individual strains can migrate between sites. These data are critical to promote&#xD;
      development of protective microbiota while restricting growth of recalcitrant pathogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A more complete understanding of this trafficking begins with in-depth, strain-level surveys&#xD;
      of the bacterial communities present in each airway niche shortly after birth, and their&#xD;
      development over time. As a step in this direction, this Academic Health Center-sponsored&#xD;
      study will use metagenomic sequencing to assess the exchange of specific bacterial strains&#xD;
      throughout the upper airways. Our mouse studies (explained elsewhere) will be complemented by&#xD;
      a study of cystic fibrosis (CF) infants, who represent a unique population that facilitates&#xD;
      the capture of oral, sinonasal, and lung microbiota over the first two years of life. By&#xD;
      using a combination of oral and throat swabs, together with nasal suction of mucus samples, a&#xD;
      metagenomic sequencing approach will be used to characterize the composition of bacterial&#xD;
      communities at each anatomical site. Beginning at birth, the investigators will collect a&#xD;
      time-series of swabs from each subject, and monitor changes in the development of microbiota&#xD;
      over time. By doing so, our studies will illuminate airway trafficking of both beneficial and&#xD;
      pathogenic microbes and may represent an essential pathophysiological step towards shifting&#xD;
      the balance between airway health and disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPERIMENTAL PLAN The development of airway bacterial communities will be monitored in a&#xD;
      small CF patient cohort. Since CF infants are monitored from birth and are routinely sampled&#xD;
      for airway microbiota during routine outpatient visits as part of their standard-of-care,&#xD;
      they represent a unique population to monitor bacterial trafficking between the oral, nasal&#xD;
      and lung cavities. All newborns at the University of Minnesota (UMN) are genetically&#xD;
      screened. Those testing positive for CF will be confirmed using a pilocarpine sweat test.&#xD;
      Positive subjects (with 2 Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator [CFTR]&#xD;
      mutations) will then be sampled during the participants' visits to the CF treatment center;&#xD;
      on average, infants will be seen every month for the first 6 months, every other month until&#xD;
      1 year of age, followed by quarterly visits to the UMN CF Center (in accordance with Cystic&#xD;
      Fibrosis Foundation guidelines). As part of standard of care, nasal samples are collected by&#xD;
      suction at each visit. Nylon swabs will also be used to sample each infant's buccal mucosa.&#xD;
      Oropharyngeal swabs will also be obtained, which are considered to be an accurate proxy of&#xD;
      lower airway (lung) microbiomes. Based on the number of CF newborns expected over the study&#xD;
      period, the investigators plan to recruit up to 10 subjects. From each infant, up to 10&#xD;
      temporal swabs will be collected from each airway site (10 infants x 10 swabs x 3 sites = 300&#xD;
      samples). Swabs will be stored in saline, frozen at -80C and processed in parallel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA will be extracted from each swab sample, and sequencing performed at the University of&#xD;
      Minnesota Genomics Center.&#xD;
