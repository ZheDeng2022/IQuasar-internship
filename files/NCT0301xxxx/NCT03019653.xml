  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at kidney function and hormonal function in patients&#xD;
      with a history of heart failure and kidney dysfunction, and to see how the use of a new drug,&#xD;
      ANX-042, affects those functions.&#xD;

      Subjects will have a choice of admitting the night prior to renal clearance study day or the&#xD;
      day of. Subjects will admit (fasting) to the Clinical Research and Trials Unit, after 3 weeks&#xD;
      of diet compliance, the morning of the first renal clearance study day. They will avoid&#xD;
      taking any sulfa containing medications and Probenecid for 72 hours prior to Visit Two and&#xD;
      Visit Three. They will complete a 24-hour urine collection which will be assessed for&#xD;
      creatinine clearance, microalbumin and sodium concentration and excretion. A pregnancy test&#xD;
      will be performed, if necessary. Their first urine void after admitting will be collected for&#xD;
      protein analysis. Brief physical exam (same as at Visit 1) will be performed by a qualified&#xD;
      Study Team Member. Their usual morning dose of medications will be held until given initial&#xD;
      water load prior to start of renal clearance infusion. Echocardiogram to determine systolic,&#xD;
      diastolic function and cardiac output will be performed prior to the start of study drug&#xD;
      infusion. A bladder ultrasound will be performed after their first void. If subject is unable&#xD;
      to sufficiently empty their bladder, a urinary catheter will be placed with their permission.&#xD;
      The subjects will be placed in the supine position for 1 hour. During the first 15 minutes,&#xD;
      two standard intravenous (IV) catheters will be placed (one in each arm). One catheter will&#xD;
      be used for infusion and the other (in the contralateral arm) for blood sampling. Subjects&#xD;
      will be asked to drink 5 mL/Kg of water initially and then drink an amount equal to the urine&#xD;
      output, and blood drawn, after each clearance period to ensure sufficient urinary flow. A&#xD;
      priming dose (calculated according to body size) of iothalamate (0.06 mg/Kg) to measure&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR) will be infused, followed by a constant rate IV sustaining&#xD;
      dose (calculated according to estimated kidney function) of iothalamate to achieve&#xD;
      steady-state plasma concentrations of 15 to 20 mg/L. The subjects will be asked to empty&#xD;
      their bladder spontaneously at the end of each clearance period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an equilibration period of 45 minutes, urine and blood samples will be collected at&#xD;
      30-minutes to determine the baseline GFR and urinary sodium excretion (UNaV). Blood pressure&#xD;
      will be measured at 20-minute intervals for the first 2 hours, then every 30 minutes, by&#xD;
      using automatic blood pressure cuff. Heart rate will be continuously monitored by&#xD;
      electrocardiography. Urinary samples for determination of volume, sodium, potassium, and&#xD;
      iothalamate will be obtained at the end of each clearance period. Venous blood samples for&#xD;
      iothalamate and sodium will be obtained at the middle of each clearance period. During the&#xD;
      first clearance, venous blood samples for renin, aldosterone, angiotensin II, AnxA1, Atrial&#xD;
      Natriuretic Peptide (ANP), Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and cGMP will be obtained and&#xD;
      urine samples for Annexin A1(AnxA1) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) will also be&#xD;
      obtained. Buffy coat from Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) vacutainer tubes will be&#xD;
      saved for possible future DNA analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the baseline renal clearance, subjects will be randomized to receive infusion of active&#xD;
      study drug or placebo for 8 hours. The research pharmacist will prepare the study drug or&#xD;
      placebo infusion, thus both the patients and investigators will be blinded. Renal clearance&#xD;
      and blood draws will be carried out every 2 hours during the infusion as described above (4&#xD;
      times), and blood draw for assays at the end of 4 and 8 hours infusion as listed above.&#xD;
      Another echocardiogram will be repeated after 4 hour of drug infusion. Subjects will be given&#xD;
      3 meals throughout the day. Dismissal will occur after one hour of post-infusion monitoring.&#xD;
