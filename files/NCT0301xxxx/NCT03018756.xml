  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) experience distressing activity-related&#xD;
      respiratory discomfort which is challenging to manage therapeutically. Interventions such as&#xD;
      pulmonary rehabilitation, collaborative self-management, supplemental oxygen therapy and oral&#xD;
      opiate medications, are variably effective and therapeutic responses to each in individual&#xD;
      patients are difficult to predict. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the acute effects&#xD;
      of inhaled opiate therapy (fentanyl citrate) on breathing discomfort (dyspnea) in individuals&#xD;
      with mild-to-moderate ILD, as well as examine the potential mechanisms of dyspnea relief.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with opioids can improve activity related dyspnea by reducing central respiratory&#xD;
      neural drive. Inhaled fentanyl citrate is an opioid that is generally well tolerated and has&#xD;
      been shown to effectively relieve respiratory discomfort without causing systemic&#xD;
      side-effects, although its mechanism of action are poorly understood. Based on the current&#xD;
      evidence, non-sedating, rapidly active inhaled fentanyl represents a possible alternative and&#xD;
      effective treatment of severe dyspnea in patients with ILD who require urgent treatment. As&#xD;
      such, the primary objective of this study is to examine the acute effects of nebulized&#xD;
      fentanyl on dyspnea intensity and quality in patients with mild-to-moderate ILD, as well as&#xD;
      examine the neurophysiological mechanisms of dyspnea relief during fentanyl inhalation. It is&#xD;
      believed that fentanyl when compared with placebo, will reduce inspiratory neural drive to&#xD;
      the diaphragm and breathing frequency, resulting in improvements in dyspnea intensity during&#xD;
      physical exertion. Alternatively, dyspnea relief after inhaled fentanyl may be independent of&#xD;
      changes in neural drive, and instead linked to the presence of opioid receptors in the lungs&#xD;
      that modulate afferent inputs to the brain, thereby favourably influencing perceived dyspnea.&#xD;

    <description>The 10-point Borg scale ranges from 0 &quot;nothing at all&quot; to 10 &quot;maximal/extremely strong&quot; and will be used to rate the intensity of dyspnea during exercise: a decrease in this rating signifies an improvement.
