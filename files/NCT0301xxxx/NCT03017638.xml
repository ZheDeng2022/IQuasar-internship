  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain after abdominal surgery can be extensive. Pain control is an important component of&#xD;
      patient comfort and participation in rehabilitation. Multimodal analgesia methods have shown&#xD;
      to reduce postoperative pain, and have been addressed to be a crucial part of the Enhanced&#xD;
      Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quadratus lumborum block (QLB) is a posterior abdominal wall block which analgesic efficacy&#xD;
      has been shown for abdominal surgeries, and also for different laparoscopic procedures, such&#xD;
      as ovarian surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess QLB's analgesic efficacy for laparoscopic colectomy&#xD;
      surgeries, using serial pain score assessments and overall opioid consumption; its effect on&#xD;
      patient satisfaction; and its effect on the development of postoperative respiratory&#xD;
      complications. This study is a prospective clinical trial assessing the effect of application&#xD;
      of QLB as a regional analgesic technique for primary laparoscopic colectomy, in comparison to&#xD;
      a historical retrospective cohort.&#xD;

      A. Specific Aims Pain control is an important component of patient comfort and rehabilitation&#xD;
      after surgery. The aim of the study is to improve multimodal analgesia and reduce&#xD;
      postoperative pain for laparoscopic colonic surgery. We hypothesize that performing a&#xD;
      Quadratus Lumborum Block (QLB) prior to start of laparoscopic colon surgery will provide&#xD;
      significant analgesic effect. As such, the primary endpoint of this study is the patient's&#xD;
      maximal reported pain scores using a numeric verbal analogue scale (1-10) elicited during the&#xD;
      patient's post operative recovery unit (PACU) stay, 24 hours, 48 hours and 4 weeks after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total opioid consumption during PACU stay and on 24 hours ,48 hours and 4 weeks after&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall patient satisfaction - will be documented on 24 hours after surgery, 48 hours&#xD;
           and 4 weeks after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Minimal saturation during PACU stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Development of postoperative respiratory complications until patient discharge:&#xD;
           re-intubation, documented apneas, severe hypoxemia (measured saturations &lt;94%; or&#xD;
           arterial blood oxygen partial pressure in relation to inspired oxygen concentration&#xD;
           [PaO2/FiO2] ration below 200)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methods The study is a prospective clinical trial assessing the effect of&#xD;
      application of QLB as a regional analgesic technique for primary laparoscopic colectomy, in&#xD;
      comparison to a historical cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All primary laparoscopic colectomy patients are eligible for inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allergy to local anesthetics or to systemic opioids&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contraindication to regional anesthesia technique, such as local infection or&#xD;
           coagulopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Requirements of more than 30 mg morphine equivalent daily prior to surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ASA IV or greater&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychiatric or cognitive disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incarceration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Renal insufficiency with Cr &gt; 2.0&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hepatic failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age under 18 years Potential risks for the procedure, which will be explained to the&#xD;
           patient, include: bleeding, local infection, local anesthetic toxicity. All are commonly&#xD;
           listed as rare complications of the procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consenting to participation, QLB will be placed in the operating room after induction&#xD;
      of general anesthesia and prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participating patients, the following data will be collected by the research staff: ASA&#xD;
      physical status, age, height, weight, gender, intra- and post operative quantitative opiate&#xD;
      use (expressed as morphine equivalent in mg/kg), numeric VAS scores, and QoR score (form&#xD;
      included).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative anesthesia will be achieved using a general anesthetic technique.&#xD;
      Intraoperative analgesia will be administered per anesthesiologists' discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have a laparoscopic colectomy. QLB Procedure Details Patients will lie in&#xD;
      the supine position. Aseptic precautions will be taken by wearing a surgical cap, a mask,&#xD;
      sterile gown and sterile gloves after disinfection of the hands. The abdominal region will be&#xD;
      disinfected using chlorhexidine solution, and then covered in sterile drapes. A high&#xD;
      frequency linear ultrasound (US) transducer (Philips 4-12L linear transducer with a frequency&#xD;
      of 6-12 MHz, Milwaukee, WI) covered with sterile plastic sheath will be placed in the&#xD;
      anterior axillary line to visualize the typical triple abdominal layers. Then, the probe will&#xD;
      be withdrawn to the posterior axillary line, where at this juncture the layers of abdominal&#xD;
      layers start to taper: the transversus abdominis muscle converging with the internal oblique&#xD;
      and external oblique forming a singular aponeurosis, blending with the quadratus lumborum&#xD;
      muscle, which inserts from the dorsal aspect of the body [Figure 1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the junction of the tapered ends of abdominal muscles and QL, and under continuous US&#xD;
      guidance, a 22 gauge 80 mm insulated Tuohy needle (SonoPlexStimu, PAJUNK MEDIZINTECHNOLOGIE&#xD;
      GEISINGEN, GERMANY) will be inserted in plane [Figure 2]. Its proper location will be&#xD;
      verified using 0.9% NaCl injection. After position verification and following negative&#xD;
      aspiration, 25 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine (Naropin-AstraZeneca, Sydney, North South Wales,&#xD;
      Australia) will be injected under US visualization, in 3-5 mL aliquots, separated by repeated&#xD;
      negative aspirations, meant to confirm absence of intravascular injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative analgesia All patients will be given a standard regimen of IV acetaminophen&#xD;
      1000mg q8hr, and IV Tramadone 100 mg q8hr (concurrent with prophylactic anti-emetic therapy&#xD;
      using IV metoclopramide 10 mg q8hr), both started intraoperatively prior to conclusion of&#xD;
      surgery, and continuing for 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While in PACU, all patients will be administered a morphine patient controlled analgesia&#xD;
      (PCA) infusion pump (Graesby 3300®, Smith Medical International Ltd. Watford, UK; IVAC®&#xD;
      PCAM®, Cardinal Health Inc., Rolle, Switzerland), for at least 48 hours. Per institutional&#xD;
      protocol, PCA will be connected after bolus loading of IV 0.1 mg/kg morphine in the PACU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Patients will be enrolled for the study either during the pre-operative&#xD;
      surgical appointment, or upon admission to the hospital. Upon enrollment, patients will have&#xD;
      a Pain Management Questionnaire (attached) and VAS pain scores (0-10; 0 indicating no pain;&#xD;
      10 indicating most excruciating pain imaginable) recorded, and have their pre-operative&#xD;
      analgesic medication documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the effect of analgesia in PACU, maximal VAS pain scores, as reported by the&#xD;
      patient to the PACU nursing staff, will be recorded. On 24 hours, 48 hoursafter surgery, the&#xD;
      patient will indicate their level of pain using Pain Management Questionnaire (attached) and&#xD;
      VAS pain scores. The patients will also complete their Pain Management Questionnaire and&#xD;
      maximal VAS pain scores at 4 weeks after surgery (using a telephone survey).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of recovery will be assessed using the Quality of Recovery (QoR) score 8-9,&#xD;
      documented on 24 hours, 48 hours (personally) and also at 4 weeks after surgery (using a&#xD;
      telephone survey).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the aforementioned scores, total analgesic medication will be documented:&#xD;
      total opioid consumption (expressed in morphine equivalents doses, mg/kg) and during PACU&#xD;
      stay and on 24 hours , and at 4 weeks after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory complications will be assessed by any of these events documented in the patient's&#xD;
      chart during the postoperative period until patient discharge: re-intubation, documented&#xD;
      apneas, severe hypoxemia (measured saturations &lt;94%; or arterial blood oxygen partial&#xD;
      pressure in relation to inspired oxygen concentration [PaO2/FiO2] ration below 200, if&#xD;
      measured).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control subjects' data will be assessed reviewing patient records. Their data will&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximal PACU VAS pain score (per nursing charts)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall 24 hours , 48 hours and 4 weeks opioid consumption (overall morphine mg/kg&#xD;
           equivalent dose)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  POD 24 and 48 hours and 4 weeks Respiratory complications&#xD;
