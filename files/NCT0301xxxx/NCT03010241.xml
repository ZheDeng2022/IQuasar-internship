    <textblock>
      Background: Distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSPN) is the most common complication of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and the most common form of peripheral neuropathy. DSPN increases&#xD;
      the risk of foot ulceration up to seven-fold, and is a significant risk factor in more than&#xD;
      60% of the amputations of the lower limbs in patients with T2DM. Reportedly, TCM may have&#xD;
      some advantages in relieving symptoms and reducing the incidence of DSPN exacerbations.We&#xD;
      postulate that patients with DSPN will benefit from therapy with TCM treatment according to&#xD;
      syndrome differentiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and design: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and multi-centric clinical&#xD;
      trial design was used on the basis of a co-regimen of mecobalamin. Subjects who met the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria were randomly divided into two groups. The patients in the study group&#xD;
      were treated with Tangbi prescription, and the patients in the control group were treated&#xD;
      with placebo. Treatment was scheduled for 24 weeks. The sample size was 188 cases.Major&#xD;
      evaluation indicators: Changes in Clinical Symptoms and Signs in Distal Symmetrical&#xD;
      Polyneuropathy patients.The clinical symptoms and signs of patients were recorded by Michigan&#xD;
      Diabetic Neuropathy Score(MDNS), and the changes of Michigan Diabetic Neuropathy Score(MDNS)&#xD;
      were compared between the two groups before and after medication. Secondary Evaluation&#xD;
      Indicators:① nerve conduction velocity changes, The changes in nerve conduction velocity of&#xD;
      each nerve were compared before and after taking medicine.② Clinical symptoms and signs&#xD;
      change, The clinical symptoms and signs of the patients were compared before and after taking&#xD;
      the medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: We postulate that patients with DSPN will benefit from therapy with TCM&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      1. Purpose of the study Major objective: To evaluate the efficacy of traditional Chinese&#xD;
           medicine (Tangbi prescription) in improving the clinical symptoms of patients with&#xD;
           diabetic distal symmetric polyneuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary objective: To evaluate the effect of traditional Chinese medicine (Tangbi&#xD;
           prescription) on nerve conduction velocity of patients with diabetic distal symmetric&#xD;
           polyneuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Experimental Measures and contrast A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and&#xD;
           multi-centric clinical trial design was used on the basis of a co-regimen of&#xD;
           mecobalamin. The patients in the study group were treated with Tangbi prescription (1&#xD;
           dose / day, twice), and patients were treated with placebo (1 dose / day, twice) in the&#xD;
           control group. Treatment was scheduled for 24 weeks. The sample size was determined to&#xD;
           188 cases through statistics calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample size calculation basis: According to the preliminary study of Antang-tongbi&#xD;
           prescription data, placebo group scale (Toronto TCSS scale) score difference is 3.45,&#xD;
           while Tangbi prescription scale score was 4.14, and the public standard deviation s =&#xD;
           1.33. The sample size is estimated by hypothesis test formula of measurement data: N = 2&#xD;
           * [(Zα + Zβ) * δ / d] ^ 2 (pp. 112-113 of the third edition of Epidemiology) (n is the&#xD;
           sample size and σ is the estimated standard deviation, d is two groups' continuous&#xD;
           variable mean difference; Zα and Zβ are the corresponding standard normal differences;&#xD;
           for Zα and Zβ values, see the Human Health Edition, Epidemiology, Third Edition, page&#xD;
           73, Table 6.2). Supposing= 0.05, β = 0.10, according to one-sided check table, the&#xD;
           quantile Zα = 1.64485, Zβ = 0.84162, and put them into the formula, and result was n =&#xD;
           78.10. Therefore, each group needs 78 patients. Considering no more than 20% withdrawal&#xD;
           rate, the total number of cases is 188, of 94 cases in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Bias analysis The evaluation index of this study is clinical symptoms, affected by many&#xD;
           factors. Although there are many ways in the treatment of oral drugs, but the exact&#xD;
           evidence of evidence-based medicine is not proved. Therefore, there is little factor&#xD;
           impacting of the biases of the evaluation results, concluding the following aspects: (1)&#xD;
           blood glucose levels. (2) existing treatment measures, (3) the conditions of EMG&#xD;
           determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
           These influencing factors are addressed as follows: (1) As for blood glucose levels&#xD;
           factor, a randomized, double-blind study design approach was used to ensure consistency&#xD;
           of the factor in the two groups. (2) subjects taking Methycobal can reduce the&#xD;
           psychological effect of patients on the efficacy of curative effect and increase patient&#xD;
           compliance. (3) Train EMG doctors consistently, and the EMG determination is fixed,&#xD;
           which forms the SOP of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Research design 4.1 The design scheme A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and&#xD;
           multi-centric clinical trial design was used on the basis of a co-regimen of&#xD;
           mecobalamin. Subjects who met the inclusion criteria were randomly divided into two&#xD;
           groups. The patients in the study group were treated with Antang-tongbi prescription,&#xD;
           and the patients in the control group were treated with placebo. Treatment was scheduled&#xD;
           for 24 weeks. The sample size was 188 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2 Research Period Medication cycle is 24 weeks. 4.3 curative effect evaluation&#xD;
           criteria 4.3.1 Major evaluation indicators Changes in Clinical Symptoms and Signs in&#xD;
           Distal Symmetrical Polyneuropathy patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The clinical symptoms and signs of patients were recorded by Michigan Diabetic&#xD;
           Neuropathy Score(MDNS), and the changes of Michigan Diabetic Neuropathy Score(MDNS) were&#xD;
           compared between the two groups before and after medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3.2 Secondary Evaluation Indicators&#xD;
&#xD;
           ① nerve conduction velocity changes The changes in nerve conduction velocity of each&#xD;
           nerve were compared before and after taking medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ② Clinical symptoms and signs change The clinical symptoms and signs of the patients&#xD;
           were compared before and after taking the medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.4 Curative effect observation indicators ① Nerve conduction velocity (every 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  MDNS scale (every 3 months). 4.5 Observational Indicators&#xD;
&#xD;
                ① Background observation (0 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. Demographic data: gender, age, height, weight and so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. General clinical data: medical history, course of the disease, treatment&#xD;
                     history, combined disease and medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Diagnostic and monitoring indicators&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. Blood pressure, fasting blood glucose test (every 1 month).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Glycated hemoglobin, blood lipids (every 3 months). 4.6 Analysis of relevant&#xD;
                     measures are based on bias analysis 4.7 Basic treatment ① Diabetes education;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Diabetic diet;&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Rational control of blood glucose: use oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin&#xD;
                     injections to keep all patients blood glucose stable in the study. In&#xD;
                     principle, the type and dose of hypoglycemic agents should maintain unchanged.&#xD;
                     If fasting blood glucose fluctuates more than 20%, diabetes experts were&#xD;
                     needed to find and remove the predisposing factors as soon as possible, and&#xD;
                     adjust the dose and monitor blood glucose changes, so the blood glucose can be&#xD;
                     smooth in 4 weeks. Adjusted dose of the drug needs to be detailed records in&#xD;
                     the combined medication table.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     ④ Taking Mecobalamin tablets (1 / time, 3 times / day). (Eisai (China)&#xD;
                     Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) 4.8 Provisions for combined treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
