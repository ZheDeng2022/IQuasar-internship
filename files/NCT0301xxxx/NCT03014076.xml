  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine if combination immunotherapy with HER2/neu GP2&#xD;
      peptide + GM-CSF vaccine and trastuzumab is safe and immunologically effective in treatment&#xD;
      of patients with HER2/neu over-expressing breast cancer in the adjuvant setting. While not a&#xD;
      primary endpoint, time to recurrence is measured for enrolled subjects. The objectives of the&#xD;
      study are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess safety and document local and systemic toxicity to combination immunotherapy with&#xD;
           GP2 peptide + GM-CSF vaccine and trastuzumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the in vitro and in vivo immunologic responses to combination immunotherapy of&#xD;
           GP2 peptide + GM-CSF vaccine and trastuzumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine maximum tolerated dose and optimal biologic dose for the combination&#xD;
           immunotherapy of GP2 peptide + GM-CSF vaccine and trastuzumab&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HER2/neu+ over-expressing breast cancer (IHC 3+ or FISH ≥2.0)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving adjuvant trastuzumab as standard of care treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Completion of breast cancer therapy (i.e., surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy as&#xD;
             appropriate per standard of care for patients' specific cancer) to exclude trastuzumab&#xD;
             (Patients on oral hormonal therapy as part of their adjuvant breast cancer treatment&#xD;
             will be maintained on their regimens.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Enrollment must occur so that patients' trastuzumab treatment and vaccine schedule&#xD;
             overlap for all 6 vaccinations and so that first vaccination occurs after a standard&#xD;
             of care Multiple Gated Acquisition Scan (MUGA)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status (PS) 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically cancer-free (no evidence of disease; excluding +CTC)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the patient is of childbearing potential, she must be willing to practice adequate&#xD;
             contraception through the study treatment period and for 2 months after completion of&#xD;

             cured&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other concurrent severe medical problems, unrelated to the malignancy, that would&#xD;
             significantly limit full compliance with the study or expose the patient to&#xD;
             unacceptable risk&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled congestive heart failure or hypertension, unstable heart disease&#xD;
             (coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction) or uncontrolled arrhythmia at the&#xD;
             time of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychiatric, addictive, or any disorder which compromises ability to give truly&#xD;
             informed consent for participation in this study or adequate compliance&#xD;
