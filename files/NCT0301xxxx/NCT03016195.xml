    <textblock>
      Oral sodium supplementation is currently administered in cases of poor weight gain in infants&#xD;
      particularly in patients who have undergone gastrointestinal surgical procedures. The&#xD;
      decision to start oral supplementation is based on urinary sodium levels although the level&#xD;
      at which to start treatment is variable as the range in normal, healthy infants is unknown.&#xD;
      This study aims to ascertain the normal range of sodium in urine specimens collected from&#xD;
      healthy newborn babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is believed that by increasing the level of salt in the intestine, glucose can be more&#xD;
      easily be absorbed and therefore weight gain improved. Babies with conditions where they are&#xD;
      at risk of salt depletion (i.e. those with a stoma) are currently administered oral sodium&#xD;
      supplementation if they are failing to gain weight and have an associated 'low' urinary&#xD;
      sodium level. Low levels of urinary sodium are considered to represent a state of low body&#xD;
      sodium levels, as the kidneys attempt to reabsorb most of the sodium in the urine before it&#xD;
      is excreted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current practice varies widely as to the level below which treatment should be instigated.&#xD;
      Some centres advise below 20 mmol/L (Birmingham Children's Hospital and Nottingham Children's&#xD;
      Hospital guidelines), others below 10 mmol/L (University Children's Hospital, Zurich). In&#xD;
      Glasgow, babies with poor weight gain are given sodium supplementation if urinary sodium&#xD;
      levels are below 40 mmol/L. There are no documented ranges for the levels of urinary sodium&#xD;
      in healthy, newborn babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By determining the reference range of urinary sodium levels in healthy, term babies who are&#xD;
      gaining weight appropriately, the investigators hope to be able to have a better&#xD;
      understanding about both the level below which supplementation should be considered and the&#xD;
      target range that should be aimed for.&#xD;

      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been designed as a cross sectional study where participants details are&#xD;
      recorded at birth, followed by a second time point at 6 weeks of age when a corresponding&#xD;
      sample of urine will be obtained. The population being studied is healthy term (37-41 week&#xD;
      gestation) babies with no significant ante- or post-natal history born within the study&#xD;
      period in a single maternity unit. Participants will be required to collect a sample of urine&#xD;
      at 6 weeks post-natal age (they will be provided with a standardized means to collect the&#xD;
      specimen) and return it to the investigators in a pre-paid, pre-addressed envelope (UN602&#xD;
      compliant packaging). This design has been chosen to obtain an unbiased sample group, with&#xD;
      minimal inconvenience or risk to participants. All confounding factors will be measured on a&#xD;
      data-sheet accompanying the specimen (sex, weight, method of feeding and medications). The&#xD;
      study should not be susceptible to bias as there is no perceived association between those&#xD;
      participants who either wish to take part in the study or subsequently choose to collect and&#xD;
      return the specimen, and their baby's urinary sodium level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective participants will be identified and approached by the neonatal/maternity staff at&#xD;
      the pre-discharge routine baby check (see Inclusion/Exclusion criteria) from the starting&#xD;
      date of the study for a period of 3 months (estimate based on average newborn deliveries per&#xD;
      week and expected return yield of urinary sodium samples i.e. participant drop-out rate).&#xD;
      There will be no coercion to participate. Mothers will be supplied with a patient information&#xD;
      statement and informed consent obtained. The consent will be filed in the mother's medical&#xD;
      notes and there will be no means of identification on the consent form that will link it with&#xD;
      any specimen obtained from the mother's baby. Instead, it will be a generic form indicating&#xD;
      intent to participate in the study. If mothers do wish to take part in the study, an initial&#xD;
      data-set will be obtained that will be identified by a unique study participation number.&#xD;
      This will include sex of the baby, birth weight, intended method of feeding/milk and any&#xD;
      medication. A study pack will be issued containing a set of instructions outlining the study,&#xD;
      a gender-specific urine collection bag, a specimen pot labeled with the participant's unique&#xD;
      identifying number (into which the urine sample should be transferred prior to returning it),&#xD;
      the data-set collection form and pre-paid, pre-addressed envelope (UN602 compliant packaging)&#xD;
      in which to return the specimen and completed form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be made clear to all participants that they are free to withdraw from the study for&#xD;
      any reason at any stage and that this will not affect their future care. No attempts will be&#xD;
      made to contact the families if samples are not returned after the 6 week time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no planned interim analysis. The study will continue until sufficient samples have&#xD;
      been returned in order to complete meaningful statistical analysis. It is anticipated that&#xD;
      this study should last no longer than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the study is not deemed to involve any risk for patients, their families or&#xD;
      staff involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and estimation&#xD;
&#xD;
      135 participants recruited over 3 months. An independent statistician has been consulted. The&#xD;
      sample size or reference limits has been based upon the precision of the confidence intervals&#xD;
      around each limit. On computing a 95% reference interval based on a normal distribution (with&#xD;
      reference limits to be at most 15% of the reference interval size) gives a sample size of&#xD;
      135.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A dropout rate of at least 25% is expected, and therefore, in order to achieve an adequate&#xD;
      sample size, we intend to pause the study after 200 participants have enrolled. If less than&#xD;
      135 samples are returned within 6 weeks after the final participant is enrolled, then further&#xD;
      participants will be recruited to achieve the desired sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urinary electrolytes will be measured in the Biochemistry laboratory in the Royal Hospital&#xD;
      for Sick Children. Urinary electrolytes (potassium, sodium and chloride) are measured by&#xD;
      in-direct (diluted) ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) which utilize membranes selective for&#xD;
      each ion species. A set volume of urine (15 ul) is diluted with diluent. A measuring&#xD;
      electrode is then submersed in this solution. An electrical potential (voltage) is developed&#xD;
      across the membranes between the reference and measuring electrodes in accordance with the&#xD;
      Nernst equation. The measured voltage is compared to previously determined calibrator&#xD;
      voltages and converted into ion concentrations (mmol/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following analysis samples will be disposed in accordance with the Human Tissue Authority's&#xD;
      Code of Practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variation of urinary sodium for the cohort will be presented as a normal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The urinary sodium of children who have not achieved a satisfactory weight gain will be&#xD;
      compared with those who have by a standard t test (as long as the urinary sodium values are&#xD;
      normally distributed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study closure&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will end if any one of the following criteria is met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The planned sample size has been achieved&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is insufficient funding to support further recruitment, and no reasonable prospect&#xD;
           of additional support being obtained&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Consideration&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out in accordance with the World Medical Association Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki (1964) and its revisions (Tokyo [1975], Venice [1983], Hong Kong [1989], South&#xD;
      Africa [1996] and Edinburgh[2000]). Favourable ethical opinion will be sought from an&#xD;
      appropriate Research and Ethics Committee (REC) before patients are entered into this study.&#xD;
      Patients will only be allowed to enter the study once either they have provided written&#xD;
      informed consent or their next of kin have provided written informed consent. The Chief&#xD;
      Investigator (CI) will be responsible for updating the Ethics committee of any new&#xD;
      information related to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finance and indemnity&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is currently not sponsored. As the study is not deemed to confer risk to&#xD;
      participants, their families or staff, indemnity has not been sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination of results&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not the intent of the researchers to inform the participants of the results of the&#xD;
      study. Firstly, all of the specimens collected and analyzed during the study are&#xD;
      unidentifiable there will be no way of contacting those who have taken part in the research&#xD;
      project. Secondly, the question that the study is designed to answer has no direct impact on&#xD;
      the care of any of the participants. Instead, the researchers aim to present their results at&#xD;
      a specialty-specific conference (e.g. British Association of Paediatric Surgeons annual&#xD;
      congress) and in an appropriate peer-reviewed journal, regardless of the outcome of the&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
