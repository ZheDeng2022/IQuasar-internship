      Golimumab effect in the modulation of gut microbiota in Ulcerative Colitis. Pilot Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. BACKGROUND Recently, a consistent body of evidence indicates that the gut microbiota&#xD;
           ability to modulate and direct the host immune response is considered one of the pivotal&#xD;
           factors that modulate the delicate balance between health and disease in digestive&#xD;
           diseases. In the case of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the gut microbiota has a&#xD;
           central role in maintaining the microbiological homeostasis of the patient. Recent&#xD;
           studies describe the existence of different patterns of intestinal microbiota from&#xD;
           patients with IBD and healthy individuals . The alteration of the microbiological&#xD;
           pattern not associated with disease is known as dysbiosis and is directly related to the&#xD;
           degree of inflammation of the intestinal mucosa, and, thus, the clinic status: a greater&#xD;
           dysbiosis, greater clinical correlation with disease state, so that the gut microbiota&#xD;
           is a direct marker of the state of colonic inflammation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The state of dysbiosis is measured through different microbiological indices of the total&#xD;
      population of bacteria in the colon. Changes in rates of these indices are the parameters&#xD;
      that are measured to characterize the gut microbiota of the patients. In the case of&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis (UC) studies have shown that intestinal microbiota is a central factor in&#xD;
      maintaining the balance between deep remission and the presence of a flare-up. Despite&#xD;
      advances, in-depth knowledge of how the gut microbiota interacts with the intestinal mucosa&#xD;
      and alters the intestinal barrier and the molecular/genetic mechanism is still unknown. Some&#xD;
      genes and associated cofactors have been identified but the exact mechanism of interaction&#xD;
      has not yet been described. The data indicate that, presumably, the mechanism of regulation&#xD;
      is a multifactorial process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this way, a deep understanding of gut microbiota and its interactions with the host and&#xD;
      the colon will be of great interest, in order to shape the future of IBD treatment,&#xD;
      especially of UC. Thus, IBD patients' intestinal microbiota could be either a therapeutic&#xD;
      target itself (fecal transplantation) or be consider as an adjustable adjuvant with&#xD;
      immunomodulators The group of anti-TNF drugs are the most recently incorporated in the&#xD;
      therapeutic arsenal of UC, in some cases changing the natural curse of the disease. However,&#xD;
      it is still unknown how these drugs modulate the intestinal microbiota and how they interfere&#xD;
      with it, although, probably, they develop a role. Recent results from studies by our group,&#xD;
      indicate that on entering clinical remission, gut microbiota is modified to patterns less&#xD;
      related with dysbiosis. Given the increasing importance of the use of anti-TNF drugs, it is&#xD;
      of great interest to discriminate between the patterns associated with dysbiosis and those&#xD;
      related with healthy mucosa, and how they are modified as a result of the use of anti-TNF&#xD;
      drugs. In this way, previous results of our group analyzing the changes of intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota associated with Adalimumab anti-TNF drug treatment have shown that during the&#xD;
      progression of the patient into remission, the mucosal dysbiosis pattern changes. On the&#xD;
      other hand, our group has also observed that after drug treatment failure, the gut microbiota&#xD;
      returns to a pattern closer to dysbiosis. For that reason, gut microbiota could be considered&#xD;
      as an excellent indicator of the real drug effectiveness in the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding Golimumab, a recently introduced anti-TNF drug therapy in UC, it is still unknown&#xD;
      how it is able to modulate the intestinal microbiota to remission-related patterns, since to&#xD;
      date there are not available studies about the relationship between Golimumab and this&#xD;
      phenomenon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of prebiotics and probiotics has shown some effectiveness as adjuvants in the&#xD;
      treatment of UC . For that reason, further characterization of the gut microbiota patterns is&#xD;
      very important to develop new strategies for adjuvant ability to modulate it, especially in&#xD;
      patients receiving anti-TNF drugs and do not achieve complete remission. Similarly to recent&#xD;
      studies, we suggest that the modulation of gut microbiota could optimize the response&#xD;
      outcomes in patients treated with Golimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, based on current trends in the literature, we suggest that modulation of the&#xD;
      intestinal microbiota and the characterization of remission-related patterns, will have a&#xD;
      huge impact on the management of patients with UC. Moreover, the modulation of gut microbiota&#xD;
      together with the anti-TNF drug effectiveness could be the most promising field in the&#xD;
      management of inflammatory bowel disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES 2.1 Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intestinal microbiota profile change according to UC activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The Intestinal microbiota profile correlated to clinical remission is represented by&#xD;
           stable intestinal microbiota biodiversity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess if Intestinal Microbiota is a useful tool to measure Golimumab effectiveness in&#xD;
           patients naïve to anti-TNF treatment and patients recurrent to anti-TNF treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To correlate clinical remission under Golimumab treatment with normal intestinal&#xD;
           microbiota profile biodiversity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To characterize the pattern of intestinal microbiota associated with the use of&#xD;
           Golimumab and temporal dynamics of microbial change.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess the effect of golimumab on the degree of colic dysbiosis in the treatment of&#xD;
           Ulcerative Colitis naive to Golimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. MATERIAL AND METHODS 3.1 Type of study/design Multicenter transversal pilot Study 3.2&#xD;
      Study population The proposed study will include 15 UC anti-TNF naïve patients from Hospital&#xD;
      Universitari Dr. Josep Trueta. Investigators will consider remission when patients have an&#xD;
      endoscopic Mayo score ≤1, and activity index score, Mayo= 0 points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Interventions NOTE: &quot;The assignment of a patient to a particular therapeutic strategy is&#xD;
      not predetermined in advance by the study protocol, instead clinical practice. Plus, the&#xD;
      decision to prescribe a particular drug is clearly unlinked from the decision to include the&#xD;
      patient in the study. Patients will not undergo any intervention, whether diagnostic or&#xD;
      monitoring, other than the usual clinical practice, and epidemiological methods shall be used&#xD;
      for the analysis of the data collected&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3.1 Treatments GOLIMUMAB induction with 200mg at week 0, and 100mg at week 2. Under 80kg,&#xD;
      the follow up treatment will be 50mg/month, and 100mg/month in patients over 80kg, as&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;

        -  Mayo clinic score (Clinical colitis activity index) (Schroeder KW et al. NEngl J Med&#xD;
           1987; 317: 1625-9). Score range: 0-9 points&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CRP (C-reactive protein): blood C-reactive protein concentration (mg/L)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Faecal calprotectin: stool sample expressed in concentration of calprotectin in ug for g&#xD;
           of feces (ug/g)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemoglobin: blood hemoglobin concentration (g / dl) Platelets: blood platelets concentration&#xD;
      (x103/ ul) Leucocytes: blood leucocytes concentration (x103/ ul) Albumin: blood albumin&#xD;
      concentration (g / dl) Creatinine levels: blood creatinine concentration (mg/ dl) 3.4.3&#xD;
      Endoscopic variables • Mayo (Endoscopic score of Ulcerative Colitis) (Schroeder KW et al.&#xD;
      1987). Mayo Endoscopic Score is based only on Endoscopic Findings. Mayo Score range from 0 to&#xD;
      3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      o Note: Investigators will send the image to a centralized digital platform, where Mayo score&#xD;
      will be assessed by 2 independent professionals in order to minimize inter-observer bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4.4 Microbiological variables&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abundance and bacterial load. 3.5 Methods The proposed study will include 15 UC patients&#xD;
           over 18 years with informed consent signed, under treatment with anti-TNF according to&#xD;
           clinical practice. All of them will have been screened for opportunistic infections.&#xD;
           Patients will be anti-TNF naïve patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool samples will be collected before starting Anti-TNF treatment (A), and at weeks 4 (B), 9&#xD;
      (C), 13 (D), 26 (E), 39 (F), and 52 (G) to complete the study. The monitoring period will be&#xD;
      one year. Investigators will collect demographic variables (age, sex, tobacco, age of&#xD;
      diagnosis, localization,…), clinical data (partial Mayo clinical score, CRP, albumin,&#xD;
      hemoglobin, creatinine, leucocytes, platelets…), and microbiological variables at A, B, C, D,&#xD;
      E, F and G. Also, 7 calprotectin sampling (at weeks 4 (B), 9 (C), 13 (D), 26 (E), 39 (F), and&#xD;
      52 (G) as a clinical practice) and Mayo endoscopic index (at baseline and at the end of the&#xD;
      monitoring period as a clinical practice). Follow-up visits will also take place within&#xD;
      routine clinical practice. For better follow-up the evolution of the patient, investigators&#xD;
      will perform additional tests included in routine clinical practice as a rectosigmoidoscopy&#xD;
      at week 12 after starting Anti-TNF treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will consider remission when patients have an endoscopic Mayo score ≤1, and&#xD;
      activity index score, Mayo clinical score =0 points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, depending on the evolution of the patient, additional tests will also be performed&#xD;
      as routine clinical protocol during the monitoring period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: Any test performed during the study and / or additional testing is routine clinical&#xD;
      practice according to clinical judgment and criteria of the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5.1 Sample processing&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA Extraction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before microbiological analyses, genomic DNA of 16s RNA gene will be extracted using&#xD;
      NucleoSpin® Soil Kit (Machery-Nagel GmbH &amp; Co., Germany). DNA concentration will be&#xD;
      determined with Qubit® BR (Invitrogen) Kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacterial 16S rRNA Gene Amplification by Pyrosequencing For pyrosequencing purposes, the 16S&#xD;
      rRNA gene was partially amplified from extracted genomic DNA using the universal bacterial&#xD;
      primers GC-357F 5'- CGCCCG CCGCGCCCCGCGCCCGGCCCGCCGCCCCCGCCC- CCT ACG GGA GGC AGC AG-3'&#xD;
      (341Y357) and 907R 5'-CCG TCA ATT CCT TTG AGT TT-3' (907Y926). PCR was performed with a&#xD;
      GeneAmp PCR System ® 2700 (AppliedBiosystems)). Then we purify the PCR product with kit&#xD;
      Ampure (Agencourt AMPure, Beckman Coulter Inc), and quantify the PCR products with Qubit® BR&#xD;
      (Invitrogen) Kit. The pyrosequencing will be performed with a 454 Life Genome Sciences&#xD;
      Sequencer FLX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequence Editing and Analysis High-quality consensus sequences will be obtained and manually&#xD;
      refined with the Bioedit software package. Alignments were carried out with ClustalW24&#xD;
      software. Consensus sequences were compared with those in GenBank and the Ribosomal Database&#xD;
      Project by using BLASTN 2.2.10. Sequences will be grouped by number of operational taxonomic&#xD;
      units or phylotypes with the DOTUR program26 using the farthest neighbor method at a&#xD;
      precision level of 0.01, i.e., 99% minimum similarity for any pair of sequences to belong to&#xD;
      the same phylotype, on a distance matrix with the Jukes-Cantor correction calculated with the&#xD;
      DNADIST program of the Phylip software package.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.6 Statistical analysis Statistical analysis will be performed with the SPSSx version 11.0.&#xD;
      Significance of distances between groups was checked using an analysis of variance. Pearson_s&#xD;
      x2 test was used to compare the prevalence of genus and species.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and laboratory data will be correlated with the values of quantitative microbial&#xD;
      indices using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves.&#xD;

The clinical Mayo Score or partial Mayo Score (PMS) uses the three non-invasive components of the full Mayo Score (stool frequency, rectal bleeding and physician's global assessement), and thus excluding the endoscopic findings scoring. Maximum score values range from 0 to 9 [Schroeder et al 2005 NEJM; Rutgeerts et al 2005 NEJM]. Calculations are based on the sum of scores for the three parameters. Values ranging: &lt;2, disease in clinical remission; 2-4, mild activity; 5-7, moderate activity; and &gt;7 severe activity.</description>

          <description>A total of 15 patients were included in the study. Stool samples were collected before starting anti-TNFα treatment (A), 4 weeks (B), 2 months after (C), 3 months (D), 6 months (E), 9 months (F) and finally 1 year after starting treatment (G). The monitoring period was one year long.&#xD;
Patients were classified as responders (responders), responder after dose optimization of anti-TNF treatment (respond after dose optimization) and non-responders (non-responders). Two different statistical analyses were done: one considering the group of responders, responder after dose optimization and non-responders, and another statistical analysis considering a unique group of responder and responders after dose optimization versus non-responders.&#xD;
Due to the fact that there are only 2 non-responders and a minimum number of 3 individuals (n= 3) is required to perform statistics, these 2 samples have been doubled for analysis.</description>

          <description>The proposed study will include 15 UC anti-TNF naïve patients . We will consider remission when patients have an endoscopic Mayo score ≤1, and activity index score, Mayo= 0 points.&#xD;
Stool samples will be collected before starting Anti-TNF treatment (M0), and then every 3 months (M1, M2, M3 and M4) to complete the study.&#xD;
GOLIMUMAB induction with 200mg at week 0, and 100mg at week 2. Under 70kg, the follow up treatment will be 50mg/month, and 100mg/month in patients over 70kg, as clinical practice.&#xD;

Due to the fact that there are only 2 non-responders and a minimum number of 3 individuals (n= 3) is required to perform statistics, these 2 samples have been doubled for analysis.</description>

        <title>Golimumab Induced Shifts in Clinical Response Based on Partial Mayo Score</title>
        <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in the Partial Mayo score at week 52 of Golimumab treatment.&#xD;
The clinical Mayo Score or partial Mayo Score (PMS) uses the three non-invasive components of the full Mayo Score (stool frequency, rectal bleeding and physician's global assessement), and thus excluding the endoscopic findings scoring. Maximum score values range from 0 to 9 [Schroeder et al 2005 NEJM; Rutgeerts et al 2005 NEJM]. Calculations are based on the sum of scores for the three parameters. Values ranging: &lt;2, disease in clinical remission; 2-4, mild activity; 5-7, moderate activity; and &gt;7 severe activity.</description>

          <title>Ulcerative Colitis Baseline</title>
          <description>A total of 15 patients were included in the study. Stool samples were collected before starting anti-TNFα treatment (A).&#xD;
Patients were classified as responders (responders), responder after dose optimization of anti-TNF treatment (respond after dose optimization) and non-responders (non-responders). Two different statistical analyses were done: one considering the group of responders, responder after dose optimization and non-responders, and another statistical analysis considering a unique group of responder and responders after dose optimization versus non-responders.&#xD;
Due to the fact that there are only 2 non-responders and a minimum number of 3 individuals (n= 3) is required to perform statistics, these 2 samples have been doubled for analysis.</description>
