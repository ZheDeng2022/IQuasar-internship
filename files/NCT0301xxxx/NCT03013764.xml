      Physical inactivity results in reductions in glucose tolerance and less sensitivity to&#xD;
      insulin. If this inactivity lasts long enough it can result in insulin resistance and type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. A high protein diet can reduce elevated glucose levels in individuals with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. Thus the investigators are interested in establishing if during a period of&#xD;
      inactivity if a diet modification can minimize the glucose changes normally observed with&#xD;
      inactivity. The objective of this project is to determine if short-term high protein (HP)&#xD;
      feeding protects against the changes in glucose levels normally observed with physical&#xD;
      inactivity. The investigators will also examine measures of blood vessel function, blood&#xD;
      lipid and blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve subjects will complete two 10 day study periods of reduced physical activity and will&#xD;
      be studied before and after each of these study periods. For their testing subjects will have&#xD;
      the following measurements: postprandial glucose responses to a mixed meal, 24 h free living&#xD;
      blood pressure control during acute physical inactivity, blood lipids, changes in body&#xD;
      composition, changes in circadian rhythm using skin temperature (ibutton), measurement of&#xD;
      aerobic capacity (VO2 max), blood vessel responsiveness (flow mediated dilation -FMD) and&#xD;
      changes in free living glucose levels (continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS). Subjects&#xD;
      will complete two conditions (high protein -HP vs normal protein - NP diets) in a randomized&#xD;
      cross-over design. In the inactive phase subjects will reduce there steps to &amp;lt;5,000&#xD;
      steps/d while consuming either a HP or NP diet. Completion of the study will take 8-10 weeks.&#xD;

      It is well known that insulin resistance increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes, which substantially impact mortality and morbidity and presents a&#xD;
      significant economic burden. Energy restriction with or without exercise has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to attenuate/reverse the development of insulin resistance and reduce the risk&#xD;
      of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Indeed, accumulating evidence suggests that&#xD;
      diets high in protein may possess additional protection against the development of insulin&#xD;
      resistance during energy restriction. Layman et al. found that a high protein diet (HP) (PRO&#xD;
      125 g/d) compared with an isocaloric high carbohydrate diet (HCHO) (PRO 68 g/d) resulted in&#xD;
      greater reductions in fasting glucose and 2 h postprandial insulin levels during 16 weeks of&#xD;
      energy restriction in overweight women. Similarly, a hypocaloric high protein diet (PRO 45%&#xD;
      vs 20%; 21 d diet treatment) increased glucose oxidation and improved insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      compared to an isocaloric high carbohydrate diet during a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp&#xD;
      procedure. In addition, markers of inflammation, β-cell function, and postprandial glucose&#xD;
      and insulin levels were improved in addition to increased resting energy expenditure after 6&#xD;
      months of hypocaloric HP compared with HCHO diet in premenopausal women independent of weight&#xD;
      loss. The increase in REE and improvement in adipose tissue function may be a potential&#xD;
      mechanism by which HP diet improves β-cell function since NEFAs are lower, which may reduce&#xD;
      lipotoxicity on the pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is evident that physical inactivity (highlighted from bed rest studies) impairs glucose&#xD;
      tolerance, insulin sensitivity, vascular function, and muscle protein synthesis in both&#xD;
      healthy and obese individuals. This model of inactivity, however, is extreme and does not&#xD;
      recapitulate the physical inactivity paradigm seen in the natural human environment.&#xD;
      Consequently, a less extreme reduction in daily physical activity (&gt;10,000 steps/d to ~1,500&#xD;
      steps/d) results in significant reductions in insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and&#xD;
      insulin-stimulated muscle Akt phosphorylation, suggesting that the impairments in insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity and glucose tolerance precede changes in body composition. A reduction in&#xD;
      ambulatory activity is a highly valid and translatable model to study the role of inactivity&#xD;
      on the development of metabolic disease, as most individuals go through periods of&#xD;
      inactivity, and it has been shown that a reduction in daily steps decreases insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity and increases visceral adiposity. To date, no study has tested the effects of&#xD;
      diet composition on the perturbations of physical inactivity. It is important to know if&#xD;
      increasing protein intake mitigates the negative perturbations of reduced ambulatory&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the overall objective of this project is to determine the extent to which short-term&#xD;
      high protein (HP) feeding may protect against the metabolic perturbations of physical&#xD;
      inactivity (i.e. PPG, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin sensitivity). The investigators will also&#xD;
      examine measures of vascular function and free living blood pressure in addition to lipemic&#xD;
      responses (i.e. FFAs, triglycerides, cholesterol, and lipoproteins) to determine if HP diet&#xD;
      impacts vascular function and lipemic responses during short term physical inactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Objectives and Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this project include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To determine if HP diet during a period of low physical activity will lower&#xD;
      the insulin response to a meal, and help to maintain insulin sensitivity and β-cell function&#xD;
      during a laboratory based mixed meal test (MMT) with stable isotope tracers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine if a HP diet during a period of low physical activity will&#xD;
      maintain glycemic control measured by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in healthy,&#xD;
      recreationally active, young individuals.&#xD;
