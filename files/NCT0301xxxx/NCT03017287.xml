      The study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of computerized GlucoMe App in patients with&#xD;
      uncontrolled diabetes treated with MDI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GlucoMe is an interactive system, which provides glucose management tools to both the patient&#xD;
      and health care team (HCT). The system includes a decision support system to be used by the&#xD;
      HCT aiming to aid clinical decision making with mathematical models. The system does not&#xD;
      intend to replace clinical judgement and all recommendations are to be approved by the HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty (40) diabetic patients on multiple daily insulin injection (MDI) with abnormal HbA1c&#xD;
      and identified as potential end users of the device will be recruited to the study and&#xD;
      screened according to the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patient's daily blood&#xD;
      glucose will be measured and the GlucoMe App will give its recommendations for change in&#xD;
      insulin dose, as well as recommendations for pre and post-meal carbohydrate and exercise.&#xD;
      Patient's daily blood glucose levels will be followed by the HCT biweekly for 12 weeks and&#xD;
      patients will be instructed to change their insulin doses according to the decision of the&#xD;
      treating physician. At the end of the study, the HCT's recommendations for treatment&#xD;
      adjustment will be compared to those of the system for both safety and efficacy. Study&#xD;
      subjects and the HCT will be asked to complete a questionnaire regarding the GlucoMe system&#xD;
      usability.&#xD;
