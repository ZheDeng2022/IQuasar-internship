    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open-label, Phase IbI study to assess the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      oral decitabine (ASTX727) and durvalumab (MEDI4736) combination therapy in the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck&#xD;
      (SCCHN) who have progressed during or after treatment with anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or&#xD;
      anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy for recurrent and/or metastatic disease. The clinical trial is&#xD;
      studying drugs that can boost the participant's immune system against the cancer cells as a&#xD;
      possible treatment for head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral Decitabine (ASTX 727)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Durvalumab (MEDI4736)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for&#xD;
      further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drugs are still being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved durvalumab (MEDI4736) or&#xD;
      tremelimumab as a treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved oral decitabine (ASTX 7272)&#xD;
      for the participant's specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a first in human study evaluating the safety of combining these different drugs.&#xD;
      Durvalumab (MEDI4736) is part of a family of proteins that make up the immune system. The&#xD;
      body generates these proteins, or antibodies, in response to foreign substances (particles&#xD;
      not typically found in the body such as bacteria and viruses) and these antibodies can&#xD;
      protect against infection. Durvalumab (MEDI4736) is an antibody that is being studied in&#xD;
      several other clinical trials to see if it has an effect in helping the immune system to&#xD;
      recognize and eliminate abnormal cells in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hope that decitabine may increase the chance of the immune system to recognize&#xD;
      the cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are looking for the highest effective dose of&#xD;
      decitabine in combination with durvalumab (MEDI4736) to improve the natural ability of the&#xD;
      immune system to recognize and target head and neck cancer cells.&#xD;
