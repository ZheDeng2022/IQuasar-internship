  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Benralizumab is a type of medicine called a monoclonal antibody that is made in the research&#xD;
      clinic; it works by blocking a specific protein in the body called interleukin-5. The study&#xD;
      medicine, benralizumab, is not yet approved for doctors to treat patients with EGPA. It is&#xD;
      considered an experimental drug in this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is open-label which means that all subjects will receive the study medication. The&#xD;
      medicine-benralizumab-will be given to subjects in addition to the medicines they are already&#xD;
      taking to treat their EGPA such as oral steroids (e.g. prednisone) and medicines that reduce&#xD;
      the activity of their immune system. Drugs that are sometimes used (i.e., standard of care)&#xD;
      to reduce the activity of the immune system in EGPA (in addition to oral steroids) include&#xD;
      azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide. Information about how&#xD;
      the stud drug that you get affects the subjects body and their health will be collected&#xD;
      through a number of tests, procedures and questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study medicine, benralizumab, will be given to subjects as one injection 30 mg under skin&#xD;
      every four weeks for 12 weeks and then every 8 weeks for 16 weeks for a total of 5&#xD;
      treatments. During the treatment phase of this study, a study staff member will call the&#xD;
      subjects to see how they are doing, what medications they are taking and if they are able to&#xD;
      decrease their steroid use. The study is a total of 9 study visits in a 44 week time period.&#xD;
      Everyone who takes part in the study will continue to receive his/her existing treatments for&#xD;
      EGPA (although their dose of oral steroids may be reduced during the study.&#xD;
