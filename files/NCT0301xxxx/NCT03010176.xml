  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum&#xD;
      administered dose (MAD) of ulevostinag alone and of ulevostinag in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in participants with advanced/metastatic solid tumors or lymphomas in Part 1,&#xD;
      and to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ulevostinag via intratumoral (IT) injection in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab in selected solid tumors in Part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ulevostinag will be administered IT; pembrolizumab (pembro) will be administered via&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) infusion. In Part 1, participants will be allocated to one of three&#xD;
      treatment arms: ulevostinag monotherapy (cutaneous/subcutaneous [cut/subcut] lesions),&#xD;
      ulevostinag +pembro (cut/subcut lesions), or ulevostinag +pembro (visceral lesions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2, participants with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who are&#xD;
      anti-programmed cell death-protein 1 or anti-programmed cell death-ligand 1 (anti-PD-1/PD-L1)&#xD;
      refractory or with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment (TrT)-naïve triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)&#xD;
      or with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 TrT-naïve solid tumors with liver metastases/lesions will receive&#xD;
      ulevostinag via IT injection at the RP2D determined in Part 1 PLUS pembrolizumab via IV&#xD;
      infusion for up 35 cycles (up approximately 2 years).&#xD;

      Participants will receive either ulevostinag monotherapy or ulevostinag in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab for up to 35 cycles (approximately 2 years). Participants will undergo at least&#xD;
      a 24-hour inpatient observation period following the first dose administration of ulevostinag&#xD;
      on Cycle 1 Day 1 in Part 1. For Part 2, the length of the observation period following&#xD;
      administration of the first dose of ulevostinag on Cycle 1 Day 1 is at least 8 hours.&#xD;
