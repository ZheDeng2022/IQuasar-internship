      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the incidence of high-grade (i.e. Grade&#xD;
      3-4 and Grade 5 of CTCAE v4.0) adverse reactions of interest in patients with metastatic RCC&#xD;
      who have progressed during or after receiving at least one prior systemic anti-angiogenic&#xD;
      treatment and who are eligible for nivolumab monotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The present study will be carried out in patients suffering from refractory metastatic Renal&#xD;
      Cell Carcinoma. The overall study population consists of 450 adult patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In France, 10600 patients were diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2010. At the time of their&#xD;
      diagnosis, approximately 30% of patients present with metastatic disease, with 90 to 95% of&#xD;
      that metastatic disease being of the clear-cell histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is a multicenter, open-label, non-controlled, phase II safety study in&#xD;
      patients who are suffering from metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma and who have progressed&#xD;
      during or after one prior systemic anti-angiogenic treatment. Patients intolerant to prior&#xD;
      systemic anti-angiogenic treatment can also be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose and schedule of nivolumab in this study will be 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Nivolumab&#xD;
      will be administered every 2 weeks until death, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or&#xD;
      withdrawal of the informed consent. 450 patients should be included over a period of 1 year&#xD;

             toxicity determination or adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. History of uncontrolled seizures, central nervous system disorders or psychiatric&#xD;
             disability judged by the investigator to be clinically significant, precluding&#xD;
