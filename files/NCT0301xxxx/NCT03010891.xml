    <textblock>
      The proposed 2-year study has two specific aims: (1) to examine the effects of a &quot;bundle&quot; of&#xD;
      supportive interventions on preterm infants' stress (salivary cortisol and&#xD;
      dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA] levels and physiological signals of infant distress), sleep,&#xD;
      and physical activity in the NICU, and (2) to explore the relationships among preterm&#xD;
      infants' salivary cortisol and DHEA levels, physiological signals of infant distress, sleep,&#xD;
      and physical activity. This randomized controlled trial will adopt a longitudinal&#xD;
      repeated-measures design to examine the effects of bundled supportive interventions on&#xD;
      preterm infants' stress (salivary cortisol and DHEA levels [using ELISA kit] and&#xD;
      physiological signals of infant distress [using bedside electrocardiographic monitors]),&#xD;
      sleep and physical activity (using ankle actigraphy) during their NICU hospitalization.&#xD;
      Preterm infants (N=120) meeting the study criteria will be randomly assigned to one of two&#xD;
      conditions: (1) control condition: usual NICU care + positioning + gentle touch +routine&#xD;
      kangaroo mother care (KMC) &lt; 20 minutes; (2) experimental condition: the bundle of supportive&#xD;
      interventions (usual NICU care +positioning + gentle touch + modulating infant states +&#xD;
      facilitated tucking + non-nutritive sucking + oral sucrose+ routine KMC &gt; 45 minutes. Outcome&#xD;
      variables will include infants' biological responses to stress (salivary cortisol, salivary&#xD;
      DHEA, and physiological signals of infant distress), sleep patterns, and physical activity.&#xD;

      Background and purpose: Preterm infants need to receive intensive care in a neonatal&#xD;
      intensive care unit (NICU) to survive, but this care exposes them to painful procedures and a&#xD;
      stressful environment. Repeated, painful/stressful stimuli can disturb infants' sleep, change&#xD;
      their physiological indicators, and affect their developing brain and organs, possibly&#xD;
      resulting in negative, long-lasting developmental consequences. Therefore, NICU clinicians&#xD;
      caring for these vulnerable infants have two important goals: to provide early interventions&#xD;
      to minimize preterm infants' stress/pain and to improve their sleep and physical activity.&#xD;
      The proposed 2-year study has two specific aims: (1) to examine the effects of a &quot;bundle&quot; of&#xD;
      supportive interventions on preterm infants' stress (salivary cortisol and&#xD;
      dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA] levels and physiological signals of infant distress), sleep,&#xD;
      and physical activity in the NICU, and (2) to explore the relationships among preterm&#xD;
      infants' salivary cortisol and DHEA levels, physiological signals of infant distress, sleep,&#xD;
      and physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This randomized controlled trial will adopt a longitudinal repeated-measures design&#xD;
      to examine the effects of bundled supportive interventions on preterm infants' stress&#xD;
      (salivary cortisol and DHEA levels [using ELISA kit] and physiological signals of infant&#xD;
      distress [using bedside electrocardiographic monitors]), sleep and physical activity (using&#xD;
      ankle actigraphy) during their NICU hospitalization. Preterm infants (N=120) meeting the&#xD;
      study criteria will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (1) control condition:&#xD;
      usual NICU care + positioning + gentle touch +routine kangaroo mother care (KMC) &lt; 20&#xD;
      minutes; (2) experimental condition: the bundle of supportive interventions (usual NICU care&#xD;
      +positioning + gentle touch + modulating infant states + facilitated tucking + non-nutritive&#xD;
      sucking + oral sucrose+ routine KMC &gt; 45 minutes. Outcome variables will include infants'&#xD;
      biological responses to stress (salivary cortisol, salivary DHEA, and physiological signals&#xD;
      of infant distress), sleep patterns, and physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes: The study will fill a gap in knowledge about the effects of bundled&#xD;
      supportive interventions on preterm infants' stress reactivity, sleep, and physical activity&#xD;
      during hospitalization. This unique combination of physiological measurements of preterm&#xD;
      infants' stress parameters and longitudinal design will provide results for establishing&#xD;
      evidence-based clinical guidelines to provide atraumatic care to this population during&#xD;
      intrusive procedures. Investigators also expect that bundling supportive interventions will&#xD;
      minimize preterm infants' pain/stress as well as improve their sleep and physical activity.&#xD;
      In the long term, the study results may help reduce the morbidity and complications due to&#xD;
      preterm birth, save medical costs in neonatal care, and promote these infants' health and&#xD;
      future developmental outcomes.&#xD;
