  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proximal humerus fractures (break of the top part of the upper arm bone) are common in older&#xD;
      people with poorer bone quality. Often patients do not undergo surgery for these fractures:&#xD;
      the bone fragments may be in an acceptable enough position to be able to heal naturally, or&#xD;
      the patient may not be well enough medically to undergo an operation. These patients need to&#xD;
      wear a sling to immobilise their injured shoulder, however muscles start to weaken quickly&#xD;
      when they are unable to be used. This research project will look at whether strength-training&#xD;
      the opposite/uninjured limb, known as &quot;cross education&quot;, has any effect on preserving the&#xD;
      function of the injured/fractured limb. Participants will be randomised into two groups using&#xD;
      minimisation, that is to say the groups will have balanced numbers in terms of exact pattern&#xD;
      of fracture and gender. One group will receive traditional rehabilitation exercises and&#xD;
      treatment by the physiotherapist for their injured limb; the other group will receive the&#xD;
      same but in addition will also undergo a strength-training exercise programme for their&#xD;
      uninjured limb. Only qualified physiotherapists with experience of treating this patient&#xD;
      cohort will be involved. Sessions in the physiotherapy department will last up to 30 minutes&#xD;
      each and will comprise of: patient review, exercise progression, and advice giving/question&#xD;
      answering; home exercise programmes will be expected to be completed 2-3 times daily and last&#xD;
      up to 30 minutes each; number of sessions will be agreed between the participant and treating&#xD;
      physiotherapist with treating ending once an agreed, acceptable level of function has been&#xD;
      achieved. The Oxford Shoulder Score patient-reported outcome measure will be completed by the&#xD;
      participant at 6 and 12 weeks and the European Quality of Life (EuroQoL)-5D-5L at 12 weeks&#xD;
      after commencement of treatment.&#xD;

      This study will investigate the use of cross education (ie. strength-training the uninjured&#xD;
      limb) as part of the recovery and return to function for skeletally mature, adult patients as&#xD;
      measured by the Oxford Shoulder Score after proximal humerus fracture and answer the&#xD;
      question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      does the use of a strength-training programme for the non-injured limb affect return to&#xD;
      function in adult patients with proximal humerus fractures?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proximal humerus fractures (break to the top part of the upper arm bone) are common,&#xD;
      accounting for 4-6% of all fractures in the older population and almost one-fifth of all&#xD;
      fractures sustained after a fall from a standing height in patients with osteoporosis. These&#xD;
      fractures can functionally impair the upper limb and so impact on overall quality of life.&#xD;
      Some studies show that a number of previously fit and independent patients may not return to&#xD;
      independent activity following a proximal humerus fracture and may even be at increased risk&#xD;
      for sustaining a subsequent fractured hip/neck of femur. If new rehabilitation approaches can&#xD;
      help improve the level of function achieved the morbidity and quality of life of these&#xD;
      patients could potentially be improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ageing population of the United Kingdom means the number of patients sustaining these&#xD;
      fractures will increase and so increase the cost to the National Health Service and the risk&#xD;
      of morbidity/mortality/disability/poor health-related quality of life. Treatment needs to&#xD;
      address range of movement (ROM) and muscle strength as well as restoration of function and&#xD;
      access to the community as quickly as possible. Effective, timely and cost-efficient&#xD;
      management of these patients must be found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with proximal humerus fractures generally undergo a period of wearing a sling to&#xD;
      immobilise the limb/stop them from moving it- especially those being managed without an&#xD;
      operation. Different orthopaedic and physiotherapy teams across the UK use different periods&#xD;
      of immobilisation, start rehabilitation at different times after injury and use different&#xD;
      rehabilitation methods. Only a few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) exist looking into&#xD;
      when to start physiotherapy and exactly what physiotherapy to do. Studies are needed to&#xD;
      develop treatment and rehabilitation protocols to deliver the best and most cost-effective&#xD;
      patient care possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wearing a sling/immobilisation of a limb for as little as one week can cause significant&#xD;
      muscle wastage resulting in loss of strength and loss of function. Studies have shown that&#xD;
      there is up to 60% reduction in strength after 5-6 weeks immobilisation. This early decline&#xD;
      in strength could be due to fewer nerve signals being sent from the brain to the inactive&#xD;
      muscles. It has been suggested that this could be prevented by strength-training the&#xD;
      uninjured limb, known as &quot;cross-education&quot;. The exact mechanisms by which it works are still&#xD;
      unknown but it is thought that using cross-education could help maintain messages sent from&#xD;
      the brain and so minimise changes in muscle and facilitating quicker recovery. The body works&#xD;
      reciprocally in many ways, for example swinging the opposite arm (to the stepping leg) whilst&#xD;
      walking. Many studies have already been done that show an improvement/maintenance of strength&#xD;
      of an immobilised limb after strength-training the opposite limb but these studies have&#xD;
      looked at uninjured patients or at those with lower limb injuries. Research into using the&#xD;
      principle of cross-education with upper limb injuries is needed before it can be applied in&#xD;
      practice routinely to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be asked some questions by the Specialist Physiotherapist or Doctor during&#xD;
      their fracture clinic appointment to see whether they are eligible to take part in the study.&#xD;
      If eligible they will have be provided with a written information sheet and the clinician&#xD;
      will explain the study and answer any questions they may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a phone call from the primary researcher 24-48 hours after being&#xD;
      provided with the study information to answer any further questions they may have and to&#xD;
      gauge interest in participation in the trial. If they are keen to be involved the primary&#xD;
      researcher will arrange for them to come into the Physiotherapy department to sign a written&#xD;
      consent form. At this appointment (which will take place in a clinical office within the&#xD;
      department) the primary researcher will then use a computer programme (called Minim) to&#xD;
      allocate them into one of the two study groups. If they are allocated into the experimental&#xD;
      group the primary researcher will teach them their strengthening exercises for their&#xD;
      uninjured limb, and will then arrange their first follow up physiotherapy appointment for&#xD;
      within the next 2-3 weeks. Patients allocated to the control group (standard rehabilitation)&#xD;
      will be booked their first physiotherapy appointment after signing their consent form. The&#xD;
      patient will also be asked to complete some questionnaires about their current level of&#xD;
      function/pain/etc.- these are completed by all patients suffering this particular injury&#xD;
      regardless of participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have ongoing physiotherapy treatment at as many appointments as are&#xD;
      deemed necessary in agreement with themselves and the treating physiotherapist to return to&#xD;
      their required level of function. Those in the experimental group will receive a&#xD;
      strength-training regime for they uninjured limb in addition to usual rehabilitation for the&#xD;
      injured limb. Those in the control group will receive usual rehabilitation for the injured&#xD;
      limb. All participants will be required to complete further questionnaires at 6 and 12 weeks&#xD;
      after the initial questionnaires were completed (as is the case for all patients receiving&#xD;
      physiotherapy at this Trust).&#xD;
