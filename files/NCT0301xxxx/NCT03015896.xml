  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide when given together&#xD;
      with nivolumab and to see how well they work in treating patients with non-Hodgkin or Hodgkin&#xD;
      lymphoma that has come back and does not respond to treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as lenalidomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Giving nivolumab and lenalidomide may work better in treating patients with&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin or Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of lenalidomide and nivolumab&#xD;
      in patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). (Phase I) II. To determine&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination of&#xD;
      lenalidomide and nivolumab in patients with relapsed/refractory NHL. (Phase I) III. To&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility and toxicities of the combination of lenalidomide and nivolumab in&#xD;
      patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin's disease (HD). (Phase IB) IV. To evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of the combination of lenalidomide and nivolumab in terms of overall response rate&#xD;
      in patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma (DLBCL). (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of lenalidomide and nivolumab in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory NHL in terms of overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR),&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). (Phase I) II. To evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of the combination of lenalidomide and nivolumab in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory HD in terms of complete response rate (CR). (Phase IB) III. To evaluate&#xD;

&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the relationship between prognostic parameters including ki-67 staining, PD-1&#xD;
      staining and cell of origin (activated B-cell or ABC versus germinal center B-cell or GCB)&#xD;
      with ORR to the combination of lenalidomide and nivolumab in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory NHL. (Phase I) II. To evaluate and monitor effects on B-, T-, and natural&#xD;
      killer (NK)-cell function with the combination of lenalidomide and nivolumab in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory NHL. (Phase I) III. To explore the relationship between prognostic&#xD;
      parameters including ki-67 staining, PD-1 staining and cell of origin (activated B-cell or&#xD;
      ABC versus germinal center B-cell or GCB) with ORR to the combination of lenalidomide and&#xD;
      nivolumab in patients with relapsed/refractory FL and DLBCL. (Phase II) IV. To evaluate and&#xD;
      monitor effects on B-, T-, and NK-cell function with the combination of lenalidomide and&#xD;
      nivolumab in patients with relapsed/refractory FL and DLBCL. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of lenalidomide followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-21 and nivolumab intravenously (IV) over&#xD;
      60 minutes on days 1 and 15 of courses 1-4 and on day 1 of courses 5-12. Courses repeat every&#xD;
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,&#xD;
      then every 6 months for up to 3 years.&#xD;
