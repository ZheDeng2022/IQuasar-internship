  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the study are 1) to determine the influence of daily consumption of&#xD;
      well-cooked broccoli on plasma and urinary glucosinolate metabolites, and 2) to determine&#xD;
      inflammatory marker changes consistent with decreased cancer risk.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Consumption of Brassica vegetables is inversely associated with incidence of several cancers,&#xD;
      including cancer of the lung, stomach, liver, colon, rectum, breast, endometrium, and&#xD;
      ovaries. Brassica vegetables are a good source of many nutrients, but the unique&#xD;
      characteristic of Brassicas (Broccoli in particular) is their rich content of glucosinolates.&#xD;
      Glucosinolates are sulfur-containing compounds that are converted to isothiocyanates (ITC) by&#xD;
      an enzyme in the plant called myrosinase, which is released when the vesicles containing&#xD;
      myrosinase are ruptured by chewing or cutting. The isothiocyanates are considered to be the&#xD;
      active agent for cancer prevention. Some of the mechanisms by which isothiocyanates likely&#xD;
      inhibit cancer include modulation of cytochrome P450 enzymes, induction of phase II enzymes,&#xD;
      and apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate how daily consumption of broccoli with myrosinase&#xD;
      inactivated by cooking influences glucosinolate metabolism and absorption, and consequent&#xD;
      regulation of inflammatory markers.&#xD;
