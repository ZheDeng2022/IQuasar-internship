      This is a multiple-center, open-label, phase 2 study evaluating the humanized anti-PD-1&#xD;
      antibody JS001, as a monotherapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma who&#xD;
      have failed in previous routine systemic treatment. Patients are injected with JS001 with&#xD;
      3mg/kg every 2 weeks until disease progresses or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Response&#xD;
      assessment is conducted by every 8 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>humanized anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (JS001) is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor antibody, which selectively interferes with the combination of PD-1 with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, resulting in the activation of lymphocytes and elimination of malignancy theoretically.</description>
