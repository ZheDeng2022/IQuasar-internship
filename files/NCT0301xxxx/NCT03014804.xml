      This phase II trial studies the side effects of autologous dendritic cells pulsed with tumor&#xD;
      lysate antigen vaccine and nivolumab and to see how well they work in treating patients with&#xD;
      glioblastoma that has come back. Vaccines made from a person's tumor cells may help the body&#xD;
      build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving dendritic&#xD;
      cell-autologous lung tumor vaccine and nivolumab may work better in treating patients with&#xD;
      glioblastoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination treatment of autologous&#xD;
      dendritic cells pulsed with tumor lysate antigen vaccine (DCVax-L) and nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare overall survival (OS) from the date of surgery in a pooled evaluation of group&#xD;
      1 subjects receiving DCVax-L and group 2 subjects receiving DCVax-L and nivolumab to recent&#xD;
      historical standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To compare OS between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Safety. II. Feasibility. III. Tumor response. IV. Immune response. V. Quality of Life&#xD;
      (QoL). VI. Overall survival (OS). VII. Overall survival rate at 9, 12, and 18 months. VIII.&#xD;
      Progression-free survival (PFS). IX. Evaluation of the safety of the DCVax-L + nivolumab&#xD;
      combination regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Estimate correlation of quantitative assessments of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL)&#xD;
      proliferation (CD8+/Ki-67+ staining).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Estimate difference in PD-1 and PD-L1 immunohistochemistry expression between density or&#xD;
      clonality with clinical responses to combination therapy in recurrent glioblastoma subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Estimate differences between outcome groups in monocytic PD-L1 expression at baseline&#xD;
      and over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Estimate differences between outcome groups in circulating tumor DNA, circulating tumor&#xD;
      cells, and CD4+ T cells at baseline and over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Estimate difference in PD-1 and PD-L1 immunohistochemical (IHC) expression between&#xD;
      archived and study samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Explore patterns of tumor proteomic profiling. VII. Estimate efficacy of combination&#xD;
      therapy by progression-free survival (PFS), rates of contrasted tumor change over time, and&#xD;
      overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. Explore effect of nivolumab on TIL proliferation (CD8+/Ki-67+ staining). IX. Explore&#xD;
      whether oligoclonal T cell populations within tumor tissue are similarly expanded in&#xD;
      peripheral blood after nivolumab, the magnitude of which correlates with clinical responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X. Explore if changes in specific MRI parameters correlate with tumor and peripheral blood&#xD;
      immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XI. Explore if a mesenchymal gene expression signature present in the initial archived tumor&#xD;
      sample correlates with T lymphocytic response in tumor after nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XII. Correlate changes of positron emission tomography (PET) in tumor with the following: TIL&#xD;
      density or clonality, clinical outcome, T cell measures in peripheral blood, clinical&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XIII. Correlate changes in PET in lymph nodes with the following: TIL density or clonality,&#xD;
      clinical outcome, T cell measures in peripheral blood, clinical toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XIV. Correlate changes in PET in organ tissue with TIL density or clonality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients receive dendritic cell-autologous lung tumor vaccine intradermally (ID) on&#xD;
      days 0, 7, 14, and weeks 4, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17 and 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients receive dendritic cell-autologous lung tumor vaccine as in Group I, and&#xD;
      nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 0, 14, and weeks 4, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17,&#xD;
      and 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 12 months.&#xD;

                  oligodendroglial components)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects must have sufficient tumor lysate protein generated from the resected&#xD;
             tumor tissue; this determination will be made by the sponsor's contracted manufacturer&#xD;
             and communicated to the clinical site through the sponsor or its designee; this&#xD;
             confirmation is not required prior to the pre-leukapheresis visit, but is required&#xD;
             before the subject can proceed to leukapheresis&#xD;

                  steroids interfere with DCVax-L manufacturing by hampering the ability of&#xD;
                  monocytes to adhere to plastic surfaces during purification; leukapheresis should&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Fever &gt;= 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit (F) (38.6 degrees Celsius [C]); if considered&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Males who are sexually active with WOCBP and not willing to use any contraceptive&#xD;
             method with a failure rate of less than 1% per year for 7 months after the week 20&#xD;
