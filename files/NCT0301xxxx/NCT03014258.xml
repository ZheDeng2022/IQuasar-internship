  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study that will assess the acquisition of immunity to Pf malaria over the&#xD;
      course of 5 sequential Controlled Human Malaria Infections (CHMI) over 2-4 years, in 10&#xD;
      healthy adult participants. 10 subjects will initially be challenged with 5 uninfected&#xD;
      mosquitoes (mock), followed by 5 challenges with 5 mosquitoes infected with drug sensitive,&#xD;
      P. falciparum parasites (strain NF54) 2, 8, 14-20, 20-32, and 32-36 months later. For the&#xD;
      final four infective CMHIs six additional immunologic malaria-naïve subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
      and challenged as infectivity controls. If dropouts occur within the original 10 person&#xD;
      cohort, and two or more CHMI remain, back-up replacement volunteers will be recruited to&#xD;
      undergo successive CHMI with the core group. All volunteers (repeat CHMI subjects and&#xD;
      infectivity controls) will be evaluated as part of an inpatient stay (or outpatient daily&#xD;
      follow-up) to diagnose Pf malaria infection and treat with Coartem(R)&#xD;
      (artemether/lumefantrine) or Malarone(R) (Atovaquone/proguanil). Daily observation will occur&#xD;
      from Study Days 9-19 or until three-day directly observed therapy for P. falciparum infection&#xD;
      is complete and two negative smears separated by a time interval &gt;12 hours have been&#xD;
      documented. A third negative smear &gt;12 hours after the previous two daily smears will be&#xD;
      documented to affirm malaria cure. Infectivity Controls enrolled as part of CHMI #5 will be&#xD;
      treated based on concomitant us qPCR results. The repeat CHMI subjects will have additional&#xD;
      outpatient visits days 1, 3, 5, and 7 after the challenge to obtain blood samples to monitor&#xD;
      the development of immunity. The study is expected to last for 48 months and will include&#xD;
      approximately 34 healthy male and female volunteers (10 active study volunteers and 18 naïve&#xD;
      controls to confirm Pf infectivity during the 2nd -5th CHMI challenges) ages 18 to 50 years,&#xD;
      inclusive, from the greater Baltimore community. The primary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      determine whether protective immunity against parasite infection develops following repeat&#xD;
      CHMI.&#xD;

      determine whether protective immunity against parasite infection develops following repeat&#xD;
      CHMI. The secondary objectives are to: 1) determine whether clinical signs and symptoms of&#xD;
      malaria decrease in intensity and duration following repeat CHMI, 2) track the production of&#xD;
      antibodies that react with P. falciparum sporozoites and blood stage parasites.&#xD;
