  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PHITT trial is an over-arching study for patients with Hepatoblastoma (HB) and&#xD;
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). This trial will use a risk-adapted approach to the treatment&#xD;
      of children diagnosed with HB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with HCC will be included as a separate cohort.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will evaluate whether reducing treatment for low risk HB patients maintains their&#xD;
      excellent event free survival (EFS) and decreases acute and long-term toxicity.&#xD;
      Intensification of therapy with the use of novel agents will be evaluated in the high risk&#xD;
      group. The trial will also compare three different regimens in intermediate risk HB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with HCC will be divided into groups based on whether the tumour is resectable or&#xD;
      unresectable and/or metastatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the biology of HB and HCC, using the identification/validation of novel and&#xD;
      already reported prognostic biomarkers as well as toxicity biomarkers is a key strand of this&#xD;
      trial, so patients in all risk groups can be registered. The trial is also designed to&#xD;
      optimise the collection of clinically annotated biologic specimens and establish the world's&#xD;
      largest repository of blood and tissue samples from paediatric patients with HB and HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial includes 4 randomised comparisons addressing therapeutic questions. For low risk HB&#xD;
      patients, outcome with a total of 4 cycles of treatment is not inferior to those receiving a&#xD;
      total of 6 cycles of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For intermediate risk patients, 3 regimens will be compared for outcome and toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For high risk patients, 2 post induction regimens will be compared for outcome. For resected&#xD;
      HCC patients, the addition of GEMOX to PLADO regimen will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition the following will be assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To validate a new global risk stratification, defined by Children's Hepatic Tumours&#xD;
           International Collaboration (CHIC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate clinically relevant factors, including the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Provide a comprehensive and highly-validated panel of diagnostic and prognostic&#xD;
                biomarkers&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Determine if paediatric HCC is a biologically different entity to adult HCC&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Develop genomic and/or biomarker analysis to predict children who may have an&#xD;
                increased risk of developing toxicity with chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish a collection of clinically and pathologically-annotated biological samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate a surgical planning tool for an impact on decision making processes in&#xD;
           POST-TEXT III and IV HB&#xD;
