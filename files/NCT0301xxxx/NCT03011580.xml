    <textblock>
      This Strategic Research Project is a translational proof-of-concept study that will determine&#xD;
      whether vitamin D3 has potential to prevent recurrent tuberculosis (TB), as indicated by&#xD;
      enhanced resolution of pulmonary inflammation detected using 18F-FDG PET-CT scanning. The&#xD;
      extent of pulmonary inflammation detectable on PET-CT scanning is a validated biomarker that&#xD;
      has previously been shown to predict risk of TB recurrence in patients taking anti-TB&#xD;
      treatment. The investigators propose to explore whether vitamin D3 can enhance resolution of&#xD;
      PET-CT-detectable pulmonary inflammation, on the basis of extensive preliminary data from in&#xD;
      vitro studies and a Phase 2b clinical trial that the investigators have conducted, showing&#xD;
      that high-dose vitamin D3 accelerates resolution of peripheral blood inflammatory responses&#xD;
      in patients with pulmonary TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty vitamin D-deficient patients who have completed 6 months' TB treatment, but who still&#xD;
      have residual pulmonary inflammation detectable on PET-CT scanning, will be allocated to&#xD;
      receive either an 8-week course of high-dose oral vitamin D3 supplementation or placebo&#xD;
      during the study period. The extent of pulmonary inflammation on PET-CT scanning will be&#xD;
      compared between intervention vs. control groups at 8-week follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the study shows a positive result, it will generate valuable proof-of-concept data that&#xD;
      could be used to support an application to conduct a large phase 3 trial of vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation to prevent TB recurrence.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Study design and its justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an exploratory study to compare the effects of vitamin D supplementation against&#xD;
      placebo (capsules with no active drug) on residual pulmonary inflammation detectable with&#xD;
      PET-CT scanning. If the study demonstrates that vitamin D supplementation can dampen down&#xD;
      lung inflammation in patients who still have such inflammation at the end of antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment, it will provide the basis for bigger and more rigorous studies. Half of the&#xD;
      participants will be asked to take capsules containing vitamin D (the immediate&#xD;
      supplementation group) and the other half placebo (the delayed supplementation group) for a&#xD;
      duration of 8 weeks, once they have completed anti-tuberculosis treatment. There is an equal&#xD;
      chance (1 in 2) that participants will be given either study medication - this allows the two&#xD;
      groups to be fairly similar in background characteristics so that any differences in&#xD;
      inflammation after 8 weeks would be put down to vitamin D supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will adopt a 'double-blind' approach, meaning that neither participants nor&#xD;
      researchers will know which study medication each participant is taking for the duration of&#xD;
      the study. This allows to minimise the influence that knowing the type of study medication&#xD;
      each participant is taking might have on researchers' or participants' behaviour during the&#xD;
      study, as these behaviours might affect the results of the study. This is also one of the&#xD;
      reasons that the investigators have chosen to use placebo in this study, rather than&#xD;
      comparing participants taking vitamin D to those who are not taking any study medication. In&#xD;
      addition, the use of placebo may encourage participants to take the study medication. It is&#xD;
      unlikely that the delay in starting vitamin D replacement for participants in the delayed&#xD;
      supplementation arm would be harmful, as vitamin D deficiency is very unlikely to be&#xD;
      associated with any acute medical problem, and the delay in its correction (8 weeks) is very&#xD;
      short in relation to the likely duration of deficiency preceding the study, which is likely&#xD;
      to have been longstanding (e.g. over years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Attend up to three visits to hospital after they have completed a course of antibiotics&#xD;
           for pulmonary tuberculosis. Visit 2 may be conducted via telephone with posting of study&#xD;
           medication (by registered mail or courier)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Take three capsules of study medication (each is 3,200 IU so a total of 9,600 IU) every&#xD;
           day, using the dispenser provided by the investigators&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Give two blood samples: first =19 ml (~4 tsp), second =25 ml (~5 tsp)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Give two coughing samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have two chest PET-CT scans&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Receive five telephone calls, each lasting about five minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Receive additional telephone calls if any doses are missed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be given a copy of the Patient Information Sheet (PIS) by a&#xD;
      member of their usual care team at their scheduled clinic appointment after completing TB&#xD;
      treatment and ample time (at least 24 hours) to decide whether they want to take part in the&#xD;
      study. Those taking a PIS will be asked to complete a contact slip providing their contact&#xD;
      details and authorising the research team to make contact with them once they have had a&#xD;
      chance to read the information; this contact slip will be forwarded to the research team by&#xD;
      the participant's usual care team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone call 1 - This will feed back results of tests of vitamin D status, calcium and&#xD;
      renal function performed as part of usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants who are found to be vitamin D deficient (serum 25[OH]D &lt;50 nmol/L),&#xD;
      normocalcaemic (serum corrected calcium &lt;2.65 mmol/L) and to have eGFR &gt;30 ml/min/1.73 m2&#xD;
      will be invited to attend Visit 1 (-2 weeks) for screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 - Potential participants attending Visit 1 will be asked to give written informed&#xD;
      consent to participate in the study. A PET-CT scan will be performed at the Department of&#xD;
      Nuclear Medicine, Barts Health NHS Trust (radiation exposure for a PET-CT scan is 4.6 mSv).&#xD;
      All women of childbearing age will be asked to do a urine pregnancy test before the PET-CT&#xD;
      scan ; the scan will not proceed unless a negative pregnancy test result is obtained at this&#xD;
      time. Blood samples (volume of 19 ml) for immunological testing and an induced sputum sample&#xD;
      will also be taken during this visit. Participants' GPs will be notified by post about their&#xD;
      involvement in the study at this stage, where consent has been given to do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone call 2 - This will feed back results of tests of the PET-CT scan performed at Visit&#xD;
      1. Participants who are found to have significant residual PET-hot pulmonary inflammation on&#xD;
      this scan (SUVmax ≥3 g/ml) will be invited to attend Visit 2 (0 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (0 weeks) - At this visit, eligible participants will be allocated to oral vitamin D&#xD;
      replacement therapy at a daily dose of 9,600 IU of Fultium-D3 (cholecalciferol or vitamin D3)&#xD;
      for 8 weeks for the immediate supplementation arm (n=20) or oral placebo for 8 weeks for the&#xD;
      delayed supplementation arm (n=20). Fultium-D3 and placebo will be identical in appearance&#xD;
      and taste and both will be given at a dose of three capsules once daily (each Fultium-D3&#xD;
      capsules contains 3,200 IU vitamin D3). Participants may also be given a CE-marked Sensemedic&#xD;
      dispenser each for real-time adherence monitoring and shown how to use it. Participants will&#xD;
      be advised of the symptoms of high blood calcium levels (nausea, vomiting, thirst, passing&#xD;
      excessive amounts of urine or feeling generally unwell) and asked to contact a designated&#xD;
      member of the study team if they develop these symptoms so that a blood test to check for&#xD;
      high blood calcium levels can be arranged urgently. Any new symptoms reported between Visit 2&#xD;
      and Visit 3 will be assessed by a study doctor for potential association with the study&#xD;
      medication. Arrangements will be made during this visit for telephone follow-up sessions.&#xD;
      Visit 2 may be conducted via telephone with posting of study medication (by registered mail&#xD;
      or courier) at an investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up telephone calls (T3-5 and for missed doses) - Follow-up telephone calls will be&#xD;
      made at 1 week (T3), 3 weeks (T4) and 5 weeks (T5) post-randomisation for all participants. A&#xD;
      member of the study team will telephone participants at a pre-arranged time to check&#xD;
      adherence to study medication and if there have been any problems with using the Sensemedic&#xD;
      dispenser. Telephone calls will also be made to participants when a non-adherence is logged&#xD;
      on the Sensemedic system. Additional intermediate study face-to-face visits will be arranged&#xD;
      as necessary if any adherence issues are identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 - PET-CT scans and measurement of whole blood (volume of 25 ml) and induced sputum&#xD;
      inflammatory markers will be repeated at Visit 3 (+8 weeks). All women of childbearing age&#xD;
      will be asked to do a urine pregnancy test before the PET-CT scan ; the scan will not proceed&#xD;
      unless a negative pregnancy test result is obtained at this time. All radiological read-outs&#xD;
      will be assessed by radiologists blinded to allocation, and compared between supplemented vs.&#xD;
      unsupplemented patients using analysis of covariance to adjust for baseline values. All&#xD;
      participants will be offered vitamin D supplementation after their 8-week follow-up&#xD;
      assessment, prior to discharge from the study. Participants'GPs will be informed by post that&#xD;
      their participation in the study has ended. All participants will be informed by post at the&#xD;
      end of the study of whether they received vitamin D supplements or placebo between Visit 2&#xD;
      and Visit 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discontinuation of study medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants whose study medication is discontinued will remain in follow-up as long as they&#xD;
      consent to do so, and data will continue to be collected for them.&#xD;
