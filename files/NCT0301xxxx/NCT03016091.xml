      A Phase II, Open-label, Single Arm Trial of Pembrolizumab for Refractory Atypical and&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, single arm, open label, interventional study. The goal of&#xD;
      this study, is to evaluate feasibility and efficacy of pembrolizumab for the treatment of&#xD;
      recurrent or progressive meningioma (WHO grades II-III) or hemangiopericytoma (HPC). All&#xD;
      patients will receive IV pembrolizumab, at a dose of 200mg, every 3 weeks. Patients will be&#xD;
      treated until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Treatment can be stopped after one&#xD;
      year of treatment in case of stable disease or completer response, with re-initiation of&#xD;
      treatment upon progression. Expression of PD1 and PD-L1 will be tested, on tumor cells, using&#xD;
      IHC staining on biopsy material obtained from previous surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have a baseline neurologic and clinical exam, MRI scan, a brain dedicated&#xD;
      CT-PET scan, a baseline cognitive exam and QOL assessment with a dedicated questionnaire.&#xD;
      Patients will have a clinical and neurological exam every treatment cycle. MRI scan will be&#xD;
      repeated after 2 months from the beginning of the trial drug administration and then every&#xD;
      2-3 months. There are no designated and specific criteria for response assessment in the&#xD;
      treatment of meningioma. Therefore, response evaluation will be made using the RECIST 1.1&#xD;
      criteria, as used for solid tumors. The trial will allow the continuation of pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      case of stable or improved clinical response, when pseudo-progression is suspected in the&#xD;
      MRI. In addition, response assessment will also be made according to the RANO criteria, as&#xD;
      used for high grade glioma. This will be compared to the RECIST evaluation, but will not be&#xD;
      used for treatment decision making.&#xD;
