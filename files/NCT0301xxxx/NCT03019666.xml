      This is a phase I trial with pilot expansion of HLA-haploidentical or HLA-mismatched related&#xD;
      donor nicotinamide expanded-natural killer (NAM-NK) cell based therapy for patients with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM) or relapsed/refractory CD20-positive non-Hodgkin&#xD;
      lymphoma (NHL). The primary endpoint of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) of NAM-NK cells while maintaining safety.&#xD;

    <description>After a lymphodepleting preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, patients receive expanded NAM-NK cells followed by a short course of interleukin-2 (IL-2) to facilitate natural killer cell survival and expansion in vivo. Monoclonal antibodies and elotuzumab for Multiple Myeloma patients, will be administered prior to and after the natural killer cell infusion(s) to facilitate tumor targeting and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).</description>
