    <textblock>
      This protocol outlines a prospective study evaluating safety and clinical outcomes of&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations performed on patients with cardiac implantable&#xD;
      electrical devices (CIEDs) including pacemakers (PMs) and implantable&#xD;
      cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). This prospective study aims to improve the evidence base&#xD;
      regarding this common clinical scenario. Specifically, the investigators aim to address&#xD;
      whether results of MRI in PM/ICD patients affect physician decision making related to&#xD;
      clinical management strategy and planning treatment interventions. Further, this study will&#xD;
      evaluate whether the results of MRI in these patients affects patient outcomes related to&#xD;
      survival and adverse events during or after MRI scanning.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MRI is the preferred imaging modality for both acute and elective evaluation of many&#xD;
      conditions. For example, for many diseases of the central nervous system, no other imaging&#xD;
      modality provides the requisite soft tissue resolution to support critical care elements such&#xD;
      as neurosurgical planning or assessment of intracranial malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, MRIs were considered contraindicated for patients with CIEDs including PMs and&#xD;
      ICDs. However, studies have demonstrated very high utilization of MRIs among patients&#xD;
      eligible for CIEDs. In many cases, alternative imaging is either insufficient or, as with&#xD;
      CT-myelography, poses substantial risks or procedural hurdles that may be less favorable than&#xD;
      the potential risks of an MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, a growing literature has suggested that MRIs can be performed safely in the&#xD;
      setting of CIEDs if certain precautions are taken. Additionally, guidance documents have been&#xD;
      released by professional societies including the American Heart Association (AHA) and the&#xD;
      American College of Radiology (ACR) outlining recommended safety measures that can be taken&#xD;
      to minimize risk and maximize benefit for patients in need of imaging. However, there are&#xD;
      fewer data on performing MRIs in pacemaker-dependent patients with ICDs, who were excluded&#xD;
      from the largest published study as well as the MagnaSafe Registry. Thus, demonstrating the&#xD;
      safety and clinical utility of performing MRIs in this context is of high importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In response to urgent clinical considerations, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center has&#xD;
      established a clinical protocol to provide safe MRIs in cases of compelling clinical&#xD;
      indications, with close supervision and oversight from Radiology and Cardiac&#xD;
      Electrophysiology staff. Thus, the investigators now propose a prospective study to evaluate&#xD;
      safety and clinical outcomes for patients treated under this clinical protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, this study proposes to perform a prospective clinical trial in patients with&#xD;
      CIEDs that have a clinical need for MRI as outpatients to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Safety according to the incidence rates of acute major and minor adverse events&#xD;
           according to pre-specified definitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical outcomes and scan utility affecting patients' survival and quality of life and&#xD;
           treatment, including acute and longitudinal changes in device parameters, the need for&#xD;
           system revision, and proportion of MRI findings influencing clinical management&#xD;
           including medical or surgical interventions, and diagnostic or prognostic changes.&#xD;
