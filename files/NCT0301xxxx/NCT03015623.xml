  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of the investigational&#xD;
      product, SBI-101, in subjects with Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) who require continuous renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy. SBI-101 is a biologic/device combination product designed to regulate&#xD;
      inflammation and promote repair of injured tissue using allogeneic human mesenchymal stromal&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in two cohorts, with an interim analysis performed in between the&#xD;
      cohorts. In the first cohort, subjects will be randomized to receive one of two treatments -&#xD;
      low dose SBI-101 or sham control. In the second cohort, subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive one of two treatments - high dose SBI-101 or sham control. SBI-101 or sham control&#xD;
      will be integrated into the renal replacement circuit and subjects in both cohorts will be&#xD;
      treated for up to 24 hours.&#xD;

    <description>SBI-101 is a biologic/device combination product that combines two components: allogeneic human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and an FDA-approved plasmapheresis device. SBI-101 is administered via integration into a Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy circuit and is designed to regulate inflammation and promote repair of injured tissue.</description>
