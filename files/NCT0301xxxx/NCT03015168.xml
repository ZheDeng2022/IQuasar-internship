  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We explored the relationship between NLR and grade 3 or higher treatment related small bowel&#xD;
      toxicity and treatment outcome of patients with rectal cancer undergoing capecitabine and&#xD;
      concurrent intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).&#xD;

      Gender, age, stage of disease, and pathologic factors were retrospectively obtained from&#xD;
      electronic patient records. Staging was determined according to the classification&#xD;
      established by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC, 7th edition).Pelvic magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) were used for pretreatment staging. All patients enrolled in this&#xD;
      study were treated with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) concurrent with capecitabine&#xD;
      (1600 mg/m2/d, administered twice daily for two weeks) before or after curative resection.&#xD;
      The mean radiation dose was 50 Gy with daily fraction of 2.0 Gy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute treatment toxicity was scored according to the National Cancer Institute Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE; version 3.0) and late toxicity was classified&#xD;
      according to the Late Effects in Normal Tissue-Subjective, Objective, Management and Analytic&#xD;
      (LENT-SOMA) system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the whole treatment procedure, all patients were subjected to a follow-up every three&#xD;
      months for the first two years, every six months for the next three years, and every year&#xD;
      thereafter. Physical examinations, routine blood test, serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)&#xD;
      and Cancer Antigen 19-9 (CA-199) level were checked at each follow up. Chest, abdominal CT&#xD;
      scan and total colonoscopy were performed annually except the suspicion of tumor recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall survival (OS) time was defined from the date of completion of treatment to death from&#xD;
      any cause and progression-free survival (PFS) time was defined as the time from the date of&#xD;
      completion of therapy to the date of local recurrence or distant metastasis or death. Patient&#xD;
      follow-up was lasted until death or the cutoff date of January 2017.Blood sampling reports&#xD;
      from each enrolled patient were obtained within seven days before treatment. White blood cell&#xD;
      count, neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelet counts were examined. The NLR was calculated as&#xD;
      the absolute neutrophil count divided by the absolute lymphocyte count using baseline blood&#xD;
      test results.&#xD;
