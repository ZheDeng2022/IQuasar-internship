      Spastic hypertonia is common after stroke. Whole-body vibration (WBV) is known to have&#xD;
      modulatory effects of muscle reflex activity and blood flow in other populations and thus&#xD;
      have potential applications in the management of spastic hypertonia post-stroke. This study&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Spastic hypertonia is common after stroke. Whole-body vibration (WBV) is known to have&#xD;
      modulatory effects of muscle reflex activity and blood flow in other populations and thus&#xD;
      have potential applications in management of spastic hypertonia post-stroke. However, the&#xD;
      potential effects of WBV on leg muscle stiffness in stroke rehabilitation remains unknown.&#xD;
      Scientific evidence is warranted to fill the knowledge gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose This study aims to investigate the acute effect of WBV on leg muscle H-reflex,&#xD;
      stiffness and blood perfusion in people with chronic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Individuals with chronic stroke will be recruited from community self-help groups and&#xD;
      existing patient database. Relevant information (e.g. demographic information, medical&#xD;
      history) will be obtained from medical records and subject interviews. Each subject will have&#xD;
      to fulfill the following inclusion criteria: (1) diagnosis of chronic stroke, (2)&#xD;
      community-dwelling, (3) able to follow simple verbal instructions. Exclusion criteria are:&#xD;
      (1) other diagnoses of neurological conditions, (2) significant musculoskeletal conditions&#xD;
      (e.g. amputations), (3) metal implants in the lower extremity or spine, (4) recent fracture&#xD;
      in the lower extremity, (5) diagnosis of osteoporosis, (6) vestibular disorders, (7)&#xD;
      peripheral vascular disease, and (11) other serious illnesses or contraindications to&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-blinded randomized within-patient cross-over study. Each participant was&#xD;
      evaluated for the soleus H-reflex, stiffness and blood perfusion of the medial gastrocnemius&#xD;
      (MG) using ultrasound on both sides before and after either a 5-minute WBV intervention (30&#xD;
      Hertz, 1.5mm, knee flexed 60 degrees) or a no-WBV condition (5 minutes). The measurements&#xD;
      were performed at baseline and every 1-min post-intervention up to 5 minutes. The outcomes&#xD;
      generated included the soleus H/M ratio, shear modulus and vascular index (VI) of the MG&#xD;
      muscle.&#xD;
