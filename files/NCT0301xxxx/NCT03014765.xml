      Study will enroll patients scheduled for hip arthroplasty. In each subject a flow-mediated&#xD;
      dilatation capability (FMD) of the brachial artery will be measured prior to elective&#xD;
      surgery, within 24 hours after surgery and 5-7 days after surgery. At each session the&#xD;
      brachial artery diameter will be measured at rest, during cuff inflation and 50 seconds after&#xD;
      cuff deflation. From above mentioned values the increase in the diameter of the artery during&#xD;
      reactive hyperemia will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simultaneously with the ultrasound investigations, the blood for determination of the&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction markers will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be contacted again 3 months after the surgery and asked about the&#xD;
      complications which may be associated with the surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular complications, especially coronary heart disease, are one of the main causes&#xD;
      of perioperative complications. Indicators of pre-clinical atherosclerosis, such as:&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction, increased arterial intima/media thickness (especially in the carotid&#xD;
      arteries), carotid calcification and coronary calcification, suggest the presence of&#xD;
      atherosclerotic process without the symptomatic presentation. Endothelial dysfunction is one&#xD;
      of the earliest measurable changes that predict the development of atherosclerotic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery is a significant stress for the organism: it increases the release of free oxygen&#xD;
      radicals and through oxidative stress it increases systemic inflammatory response and causes&#xD;
      thromboembolic complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study 50 patients of both sexes 40-80 years of age scheduled for hip arthroplasty will&#xD;
      be included. In each subject a flow-mediated dilatation capability (FMD) of the brachial&#xD;
      artery will be measured prior to elective surgery, within 24 hours after surgery and 5-7 days&#xD;
      after surgery. Measurement of the brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation capability (FMD):&#xD;
      the brachial artery diameter will be measured 5 cm proximal to the antecubital fossa at rest,&#xD;
      during cuff inflation and 50 seconds after cuff deflation. The cuff will be inflated for 4&#xD;
      min. From above mentioned values the increase in the diameter of the artery during reactive&#xD;
      hyperemia will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simultaneously with the ultrasound investigations, the blood for determination of the&#xD;
      inflammatory and endothelial dysfunction markers (CRP, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-18, TNFa, VW&#xD;
      Factor, Selectin P, selectin E) will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be contacted again 3 months after the surgery and asked about the&#xD;
      complications which may be associated with the surgery.&#xD;
