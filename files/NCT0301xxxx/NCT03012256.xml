      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Canada, home care clients are a large and expanding subgroup of medically complex older&#xD;
      adults with relatively poor access to effective chronic disease management. They have double&#xD;
      the emergency department utilization rate compared to nursing home residents or other older&#xD;
      populations. The investigators previously published a case-finding tool (the Detection of&#xD;
      Indicators and Vulnerabilities for Emergency Room Trips (DIVERT) Scale) that has been&#xD;
      recommended for chronic disease management case-finding in home care. The investigators&#xD;
      recently conducted a pilot trial in Niagara, Canada, of a targeted, person-centered model of&#xD;
      supportive cardio-respiratory disease management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate a cardio-respiratory disease management model in home care to&#xD;
      manage symptoms and avoid emergency department use. A pan-Canadian, pragmatic&#xD;
      cluster-randomized trial will be conducted by a collaboration of trial investigators and&#xD;
      public home care providers (i.e., health regions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to evaluate the effectiveness and preliminary cost-effectiveness of a&#xD;
      targeted, person-centered cardio-respiratory management model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main question is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      P: Among home care clients experiencing cardio-respiratory symptoms (objectively targeted&#xD;
      using the DIVERT Scale), I: can a guideline-based, feasible, multi-component/complex,&#xD;
      cardio-respiratory management model, C: compared to regular care, O: reduce&#xD;
      cardio-respiratory symptoms, reduce/postpone unplanned emergency department (ED) visits,&#xD;
      reduce unplanned hospital use, improve patient activation, or improve health-related quality&#xD;
      of life for clients, T: over a 6-month follow-up period from baseline?&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Context:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Public home care services are delivered to at least 6% of Canadians age 65-74, 15% age 75-84&#xD;
      and 32% age 85 or older. These clients are medically complex, access care across settings,&#xD;
      have very high emergency department utilization rates, and have relatively poor access to&#xD;
      effective chronic disease management. Their frequent emergency department use is not aligned&#xD;
      with chronic disease management or geriatric care principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective chronic disease management models employ multiple components delivered by a&#xD;
      coordinated multidisciplinary team. According to the 'chronic disease management model', home&#xD;
      care plays a complementary function to medical practitioners. Clinical and self-care support&#xD;
      as well as case management are among the most effective components in chronic disease&#xD;
      management. Self-care education and support has been shown to improve health outcomes across&#xD;
      chronic diseases. Sustained follow-up by nurses or other non-medical staff is also effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Canadian home care providers, historically focused on the delivery of personal support&#xD;
      services, have started to develop supportive chronic disease management capacity (e.g.&#xD;
      specialist nurse monitoring). However, most trials exclude frail seniors and are not specific&#xD;
      to home care, which leaves little evidence to inform chronic disease management practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous Work:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective chronic disease management in home care has been limited by insufficient targeting&#xD;
      of clients at most need or most likely to benefit. The investigators developed and validated&#xD;
      a prognostic case-finding tool for home care known as the Detection of Indicators and&#xD;
      Vulnerabilities of Emergency Room Trips (DIVERT) Scale that has been recommended for home&#xD;
      care. It can be derived in real time from the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care&#xD;
      (RAI-HC) standardized home care assessment used in 9 Canadian provinces as well as Estonia,&#xD;
      Finland, Hong Kong, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore,&#xD;
      Spain, Switzerland, and some U.S. states. Cardio-respiratory symptoms and conditions are&#xD;
      prominent predictive elements of the DIVERT Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on evidence-based guidelines developed - in part - by the investigator team, the&#xD;
      investigators piloted the combined use of the DIVERT Scale with a multi-component&#xD;
      cardio-respiratory management model. The pilot pragmatic cluster randomized trial included&#xD;
      over 200 clients across six home care caseloads. The pilot was recognized on the 2015 Ontario&#xD;
      Minister's Medal Honour Role for Excellence in Health Quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES The main objective is to evaluate the effectiveness and preliminary&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of a targeted, person-centered cardio-respiratory management model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Among home care clients experiencing cardio-respiratory symptoms (objectively targeted&#xD;
           using the DIVERT Scale), can a guideline-based, feasible, multi-component/complex,&#xD;
           cardio-respiratory management model, compared to regular care, reduce/postpone unplanned&#xD;
           emergency department (ED) visits, improve patient activation, reduce cardio-respiratory&#xD;
           symptoms, reduce unplanned hospital use, or improve health-related quality of life for&#xD;
           clients, over a 6-month follow-up period from baseline?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If effective, is there evidence for cost-effectiveness?&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      From evidence-based guidelines developed - in part - by this team, extensive client&#xD;
      profiling, and input of clients/families as well as health professionals, the investigators&#xD;
      developed a person-centred, multi-component cardio-respiratory management model containing&#xD;
      the following components: scheduled nurse-led self-management support (based on a training&#xD;
      program, and tool-kit), advanced care and goal planning, clinical pharmacist medication&#xD;
      reconciliation, team case rounds, SBAR (the Situation, Background, Assessment and&#xD;
      Recommendation) communication protocol with primary care, and a standardized transition&#xD;
      package. Each component has a specific objective within the model, however the manner in&#xD;
      which it is delivered may be adapted. The approach is based on evidence of effective&#xD;
      implementations in other fields, and includes all elements for 'person-centred care'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial that leverages secondary&#xD;
      electronic patient records. Sixty-six (66) geographic areas (home care caseloads) will be&#xD;
      randomized using a 1:2 (intervention: control) ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 1,080 long-stay home care clients living in a non-institutional setting from 66&#xD;
      distinct geographic home care caseloads in Canada. Inclusion criteria: clients who are in the&#xD;
      DIVERT Scale target groups (9,10, 14, 15) will be included (i.e. at least one&#xD;
      cardio-respiratory symptom (chest pain, dyspnea, dizziness, irregular pulse) and at least one&#xD;
      cardiac condition (congestive heart failure or coronary artery disease)). The investigators&#xD;
      will utilize the DIVERT Scale as an objective measure of eligibility. Clients who are&#xD;
      receiving palliative care (i.e., prognosis of less than six months to live, K8e from Resident&#xD;
      Assessment Instrument-Home Care (RAI-HC)) or dialysis (P2g from RAI-HC) at baseline&#xD;
      assessment will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible clients will be identified by each case manager during regular home care enrollment&#xD;
      and reassessment using the RAI-HC assessment (standard practice) for between 6 to 8 months.&#xD;
      Eligible clients will be automatically included into the intervention or 'regular care'&#xD;
      control on an intent-to-treat basis. Each home care provider's process for attaining consent&#xD;
      to intervention will apply. Study informed consent will not be sought given that the&#xD;
      cardio-respiratory management model is considered best practice care and is offered - whole&#xD;
      or in part - at the full clinical discretion of the home care provider as per existing&#xD;
      practice. The cardio-respiratory management is accepted - whole or in part - at the full&#xD;
      clinical discretion of the clients as per existing practice. Trial investigators have no part&#xD;
      in the intervention pilot data collection, individual care decision-making, or records&#xD;
      management during the study period beyond providing guidance and access to resources. All&#xD;
      trial data will be extracted from secondary data and anonymized prior to transmission by home&#xD;
      care provider staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes and Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Difference in days to first unplanned emergency department visit within 6 months of&#xD;
           baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of cardio-respiratory symptoms over 6-month follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cost of all home care services within 6 months of baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in patient activation (based on 13 item patient activation measure) over 6-month&#xD;
           follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in health-related quality of life (based on Minimum Data Set Health Status Index)&#xD;
           over 6-month follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The difference in the number of unplanned emergency department visits per days at risk&#xD;
           (alive, not institutionalized) within 6 months of baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of unplanned inpatient (medical) hospital days per days at risk (alive, not&#xD;
           institutionalized) within 6 months of baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 6-month follow-up will be used to reflect the time at greatest risk among home care&#xD;
      clients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample calculations/Assumptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: Time to first unplanned emergency department visit within 6 months of&#xD;
      baseline (alive, not institutionalized). Ability to detect a hazard ratio of 0.75.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean size of a home care caseload: 120 clients Mean prevalence of DIVERT target group in each&#xD;
      caseload: 30% Expected recruitment over 6 months per caseload: 30 Mean cluster size: 30&#xD;
      Allocation: 1:2 (intervention: control)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simulations using retrospective secondary data sources were undertaken to explore the power&#xD;
      of a hypothetical DIVERT-CARE trial conducted in the Hamilton-Niagara-Haldimand-Brant (HNHB)&#xD;
      health region of Ontario from December 2014 to June 2015. The simulations found that 60 HNHB&#xD;
      home care caseloads randomized at a 1:2 intervention to control ratio could expect to enroll&#xD;
      1,809 patients across seven months. The simulation linked patients to their actual emergency&#xD;
      department utilization records, and extended the time to first ED visit figures for patients&#xD;
      in 20 randomly selected intervention caseloads to achieve a hazard ratio of 0.75, a figure&#xD;
      chosen to be more conservative than the pilot study but still clinically significant. The&#xD;
      overall event rate was 35.5% in the intervention group and 44.8% in the control. The median&#xD;
      time to first visit was 88 days in the intervention group and 75 days in the control. The&#xD;
      power of the simulated DIVERT trial was 94.12% with a two-sided alpha of 0.05. Simulations&#xD;
      with a hazard ratio of 0.80 yielded a power of 79.96% The intracluster correlation&#xD;
      coefficient (ICC) was estimated to be 0.005.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis will be assessed through a multilevel discrete-time proportional&#xD;
      hazards model. The dependent variable will be days until first emergency department visit,&#xD;
      censored at date of home care discharge for any reason. Caseload and partner site will be&#xD;
      included as nested random effects. The hazard ratio, 95% confidence interval, and p-value&#xD;
      will be reported for the treatment group effect and covariates when applicable. A two-sided&#xD;
      alpha level of 0.05 will be used to judge statistical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The economic evaluation will examine total care costs, controlling for length of stay,&#xD;
      between treatment groups to compare incremental costs to incremental effects (i.e. cost per&#xD;
      ED visit averted).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary hypotheses will be evaluated by a multilevel general linear model. Six-month&#xD;
      change in health-related quality of life, number of symptoms, patient activation, and number&#xD;
      of emergency department visits will be the respective dependent variables. Caseload and home&#xD;
      care provider site will be included as nested random effects. The unit change in each&#xD;
      measure, 95% confidence interval, and p-value will be reported for the treatment group effect&#xD;
      and covariates when applicable. A two-sided alpha level of 0.05 will be used to judge&#xD;
      statistical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Secondary Datasets:&#xD;
&#xD;
      RAI-HC: The Resident Assessment Instrument Home Care (RAI-HC) is a standardized comprehensive&#xD;
      assessment containing approximately 200 items, has been found to document major domains of&#xD;
      health reliably. The Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) collects and reports&#xD;
      this data from publically funded home care programs. CIHI conducts its own quality assurance&#xD;
      procedures to ensure accuracy and completeness. CIHI also provides a document describing the&#xD;
      interpretation of all included variables for the RAI-HC dataset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Client Health and Related Information System: The Client Health and Related Information&#xD;
      System (CHRIS) is an online patient management system for Community Care Access Centre (CCAC)&#xD;
      use. It includes patient assessments, documents, provider and vendor contracts, billing of&#xD;
      services information, and medical supplies and equipment rental costs. CHRIS continues to&#xD;
      maintain the quality and integrity of its data independently. Cost data from sites outside of&#xD;
      Ontario will be estimated as per the services rendered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      National Ambulatory Care Reporting System: The National Ambulatory Care Reporting System&#xD;
      (NACRS) contains data from all hospital-based and community-based ambulatory care. It is&#xD;
      collected and maintained by CIHI, which conducts its own quality assurance procedures to&#xD;
      ensure accuracy and completeness. CIHI also provides a document describing the interpretation&#xD;
      of all included variables for this dataset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discharge Abstract Database: The Discharge Abstract Database (DAD) captures administrative,&#xD;
      clinical and demographic information on hospital discharges (including deaths, sign-outs and&#xD;
      transfers). It is collected and maintained by CIHI, which conducts its own quality assurance&#xD;
      procedures to ensure accuracy and completeness. CIHI also provides a document describing the&#xD;
      interpretation of all included variables for this dataset.&#xD;
