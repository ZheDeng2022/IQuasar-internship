             dedifferentiated carcinoma, clear cell adenocarcinoma, mixed epithelial carcinoma,&#xD;
             adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified (N.O.S.), mucinous adenocarcinoma, squamous&#xD;
             cell carcinoma, and transitional cell carcinoma) or endometrial carcinosarcoma).&#xD;
             Histologic documentation of diagnosis of carcinoma is required. MSI-high patients will&#xD;
             be identified based on immunohistochemistry or MSI testing of archival tumor specimens&#xD;
             by department of pathology or via known mutations found in mismatch repair genes via&#xD;
             the Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (IMPACT) assay through&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  All patients must have measurable disease. Measurable disease is defined by RECIST&#xD;
             (version 1.1). Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded). Each&#xD;
             lesion must be ≥ 10 mm when measured by CT, MRI or caliper measurement by clinical&#xD;
             exam; or ≥ 20 mm when measured by chest x-ray. Lymph nodes must be ≥ 15 mm in short&#xD;
             axis when measured by CT or MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have at least one &quot;target lesion&quot; to be used to assess response on this&#xD;
             protocol as defined by RECIST version 1.1. Tumors within a previously irradiated field&#xD;
             will be designated as &quot;non-target&quot; lesions unless progression is documented or a&#xD;
