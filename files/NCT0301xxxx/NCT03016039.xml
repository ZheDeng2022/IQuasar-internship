      To use curcumin supplementation as an additive treatment to induce clinical, biochemical&#xD;
      response and remission in patients with suspected Pelvic inflammatory disease, Tubo ovarian&#xD;
      abcess, Endometritis, wound infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: An addition of oral curcumin to highly suspected PID/Endometritis/Wound infection&#xD;
      patients may augment clinical and biochemical response and accelerates the improvements of&#xD;
      the sign symptoms and reported outcomes of those diseases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), Endometritis, Wound infection are infections of the female&#xD;
      reproductive system. Although PID is a well known pathophysiology the diagnosis method I not&#xD;
      well established and its true magnitude is unknown. Many women report that they have been&#xD;
      treated for PID when they did not suffer from it and vice versa. Hence the main way to&#xD;
      diagnose remains clinical and currently there is no well-established biochemical marker. In&#xD;
      endometritis and wound infection the cause may be known but the pathogens involved in the&#xD;
      disease formation vary as for this broad spectrum antibiotic is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: To use curcumin supplementation as an additive treatment to induce clinical,&#xD;
      biochemical response and remission in patients with suspected PID, Tubo ovarian abcess,&#xD;
      Endometritis, wound infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: An addition of oral curcumin to highly suspected PID/Endometritis/Wound infection&#xD;
      patients may augment clinical and biochemical response and accelerates the improvements of&#xD;
      the sign symptoms and reported outcomes of those diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rational: Curcumin treatment has been shown to safe and efficient in inflammatory states such&#xD;
      as in mild-moderate Ulcerative colitis (UC), obesity, and type II diabetes mellitus when used&#xD;
      as an add-on to conventional treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the gynecology and especially in the PID/Tubo ovarian abcess diseases the use of Curcumin&#xD;
      as a supplement has never been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the future it is necessary to study the use of curcumin in different gynecological&#xD;
      diseases (e.g Endometriosis/Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and also in gynecology oncology) in&#xD;
      which inflammatory and immune response are involve in the disease.&#xD;
