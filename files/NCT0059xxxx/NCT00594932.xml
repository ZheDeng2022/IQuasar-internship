      We hypothesize that mycophenolate mofetil(Cellcept)is safe and effective for lupus arthritis.&#xD;
      In this study, patients with lupus will be randomly assigned to receive mycophenolate mofetil&#xD;
      or placebo (inert pills) for three months. At the end of three months all patients will&#xD;
      receive mycophenolate mofetil for three additional months. The effectiveness on arthritis and&#xD;
      other symptoms of lupus will be measured by joint counts and by the BILAG instrument (a&#xD;
      measure of overall lupus disease activity. Additionally special blood tests aimed at&#xD;
      understanding the biologic effects of mycophenolate mofetil will also be performed at some&#xD;
      visits. The primary outcome measurement will be the safety and effectiveness of this&#xD;
      treatment (as compared to placebo) at the three month point. The trial will continue in a&#xD;
      blinded fashion (neither the investigator or the participants know who is getting&#xD;
      mycophenolate and who is getting placebo) until 24 patients have completed the first three&#xD;
      months of the protocol.&#xD;

      Patients and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      27 patients with active BILAG B or A arthritis, with at least 6 swollen and 6 tender joints&#xD;
      entered a six month study of MMF vs placebo for three months followed by open label MMF. 14&#xD;
      patients (12 women and 2 men) received placebo at baseline and 13 patients (11 women and 2&#xD;
      men) received MMF. Primary Outcome was Major Clinical Response at 3 months, then all patients&#xD;
      received open label Cellcept for another 3 months. Blood was drawn for safety, lupus disease&#xD;
      activity measures and exploratory Biomarkers, Joint counts were performed monthly. At&#xD;
      baseline background DMARDs were stopped. Plaquenil was allowed. All patients received 160 mg&#xD;
      depomedrol at baseline and were allowed 80 mg shots at subsequent months after blood draws&#xD;
      and procedures had been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEFINITION of RESPONSE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prespecified Primary Endpoint: Complete Clinical Response:&#xD;
&#xD;
      BILAG C in musculoskeletal by Week 12 and decrease to 0.25 or less of tender +swollen jt&#xD;
      counts&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prespecified Secondary Endpoint: Partial response:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One letter drop in musculoskeletal by Week 12 OR decrease to 0.5 or less tender + swollen jt&#xD;
      counts&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Measure (not prespecified): Major Clinical Response:&#xD;
&#xD;
      BILAG C in musculoskeletal by Week 12 and decrease to 0.5 or less of tender +swollen jt&#xD;
      counts. (In the primary analysis the one patient who met this endpoint was designated as a&#xD;
      partial responder since those prespecified criteria were also met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non response:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does not meet above criteria for complete or partial response&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Measures: (prespecified secondary endpoints) included joint counts, changes in&#xD;
      BILAG and SLEDAI and physician and patient global assessments.&#xD;

    <description>Participants randomly assigned to Arm I will receive mycophenolate mofetil in ascending doses during Month 1, and 3 grams/day (or less if there are tolerance issues) for Months 2 through 6. During Month 1 these participants receive the same number of pills as every other month, but with ascending doses of mycophenolate mofetil and descending numbers of placebo pills. Week one for a total of 1.5 gm/day of mycophenolate mofetil, Week two 2.0 gm/day, Week three 2.5 gm/day and Week 4 3 gm/day. Dose can be held or decreased for tolerance issues at any time.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Placebo Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients Randomly Assigned to Arm 2 will receive a placebo comparator. The placebo treatment will be structured so that they will undergo the same type of dosing in Month 1 that the ascending dose patient from Arm 1 undergo, but will have placebo in both bottles of pills. At the end of three months, after assessment of primary outcome, these patients enter open label treatment for three more months. During the fourth month this group continues to receive the same number of pills as they received before, with ascending doses of mycophenolate mofetil given vs descending placebo pills so that their induction is the same as those in Arm 1 at the first month.</description>

    <reported_events>
      <time_frame>3 months for non serious adverse events and six months for deaths and serious adverse events. We did not formally collect adverse events after the end of the double blind part of the study since all continuing patients received open lable MMF, a standard of care for SLE. Since we are confident that there were no additional deaths or serious adverse events over six months, we can report those for the entire six month period but we only have non serious adverse events collected for three months.</time_frame>
      <desc>Definitions do not differ. However we only collected accurate non-serious adverse events for the first three months. After that it was no longer a blinded trial, those who wanted to continue were receiving MMF, a standard of care for SLE. Safety of this commonly used drug would not be interpretable in a tiny trial after the double blind period. However, we can report SAEs for six months, since we are confident we can be accurate about those. There were also no deaths over six months.</desc>

          <title>Mycophenolate Mofetil</title>
          <description>Patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil from baseline throughout their participation in the study (up to six months). Mycophenolate is a standard of care treatment for SLE, and the primary endpoint was at three months, after which mycophenolate was given &quot;open lable.&quot; This trial did not collect adverse events after three months in any formal manner that can be reported here.&#xD;
However there were no deaths so we can report that for six months. We can also report serious adverse events for all six months. Therefore deaths and serious adverse events are reported for six months and placebo crossovers are included in the &quot;at risk&quot; population for a total of 24 at risk. However non serious adverse events can only be reported for three months so the population at risk remains at 13 for non serious adverse events.</description>

          <title>Placebo</title>
          <description>Patients receiving placebo for the first three months. They were then offered mycophenolate mofetil for up to three more months. Since this is a standard of care for SLE formal assessment of adverse events was not performed during the second three months. We cannot provide any data after the first three months on placebo patients since there were no placebo patients after the first three months. Therefore the at risk population on placebo is 14 and the reporting period is 3 months for them. This is true for all types of adverse events since there was no placebo group after 3 months.</description>
