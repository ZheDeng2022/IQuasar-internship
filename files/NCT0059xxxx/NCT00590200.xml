      This proposal delineates a research plan to collect blood from the patients undergoing heart&#xD;
      catheterization or have had a heart catheterization within one year, coming in for outpatient&#xD;
      appointments, or have scheduled cardiac CT scans at the Cleveland Clinic over a five-year&#xD;
      period for the purpose of establishing a gene bank registry. The University of North Carolina&#xD;
      at Chapel Hill will enroll 1,000 non-Caucasian patients. MetroHealth Medical center in&#xD;
      Cleveland will enroll 1,000 non-Caucasian patients. The blood collected will be processed to&#xD;
      create a repository of DNA, lymphoblastoid cell line immortalization on selected patient&#xD;
      populations, plasma and serum. The DNA will be amplified in certain patient populations to&#xD;
      preserve the quantity. Along with a sample of blood collected from individual patients, a&#xD;
      concise general medical history, demographic data, electrocardiographic data,&#xD;
      echocardiographic data (available for about 55% of patients at the present time), and&#xD;
      laboratory data will be collected. A short interview will take place after enrollment during&#xD;
      the outpatient visit or hospital stay, or may be conducted via phone call after enrollment.&#xD;
      All the clinical data gathered will be compiled in GATC heart center database, and would be&#xD;
      stored in a format where a culmination of clinical findings, i.e. representing a disease of&#xD;
      interest, can be used to search the database to identify the blood samples of all patients&#xD;
      with such characteristics for further study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study is to commence on March 1st 2001 and is to be completed within 2-5 years. The&#xD;
      targeted number of patients to be enrolled is 15,000. All patients undergoing cardiac&#xD;
      catheterization or have had a heart catheterization within one year, coming in for outpatient&#xD;
      appointments, or have scheduled cardiac CT scans or CT scans performed within one year of&#xD;
      scheduled blood draw, will be eligible to be enrolled. Patients inclusion criteria are as&#xD;
      follows, once informed consent is obtained:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Males or females at least 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient has not been previously enrolled in the genebank registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient able to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patient to undergo cardiac catheterization or had a left heart cath at The Cleveland&#xD;
           Clinic or at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, or at MetroHealth Medical&#xD;
           Center within 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients &gt; or = to 50 y/o with normal cardiac catheterizations (&lt; 30% in all coronary&#xD;
           vessels per angio). (If subjects enrolled as normal controls are later deemed to have&#xD;
           significant Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), the subject's blood and data will still be&#xD;
           useful in the Genebank under the broader scope of the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Any patient with history of myocardial infarction (MI). (If a subject reports history of&#xD;
           MI at another facility, outside records will be obtained to confirm the diagnosis. If MI&#xD;
           cannot be confirmed by data in the record, the subject's blood and data will still be&#xD;
           useful in the Genebank under the broader scope of the study.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Non-caucasian patients or of Hispanic Ethnicity (UNC and MetroHealth Medical Center&#xD;
           only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. All Patients undergoing Cardiac CT or had Cardiac CT within 1 year (CCF only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Any patient coming to the Heart and Vascular Institute for outpatient scheduled&#xD;
           appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Any patients that have had or are going to have an implanted cardioverter defibrillator&#xD;
           (ICD) or cardiac resynchronization defibrillator (CRT-D).&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Any patients with cardiac arrhythmias or a family history of cardiac arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Cleveland Clinic will follow inclusion criteria 1-6 and 8-11, UNC and MetroHealth Medical&#xD;
      Center will follow criteria 1-11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      None except as in Inclusion criteria.&#xD;
