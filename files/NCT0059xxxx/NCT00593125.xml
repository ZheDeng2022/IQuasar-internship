  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed investigation will use methadone maintained patients who have concurrent cocaine&#xD;
      dependence in order to take advantage of the excellent (over 80%) treatment retention in this&#xD;
      patient group and to maximize treatment compliance by daily observed medication with both&#xD;
      methadone and levetiracetam. In the initial patients we will explore the tolerability of&#xD;
      escalating doses of levetiracetam as well as its potential role in reducing cocaine use, as&#xD;
      monitored by self-report and verified by three-times weekly urine toxicology testing in&#xD;
      methadone treated patients.The specific aim of this study is to evaluate the tolerability and&#xD;
      efficacy of levetiracetam 3 grams/day in modifying cocaine-using behavior, reducing cocaine&#xD;
      craving and attenuating cocaine's reinforcing effect among methadone-maintained patients&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This 12-week open-label clinical trial will provide treatment for 15 cocaine-dependent opioid&#xD;
      dependent patients. Participants, aged 18-65 years, will receive levetiracetam 3000 mg/day&#xD;
      while concurrently receiving treatment with methadone. Baseline cocaine use will be&#xD;
      determined during the first week of treatment participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design will have three overlapping phases that are summarized below: 1) A one week&#xD;
      methadone fixed induction (week 1) and flexible stabilization phase (weeks 2-9); 2) an 8-week&#xD;
      &quot;treatment&quot; phase (weeks 2-9), consisting of slow titration and stabilization on study&#xD;
      medication; and 3) a four week &quot;taper, detoxification or transfer&quot; phase (weeks 9-12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first week of induction onto methadone, participants will be administered fixed&#xD;
      increasing doses of methadone starting at 30 mg daily and increased to 60 mg daily by the end&#xD;
      of the first week. This methadone dose will be adjusted for stabilization of opiate&#xD;
      withdrawal symptoms using a flexible dosing from 40 mg up to 150 mg. This range has been&#xD;
      found to be adequate for the vast majority of patients receiving methadone in our program and&#xD;
      is designed to accommodate participants who may not be able to tolerate the higher&#xD;
      maintenance doses or may still experience withdrawal symptoms, respectively. We may increase&#xD;
      or decrease this amount on a case-by-case basis based on physician assessment of&#xD;
      self-reported and observed symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting on week 2 subjects will receive levetiracetam 500mg/day and this dose will be slowly&#xD;
      titrated to a total of 3000mg/day or maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Subjects will remain on&#xD;
      their full dosage through week 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of week 8, participants will undergo detoxification from methadone over a 4-week&#xD;
      period (weeks 8-12) and discontinuation from levetiracetam over a concurrent 2-week period.&#xD;
      All participants will receive weekly 1-hour of individual psychotherapy (Cognitive Behavioral&#xD;
      Treatment) with experienced clinicians specifically trained to deliver the therapy and who&#xD;
      will receive ongoing supervision. The primary outcomes will be reported medication side&#xD;
      effects (medication tolerability), and reduction in cocaine use, as assessed by self-report&#xD;
      and thrice-weekly urinalyses. Secondary outcomes will include weeks in treatment (retention),&#xD;
      and change in measures of: cocaine craving, anxiety symptoms and opiate withdrawal symptoms.&#xD;
      This study will occur at the Outpatient Treatment Research Program in Building 36 at the VA&#xD;
      CT Healthcare System.&#xD;

    <description>The participants will start receiving Levetiracetam 500mg in the mornings of the first day on week 2. The dose will be titrated every third day, until the target dose of 3000mg/day is achieved by week 4. The study medication must be titrated to 3000 mg/day or to the subject's maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The physician overseeing this titration as well as all study staff will not be blind to the subject's medication administration. The medication will be discontinued over a two-week period</description>
