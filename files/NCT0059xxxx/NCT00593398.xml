      Malaria is caused by a parasite and is a health problem for mothers and fetuses (unborn&#xD;
      infants). The Cameroonian Ministry of Health recommends that all pregnant women should take&#xD;
      the drug sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (also known as SP) every two months during pregnancy to&#xD;
      avoid malaria. The purpose of this study is to find out how effective SP is in preventing&#xD;
      pregnant Cameroonian women from getting malaria. Additional goals of this study are to see&#xD;
      whether: SP prevents malaria parasites from causing changes in the placenta; SP prevents or&#xD;
      helps women make a substance that keeps parasites from accumulating in the placenta; and&#xD;
      whether SP affects the amount of protection a mother transfers to her baby. Participants will&#xD;
      include 1,160 pregnant women, ages 15-50 years, and 216 babies born residing in Ngalii II and&#xD;
      Ntouessong. Study procedures will include monthly blood samples from pregnant women and&#xD;
      babies. Volunteers may participate in this study for up to 19 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria is one of the three major infectious diseases in the world&#xD;
      today. Infants in endemic areas are born with transplacentally-acquired antibodies (Ab) that&#xD;
      help to protect them against severe infections. Once this passive-immunity wanes, infants&#xD;
      become susceptible to severe disease. Asymptomatic and clinical malaria are more common in&#xD;
      pregnant women, creating a health problem for both mother and developing fetus. Malaria&#xD;
      increases maternal anemia, mortality at parturition and the risk of having low birth weight&#xD;
      (LBW) babies. This study plans to enroll a total of 1,160 pregnant women, ages 15 to 50&#xD;
      years, including 920 pregnant women who reside in the city of Yaounde and 240 women who&#xD;
      reside in the rural villages of Ngali II and Ntouessong. In addition, 216 babies born&#xD;
      residing in Ngali II and Ntouessong will be enrolled. Women will receive physical exams,&#xD;
      participate in blood sample collection, and will be followed monthly through their pregnancy.&#xD;
      Participants will receive sulfadoxine - pyrimethamine (SP) every other month until term, as&#xD;
      recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). During the 2nd or 3rd visit, pregnant&#xD;
      women will be asked to provide a stool sample for detection of intestinal parasites. At&#xD;
      delivery, the following will be collected: 2-3 cc of maternal venous blood, information on&#xD;
      the newborn, a biopsy of the placenta for histology, blood from the intervillous space of the&#xD;
      placenta (IVS) for cytokines, and fetal cord blood for Ab and primed T and B cells. To&#xD;
      determine how malarial infection during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters influences malarial&#xD;
      infection in infants, mothers in the above study as well as additional mothers who received&#xD;
      Intermittent Preventive Therapy (IPT)-SP during the 2nd and 3rd trimester and women who&#xD;
      received less than the recommended dose will be recruited during their last trimester of&#xD;
      pregnancy and asked to enroll their newborns. The levels of antimalarial cellular and humoral&#xD;
      immunity at birth will be recorded for each infant. The newborn will be followed to determine&#xD;
      when they 1st become positive for P. falciparum and the number and severity of infections. In&#xD;
      addition, the decline of maternal Ab and acquisition of Ab (IgM and IgG) by infants to&#xD;
      vaccine-candidate antigen (Ag) will be monitored throughout the 1st year using blood samples&#xD;
      collected monthly. The goals of this study are to determine if the absence of malaria during&#xD;
      the 2nd and 3rd trimesters (due to the use of IPT) does the following: alters the development&#xD;
      of pregnancy-associated immunity in the mother; reduces placental pathology; and increases&#xD;
      the susceptibility of babies to malaria. The primary outcome measures will be to determine:&#xD;
      at delivery, the proportion of primigravidae with Ab to variant antigen identified by Salanti&#xD;
      (VAR2csa) will be significantly reduced if pregnant women are not infected during the 3rd&#xD;
      trimester of pregnancy; prevalence of presence of severe pathology will be compared among the&#xD;
      groups; and the number of babies who have malaria during the first 6 months of life. The&#xD;
      secondary outcome measures of this study will include: determining if maternal P. falciparum&#xD;
      infection during the 2nd or 3rd trimester reduces the transfer of malaria-specific IgG to the&#xD;
      fetus; determining if the proportion of babies who are born with primed T cells is the same&#xD;
      in those whose mothers had malaria during the 2nd or 3rd trimester compared to those who did&#xD;
      not; presence of primed B cells in cord blood will be detected by culturing cord blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells MNC in vitro culture for 5 days; and plasma collected from babies when they&#xD;
      experience their 1st P. falciparum infection will be screened for the presence of IgG and IgM&#xD;
      Abs against the panel of Ag. The duration of the entire study is 5 years.&#xD;
