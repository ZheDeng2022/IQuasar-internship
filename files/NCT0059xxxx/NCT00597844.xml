  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how the brain re-learns to control the larynx in speaking&#xD;
      and swallowing when undergoing surgical rehabilitation in the form of either thyroplasty or&#xD;
      vocal fold augmentation for unilateral vocal cord paralysis. What is needed is information on&#xD;
      how the brain re-learns to control speaking and swallowing so that we can eventually learn&#xD;
      how to help patients re-learn faster after their procedure. Functional Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      Imaging (or fMRI) will allow us to image your brain as you speak and swallow. We will produce&#xD;
      &quot;brain maps&quot; for speaking, swallowing and hand movements.&#xD;

      The purpose of this investigation is to determine cortical mechanisms of adaptation to&#xD;
      surgical rehabilitation of patients with unilateral vocal cord paralysis (UVCP) undergoing&#xD;
      either type I thyroplasty or unilateral vocal fold augmentation for the management of&#xD;
      unilateral vocal cord paralysis. This study will use the non-invasive imaging technique,&#xD;
      Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), to investigate cortical responses and responses&#xD;
      in the larynx of patients with UVCP who have been deemed to be candidates for either type I&#xD;
      thyroplasty or unilateral vocal fold augmentation for the purpose of rehabilitating this&#xD;
      UVCP. Patterns of brain activity from the fMRI studies will be compared with the preoperative&#xD;
      study with each patient serving as their own control for the purpose of evaluating the&#xD;
      alterations in sensory motor organization of the brain in response to UVCP. In addition,&#xD;
      responses in patients with UVCP will be compared to normal controls. This will allow us to&#xD;
      identify the impact on speech and swallowing and the subsequent reorganization which we&#xD;
      theorize will occur in response to the vocal cord medialization. Patients will undergo&#xD;
      standardized voice evaluation with improvement in voice serving as a secondary endpoint. The&#xD;
      results of the current investigation will provide needed information on both central and&#xD;
      peripheral mechanisms of adaptation.&#xD;
