      Heart failure is a clinical syndrome where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to&#xD;
      satisfy the organism's metabolic needs. Heart failure has become a major clinical and public&#xD;
      health problem with approximately 300,000 Canadians being affected. Atrial fibrillation is a&#xD;
      rhythm disorder in which the upper chambers of the heart (the atria) are paralyzed by&#xD;
      continuous electrical activity. Some of the continuous chaotic electrical activity in the&#xD;
      atria travels to the lower cavities of the heart (the ventricles) causing then to beat&#xD;
      irregularly and very rapidly. It is the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia, affecting 5% of&#xD;
      individuals 65 years and older and it is associated with an increased risk of stroke. Both&#xD;
      conditions (heart failure and atrial fibrillation) often co-exist in the same patient. Heart&#xD;
      failure promotes atrial fibrillation and atrial fibrillation aggravates heart failure. The&#xD;
      Atrial Fibrillation and Congestive Heart Failure (AF-CHF) trial is investigating whether&#xD;
      preservation of normal cardiac rhythm influences mortality and morbidity. The AF-CHF study&#xD;
      began in 2001 and 1,378 patients have been enrolled from 123 participating centres, in North&#xD;
      America, South America, Europe, and Israel. The results of this trial which are expected in&#xD;
      October 2007, will improve decision-making for the physician and will provide useful&#xD;
      information to healthcare organizations responsible for the care of heart failure patients.&#xD;

      Congestive heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are two important and growing&#xD;
      problems in medicine and cardiology. Both conditions often co-exist and complicate each&#xD;
      other's management. Two therapeutic strategies are available for patients with AF and CHF:&#xD;
      the first aims at restoring and maintaining sinus rhythm, whereas, the second focuses&#xD;
      exclusively on optimizing ventricular rate. The primary objective of the Atrial Fibrillation&#xD;
      and Congestive Heart Failure (AF-CHF) trial is to compare these two widely-used treatment&#xD;
      strategies with respect to cardiovascular mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Restoring and maintaining sinus rhythm reduces cardiovascular mortality compared&#xD;
      to a rate control treatment strategy in patients with AF and CHF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Despite new therapeutic interventions, the prognosis of heart failure patients&#xD;
      remains grim with 5-year survival rates usually less than 50%. In most recent, large CHF&#xD;
      trials, AF has been reported to be independently associated with increased mortality.&#xD;
      Non-randomized observations also suggest that patients with AF in the setting of CHF have a&#xD;
      greater tendency to revert to sinus rhythm during amiodarone therapy or with newer class III&#xD;
      antiarrhythmic agents and that those who maintain a normal rhythm have a better prognosis.&#xD;
      There is a need to determine whether a treatment strategy that attempts to maintain sinus&#xD;
      rhythm will have a beneficial impact on cardiovascular mortality in CHF patients. This&#xD;
      hypothesis has never been tested in a prospective, controlled, adequately-powered randomized&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan: AF-CHF is a prospective, multicentre clinical trial (100 centres in Canada,&#xD;
      the USA, and Europe), that will randomize 1,450 NYHA class II-IV CHF patients with left&#xD;
      ventricular ejection fraction &gt;/=35% (NYHA class I patients with prior hospitalization for&#xD;
      CHF or ejection fraction &lt;/=25% are also eligible) and a history of significant AF (ECG&#xD;
      documentation of either one episode lasting &gt;/=6 hours within the past 6 months, or an&#xD;
      episode lasting &gt;/=10 minutes within the past 6 months in a patient with prior electrical&#xD;
      cardioversion for AF) to one of two treatment strategies: 1) rhythm control with the use of&#xD;
      electrical cardioversion if needed combined with antiarrhythmic drug therapy (amiodarone or&#xD;
      other class III agents), and additional non-pharmacologic therapy in resistant patients, 2)&#xD;
      rate control with the use of drugs (mainly beta-blockers plus digoxin) and/or pacemaker and&#xD;
      AV nodal catheter ablation if necessary. The enrollment period will be completed within 2&#xD;
      years with a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Both groups will receive optimal CHF management&#xD;
      with ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers. Cardiovascular mortality will be the primary endpoint&#xD;
      of the trial. The intention-to-treat approach will be the primary method of analysis.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are total mortality, hospitalization, stroke, cost of therapy and quality&#xD;
      of life. From recent trial data, we anticipate a 18.75% 2-year cardiovascular mortality in&#xD;
      the rate control arm and a 25% reduction in cardiovascular mortality in the rhythm control&#xD;
      group. Assuming a 2% loss to follow-up, a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 and an annual accrual&#xD;
      rate of 750 patients, we calculate that 722 patients per group (rounded total number of 1,450&#xD;
      patients) will be necessary to achieve a power of 0.80 when performing a log-rank test. The&#xD;
      Research Centre of the Montreal Heart Institute will be the Coordinating and Methods Centre.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;/=35% as measured by nuclear imaging,&#xD;
             echocardiography, or cardiac angiography within 6 months preceding enrollment. If the&#xD;
             patient has had a myocardial infarction or heart surgery during this period, the&#xD;
             ejection fraction must be remeasured.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Symptomatic CHF (NYHA class II-IV) at some time during the 6 months before&#xD;
             randomization, despite therapy with an ACE inhibitor (however, patients who do not&#xD;
             tolerate an ACE inhibitor are eligible). Asymptomatic patients (NYHA class I) with&#xD;
             either a prior hospitalization for CHF during the 6 months before randomization or&#xD;
             with a left ventricular ejection fraction of &lt;/=25% are also eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of significant AF, defined as either:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. one episode lasting &gt;/=6 hours (duration of AF will be determined by history),&#xD;
                  within the past 6 months with electrocardiographic confirmation; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. an episode lasting &gt;/=10 minutes (by history) within the past 6 months with&#xD;
                  electrocardiographic confirmation in a patient with a prior electrical&#xD;
                  cardioversion for AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. In the opinion of the clinical investigator, the patient must be eligible for&#xD;
             long-term treatment with either treatment strategy of AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. AF is known to be present and uninterrupted for more than 12 months prior to&#xD;
             randomization. However, if such a patient is cardioverted and maintained in sinus&#xD;
             rhythm for &gt;/=24 hours, he or she becomes eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Reversible cause of AF such as acute pericarditis, pulmonary embolism,&#xD;
             hyperthyroidism, alcohol intoxication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. AF occurring and not persisting beyond 10 days of surgery or myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Reversible cause of CHF such as severe aortic or mitral stenosis and&#xD;
             tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
