  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depressed patients will receive 6 weeks of citaloprma (20-40mg) therapy. Subjects who have an&#xD;
      inadequate response (partial or non-responder) will be randomized to receive either&#xD;
      mecamylamine (5-10mg) or placebo added to their citalopram for a further 8 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled, parallel group, flexible dose&#xD;
      titration, add-on study. Male or female subjects aged 18-70 years suffering from Major&#xD;
      Depressive Disorder according to DSM-IV, with a HAMD-17 score greater than 21 and a&#xD;
      CGI-Severity of Illness score greater or equal to 4, will be started on open labeled&#xD;
      citalopram treatment. The dose of citalopram may be increased form 20mg to 40mg over a six&#xD;
      week period, depending on investigator assessment of tolerability and efficacy. At the end of&#xD;
      this treatment, subjects with a HAMD-17 score greater or equal to 14 and a CGI-Severity of&#xD;
      Illness score greater or equal to 4 will be considered as partial or non-responders and will&#xD;
      be entered into the double blind phase of the study. Subjects will be randomized to either&#xD;
      mecamylamine or placebo for a further 8 weeks. Citalopram medication will remain constant&#xD;
      while mecamylamine (or placebo) can be increased from 5.0 to 7.5 to 10.0mg based on&#xD;
      investigator assessment of tolerability and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma samples for citalopram assay will be collected at the start and end of the double&#xD;
      blind phase to exclude any mecamylamine effect being due to a drug:drug interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 500 subjects will be entered into the open-label phase of the study and&#xD;
      approximately 160 into the double blind phase. The study will be conducted in India and the&#xD;
      USA.&#xD;
