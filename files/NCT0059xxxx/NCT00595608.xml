      Patients undergoing nasal surgery commonly experience a variety of symptoms in the&#xD;
      post-operative period including blockage, running, pain, bleeding and reduction in sense of&#xD;
      smell. A variety of preparations are currently recommended for symptomatic relief in the post&#xD;
      operative period. These include saline irrigations and sniffs, steam inhalations,&#xD;
      decongestants and steroid drops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no level 1 evidence in literature to support the use of any particular&#xD;
      preparation over others in nasal surgical aftercare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to conduct a single blinded, randomised trial comparing saline sprays vs Sterimar,&#xD;
      a commercially available aerosolised isotone saline solution, comparing patients' symptom&#xD;
      scores following septal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will help to establish efficacy and symptom control and advantages of one solution&#xD;
      and delivery device over the other.&#xD;

      Project Proposal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sterimar vs Saline Sprays in nasal surgical aftercare - a blinded, randomised trial.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing nasal surgery commonly experience a variety of symptoms in the&#xD;
      post-operative period including blockage, running, pain, bleeding and reduction in sense of&#xD;
      smell. A variety of preparations are currently recommended for symptomatic relief in the post&#xD;
      operative period. These include saline irrigations and sniffs, steam inhalations,&#xD;
      decongestants and steroid drops. These are intended to reduce swelling and crusting and their&#xD;
      resultant symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no level 1 evidence in literature to support the use of any particular&#xD;
      preparation over others in nasal surgical aftercare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent randomised controlled trial carried out in this department, comparing use of&#xD;
      xylometazoline based decongestants vs Sterimar seawater nasal spray, showed a lower pain&#xD;
      scoring in the Sterimar group but no other significant differences. This study is as yet&#xD;
      unpublished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sterimar spray is a spray made from seawater which is diluted to make the solution isotonic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, other forms of Saline sniffs and rinses are also used for the above mentioned&#xD;
      applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is easy to make up an isotonic saline solution, using 5 grams of salt (1 teaspoon) for&#xD;
      every Â½ litre of boiled water. This can then, after cooling off, be applied to the nasal&#xD;
      cavities with the help of a standard 10 ml syringe which is provided to the patient at&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As Sterimar is not yet on the hospital formulary, the cost for the treatment is currently&#xD;
      borne by the patient. For the duration of the study, patients randomized into the Sterimar&#xD;
      group will be provided with the medication free of charge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We consider it unlikely that patients randomised into the saline spray group will supplement&#xD;
      this treatment by buying further saline sprays from the chemist at their own expense.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish this and to follow up patients after the trial period, we will establish a&#xD;
      research clinic. Patients will be reviewed in a clinic dedicated to patients taking part in&#xD;
      this trial approximately 2 weeks after surgery, after completion of the trial period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will help to establish efficacy and symptom control and advantages of one solution&#xD;
      and delivery device over the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If home-made saline sprays could be used to similar effect as Sterimar, the cost for this&#xD;
      form of surgical aftercare could be lowered significantly, both for the patient and the NHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to conduct a single blinded, randomised trial comparing saline sprays vs Sterimar,&#xD;
      a commercially available aerosolised isotone saline solution, comparing patients' symptom&#xD;
      scores following septal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MHRA confirmed that neither the Sterimar nor the home made saline spray are considered&#xD;
      Investigational Medicinal Products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENT unit, Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, teaching hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusions / exclusions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing septoplasty and septoplasty in conjunction with turbinate surgery will be&#xD;
      recruited. Those undergoing additional procedures including polypectomy will be excluded, as&#xD;
      will all patients whose post-operative recommendations are for steroids or other take home&#xD;
      medications that may bias results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients fitting the inclusion criteria will be approached in the Outpatients clinic. The&#xD;
      decision for septoplasty +/- turbinate surgery will be made there and consent for the&#xD;
      operation will be taken. A patient information sheet will be administered by the lead&#xD;
      investigator or other medical staff on the same day, allowing the patient ample time to&#xD;
      discuss the matter with relatives and medical staff. Patients will be left to read the&#xD;
      information sheet and then re-approached to assess willingness to be included in the trial.&#xD;
      The procedure of the trial will be further explained and informed consent to take part will&#xD;
      be obtained. Patients will retain the patient information sheet as well as receive a scoring&#xD;
      sheet containing visual analogue scales to assess symptoms - pain, running, sense of smell,&#xD;
      bleeding, blockage. A questionnaire assessing use of post-operative analgesia for 7 days on a&#xD;
      daily basis will also be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these forms will be on appropriately headed paper. A clear explanation of how to complete&#xD;
      the assessment sheet will be given. The patient will be approached again on the pre-operative&#xD;
      morning and Patients will be randomised using a randomisation schedule generated by NHS&#xD;
      Grampian Research &amp; Development Dept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      can withdraw his/her consent to the trial at any time. Randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised using a randomisation schedule generated by NHS Grampian Research&#xD;
      &amp; Development Dept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the randomisation, patients will be given one of either saline sprays or Sterimar&#xD;
      Physiological Sea Water Microspray. Instructions regarding use will be given including&#xD;
      frequency and technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the 3rd and 7th postoperative day, patients will complete the symptom assessment sheet&#xD;
      judging their symptoms on that day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient should record painkillers needed on the Analgesia Requirement Sheet on a daily&#xD;
      basis for 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will also be provided with an EQ-5D health questionnaire, which is well&#xD;
      validated and has referent look up values for populations of ill and healthy patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These will be returned in a pre-paid envelope and will be identifiable only by the patients'&#xD;
      study number retained in the randomisation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual analogue scales will be analyzed by investigators blinded to which treatment has been&#xD;
      administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be further analysed comparing scores achieved for those taking saline sniffs and&#xD;
      those taking Sterimar. Tests of statistical significance will be performed to establish if&#xD;
      either preparation is superior in symptom control. Analgesia use will be taken into&#xD;
      consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To select a difference in symptom scores on a visual analogue scale of 10mm or more at the&#xD;
      level of significance with 80% power, a sample size of 60 patients is required in each arm of&#xD;
      the trial. This is assuming a standard deviation of 19mm, which was demonstrated in the study&#xD;
      previously conducted in this department.&#xD;
