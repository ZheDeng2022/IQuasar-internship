    <textblock>
      Hot flashes can be a disturbing symptom of menopause. Prescription medications are commonly&#xD;
      used for symptom relief. Several non-prescription therapies are under investigation. This&#xD;
      study will examine the use of omega-3 (fish oil) supplements to see if it helps relieve hot&#xD;
      flashes and therefore improve the quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Menopausal women who take Omega 3 vitamins(fish oils)will show improvement in the severity of&#xD;
      their hot flashes.In addition women who take Omega 3 supplements will show improvement in&#xD;
      their lipid profiles.&#xD;

      This study requires you to have blood drawn twice, record your hot flashes for a total of 3&#xD;
      weeks, and to take a product every day for 12 weeks. It will also entail 4 visits and up to 4&#xD;
      telephone contacts. The information you provide will be maintained in a database accessible&#xD;
      only to the primary investigator and research team. You will be assigned a code number for&#xD;
      your blood work and all other information. The key to this code will be maintained in this&#xD;
      database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall 60-100 women will be recruited for this study locally. During the course of the study&#xD;
      you will get overall two blood draws amounting to up to a teaspoon for measurement of your&#xD;
      cholesterol and fat levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project consists of three phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will ask you questions about your medical history and your health. You will then be asked&#xD;
      to provide a urine sample which will be used to confirm your menopausal status with a FSH&#xD;
      level. You will be requested to keep a record of your hot flashes for one week using a&#xD;
      symptom diary. Upon completion of the diary, you will return to the study site. If you&#xD;
      qualify for participation, you will have blood work done to measure your cholesterol and&#xD;
      other fat levels through a lipid panel. You will be provided with these results free of&#xD;
      charge at the conclusion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive the study medication. Half of the participants will receive the actual&#xD;
      product we are investigating and half will receive a placebo (inactive/dummy pill). Neither&#xD;
      you nor the investigators will not know which one you are given until the end of the study.&#xD;
      During the 4th and 12th weeks, you will be asked to keep a diary (similar to the first one)&#xD;
      of your hot flashes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 12 week study period, you will return to the study center. The second blood&#xD;
      draw will be done to monitor any changes. This will conclude your participation. You will be&#xD;
      sent a copy of your cholesterol profiles and FSH levels approximately 2 weeks after you&#xD;
      complete the study.&#xD;
