      The main purpose of this study is to see if these T-lymphocytes are safe. To make these&#xD;
      Ad-specific T lymphocytes the investigators will obtain blood from the stem cell donor and&#xD;
      transfer Ad into another type of blood cell, called monocytes. These cells can then stimulate&#xD;
      the T lymphocytes and train them to kill cells infected with Ad. The investigators will then&#xD;
      grow these Ad-specific T lymphocytes by more stimulation with Ad-infected monocytes and a&#xD;
      third type of blood cell called a B lymphoblast from the donor. After testing the T&#xD;
      -lymphocytes, the investigators will inject them into patients after transplant who are at&#xD;
      high risk of serious Ad virus infection. The investigators will make sure the injected cells&#xD;
      are safe and see if they affect the growth and behavior of adenoviruses in the patient's own&#xD;
      body.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Viral infection is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in patients who receive&#xD;
      bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from unrelated or mismatched donors. This increased risk of&#xD;
      infection relates to a number of factors including the immunosuppressive regimens these&#xD;
      patients receive, delayed immune recovery and the greater genetic disparity between donor and&#xD;
      recipient that result in defective interactions between antigen presenting cells and immune&#xD;
      system effector cells. In most cases viral infection post BMT results from reactivation of&#xD;
      latent virus and CMV, EBV and adenoviruses (Ad) are the commonest viral pathogens causing&#xD;
      disease after transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of Ad infection is &gt;25% for patients at risk in the first 100 days after&#xD;
      transplant 1 2. In the transplant population, adenovirus is recoverable from many sites and&#xD;
      may cause hemorrhagic cystitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, hepatitis, colitis and pancreatitis,&#xD;
      often with severe morbidity and a mortality approaching 60%3. The most frequently used drug&#xD;
      for the treatment of adenoviral infections is Cidofovir. But while there are occasional&#xD;
      reports of responses to Cidofovir, no approved antiviral agent has proven efficacy for the&#xD;
      treatment of severe Ad disease, nor are there any prospective randomized, controlled trials&#xD;
      of potentially useful anti-Ad therapies 4. With the increasing use of so-called&#xD;
      submyeloablative or reduced intensity, highly immunosuppressive conditioning regimens, higher&#xD;
      rates of Ad infections/reactivation have been observed due to prolonged immune suppression.&#xD;
      The onset of Ad disease/reactivation has recently been reported to occur at a median of 18&#xD;
      days post-transplant (range -7/&gt;+100) 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As viral complications in these patients are clearly associated with the lack of recovery of&#xD;
      virus-specific cellular immune responses, reconstitution of the host with in vitro expanded&#xD;
      CTLs is an effective approach to prevent and treat these diseases. Adoptive immunotherapy&#xD;
      with in vitro expanded CTLs has proved effective in preventing and treating diseases related&#xD;
      to Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infections 5; 6 and cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivations7 in&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. A promising strategy to generate&#xD;
      donor-derived Ad-specific CTL is the infection of monocytes that direct the CTL response to&#xD;
      viral capsid antigens8. This approach allows exposure to all proteins in the Ad protein coat,&#xD;
      leading to presentation of multiple, undefined antigen epitopes. Hence, the investigators now&#xD;
      plan to use a recombinant Ad vector for infection of donor-derived monocytes. These infected&#xD;
      monocytes will then be used as antigen presenting cells (APC) to generate Ad-specific CTL in&#xD;
      vitro. For the expansion of the Ad-specific CTL, the second stimulation will use irradiated,&#xD;
      Ad-infected monocytes and subsequent stimulations will use donor-derived Lymphoblastoid Cell&#xD;
      Lines (LCL) transduced with the Ad vector as an APC 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to evaluate this approach for the prophylaxis of Ad reactivation&#xD;
      and disease in the recipients of matched unrelated donor or mismatched family member bone&#xD;
      marrow allografts, who are at high risk for this complication. Initially, the investigators&#xD;
      will give the donor-derived Ad-specific CTLs to patients in a dose escalation study to&#xD;
      determine their safety and immunologic and virologic efficacy.&#xD;
