  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of high dose radiation administered by&#xD;
      both proton and photon therapy. Radiation is an effective treatment for many types of tumors&#xD;
      and it is thought that radiation alone, when given in much higher doses over a shorter period&#xD;
      of time, may be more effective in controlling recurrence of sarcoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  In this study three types of radiation will be used: standard radiation (called photon);&#xD;
           alternative form of radiation called proton beam therapy; and a localized radiation&#xD;
           applicator plaque that can be applied to the surface of the dura (the fibrous outer&#xD;
           envelope that surrounds the spinal cord and fluid surrounding the spinal cord) at time&#xD;
           of surgical removal of the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiation treatments (photon and proton) and possibly surgical removal of portions of&#xD;
           the tumor with intraoperative radiation delivery to the surface dura with intraoperative&#xD;
           radiation delivery will be performed over a period of 12 weeks. As part of the treatment&#xD;
           planning process, participants will need two treatment planning CT scans and 2-3&#xD;
           treatment planning sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive, in total, 39-43 photon/proton treatments.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pathological diagnosis of malignant mesenchymal tumor of the&#xD;
             thoracic/lumbar/spine/sacrum or paraspinal soft tissues involving nerve roots or&#xD;
             extending into spinal canal. Inter-osseous bone sarcomas are to be managed by wide&#xD;
             resectional surgery for patients that are medically operable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient tumor status: 1) post biopsy or post resection with gross residual disease 2)&#xD;
             post grossly complete resection but with margins positive or very close or tumor spill&#xD;
             or cut through&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lesion may be primary or recurrent after prior surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No clinical, radiographic or other evidence of distant metastasis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fit for the exposure of the affected vertebral segment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 36 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  KPS equal to or greater than 70&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Declines radical surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior radiation treatment to the affected spine region&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease/conditions characterized by high radiation sensitivity. These include genetic&#xD;
             diseases, such as ataxia telangiectasia. Major local conditions which are the local&#xD;
             tolerance viz., multiple surgical procedures, serious local injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No evident cord/cauda malfunction for causes other than effects of local tumor growth&#xD;
             or due to metabolic effects of tumor&#xD;
