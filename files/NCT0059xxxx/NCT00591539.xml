    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find out if long-term survivors of childhood&#xD;
      head or neck cancer, who received radiation therapy as part of the overall treatment plan,&#xD;
      are at increased risk of thickening or blockage of the carotid arteries (the major blood&#xD;
      vessels in the neck).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers also want to find out if other medical conditions, such as high blood sugar, high&#xD;
      blood cholesterol, or history of tobacco use may contribute to the thickening or blockage of&#xD;
      the carotid arteries.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some research shows that survivors of adult head or neck cancer, who received radiation&#xD;
      therapy, are at increased risk for thickening or blockage of the carotid arteries, which may&#xD;
      increase the risk for other medical conditions, such as stroke. Researchers want to learn&#xD;
      about the possible risks of thickening or blockage of the carotid arteries in survivors of&#xD;
      childhood head or neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, researchers will see if there are any possible&#xD;
      effects (thickening or blockage) of radiation therapy on your carotid arteries. This will be&#xD;
      done by examining the test results from routine testing (mentioned below) that is normally&#xD;
      done for your standard long-term follow-up care of the disease. These routine tests would be&#xD;
      performed even if you were not in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During your long-term follow-up clinic appointment, you will have a physical exam and an&#xD;
      ultrasound test (performed at the Cardiology Clinic) of the carotid arteries. A carotid&#xD;
      ultrasound is a test that uses sound waves to look at the blood vessels in the neck. Blood&#xD;
      will be drawn (about 2-3 teaspoons) for laboratory tests, including blood sugar level, blood&#xD;
      cholesterol level, blood triglyceride level, thyroid hormone level, and blood levels of&#xD;
      certain proteins (C-reactive protein and brain natriuretic peptide).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any of the tests show any thickening or blockage of the carotid arteries or other medical&#xD;
      problems, such as high blood sugar, your study doctor will discuss the test results,&#xD;
      treatment options, and/or a follow-up plan with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 60 patients will take part in this study. All will be&#xD;
      enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
