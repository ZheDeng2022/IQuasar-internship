  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate differences among people with focal dystonia (FD), complex&#xD;
      regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and people who have both conditions to learn more about the&#xD;
      cause of both disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following procedures in five visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electroencephalography (EEG). Electrodes (metal discs) are placed on the scalp with an&#xD;
           electrode cap, a paste or a glue-like substance. The spaces between the electrodes and&#xD;
           the scalp are filled with a gel that conducts electrical activity. Brain waves are&#xD;
           recorded while the subject lies quietly and sensory stimulation is applied to the thumb&#xD;
           or finger.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This test uses a magnetic field and radio waves to&#xD;
           obtain images of body tissues and organs. The patient lies on a table that can slide in&#xD;
           and out of the scanner, wearing earplugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping sounds&#xD;
           that occur during the scanning process. The procedure lasts about 45 minutes, during&#xD;
           which time the patient will be asked to lie still for up to 15 minutes at a time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). An insulated wire coil is placed on the scalp&#xD;
           and a brief electrical current is passed through the coil. The current induces a&#xD;
           magnetic field that stimulates the brain. There may be a pulling sensation on the skin&#xD;
           under the coil and a twitch in muscles of the face, arm or leg. During the stimulation,&#xD;
           subjects may be asked to keep their hands relaxed or to contract certain muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peripheral electrical stimulation. In two experiments, TMS is combined with peripheral&#xD;
           electrical stimulation, similar to what is used in nerve conduction studies, to the&#xD;
           median nerve at the wrist. There may be muscle twitching.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surface electromyography. For TMS tests and peripheral electrical stimulation,&#xD;
           electrodes are filled with a conductive gel and taped to the skin to record the&#xD;
           electrical activity of three muscles on the right hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Needle EMG. A needle is inserted into a muscle to record the electrical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nerve conduction studies. A probe is placed on the skin to deliver a small electrical&#xD;
           stimulus, and wires are taped to the skin record the nerve impulses. These studies&#xD;
           measure the speed with which nerves conduct electrical impulses and the strength of the&#xD;
           connection between the nerve and the muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin biopsy. Two sites are biopsied. A local anesthetic is given to numb the area and a&#xD;
           1/4-inch piece of skin is removed with a special tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  JVP domes. Subjects are tested for their ability to discriminate sensory stimuli in the&#xD;
           affected region and on the other side of it. They are asked to discriminate between&#xD;
           stamps with grooves of different widths that are applied to the hands or feet.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dystonia is generally regarded as a motor execution abnormality due to a central nervous&#xD;
      system dysfunction in the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical motor loop. Regional traumas are&#xD;
      considered to be risk factors for the development of focal dystonia (FD) in the affected&#xD;
      limb. Since focal limb traumas are also associated with complex regional pain syndrome&#xD;
      (CRPS), there may be a common underlying pathology in both conditions. In CRPS, many patients&#xD;
      have a small fiber neuropathy. The goal of the proposed research is to distinguish&#xD;
      (discriminate) among the three disease categories (FD, FD+CRPS, CRPS), to find out whether FD&#xD;
      and CRPS share a common physiological substrate and represent two sides of a spectrum, and to&#xD;
      see which clinical situations may be secondary to an underlying small fiber neuropathy.&#xD;
      Independent studies will be conducted in patients with affected upper limbs and in those with&#xD;
      affected lower limbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to perform two studies on overall 90 subjects. One study will assess the affected&#xD;
      upper limb in 15 patients with unilateral focal dystonia, 15 patients with CRPS and 15&#xD;
      patients with focal dystonia and CRPS, while the second study will test the affected lower&#xD;
      limb in 15 patients with unilateral focal dystonia, 15 patients with CRPS and 15 patients&#xD;
      with focal dystonia and CRPS in the lower limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to explore the central aspects (somatosensory evoked potentials, SEPS, and&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation, TMS) in patients with upper limb disorders, because the&#xD;
      cortical representation of hand muscles is easier to study than the lower limb muscle&#xD;
      representations. In contrast, the peripheral studies (quantitative EMG and nerve conduction)&#xD;
      will be performed in patients with lower limb disorders, due to length, accessibility and&#xD;
      separation of pure motor and sensory nerves in the leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure for the central nervous system features (the upper limb&#xD;
      assessment) will be the difference in EEG dipole localization of the SEPs from thumb and&#xD;
      index finger between the three groups to assess possible disturbances of cortical&#xD;
      representation in the primary sensory cortex. TMS measures will be exploratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure of the lower limb testing will be the duration of motor unit&#xD;
      action potentials (MUAP) to assess differences and subtle lesions, which were not picked up&#xD;
      in clinical routine due to bigger confidence intervals of the single parameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unaffected side is the primary target of this study since we are looking for an&#xD;
      underlying substrate; however, all clinical tests will be performed bilaterally (if tolerated&#xD;
      by the subjects) and the comparison of both sides will be a secondary outcome measure.&#xD;
