  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to study the safety and efficacy of a pre-packaged, portion&#xD;
      controlled meal plan on weight loss and glycemic control in overweight and obese patients&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 - Effects on Weight Assess the effects of a pre-packaged, portion controlled meal plan&#xD;
      on weight loss in overweight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers hypothesize that the pre-packaged, portion controlled diet (PCD) will produce&#xD;
      a greater weight loss than a diabetes support and education (DSE) program at 12 weeks. The&#xD;
      study will be powered to detect between group differences of 3% of body weight. Secondarily,&#xD;
      the researchers will assess whether there are any differences in weight during the secondary&#xD;
      phase from weeks 13-24 when both groups will consume a PCD diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 - Effects on Glycemic Control&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess the effects of a pre-packaged, portion controlled meal plan on glycemic control in&#xD;
      overweight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers hypothesize that the PCD will show greater improvement in HbA1c levels than a&#xD;
      DSE group at 12 weeks. The study will be powered to detect between group differences of .5%&#xD;
      in HbA1c. Secondarily, improvements and differences in HbA1c from weeks 13-24 when both&#xD;
      groups are consuming a PCD will be assessed.&#xD;

           at least 3 months or more is allowable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes control: Measures of HbA1c and fasting glucose will be takes at visits 1-4 to assess&#xD;
      diabetes and glycemic control. In addition, we will track use of medications used to control&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dyslipidemia: Lipid/lipoprotein concentrations (total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol,&#xD;
      LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides) will be measured at visits 1-4. Current medication use&#xD;
      will be collected at each clinic visit. We will use these data to track the incidence and&#xD;
      prevalence of dyslipidemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory Markers: Inflammation will be measured using high sensitivity C reactive protein&#xD;
      (hs- CRP) at visits 2-4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrocardiograms: Electrocardiograms will be obtained at visit 1 according to a standard&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertension and blood pressure measures: Through blood pressure measurements at visits 1-4,&#xD;
      and self-reported current medication use, we will track the incidence and prevalence of&#xD;
      hypertension as a measure of periphery artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight, height, and waist circumference: Body weight will be measured at each PCD visit,&#xD;
      using calibrated scales. Participants will be weighed in light indoor clothing. Waist&#xD;
      circumference will be measured at visits 1-4. Height will be measured at visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum and DNA samples: Samples of serum will be frozen and stored for future testing of new&#xD;
      and emerging cardiovascular risk factors. DNA samples will be frozen and stored to identify&#xD;
      genetic markers of diet response. We will use these samples to determine the possibility that&#xD;
      the common genetic variant ENPP1 K121Q could predispose diabetic and metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      subjects to respond better to weight loss intervention than those who have the common variant&#xD;
      K121K. Similarly, other genetic variants that associate with obesity and insulin resistance&#xD;
      may change susceptibility to weight loss in different directions. If at any time during the&#xD;
      study a participant decides they do not want their serum samples to be stored they may have&#xD;
      them destroyed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-Reported Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychosocial measures: A battery of psychosocial measures will be assessed including&#xD;
      standardized assessments such as the Beck Depression Inventory8 and an eating disorders&#xD;
      questionnaire.9 These surveys will be measured will be assessed at visits 1-4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life: The Short Form 36 (SF-36) version will be used to measure general health&#xD;
      related quality of life at visits 1-4.10 It can be used to calculate domain scores plus two&#xD;
      summary scores: physical summary (four domains, 21 items), and mental health summary (four&#xD;
      domains, 14 items).&#xD;
&#xD;
      7-day Food Records: A 7 day food record will be recorded at visits 2-4 to assess compliance&#xD;
      with the PCD in phases 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptability: Acceptability of each program (PCD and DSE) will be measured at visits 2-4 to&#xD;
      determine tolerability and ease of each program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socio-demographics: Information on employment, household composition, and education is&#xD;
      collected at visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight history, personal medical history, family medical history: At visit one only.&#xD;
      Participants report their weights at various ages, history of weight cycling, and family and&#xD;
      personal history of disease. Participants will be referred to appropriate treatment for any&#xD;
      eating disorders, depression or other complications discovered as a result of the standard of&#xD;
      care weight and lifestyle inventory and beck depression inventory administered at the&#xD;
      screening visit. This treatment will be offered at CORE, or if participants prefer, with a&#xD;
      provider at another location relevant to their complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant medications and adverse events: At visits 1-4 concomitant medications and adverse&#xD;
      events will be recorded. Additional changes to these will be assessed as needed throughout&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible volunteers are randomly assigned to a treatment group consisting of a pre-packaged,&#xD;
      portion controlled meal plan (PCD) or to a control group that consists of a combination&#xD;
      diabetes support and education (DSE) program/pre-packaged, portion controlled meal plan (PCD)&#xD;
      cross-over group. Treatment assignments are unmasked. At the end of 24 weeks the treatment&#xD;
      group will have completed 18 group sessions and the control group will have completed 15&#xD;
      group sessions. The PCD program is aimed at achieving and maintaining a decrease in weight&#xD;
      from 1-24 weeks. Combination DSE/PCD program is aimed at achieving and maintaining a decrease&#xD;
      in weight from weeks 13-24. A Certified Diabetes Educator will review the effects of diet and&#xD;
      weight loss, exercise, and medications on blood glucose levels among all participants at the&#xD;
      first group meeting before any changes in dietary intake or exercise are prescribed.&#xD;
      Participants will be counseled on strategies to prevent hypoglycemia. In addition the causes,&#xD;
      symptoms and treatment of hypoglycemia will be reviewed including when to contact their&#xD;
      health care provider.&#xD;
