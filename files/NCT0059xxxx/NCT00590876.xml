    <textblock>
      In patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) is the&#xD;
      rate-limiting step to achieve glucose level control. As a result, understanding the body's&#xD;
      responses (including the brain's response) to hypoglycemia is essential for the effective&#xD;
      treatment of patients with T1DM. The purpose of this research is to determine whether&#xD;
      pancreatic islet cell allotransplantation to restore normoglycemia (normal blood glucose&#xD;
      levels) in Type 1 Diabetic patients with hypoglycemia unawareness alters brain fuel&#xD;
      utilization and cognitive performance under euglycemic (blood sugar at 100 mg/dl) and&#xD;
      hypoglycemic (blood sugar at 50 mg/dl) conditions. Three groups of subjects will be studied:&#xD;
      (1) T1DM patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia and/or hypoglycemia unawareness who&#xD;
      have been selected for pancreatic islet cell allotransplantation; (2) T1DM patients who also&#xD;
      have a history of severe hypoglycemia and/or hypoglycemia unawareness; (3) nondiabetic&#xD;
      subjects. All subjects will undergo identical testing including: (a) screening; (b)&#xD;
      neuropsychological testing; (c) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during&#xD;
      euglycemic and hypoglycemic conditions.&#xD;
