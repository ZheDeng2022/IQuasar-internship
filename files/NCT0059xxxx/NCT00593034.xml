      This study will use the CCPT II to assess attention in 12-21 year olds enrolled in a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial of a brief behavioral treatment for substance abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will describe at baseline levels of attention using a well validated instrument&#xD;
      (Connors Continuous Performance Test II) and explore the association between attention levels&#xD;
      and substance use. The primary study hypothesis is that lower initial levels of substance use&#xD;
      (as measured by percent days abstinent) will be associated with higher attention levels. We&#xD;
      envision that this data will inform a better understanding of how attention may modify&#xD;
      treatment response.&#xD;

      Research among adolescents with substance use problems presents unique challenges to&#xD;
      investigators. Issues with recruitment, confidentiality, and follow-up have been cited as&#xD;
      common limitations to research in this area. One likely contributor to decreased treatment&#xD;
      persistence and follow-up is the limited ability to sustain attention that many adolescents,&#xD;
      especially those with substance problems, may manifest. (Taper, 2002) Thus, assessing&#xD;
      attention before beginning substance abuse treatment has the potential not only to inform the&#xD;
      science of adolescent addiction medicine, but also to guide the development of therapies to&#xD;
      specifically address attention deficits among adolescent substance users. Adolescent&#xD;
      outpatients being treated for substance problems have not been systematically studied for&#xD;
      clinical or subclinical attention levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aims this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test the feasibility of administering the Connors Continuous Performance Test II&#xD;
           (CCPT II), a well validated measure of attention, to a sample of 12-21 year old patients&#xD;
           receiving treatment for substance abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To obtain baseline descriptive statistics on the CCPT II in a previously understudied&#xD;
           group of young patients receiving treatment for substance abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To estimate the magnitude of the association between substance use and levels of&#xD;
           attention at baseline before treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To explore the degree to which attention may affect response to substance abuse&#xD;
           treatment in general and specifically motivational interviewing.&#xD;
