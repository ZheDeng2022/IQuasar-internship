      Hypothesis to be tested: Dopamine D1-like receptor-induced natriuresis is impaired in humans&#xD;
      with G protein-related kinase 4 gene variants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research group has discovered a D1 receptor/adenylyl cyclase coupling defect in renal&#xD;
      PTCs from subjects with essential hypertension. We have found increased GRK-4 activity in&#xD;
      renal PTCs in human essential hypertension due to activating variants of GRK-4, an effect&#xD;
      that was reproduced in a transfected cell model. Preventing the translation of GRK-4&#xD;
      normalized the coupling of the D1 receptor to adenylyl cyclase in hypertension. Gene variants&#xD;
      of GRK-4 cause a ligand-independent serine-phosphorylation of the D1 receptor, resulting in&#xD;
      its uncoupling from the G-protein/effector complex. The desensitization of the D1 receptor in&#xD;
      the renal PTC is hypothesized to be the cause of the compromised natriuretic effect of DA&#xD;
      that eventually leads to Na+ retention and hypertension. The primary objective of this&#xD;
      protocol is to demonstrate that natriuresis engendered by D1-like receptor activation with&#xD;
      fenoldopam is blunted in subjects with 3 or more SNPs of GRK-4 compared with responses in&#xD;
      subjects with 0-2 SNPs.&#xD;

      Dopamine (DA) is an endogenous catecholamine, which serves as a biochemical precursor of&#xD;
      norepinephrine and epinephrine. DA is well known as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous&#xD;
      system. During the past decade, however, DA has been characterized as an important modulator&#xD;
      of BP, Na+ balance, renal and adrenal function through an independent peripheral dopaminergic&#xD;
      system. Evidence indicates that DA is synthesized locally within the kidney and acts at&#xD;
      adjacent cells in an autocrine or paracrine fashion to control renal Na+ excretion (1,2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a coordinated hormonal cascade, the principal effector&#xD;
      of which is angiotensin II (ANG II). All of the components of the RAS are present within the&#xD;
      kidney and intrarenal formation of ANG II provides major regulation of renal hemodynamic and&#xD;
      tubule function via a self-contained intrarenal RAS (3,4). We propose to study the&#xD;
      interaction of the renal dopaminergic and renin-angiotensin systems in the regulation of Na+&#xD;
      balance and Na+ sensitivity of blood pressure (BP) and in the pathophysiology of essential&#xD;
      hypertension in man.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our group has discovered a D1 receptor/adenylyl cyclase coupling defect in renal PTCs from&#xD;
      subjects with essential hypertension. We have found increased GRK activity in renal PTCs in&#xD;
      human essential hypertension due to activating variants of GRK-4, an effect that was&#xD;
      reproduced in a transfected cell model. Preventing the translation of GRK-4 normalized the&#xD;
      coupling of the D1 receptor to adenylyl cyclase in hypertension. The variants of GRK-4 cause&#xD;
      a ligand-independent serine-phosphorylation of the D1 receptor, resulting in its uncoupling&#xD;
      from the G-protein/effector complex. The desensitization of the D1 receptor in the renal PTC&#xD;
      may be the cause of the compromised natriuretic effect of DA that eventually leads to Na+&#xD;
      retention and hypertension. Therefore, a primary objective of the entire Program Project&#xD;
      Grant, of which this protocol is one part, is to identify humans with salt-sensitive&#xD;
      hypertension and resistance to the inhibitory effect of D1-like receptor agonist fenoldopam&#xD;
      on renal proximal Na+ reabsorption and determine whether these individuals have the&#xD;
      activating polymorphisms of GRK-4 alone or in combination with polymorphisms of genes of the&#xD;
      RAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are selected (on the basis of their GRK-4 genotype) from the pool of subjects that&#xD;
      have already been genetically screened under IRB-HSR # 11494.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be prepared and will be studied in approximate metabolic balance at 150 meq&#xD;
      Na+/d. After approximate metabolic balance is achieved (estimated 5 days), subjects will&#xD;
      receive either fenoldopam infusion or vehicle infusion on Day 6 and the opposite agent&#xD;
      (fenoldopam or vehicle) will be infused on Day 7. The order of infusion will be randomized&#xD;
      and the study will be conducted in double-blind fashion. Vehicle will be D5W and will be&#xD;
      infused during the control period using the same rate as the post control period. At 1100 h&#xD;
      on study Day 6, an i.v. infusion of fenoldopam or vehicle will be initiated and continued for&#xD;
      3h. The fenoldopam infusion rate will be 0.05 μg/kg/min. This infusion rate of fenoldopam has&#xD;
      resulted in a greater than 2-fold increase in UNaV without alteration of systemic hemodynamic&#xD;
      function in normal subjects (30). Plasma fenoldopam levels will be monitored to document&#xD;
      delivery of this agent into the circulation. BP and heart rate will be measured in duplicate&#xD;
      every 10 min during the experimental period (1100-1400h). The experimental period will be&#xD;
      followed by a 2-hour post-control period (1400h-1600h) during which vehicle will be infused.&#xD;
      Blood and urine samples will be obtained every 30 min and will be analyzed for Na+, K+,&#xD;
      lithium and creatinine concentrations and osmolality. In addition, blood samples will be&#xD;
      analyzed for PRA, cyclic AMP (blood and urine), plasma ANG II and aldosterone concentrations&#xD;
      at 1045, 1215, 1345 and 1545 h. After completion of a post-control period at 1600h, the&#xD;
      subjects will be allowed to be out of bed but remain as inpatients and receive the same diet&#xD;
      as previously. No food is given after 2400h on Day 6. On Day 7, the identical protocol as on&#xD;
      Day 6 will be repeated except that the opposite agent (fenoldopam or vehicle) will be&#xD;
      infused. The subjects will be discharged from the GCRC on their previous diet.&#xD;
