      This research protocol makes pictures of brain tumors. The pictures are made with a positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET) scanner. PET scans use radioactivity to &quot;see&quot; cancer cells. We are&#xD;
      using a new kind of PET scan. The new PET scan is called [18F]-FACBC PET. We will compare&#xD;
      this to the standard PET scan. The standard PET scan is called [11C]-methionine PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect these pictures will give us information about your tumor. We also hope to collect&#xD;
      information about the amount of radioactivity exposure. We will measure radioactivity&#xD;
      exposure to your tumor, brain and other organs. The research study results will be used to&#xD;
      support the submission of an investigational new drug (IND) application to the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA).&#xD;

      The purpose of this research is to: 1) perform both 3-[18F]-FACBC and&#xD;
      [11C-methyl]-Lmethionine brain tumor PET imaging studies in patients with primary brain&#xD;
      tumors who have previously been treated and are now suspect for having recurrence or&#xD;
      progression of disease (a pilot study, n=20); 2) perform only 3-[18F]-FACBC PET imaging&#xD;
      studies on an additional set of patients with primary brain tumors who have previously been&#xD;
      treated and are now suspect for having recurrence (n=10) . 3) obtain organ/tissue and body&#xD;
      radiation dosimetry information following i.v. injection of 3-[18F]-FACBC; 4) look for&#xD;
      potential correlations between the scan results obtained from those patients enrolled to&#xD;
      03-028 and the patients' past medical treatment; The first set of 20 patients will agree to&#xD;
      two PET studies. One study will involve the i.v.&#xD;
&#xD;
      administration of a fluorine-18 labeled amino acid analogue, 3-fluoro-aminocyclobutane&#xD;
      carboxylic acid (3-[18F]-FACBC) with sequential brain and body PET imaging. The second study&#xD;
      will involve i.v. administration of [11C-methyl]-L-methionine and head imaging only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The additional set of 10 patients will undergo one PET study which will consist of the i.v.&#xD;
&#xD;
      administration of fluorine-18 labeled amino acid analogue, 3-fluoro-aminocyclobutane&#xD;
      carboxylic acid (3-[18F]-FACBC) with one brain scan and one body scan only. The 3-[18F]-FACBC&#xD;
      PET studies (n=30) will be performed under the Radioactive Drug Research Committee (RDRC)&#xD;
      guidelines as defined and established by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA).&#xD;
      [11C-methyl]-L-methionine is in the hospital formulary and is approved for imaging brain&#xD;
      tumors at MSKCC. Our hypotheses include: 1) [18F]-FACBC has equal or better brain tumor&#xD;
      imaging characteristics compared to [11C]-methionine; 2) [18F]-FACBC is not metabolized, and&#xD;
      radiolabeled metabolites will not confound the interpretation of the images as can be the&#xD;
      case with [11C]-methionine; 3) imaging recurrent brain tumors with [18F]-FACBC will be&#xD;
      enhanced by lower brain (background) activity as compared to corresponding [11C]- methionine&#xD;
      images; 4) the biodistribution of [18F]-FACBC and radiation dosimetry following i.v.&#xD;
      administration of a 370 MBq (10 mCi) dose is safe and within FDA guidelines; 5) a 370 MBq (10&#xD;
      mCi) dose of [18F]-FACBC is sufficient for imaging brain tumors in a clinical setting; 6) the&#xD;
      accumulation of [18F]-FACBC will correlate with the patients response to prior treatment and&#xD;
      will provide prognostic information with respect to tumor progression and survival.&#xD;

    <description>F-18 labeled FACBC is prepared stereo-specifically in a semi-automated, NCA procedure utilizing the General Electric FDG MicroLab, a system employing a quaternary 4-aminopyridinium resin to effect F-18 fluorination. The triflate species is displaced with F-18 fluoride in the MicroLab, and then the 1-t-butyl carbamate-3- trifluoromethane sulfonoxy-1-cyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid methyl ester is hydrolyzed with 1 N HCl. The final product is isotonic and sterile, and has been utilized in animal experiments. The product was obtained in 30% radiochemical yield after 65 minutes from EOB. The radiochemical purity was greater than 95% and no preparative HPLC was required. The procedure could be considered routine, and is performed on the FDG synthetic module without changes either to the programming or to the cassettes.</description>

            <description>FACBC, Methionine: F-18 labeled FACBC is prepared stereo-specifically in a semi-automated, NCA procedure utilizing the General Electric FDG MicroLab, a system employing a quaternary 4-aminopyridinium resin to effect F-18 fluorination. The triflate species is displaced with F-18 fluoride in the MicroLab, and then the 1-t-butyl carbamate-3- trifluoromethane sulfonoxy-1-cyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid methyl ester is hydrolyzed with 1 N HCl. The final product is isotonic and sterile, and has been utilized in animal experiments. The product was obtained in 30% radiochemical yield after 65 minutes from EOB. The radiochemical purity was greater than 95% and no preparative HPLC was required. The procedure could be considered routine, and is performed on the FDG synthetic module without changes either to the programming or to the cassettes.&#xD;
