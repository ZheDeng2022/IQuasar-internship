    <textblock>
      Building on a platform of pharmacological treatment with Suboxone (buprenorphine and&#xD;
      naloxone), participants are randomly assigned to one of four psychosocial treatment&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The approval of buprenorphine (combined with naloxone as Suboxone速) by the FDA enables&#xD;
      physicians in the United States to provide pharmacotherapy treatment to opioid-dependent&#xD;
      patients in private medical settings. Buprenorphine's wide acceptance and implementation by&#xD;
      physicians has been slower than expected, however, and this may be due in part to the nature&#xD;
      and necessity of providing comprehensive treatment for opioid-dependent patients. Lessons&#xD;
      learned from methadone maintenance make it clear that simply providing opioid substitution&#xD;
      does not address the behavioral components of dependence. While there is no lack of&#xD;
      behavioral treatment facilities for substance abuse in the United States, what is lacking is&#xD;
      an integrative approach to the treatment of opioid dependence using pharmacotherapy in&#xD;
      conjunction with proven behavioral treatment strategies. Following a two-week stabilization&#xD;
      and baseline period, this project will randomize 240 participants into 4 behavioral treatment&#xD;
      groups featuring cognitive behavioral therapy and contingency management therapy. A&#xD;
      universal, manual-guided psychosocial standard of care for buprenorphine pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment allows for ethical inclusion of a &quot;no-CBT or CM therapy&quot; condition and closely&#xD;
      resembles the current standard of psychosocial care delivered with opioid treatment using&#xD;
      Suboxone速. Behavioral therapies will be delivered for 16 weeks (to study week 18) in&#xD;
      conjunction with continued care with Suboxone速. An additional 16 weeks of treatment using&#xD;
      Suboxone速 (to study week 34) will ensue during which no CBT or CM therapies are provided. All&#xD;
      participants enter a buprenorphine taper and return at study week 52 for long-term follow-up&#xD;
      evaluations. Outcomes for the trial include illicit drug use (urine drug samples collected&#xD;
      three times per week during the first 18 weeks), drug craving, retention (days in the&#xD;
      protocol), psychiatric status (depression, mood), HIV risk behaviors, and treatment&#xD;
      feasibility ratings. Results will be used to recommend strategies to optimize buprenorphine&#xD;
      treatment outcomes and promote integration of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial/behavioral&#xD;
      treatment strategies for physicians and for behavioral treatment facilities treating&#xD;
      opioid-dependent patients.&#xD;
