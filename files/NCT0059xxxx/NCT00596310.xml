  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the number one cancer killer in Kentucky and has a very high incidence within&#xD;
      the 5th Congressional District of Kentucky (110.8 cases per 100,000 in period 1996-2000).&#xD;
      Surgical removal provides the best chance for cure. Unfortunately, the majority of lung&#xD;
      cancer cases are detected in an advanced stage, when surgical resection is impossible. This&#xD;
      leads to shorter survival rates and increased mortality rates for lung cancer, increased&#xD;
      patient suffering, and greater cost to the healthcare system. Methods that favor earlier&#xD;
      detection are therefore crucial for successful treatment. One such method, low-dose spiral&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) is being studied to determine whether its use as a screening method&#xD;
      will lead to earlier detection and earlier intervention, perhaps impacting survival and&#xD;
      mortality in lung cancer. This method has a modest sensitivity to detect lung cancer, but low&#xD;
      specificity, which leads to many false positives and a low negative predictive value. The&#xD;
      present study is designed to address both of these limitations by: 1) identifying individuals&#xD;
      in the population at highest risk for developing lung cancer (due to smoking habits and&#xD;
      decreased pulmonary function) for subsequent CT screening, and 2) performing biomarker&#xD;
      testing in conjunction with the CT scan to improve the ability to discern individuals with&#xD;
      benign lung nodules from those with malignant tumors. The 5th Congressional District of&#xD;
      Kentucky has one of the highest rates of lung cancer in the nation and is an ideal location&#xD;
      to test the validity (sensitivity and specificity), feasibility (negative and positive&#xD;
      predictive value), and efficacy (stage distribution shift to earlier stage disease, increased&#xD;
      survival, and decreased cancer-specific mortality) of these strategies to enhance early&#xD;
      detection.&#xD;
