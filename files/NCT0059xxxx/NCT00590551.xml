      There are many reasons that cause skin to breakdown. This study will only compare&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  temperature&#xD;
&#xD;
      with the use of slings and without the use of slings (fabricated device used to safely handle&#xD;
      patient transfers and repositioning).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no difference in skin pressure, pH, or temperature with or without the use of&#xD;
      slings.&#xD;

      Preventing the development of pressure wounds in patients and preventing staff injuries and a&#xD;
      safe work environment has been an ongoing effort at Christiana Care Health System (CCHS).&#xD;
      Skin damage on hospitalized patients can be devastating. Not only does it increase patient's&#xD;
      hospital stay, but it also causes pain and affects patients quality of life and subsequently&#xD;
      costs. One practice in prevention and treatment of wounds is the use of pressure reducing,&#xD;
      relieving or pressure redistribution surfaces (mattresses) and repositioning devices&#xD;
      (electric lifts). Manufacturers of mattresses emphasize the need to limit layers between&#xD;
      surface (mattress) and the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safe work environments focus on programs that help to ensure the prevention of work related&#xD;
      injuries. Injury prevention programs have focused on equipment to eliminate manual lifting in&#xD;
      an effort to decrease staff injuries from patient transfers and repositioning. Part of this&#xD;
      practice is to leave the sling under the patient in order to reduce the amount of times staff&#xD;
      are manually repositioning or turning the patient. With an increasing patient population that&#xD;
      is either obese or extremely obese (bariatric patients) positioning and lifting equipment&#xD;
      need to manage large weight limits. In response, manufacturers have constructed slings with&#xD;
      increased fabric strength to handle heavier patients. There is concern that the newer sling&#xD;
      fabrics may interfere with the low airloss and pressure redistribution purpose of mattresses.&#xD;
      Information from this study may help in making slings with materials that can support higher&#xD;
      weights while not causing any added skin problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A convenience sample of 240 adult patients meeting the study criteria will be recruited from&#xD;
      the inpatient units at Wilmington Hospitaland Christiana Hospital for this comparison study.&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent, subjects will be randomized by a member of the study team&#xD;
      to one of six groups, yielding 40 subjects per group. Groups will be assigned as follows&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Supine and with sling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30 degrees HOB (Head of bed)elevation without leg elevation and with sling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30 degrees HOB elevation with 10 degrees leg elevation and with sling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Supine and without sling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30 degrees HOB elevation without leg elevation and without sling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30 degrees HOB elevation with 10 degrees leg elevation and without sling&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staff nurses will identify patients who need use of a sling for transfers and repositioning&#xD;
      and contact the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A member of the research team will determine patient eligibility, obtain informed consent,&#xD;
      and collect demographic information such as&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  height&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BMI, (Body Mass Index)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  gender&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  race&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Braden score, a list of risk factors in determining potential skin breakdown&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  activity level&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once consented, the patients sacral skin temperature and skin pH will be measured using a&#xD;
      thermometer and nitrazine paper and a control measurement of both temperature and pH will be&#xD;
      taken on anterior thigh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The X sensor or pressure mapping system, will be placed directly under the patient for&#xD;
      patients randomized to the no sling groups. For patients randomized to the sling groups, the&#xD;
      sling will be placed between the X sensor and the patient. The use of incontinence pads, etc.&#xD;
      if needed, will be limited to one and will be noted on data collection tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressure mapping, temperature and pH will be recorded at one minute baseline and at 20&#xD;
      minutes. Pressure mapping over the sacral area will be recorded and will include the highest,&#xD;
      lowest and average measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will have three dependent variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  temperature&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All three dependent variables will be on the ratio scales of measure. The goal of the study&#xD;
      is to test the null hypothesis that the three dependent variables are equal among six&#xD;
      conditions. Subjects will be randomly assigned to the six conditions. Each of the dependent&#xD;
      variables will be collected twice. Therefore, the study will incorporate one between subjects&#xD;
      factor, condition and one within subjects factor, time period. The between subjects factor&#xD;
      will have six levels and the within subjects factor will have two levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The traditional approach to analyzing data from the proposed research design is a univariate,&#xD;
      repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Increasingly, random effects or RE models are&#xD;
      being employed with data from repeated measures designs (Hedeker &amp; Gibbons, 1997 and Singer&#xD;
      and Willett, 2003). RE models offer two important advantages over ANOVA, (Raudenbush and&#xD;
      Bryk, 2002). First, unequal samples sizes such as occurs with missing data do not present the&#xD;
      difficulties they impose for ANOVA. Second, it is easy to specify complex models that include&#xD;
      multiple random effects. The proposed research model is straightforward and there are only&#xD;
      two time periods where data will be collected. In such instances, a third alternative is&#xD;
      available: a multivariate repeated measures ANOVA (Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2006). Like RE&#xD;
      models, the multivariate approach is robust to violations of the sphericity assumption&#xD;
      (Stevens, 2002). Unlike RE models, the analysis is straight forward and results are&#xD;
      interpreted according to traditional ANOVA conventions, a time effect, a group effect, and a&#xD;
      group by time interaction, which makes them understandable to a wider audience (Maxwell and&#xD;
      Delaney 2004). Consequently, data for the proposed study will be analyzed using the&#xD;
      multivariate repeated measures ANOVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A priori power was estimated for the three, multivariate repeated measures ANOVA for each&#xD;
      dependent variable in the study. The proposed analyses will use a two tailed alpha levels set&#xD;
      to .05. Overall power was set to .80, meaning the study will have an 80 percent probability&#xD;
      of finding a significant difference if such differences exist in the population. Equal sample&#xD;
      sizes are assumed. The power analysis concentrated on the multivariate group by time&#xD;
      interaction because it usually is the least powerful element in a repeated measures ANOVA&#xD;
      (Field, 2005 and Wickens and Keppel, 2004). A medium effect size is anticipated Cohens 1988 f&#xD;
      = .25. In addition, a drop out rate of 20 percent is expected. Results show an overall sample&#xD;
      size of 240 will be required, 40 subjects per group. This sample size was selected as the&#xD;
      smallest sample that would be important to detect.&#xD;
