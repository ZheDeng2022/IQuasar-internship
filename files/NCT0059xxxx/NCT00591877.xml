      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevalence and burden of disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) defined as presence of symptoms of heartburn and/or&#xD;
      acid regurgitation is a common chronic disorder. It is a significant health problem&#xD;
      especially in the Western population associated with a huge economic burden and impaired&#xD;
      quality of life (1, 2). The prevalence of GERD in the adult population of the United States&#xD;
      is 40% (symptoms at least once a month). Approximately 20% report GERD related symptoms&#xD;
      weekly while 14% report them on a daily basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The leading gastrointestinal symptoms evaluated in a primary care office setting are those&#xD;
      related to a diagnosis of GERD. The mainstay of treatment for GERD symptoms at present time&#xD;
      are proton pump inhibitors (PPI) in combination with life style changes. In fact, PPI have&#xD;
      become one of the most commonly written prescriptions, trends suggesting that per year&#xD;
      scripts have doubled since 1999. It is estimated that Americans spend in excess of 10 billion&#xD;
      US dollars/year on PPIs and two of the top five selling drugs in the United States are PPIs&#xD;
      (5). For patients who prefer to refrain from long-term medication use, may benefit from&#xD;
      acid-reflux surgeries such as Nissen fundoplication. However, acid-reflux reducing procedures&#xD;
      are associated with operative morbidity and mortality including several complications&#xD;
      including gas bloat syndrome. A large number of patients who undergo surgery for reflux&#xD;
      symptoms may eventually relapse and require PPIs. Thus, treatment of reflux, either&#xD;
      pharmacological or surgical, is costly (6-9) and presents a significant economic burden on&#xD;
      the health-care delivery system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social Impact of the disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
      GERD symptoms are associated with bodily pain, impaired social, emotional and physical&#xD;
      functioning which has a profound impact on daily living. Much research has been done to&#xD;
      evaluate the true burden of GERD on our society. For instance, 40% of patients with nighttime&#xD;
      symptoms of GERD reported that such symptoms affected their ability to function the next day.&#xD;
      Furthermore, 27% of these patients reported that their own night-time symptoms affected their&#xD;
      spouses ability to sleep (10). Clearly, this data indicates a huge number of Americans who&#xD;
      report the effects of heartburn on personal and spousal quality of life. GERD symptoms need&#xD;
      to be addressed effectively as successful treatment for GERD results in improvements in&#xD;
      health related quality of life (11, 12). In the treatment of GERD, the goal should be&#xD;
      complete symptom resolution as this has been shown to be associated with a clinically&#xD;
      significant improvement in health related quality of life (HRQL) (13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Refractory GERD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite life style changes and compliant therapy with PPI, a large number of patients may&#xD;
      have persistent symptoms and classified to have refractory GERD, a distinctive group that is&#xD;
      difficult to manage (14). The putative reasons remain poorly defined but likely include&#xD;
      contributions from factors such as non-acid reflux, visceral hypersensitivity, and abnormal&#xD;
      esophageal motor events (14). A study by Tack et al investigated mechanisms for poor response&#xD;
      to PPI therapy and showed persistence of acid reflux in 11%, bile reflux alone in 38% and a&#xD;
      combination of acid and bile reflux in 26%. However, persistence of acid or bile reflux does&#xD;
      not prove a causal relationship with symptoms (15). Also, in this group of individuals with&#xD;
      acid or bile reflux on BID PPI's, a possible treatment option is Nissen's fundoplication, the&#xD;
      utility of which is yet to be proven in this cohort. There is no consensus definition of&#xD;
      refractory GERD and generally, it is defined as non-response of symptoms to optimum PPI&#xD;
      trial. The goal of providing symptomatic relief to these refractory patients is extremely&#xD;
      challenging in view of limited options. It is to these patients that the investigators would&#xD;
      like to evaluate in a feasibility study the use of complementary medicine modalities&#xD;
      including acupuncture and yoga that may be relatively safe, cost-effective therapies to help&#xD;
      with the distressing symptoms of GERD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complementary and alternative medicine:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a group of diverse medical and health care&#xD;
      systems, therapies and products that are not presently considered to be part of conventional&#xD;
      medicine. These methods have been used for centuries in the eastern culture for a myriad&#xD;
      group of diseases. CAM became popular in the US in the 1990's where majority of people used&#xD;
      it as a complement to conventional medicine and not as an alternative (16-18). Recently,&#xD;
      there has been much interest in applying these modalities not as secondary therapies to&#xD;
      conventional treatment but as the primary method. Amongst them acupuncture and yoga have&#xD;
      gained a great deal of popularity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupuncture (AC):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupuncture is part of the traditional Chinese medicine a complete system of healing that&#xD;
      dates back to 200 BC. The general theory of acupuncture is based on the premise that there&#xD;
      are patterns of energy flow (Qi) through the body that are essential for health and&#xD;
      disruptions of this flow are believed to be responsible for disease. Studies have shown that&#xD;
      AC modulates the endorphin system via the central pain processing pathways (19, 20).&#xD;
      Acupuncture has been widely used for various gastrointestinal disorders. It is conceivable&#xD;
      that acupuncture may be effective in patients with GERD because it has been shown to alter&#xD;
      acid secretion, GI motility and visceral pain (21, 22).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of GERD is multifactorial. The predominant mechanism postulated to cause&#xD;
      GERD is transient relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (TLESR). Pathological reflux&#xD;
      may also occur due to low LES pressures (23). Studies have shown that acupoint stimulation&#xD;
      can decrease the rate of TLESR's and hence prevents reflux (24). The investigators propose to&#xD;
      use 3 acupoints ST-36, PC-6, CV-12 for treatment of symptoms of GERD. These points are&#xD;
      described in the subsequent sections. Acupuncture will be performed by Dr. Santosh Sharma who&#xD;
      has the expertise in this treatment modality and is currently offering his therapy for&#xD;
      several years at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Kansas City.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yoga:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yoga refers to a combination of breathing exercises and postures designed to involve specific&#xD;
      muscle groups with systemic effects on the various organ systems. Yoga originated in India at&#xD;
      least 3000 years ago. The practice of yoga came to US in 1890 and gained popularity in 1960s&#xD;
      because of a rising interest in and cultural acceptance of alternative modalities and mind&#xD;
      body therapies. Yoga is offered in local YWCA, health clubs and yoga centers and in hospitals&#xD;
      as part of disease prevention and management programs (25).The most popular form is Hatha&#xD;
      yoga. As discussed below, the usefulness of yoga has been studied in certain chronic&#xD;
      illnesses such as back pain with promising results. The investigators propose to use yoga&#xD;
      exercises specifically designed for reflux symptoms. Dr. Vijay Kumar will be offering yoga&#xD;
      classes to patients with refractory GERD. Dr. Vijay Kumar is a Professor of Computer Science&#xD;
      at University of Missouri - Kansas City and has been offering classes for several years at&#xD;
      various levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence for use of acupuncture and yoga:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several randomized controlled trials have been conducted demonstrating the beneficial effects&#xD;
      of acupuncture. A randomized controlled study in 29 patients with mild to moderate ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis with a 4 month follow up after completion of acupuncture sessions showed a&#xD;
      statistically significant improvement in colitis activity index (CAI) as compared to the&#xD;
      control group. The study concluded that acupuncture provided an additional therapeutic&#xD;
      benefit to patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (26).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another randomized 3-arm study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of traditional&#xD;
      Chinese acupuncture compared with sham acupuncture (needling at defined non-acupuncture&#xD;
      points) and conservative therapy in patients with chronic pain due to osteoarthritis of the&#xD;
      knee. Addition of acupuncture led to significant improvement in the symptoms (27). Recently,&#xD;
      Dickman et al evaluated the efficacy of adding acupuncture (twice a week over 4 weeks) as&#xD;
      compared to doubling the PPI dose in 30 refractory GERD patients(28). The acupuncture group&#xD;
      demonstrated a significant decrease in mean daytime heartburn scores compared to high-dose&#xD;
      PPI group. Mean nighttime heartburn and regurgitation scores improved only in the acupuncture&#xD;
      group. Thus this study showed that adding acupuncture as compared to doubling the PPI dose&#xD;
      was more effective in controlling symptoms of GERD in patients on standard dose of PPI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar benefits have been demonstrated with the use of yoga. A randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      compared yoga, exercise and self care book for chronic low back pain showed that yoga was&#xD;
      more effective than a self-care book for improving function and reducing chronic low back&#xD;
      pain and the benefits persisted for at least several months (29). Yoga was also found to be&#xD;
      useful in improving symptoms related to irritable bowel in a randomized trial conducted in&#xD;
      Canada (30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICAL RELEVANCE OF THIS STUDY GERD is a well known, widely prevalent, clinical entity. The&#xD;
      symptoms of GERD if not relieved can affect the daily functioning/productivity of&#xD;
      individuals. This can be especially frustrating for some patients, who may spend hundreds of&#xD;
      dollars every year on prescription medications, and are still not able to obtain relief of&#xD;
      their symptoms. In the United States alone, it is estimated that PPI costs alone make up over&#xD;
      $10billion/year (5). However, despite these staggering costs, it is clear that even PPI&#xD;
      therapy is not the definitive answer for all patients. Indeed, it has been reported that 37%&#xD;
      of patients receiving PPIs also note concomitant antacid use. This finding underscores the&#xD;
      fact that even with PPI therapy, a large percentage of patients do not achieve full symptom&#xD;
      relief. When left untreated--or when treated inadequately--severe GERD can progress to&#xD;
      esophagitis, esophageal ulcers, esophageal strictures, laryngeal disease, chronic cough,&#xD;
      Barrett's esophagus, and esophageal adenocarcinoma. Clearly, such patients with refractory&#xD;
      symptoms are the ones in the direst need for additional modalities of therapy. Yoga and&#xD;
      acupuncture may be a promising option for these patients, as they represent cost-effective,&#xD;
      yet underused, options which may be usefully employed to control the symptoms of GERD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient demographics, order of randomization, responses to questionnaires, and antacid use&#xD;
      will be collected by the study coordinator and recorded in a database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISK AND BENEFIT TO THE STUDY PARTICIPANT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot prospective study has the potential to identify new treatments for GERD symptoms.&#xD;
      The participants in this study may experience relief from their GERD symptoms persistent on&#xD;
      high dose acid suppressive therapy. This may improve their quality of life and level of&#xD;
      functioning. The risks to the study group are minimal. There is minor risk of bruising,&#xD;
      needle breakage and infection with the acupuncture needles and musculoskeletal symptoms in&#xD;
      patients undergoing yoga. If the study shows significant improvement in reflux symptoms with&#xD;
      acupuncture or yoga, then these methods may have a wider application to the entire spectrum&#xD;
      of GERD symptoms with the prospect of avoiding pharmacologic and surgical therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL METHODS AND DATA ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed with the help of a statistical software program. Categorical and&#xD;
      continuous variables will be compared using the Student's t-test and chi-square test. A p&#xD;
      value of &lt; 0.05 will be considered significant.&#xD;
