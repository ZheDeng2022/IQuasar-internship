      This study uses a new investigational (not yet approved by the FDA for widespread use) drug&#xD;
      called ZIO-101, an organic arsenical. You must be diagnosed to have relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      leukemia or lymphoma (blood cancer) and have tried other standard therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to determine whether ZIO-101 may be given safely. The study will also&#xD;
      test whether ZIO-101 helps to treat blood cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate that approximately 22 to 35 patients will take part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arsenic has been used as a medicinal agent for centuries in many different cultures. Most&#xD;
      recently in the United States, an inorganic arsenic compound was approved by the FDA for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). However, use of&#xD;
      inorganic arsenic is limited by a narrow range of activity and systemic toxicity, most&#xD;
      notably of the cardiac system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ZIO-101 is an organic arsenic derivative. In vitro testing in both the National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute (NCI) cancer cell panel and in vivo testing in a leukemia animal model demonstrated&#xD;
      substantial activity of SGLU against hematologic cancers. In vitro testing of SGLU using the&#xD;
      NCI human cancer cell panel also detected activity against lung, colon and brain cancers,&#xD;
      melanoma, and ovary and kidney cancers. Moderate activity was seen against breast and&#xD;
      prostate cancers cells. Data suggest that organic arsenic generates reactive oxygen species&#xD;
      in the cells to induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find answers to the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the largest dose of ZIO-101 that can be given once a day for 5 days every 4&#xD;
           weeks (a &quot;cycle&quot;)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What are the side effects of ZIO-101 when administered in this way?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. After getting the drug how much of the ZIO-101 remains in the blood stream up to 8 days&#xD;
           after the first injection?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Is ZIO-101 useful in reducing my blood cancer?&#xD;
&#xD;
      A series of tests will be taken throughout the study: medical history will be recorded, a&#xD;
      physical exam performed, an electrocardiogram (EKG) (a measurement of your heart activity),&#xD;
      blood tests. The amount of blood taken for these lab tests will equal about 2 1/2&#xD;
      tablespoons. In addition, a urine pregnancy test (if applicable), and a urine sample taken to&#xD;
      test if your kidneys are working correctly. To see the current condition of your blood&#xD;
      cancer, additional tests may need to be performed if they have not already been done&#xD;
      recently. These tests may include: a bone marrow biopsy, special testing of your blood, a CT&#xD;
      scan and a bone scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately before being treated with ZIO-101, you will have another physical examination,&#xD;
      you will also be asked about any medicines you are taking and how you are feeling. The blood&#xD;
      tests may need to be repeated along with the EKG and the urine test. In addition, a small&#xD;
      blood sample must be taken immediately before the injection of ZIO-101.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The injections of ZIO-101 will take approximately one hour. Following the first injection&#xD;
      only, you will have 6 samples of blood taken at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 hours. Additional&#xD;
      blood samples will be taken prior to each dose of ZIO-101 only. You will also have repeat EKG&#xD;
      within one hour after completing the injection. This process will be repeated for 5&#xD;
      consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your next visit will be Week 2 and at the onset of this visit, a blood sample will be taken&#xD;
      and you will be asked how you feel. At Weeks 3 and 4, another blood sample will be taken and&#xD;
      you will be asked how you feel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of Week 4, a new cycle begins. Immediately before being treated with ZIO-101, you&#xD;
      will have a physical examination, you will be asked about any medicines you are taking and&#xD;
      how you are feeling. The blood tests will be repeated along with the EKG and the urine test.&#xD;
      In addition, any test used to measure your blood cancer will be repeated toward the end of&#xD;
      the cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive up to six of these cycles.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have relapsed/refractory leukemia or lymphoma for which no standard&#xD;
             therapies are anticipated to result in a durable remission. Relapsed/refractory&#xD;
             leukemia/lymphoma includes acute leukemia, chronic myeloproliferative disease, chronic&#xD;
             lymphoproliferative disease, multiple myeloma, and any type of lymphoma. Subjects with&#xD;
             poor-risk myelodysplasia (MDS) are also candidates for this protocol. Poor risk MDS&#xD;
             includes refractory anemia with excess blasts or excess blasts in transformation, and&#xD;
             chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of ≤ 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential (i.e., women who are pre-menopausal or not surgically&#xD;
             sterile) must use acceptable contraceptive methods (abstinence, intrauterine device&#xD;
             [IUD], oral contraceptive or double barrier device), and must have a negative serum or&#xD;
             urine pregnancy test within 1 week prior to beginning treatment on this trial. Nursing&#xD;
             subjects are excluded. Sexually active men must also use acceptable contraceptive&#xD;
             methods. Pregnant and nursing subjects are excluded because the effects of ZIO-101 on&#xD;
             a fetus or nursing child are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be able and willing to give written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absent rapidly progressing disease, the interval from cancer therapy should be ≥ 3&#xD;
             weeks. Subjects receiving hydroxyurea should be on stable dose ≥ 7 days before&#xD;
             beginning treatment protocol. Persisting chronic toxicities from prior therapy must be&#xD;
             ≤ grade 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have the following clinical laboratory values:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 2 x the upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 2 x the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3 x the&#xD;
                  upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  QTc interval &lt; 450-470 mSec&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with any one of the following criteria will not be eligible for study&#xD;
        participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with indolent and stable myeloma, MDS or CLL not requiring therapy are not&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Central nervous system (CNS) involvement with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled active infection of any kind. Subjects with infections that are under&#xD;
             active treatment with antibiotics and whose infections are controlled may be entered&#xD;
             to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active heart disease including myocardial infarction within previous 6 months;&#xD;
             symptomatic coronary artery disease; any type of chronic, ongoing arrhythmias; or&#xD;
             uncontrolled congestive heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant therapy for hematologic cancer (except hydroxyurea).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NYHA functional class ≥ 3, myocardial infarction ≤ 6 mo or uncontrolled cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia other than asymptomatic atrial fibrillation; QTc ≥450msec; AV-block ≥&#xD;
             grade-2 or Left Bundle Branch Block.&#xD;
