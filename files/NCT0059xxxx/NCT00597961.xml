      There are two goals of this research study. First, we hope to develop a plan to guide family&#xD;
      discussions that can help parents diagnosed with lung cancer talk about cancer risk with&#xD;
      their adult children. Second, we want to understand how families talk about cancer&#xD;
      prevention.&#xD;

      In large part due to the advent of genetic testing, families have recently become a more&#xD;
      central focus in cancer prevention. Given the high concordance of health behaviors within&#xD;
      families (Kristeller et al., 1996), there is interest in developing family-wide behavior&#xD;
      change interventions to reduce cancer risk. A cancer diagnosis represents a &quot;teachable&#xD;
      moment,&quot; in which a diagnosis may prompt health behavior change. Although this phenomenon has&#xD;
      been observed among cancer survivors, it has not been examined among a patient's family&#xD;
      members. Several critical questions exist about how families understand and communicate with&#xD;
      regard to cancer risk information and what family processes facilitate or impede health&#xD;
      behavior change. There is very little existent research in the area of cancer prevention&#xD;
      among family members of cancer patients. Results in this area could help us develop&#xD;
      interventions for family members who are motivated to make health behavior changes, and to&#xD;
      inform and guide others who may not be motivated at the time their family member is&#xD;
      diagnosed. Most importantly, the results could also help us intervene with family members of&#xD;
      those who have been diagnosed with cancers where genetic and lifestyle components are&#xD;
      important in the etiology of the illness, such as lung cancer and melanoma, and thus&#xD;
      first-degree family members would benefit from strong messages to adopt healthy lifestyles.&#xD;
      The research will rely on qualitative data collection and analysis. We will conduct&#xD;
      qualitative interviews with 20 pairs of melanoma patients and one adult son or daughter, and&#xD;
      20 pairs of lung cancer patients and one adult child/sibling/or spouse. More specifically,&#xD;
      for each pair of participants (i.e., the patient and his/her family member) we will conduct&#xD;
      three interviews: an individual interview with the patient, an individual interview with the&#xD;
      family member, and a joint interview where we will talk to the patient and family member at&#xD;
      the same time. We will analyze interview data with a qualitative data computer analysis&#xD;
      program, and identify themes and conclusions representing the core ideas in our data.&#xD;

        Concentrating on two distinct tumor types, lung cancer and melanoma, because of the&#xD;
        prominence of risk behaviors in the etiology of both of these cancers. With regard to lung&#xD;
        cancer, we have identified high concordance of smoking among the spouses, siblings and&#xD;
        children of recently diagnosed patients. In the context of melanoma, patients report a&#xD;
        desire to use focused family discussions to encourage family members to reduce their skin&#xD;
        cancer risk and increase early detection behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        &quot;Family&quot; defined as a group consisting of blood relatives, domestic partners, &amp; on-blood&#xD;
        relatives as defined by cancer patient. During interviews with melanoma-affected families&#xD;
        we will be gathering data from a melanoma patient &amp; ne of their adult sons or daughters.&#xD;
        During the interviews with lung cancer-affected families we will be gathering data from a&#xD;
        lung cancer patient and either one of their adult children, or one of their siblings, or&#xD;
        their spouse.&#xD;
