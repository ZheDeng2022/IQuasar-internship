      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of Virtual Reality (VR) technology during&#xD;
      Physical Therapy (PT) and/or Occupational Therapy (OT) for patients with burns. Research&#xD;
      questions: Do patients have increased joint Range of Motion (ROM) and reduced pain when using&#xD;
      VR during PT compared to PT/OT when VR is not used? Do scores on an imaging ability scale&#xD;
      correlate with the effects of VR when used with PT/OT? Do adults and children differ in their&#xD;
      ability to engage in the virtual world?&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of virtual reality (VR) technology during&#xD;
      Physical Therapy (PT) and/or Occupational Therapy (OT) for patients with burns. Due to the&#xD;
      pain that many burn patients experience during PT/OT, we are searching for non-medicinal&#xD;
      methods of decreasing their pain. The question we will address is: does VR use during PT/OT&#xD;
      help to increase Range of Motion (ROM) and decrease pain intensity?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recovery from a trauma can be hindered by the presence of acute pain. Unfortunately for burn&#xD;
      victims, physical and occupational therapies remains an area of significant evoked pain.&#xD;
      PT/OT is an integral part of the burn recovery and starts early in the course of treatment.&#xD;
      PT/OT is necessary to maintain elasticity of healing skin and thereby promote functional&#xD;
      range of motion of affected joints. If the patient is unable to participate in PT/OT due to&#xD;
      pain, joint contractures can occur and surgical release of the contracture can become&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although pain during PT/OT can be treated with opioids, there are several drawbacks to the&#xD;
      use of analgesics alone. Side effects, the development of opioid tolerance, and the inability&#xD;
      of the drugs to adequately control pain are some of the disadvantages. Supplemental use of&#xD;
      nonpharmacologic techniques, along with opioid therapy, has been found to be effective in&#xD;
      reducing pain and anxiety. In particular, distraction has been found to be useful to minimize&#xD;
      burn pain (Miller, 1992; Patterson, 1995). Virtual reality, due to its immersive nature that&#xD;
      includes sight, sound, and sometimes touch, may be an even more effective method of&#xD;
      distraction than traditional methods such as video movies or interactive video games. To&#xD;
      explain these non-pharmacologic analgesic effects, investigators propose that the illusion of&#xD;
      going in to the virtual world draws the patient's attention. Conscious attention is required&#xD;
      for the experience of pain (Chapman and Nakamura, 1999; Eccleston and Crombez, 1999). The&#xD;
      interactive nature of the immersive virtual reality make VR unusually attention grabbing,&#xD;
      leaving less attention available to process incoming pain signals (Hoffman, Patterson and&#xD;
      Carrougher, 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1996, Hunter Hoffman and David Patterson co-originated new techniques using immersive&#xD;
      virtual reality for pain control. Virtual reality is a familiar format to children and young&#xD;
      adults, who grew up playing videogames. Like videogames, it is an environment that is&#xD;
      stimulated by a computer. However, in virtual reality, visual experiences are presented&#xD;
      through special stereoscopic goggles. Virtual reality simulations can include additional&#xD;
      sensory information, such as sound through speakers and touch through cyber-gloves. Users&#xD;
      interact with a virtual reality environment either through a keyboard, mouse, or a specially&#xD;
      designed device. These systems are described as &quot;fully immersive&quot; as the user is surrounded&#xD;
      by virtual reality stimulation. Simulated environments have been used to mimic videogames and&#xD;
      real-world situations, such as pilot training, driver training, museum tours, and underwater&#xD;
      expeditions. Researchers have found that immersive virtual reality distraction can reduce&#xD;
      patient's pain rating during severe burn wound care by 30% to 50% (Hoffman, Patterson et al.,&#xD;
      2004; Hoffman, Patterson and Carrougher, 2000). Patients receiving adjunctive VR during&#xD;
      physical therapy reported large reductions in the amount of time spent thinking about pain,&#xD;
      pain intensity (worst pain) and in how unpleasant they found their pain (Hoffman, Patterson,&#xD;
      Carrougher and Sharar, 2001). In a recent fMRI brain scan study, participants reported large&#xD;
      reductions in subjective pain when in VR compared to no VR during their scan. The controlled&#xD;
      laboratory fMRI study further showed that VR analgesia was accompanied by large reductions in&#xD;
      pain-related brain activity (Hoffman, Richards et al., 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will replicate and extend the work of Hoffman, Patterson and colleagues.&#xD;
      Using similar experimental techniques, patients will serve as their own controls to evaluate&#xD;
      the effects of the use of VR during physical therapy/occupational therapy for burn care&#xD;
      compare to no VR during therapy during several sessions. An imagery scale will be completed&#xD;
      by subjects prior to the first session to determine if there is a correlation between imagery&#xD;
      scores and the effects of the VR. This may help identify patients who will benefit from VR in&#xD;
      the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior research has shown that some patients respond better than others to adjunct therapy&#xD;
      than others. Caregivers may be reluctant to initiate such therapies unless they are certain&#xD;
      it will be beneficial. Kwekkeboom has developed and tested the Imaging Ability Questionnaire&#xD;
      (IAQ) and the Kids Imaging Ability Questionnaire (KIAQ) to help determine who would benefit&#xD;
      from this type of intervention (Kwekkeboom, Maddox, West, 2000). Participants will be&#xD;
      completing these questionnaires prior to the first VR therapy session. The instruments for&#xD;
      both groups will be the same with the exception of the &quot;imaging ability&quot;. Each group will&#xD;
      complete an &quot;imaging ability&quot;, but one has been designed especially for children, the other&#xD;
      for adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of the research using VR has been focused on children. Children and adolescents&#xD;
      are accustom to playing video games and may have an easier transition into the VR world. We&#xD;
      are interested in the adult's ability to become engaged in VR compared to children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential benefits include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Speedier Physical Rehabilitation a Decreased Pain Experience During Necessary Care Decreased&#xD;
      Pain Med Requirements Addition of Variety to Daily Activities Altruistic Benefit Derived From&#xD;
      the Possible Future Benefit to Others.&#xD;
