  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test of the liver can&#xD;
      accurately measure the amount of fat in the liver compared to the results of a liver biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 18 years of age and older who are scheduled to have or who have already had a liver&#xD;
      biopsy as part of their medical care within 1 month of enrollment in this study may be&#xD;
      eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo an MRI. For this procedure, the subject lies still on a table that&#xD;
      slides into a narrow metal cylinder (the MRI scanner) for 30 to 60 minutes. A special pad or&#xD;
      tube is placed around the abdomen to improve the image of the liver obtained. Earplugs are&#xD;
      placed in the ears to muffle loud thumping and knocking sounds that occur with the electrical&#xD;
      switching of the magnetic field. The findings of the MRI are compared with those of the liver&#xD;
      biopsy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous liver biopsy remains the gold standard test to evaluate hepatic fat content,&#xD;
      fibrosis and cirrhosis, but there is growing interest in the application of magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) techniques such as (1)H-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) as&#xD;
      a non-invasive approach to quantify these characteristics. The ability to accurately quantify&#xD;
      hepatic metabolites, such as intrahepatic lipid, has important implications for clinical&#xD;
      evaluation and management of patients with liver related diseases and may obviate the need&#xD;
      for liver biopsies in a number of clinical settings. The current proposal is designed to&#xD;
      develop and validate hepatic (1)H-MRS capabilities at the NIH Clinical Center and to use this&#xD;
      technique in a subsequent study to estimate the prevalence of hepatic steatosis among persons&#xD;
      living with HIV/AIDS. In the present study we propose to complete MRI with (1)H-MRS in 70&#xD;
      adults who will be undergoing percutaneous liver biopsy in order to establish the ability of&#xD;
      (1)H-MRS to accurately assess hepatic fat content compared to histopathological scoring.&#xD;
