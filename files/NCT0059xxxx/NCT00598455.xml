  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eighty percent of patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) have renal angiomyolipomata.&#xD;
      These lesions grow and can lead to significant morbidity by hemorrhage or renal failure.&#xD;
      Understanding the natural history of these lesions and understanding which lesions may be&#xD;
      more prone to grow quickly or develop aneurysms that predispose to hemorrhage will greatly&#xD;
      assist clinical care of patients with TSC. The objective is to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      serial MR and CT imaging will allow objective, reproducible quantification of angiomyolipoma&#xD;
      growth by volumetric analysis, and analysis of lesions characteristics will identify&#xD;
      angiomyolipomata with rapid growth potential that would require intervention. The specific&#xD;
      aim of this proposal is to collect clinically obtained serial abdominal imaging from the&#xD;
      Tuberous Sclerosis Natural History Consortium Centers and analyze the volume and adiposity of&#xD;
      the individual angiomyolipomata. The growth rate is hypothesized to have an inverse&#xD;
      relationship to adiposity. Yearly renal MR or CT imaging will be performed of patients with&#xD;
      TSC. The images will be coded at the site of acquisition, and transferred via VPN to a secure&#xD;
      server at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Using innovative imaging processing&#xD;
      software (Cincinnati Children's Hospital Image Processing Software (CCHIPS), the image data&#xD;
      will be segmented to reveal various tissue components based on signal intensities. Different&#xD;
      signal intensities can differentiate normal renal parenchyma, and renal angiomyolipomata.&#xD;
      Using the imaging data and the novel software, the volume of an individual angiomyolipoma, as&#xD;
      well as the adiposity will be determined. Imaging at enrollment (year 1) will serve as&#xD;
      baseline. At years two and three, the lesions will undergo repeat analysis. Angiomyolipoma&#xD;
      growth rates and adiposity over three years will be analyzed to test the hypothesis above.&#xD;

      Objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objective is to test the hypothesis that serial MR and CT imaging will allow objective,&#xD;
      reproducible quantification of angiomyolipoma growth by volumetric analysis, and analysis of&#xD;
      lesions characteristics will identify angiomyolipomata with rapid growth potential that would&#xD;
      require intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aim of this proposal is to collect clinically obtained serial abdominal imaging&#xD;
      from the Tuberous Sclerosis Natural History Consortium Centers and analyze the volume and&#xD;
      adiposity of the individual angiomyolipomata. The growth rate is hypothesized to have an&#xD;
      inverse relationship to adiposity. The prognostic value of identifying lesions with&#xD;
      aggressive growth characteristics is very large, and intervention can be instituted early in&#xD;
      order to reduce the renal damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The target population for this study will be patients with tuberous sclerosis who attend&#xD;
           a tuberous sclerosis clinic that is part of the consortium. The data collected will&#xD;
           include routine imaging data, age, gender, and if know, the genotype. Approximately 855&#xD;
           patients throughout the United States will be asked to participate in this natural&#xD;
           history study and 450 of those are anticipated to consent and have complete data on 3&#xD;
           years of CT and MR Imaging Scans to measure angiomyolipoma growth and adiposity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients attending the tuberous sclerosis clinics that are members of the consortium&#xD;
           will be asked if they would be involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Imaging will be obtained as part of the standard of care at the Consortium Centers.&#xD;
           Imaging done on pregnant patients will not be excluded. MRI has been used now&#xD;
           extensively for pregnant patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol Design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a natural history study involving the imaging characteristics of angiomyolipomata&#xD;
      found in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex. This study offers the potential benefit&#xD;
      that the lesion characteristics and growth rate will be monitored. Patel et al. posit that&#xD;
      growth rates of greater than 0.5 cm/year for solid tumors are worrisome for malignancy.&#xD;
      Patients harboring lesions that exhibit faster growth rates will be identified so that they&#xD;
      can be more carefully monitored. During the course of the study, should we detect concerning&#xD;
      features, the Consortium Center TS Clinic Director will be alerted. Imaging modalities that&#xD;
      may be used include CT scans. The patient data being collected will be done so for clinical&#xD;
      reasons, and every effort will be made to use the least possible radiation exposure. There&#xD;
      are several ways to reduce the exposure, and these limiting techniques will be employed for&#xD;
      each scan. The scans will be performed both pre and post contrast using an agent such as&#xD;
      OptirayÂ® so that vascularity can be assessed. Patients may also be imaged with a 1.5 Tesla&#xD;
      magnet in a supine position using a phased array torso coil or body coil, depending on&#xD;
      patient size. When compatible, respiratory compensation will be used to diminish respiratory&#xD;
      artifact. Overall imaging time for the following sequences will be approximately 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Recruitment process: Patients will be recruited from patients seen at the Tuberous&#xD;
      Sclerosis Natural History Consortium Centers, including Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Loma&#xD;
      Linda University, University of Pennsylvania Medical Center, Connecticut Children's Medical&#xD;
      Center, Vanderbilt University, Columbus Children's, Texas Scottish Rite Hospital,&#xD;
      Massachusetts General Hospital, Miami Children's Hospital, Minnesota Epilepsy Group,&#xD;
      Dartmouth University, Washington Children's Hospital, New York University School of Medicine,&#xD;
      University of Texas, Houston, Children's Hospital, Boston, and Children's Hospital,&#xD;
      Pittsburgh.&#xD;
