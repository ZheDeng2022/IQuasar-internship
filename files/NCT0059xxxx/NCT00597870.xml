  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to determine whether the Talent Thoracic Stent Graft,&#xD;
      an investigational device, is a safe and effective method of treating thoracic aortic&#xD;
      aneurysms (abnormal ballooning of the vessel wall) and other thoracic lesions (dissections,&#xD;
      transections, pseudoaneurysms, penetrating ulcers, etc.). The endovascular method is a&#xD;
      substitute for the major operation that is performed to treat the lesions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The endovascular method consists of the insertion of catheters (vinyl tubes) into both groin&#xD;
      arteries. These catheters then allow positioning of artificial tubes or stent graft(s) into&#xD;
      the diseased blood vessel without the need for major surgery which involves opening the&#xD;
      chest. The blood vessel problem (thoracic aortic aneurysm/lesion) will be treated using an&#xD;
      artificial bypass tube (stent graft) that will be placed inside the diseased artery. The&#xD;
      stent graft(s) that will be used are made of polyester graft fabric sewn to a self-expanding&#xD;
      nickel-titanium (Nitinol) wire frame and is manufactured by Medtronic AVE, Santa Rosa&#xD;
      California.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aneurysms/lesions can be located in any position along the length of the aorta. This study&#xD;
      evaluates only aneurysms/lesions that occur in the descending part of the thoracic aorta as&#xD;
      it traverses the chest and enters the abdominal cavity. The risk of thoracic&#xD;
      aneurysms/lesions is that they rupture without warning. The risk of rupture increases as the&#xD;
      aneurysm size increases. Following rupture, almost all patients expire within the first 24&#xD;
      hours. For this reason treatment of thoracic aneurysms/lesions is recommended by conventional&#xD;
      surgical means if the patient is a candidate for an operation. The conventional operation&#xD;
      involves occluding the aorta and replacing the aneurysm with a cloth tube that is sewn to&#xD;
      replace the diseased part of the aorta. The major surgery and occlusion of the aorta that is&#xD;
      part of the conventional surgery is directly related to several complications that have been&#xD;
      reported in the literature. In addition, many patients are too ill for conventional surgery&#xD;
      due to concomitant illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the procedure, the patient will be followed at regular intervals (pre-discharge, 1&#xD;
      month, 6 months, 12 months and every year thereafter for life) as part of the evaluation of&#xD;
      the experimental treatment. During this time, the patient will have several tests performed&#xD;
      to evaluate the function of the repair. The tests will include clinical examination, x-rays&#xD;
      of the chest and spiral CT scan. The experimental part is the placement of the TALENT&#xD;
      Stent-Graft System using the catheter (endovascular) methods. The risk of the experimental&#xD;
      catheter bypasses is that the procedure may not be successful. In most cases, this would&#xD;
      require a standard operation to repair the problem. Sometimes there are other risks such as&#xD;
      injury to the vessels. Small pieces of diseased arteries may be dislodged which may require&#xD;
      removal. Bleeding may occur from introduction sites, and rarely, infection may develop. If a&#xD;
      catheter bypass is unsuccessful, there can be added discomfort because the procedure may last&#xD;
      longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits of the procedure are that the patient might avoid some of of the pain and&#xD;
      discomfort associated with standard operations. Major surgery is avoided and hospital stay&#xD;
      may be much shorter. Patients may be able to return to usual daily activities sooner. In&#xD;
      addition, patients who are too high risk for conventional surgical treatment can have their&#xD;
      aneurysm treated using the endovascular graft if their anatomy is appropriate&#xD;
