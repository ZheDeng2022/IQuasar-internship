      Marfan syndrome is a genetic disease of our connective tissue, which provides material and&#xD;
      support for our skeleton, muscles, blood vessels and other parts of our bodies. People with&#xD;
      Marfan syndrome may be tall and thin with slender, tapering fingers, long arms and legs, and&#xD;
      spine curvature. They often have heart and eye problems. In some patients, the condition is&#xD;
      very mild and the person has few or no symptoms. Others are always at risk of&#xD;
      life-threatening problems, which usually involve damage to the valves in the heart or&#xD;
      weakening of the large blood vessels leading from the heart. If the blood vessels become&#xD;
      weak, they can balloon out (dilate) and break (rupture), which might cause the person to die&#xD;
      suddenly. We have only a limited ability to stop the progression of disease in Marfan&#xD;
      syndrome. Typically we use medicines that lower heart rate or blood pressure (or both). But&#xD;
      this does not prevent the disease and very few drugs work well enough to keep patients from&#xD;
      needing surgery or dying suddenly because a blood vessel has torn open. Our objective is to&#xD;
      study two medicines to see if one, or both, can improve blood vessel function in patients&#xD;
      with Marfan syndrome. One (Atenolol) belongs to a group of drugs called beta blockers and is&#xD;
      often used to treat high blood pressure. It is the most common drug that is currently used to&#xD;
      treat patients with Marfan syndrome. The other (Losartan) is also used for high blood&#xD;
      pressure, but works in a different way. This study will help us to find better ways to treat&#xD;
      people who have Marfan syndrome and to identify early changes in blood vessel function that&#xD;
      may help to prevent long-term complications.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed research is to conduct a randomized, double-blind superiority&#xD;
      feasibility study to compare the effects of two types of medication (Losartan, an Angiotensin&#xD;
      Receptor Blocker, and Atenolol, a beta blocker) on vascular function in patients with Marfan&#xD;
      syndrome (MFS). Our outcomes will include measuring the pulse wave velocity (PWV) and other&#xD;
      biophysical properties of the aorta in the two groups of patients. This study will provide&#xD;
      essential pilot data and development of logistics to enable a full multi-centre randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial to test the hypothesis that Losartan will improve vascular function and, in&#xD;
      the long-term, slow the rate of aortic root dilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MFS is an inherited disorder that affects 1:5000 of the population (i.e., 6000 people) in&#xD;
      Canada alone. In MFS, mutations in the FBN1 gene lead to production of abnormal fibrillin 1&#xD;
      and to connective tissue abnormalities that impair skeletal, ocular, pulmonary and, most&#xD;
      importantly, cardiovascular systems. Cardiovascular complications are also related to&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction, which has widespread implications for the health of large and&#xD;
      muscular blood vessels and has effects on blood pressure, thrombosis, cholesterol levels and&#xD;
      general vascular homeostasis. In MFS, progressive dilation, dissection and rupture of the&#xD;
      aortic root may occur. This dilation is not solely due to the primary abnormality in collagen&#xD;
      caused by the abnormal fibrillin protein. It remains unclear what the vascular mechanisms are&#xD;
      that cause dilation of the aortic root. Eventual aortic rupture is a major cause of sudden&#xD;
      death in MFS. If untreated, MFS significantly shortens the lifespan of affected individuals:&#xD;
      half will succumb in their late 20s or early 30s, usually of aortic rupture. As such, it is&#xD;
      crucial to develop effective treatments for cardiovascular disease in MFS and to improve our&#xD;
      ability to detect critical changes in blood vessel (aortic) structure and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical management of cardiovascular disease in individuals with MFS aims to decrease the&#xD;
      rate of aortic root dilation and reduce the risk of dissection and rupture. Beta blockers&#xD;
      (eg. Atenolol) have been the traditional medical treatment although some studies have cited&#xD;
      the success of calcium antagonists or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,&#xD;
      However, while beta blocker treatment has been successful in reducing the rate of dilation of&#xD;
      the aorta, and its complications in MFS, studies report inconsistent responses to treatment&#xD;
      and one pediatric study showed no benefit of beta blockers and better results with ACE&#xD;
      inhibitors. Thus, it is still unclear whether one or the other of these pharmacological&#xD;
      agents improves outcomes in regard to aortic dilation or rupture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, individuals with MFS have been shown to have dysregulation of transforming growth&#xD;
      factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling that is postulated to result in the enlarged aortic root and&#xD;
      other manifestations of the disease. Conversely, disorders of TGF beta 1 and 2 receptors have&#xD;
      been shown to produce a Marfan phenotype. A study using a Marfan mouse model found that&#xD;
      Losartan, an angiotensin 2 AT1 receptor blocker, prevented the development of aortic root&#xD;
      dilation and other phenotypic manifestations of the syndrome. Among the actions of Losartan&#xD;
      is the prevention of increased levels of TGF beta and its effects on stimulation of&#xD;
      production of extracellular matrix in vascular smooth muscle. This evidence suggests that&#xD;
      agents that alter TGF beta signalling, such as Losartan, might have significant potential to&#xD;
      ameliorate endothelial dysfunction and aortic dilation in MFS. A clinical trial comparing the&#xD;
      effects of Losartan with the current standard treatment regimen (beta blockers) is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultimately, even treated individuals suffer from aortic dilation, so that surgical repair of&#xD;
      the dilated aortic root is definitive in MFS. Elective surgery carries a low mortality and&#xD;
      has significantly improved life expectancy; in contrast, emergency surgery for aortic root&#xD;
      dissection or rupture carries a much higher mortality. Our earlier clinical studies and more&#xD;
      recent work in a Marfan mouse model study suggest that aortic root dilation is a later stage&#xD;
      in the disease process, which has involved cellular mechanisms (perhaps related to TGF beta)&#xD;
      before aortic root dilation occurs. This suggests that, through research, one might enable&#xD;
      clinicians to identify individuals who are in the early stages of vessel dilation and/or who&#xD;
      are at risk for aortic rupture. If we could improve our capacity for early diagnosis of&#xD;
      aortic root dilation, we could intervene in the pre-clinical stages and minimize the&#xD;
      incidence of emergency surgery or sudden death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Towards this goal, our group has developed a novel method of assessing the biophysical&#xD;
      properties of the aorta by standard Echo Doppler techniques and have developed an accurate&#xD;
      measure of PWV, which is considered the most important index of vascular function. In&#xD;
      patients with MFS, we have demonstrated increased pulse wave velocity, reduced&#xD;
      distensibility, increased stiffness in the large central arteries, and endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction-even if the aortic root had not yet dilated (see appended paper).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of these studies, we have also been given access to proprietary GE software to&#xD;
      analyze raw data and have developed a software program that analyses the Doppler pulse flow&#xD;
      and external carotid artery pressure tracing raw data to obtain parameters that previously&#xD;
      required invasive techniques or laborious manual techniques to calculate. Using this new&#xD;
      technique, which is unique to our group and applicable to other conditions that affect the&#xD;
      aorta, we can now measure several key variables of aortic vessel function, including vascular&#xD;
      distensibility, stiffness indices, impedances, total arterial compliance, reflective wave&#xD;
      index, left ventricular work and efficiency. We predict that using this method to make a&#xD;
      comprehensive assessment of aortic vascular (dys)function will provide for early detection of&#xD;
      vascular changes and enable an improved comparison of the effectiveness of pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment of cardiovascular disease in MFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the objective of the proposed research is to use this methodology to compare&#xD;
      aortic vascular function in individuals with MFS under conventional treatment using a beta&#xD;
      blocker (Atenolol) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (Losartan). We propose a randomized,&#xD;
      prospective, double-blinded superiority study to compare the actions of Losartan with&#xD;
      Atenolol on vascular function in a group of 30 patients with MFS. Our research group has the&#xD;
      unique capability to perform an analysis of the vascular effects of these therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Specific Aims are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether 12 months of treatment with Losartan decreases PWV more than 12&#xD;
           months of treatment with Atenolol in a cohort of patients with MFS;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether 12 months of treatment with Losartan will improve indices of&#xD;
           distensibility, stiffness, arterial compliance, impedances and endothelial function more&#xD;
           than 12 months of treatment with Atenolol in the same cohort of patients with MFS;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine whether 12 months of treatment with Losartan slows the progression of&#xD;
           aortic root dilation when compared to 12 months of treatment with Atenolol in the same&#xD;
           cohort of patients with MFS.&#xD;
