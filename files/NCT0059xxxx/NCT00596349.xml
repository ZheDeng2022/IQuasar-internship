  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help us learn more about how women who have had or now have&#xD;
      ovarian cancer are doing 5 years or more from their diagnosis. We want to learn about general&#xD;
      quality of life, long-term side effects of treatment, sexual function, thinking, memory, and&#xD;
      psychological effects (such as anxiety and depression). We will also look at how these women&#xD;
      are being followed for ovarian cancer. We hope this study will help us better understand how&#xD;
      women surviving ovarian cancer are doing.&#xD;
