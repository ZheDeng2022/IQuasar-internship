      The purpose of this study is to take a population of lung transplant recipients who meet UCLA&#xD;
      criteria for induction chemotherapy with thymoglobulin and prospectively study weather giving&#xD;
      the first dose intraoperatively versus postoperatively makes a difference with how patients&#xD;
      do during and after lung transplantation. In addition, these cohorts will be compared to&#xD;
      patients who do not qualify for thymoglobulin and receive either an alternative agent or no&#xD;
      agent. The primary endpoint is primary graft dysfunction. We will also evaluate several other&#xD;
      early and late end points such as ventilator days, ICU/hospital days, acute/chronic&#xD;
      rejection, infection, CT chest abnormalities, and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also collect donor lung tissue and lavage fluid for measurement of various proteins&#xD;
      and receptor expression at two time points: (1) prior to implementation and dosing of&#xD;
      induction chemotherapy and (2) after transplantation (following a course of induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy). This will allow us to possibly make a connection between the profiles of the&#xD;
      various proteins and receptors and the clinical outcomes, depending on weather the patient&#xD;
      has received induction chemotherapy, starting intraoperatively or postoperatively.&#xD;
