  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute pain episodes associated with sickle cell disease (SCD) are very difficult to manage&#xD;
      effectively. Opioid tolerance and side effects have been major roadblocks in our ability to&#xD;
      provide these patients with adequate pain relief. This pilot study is designed to examine the&#xD;
      safety and feasibility of using ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist,&#xD;
      in the inpatient seeing with children and adolescents who have sickle cell vasoocclusive&#xD;
      pain. Previous research suggests that in subanesthetic doses, ketamine may be able to prevent&#xD;
      the development of opiate tolerance and facilitate better pain relief with lower opiate&#xD;
      doses, allowing for less respiratory depression, less sedation, easier ambulation, less&#xD;
      deconditioning, shorter hospital stays, and better quality of life. The goal of this pilot&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of using a continuous infusion of ketamine,&#xD;
      in conjunction with opiates, in the inpatient setting for sickle cell vasoocclusive pain. It&#xD;
      is hypothesized that using a low dose ketamine infusion in conjunction with opiates will be a&#xD;
      safe and feasible practice for the treatment of sickle cell pain.&#xD;

      3.2 Study Design/Type&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria is enrolled up to 24 hours after admission&#xD;
           for a vasoocclusive episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prior to onset of ketamine infusion, the following information is collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Demographic information (age, gender, SCD genotype, past history of SCD-related&#xD;
                complications) [Obtained from the patient's medical chart]&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Opiate utilization/hour since admission [Obtained from the patient's medical chart]&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) scores since admission [Obtained from the patient's&#xD;
                medical chart]&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Sedation score (University of Michigan Sedation Scale) is obtained [By the nursing&#xD;
                staff]&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Body outline figure of the Adolescent Pediatric Pain Tool (validated down to age 7)&#xD;
                is administered [By the research staff]&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Ketamine Effects Scale (KES) is administered to the patient [By the research staff]&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ketamine infusion is begun at 0.05 mg/kg/hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. After infusion is initiated:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Vital signs are taken every hour for two hours after infusion begins, then after&#xD;
                two hours, then every four hours for the remainder of the hospitalization&#xD;
                [Completed by the nursing staff]&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Pain scores are recorded with vital signs if the patient is awake [Completed by&#xD;
                nursing staff]&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Patient is also asked if pain is a lot better, a little better, no change, a little&#xD;
                worse, or a lot worse than previous assessment [Completed by nursing staff]&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Sedation score (University of Michigan Sedation Scale) assessed with pain score&#xD;
                [Completed by the nursing staff]&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Adolescent Pediatric Pain Tool (APPT) body outline figure is completed by the&#xD;
                patient once per day between 3 pm and 5 pm. [Administered by the research staff]&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Ketamine Effects Scale (KES) is administered to the patient once per day between&#xD;
                3pm and 5pm [By the research staff]&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Patient is monitored for side effects including dreams, disorientation, dysphoria,&#xD;
                agitation, CNS depression, respiratory depression, increasing hypoxia, nausea, or&#xD;
                vomiting [Completed by the nursing or research staff]&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Need for supplemental oxygen is recorded (oxygen saturation &lt;95%) [Completed by&#xD;
                nursing staff]&#xD;
&#xD;
             9. Opiate use and NSAID use/6 hours is recorded [Completed by the nursing or research&#xD;
                staff]&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The infusion may be discontinued or decreased at any time due to unacceptable side&#xD;
           effects as determined by the clinician, patient, parent, or principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Agents designed to reduce ketamine side effects [midazolam (Versed), clonidine,&#xD;
           lorazepam (Ativan), or diazepam (Valium)] may be administered at the discretion of the&#xD;
           attending physician or the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. 4 hours or more after infusion begins, the infusion rate may be increased to 0.1&#xD;
           mg/kg/hour if the following parameters are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. patient's pain has not improved to an acceptable range (pain score is still â‰¥5)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. side effects remain acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. 4 hours or more after the previous increase the ketamine infusion may be increased to&#xD;
           0.15 mg/kg/hour per parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. 4 hours of more after the previous increase the ketamine infusion may be increased to&#xD;
           0.2 mg/kg/hour per parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. The ketamine infusion will be discontinued at the time of transition to oral pain&#xD;
           medication, or no more than 72 hours after initiation, or at the request of the&#xD;
           clinician, patient, parent, or principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Pain scores, vital signs, sedation score, opiate use, APPT body outline figure, and KES&#xD;
           score will be recorded as above for the remainder of the hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Total length of hospitalization will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Patient will be contacted on a weekly basis for 4 weeks following hospitalization for&#xD;
           review of potential side effects, pain episodes, or events leading to re-admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. The patient's medical record will be reviewed to determine duration of previous&#xD;
           hospitalizations for SCD pain in the previous 24 months and opiate utilization, pain&#xD;
           scores, and transition to oral opiates during those hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be conducted as a pilot study; patients will not be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Duration&#xD;
&#xD;
      The length of the patient's participation in this study is the duration of their&#xD;
      hospitalization, as well as 4 weeks worth of follow-up phone calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5 Discontinuation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual patients will stop receiving ketamine if they develop acute chest syndrome (ACS),&#xD;
      have a stroke, are transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), if their hemoglobin falls&#xD;
      below 5 mg/dl, if they experience unacceptable side effects, or at the request of the PI,&#xD;
      attending, patient, or parent. However, they will continue to be in the study and all data&#xD;
      will be collected throughout the duration of their hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire trial will be terminated when 20 patients have completed the protocol, or if there&#xD;
      is an unexpected rate of acute chest syndrome or admissions to the pediatric intensive care&#xD;
      unit (PICU).&#xD;
