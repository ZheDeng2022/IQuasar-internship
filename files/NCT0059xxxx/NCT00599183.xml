  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-iniated pilot study to determine if MRI with diffusion tensor imaging&#xD;
      (DTI) and tractography will yield useful information in patients suspected of having cervical&#xD;
      spine disc herniation to provide imaging confirmation of whether or not disease is&#xD;
      progressing and to assess response to treatment (regardless of treatment provided).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Conventional MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is used to confirm disc herniation of the&#xD;
      cervical spine. Symptoms of the condition can change before they can be seen by conventional&#xD;
      MR images. Therefore, very little gross change can be seen by conventional MRI even after 6&#xD;
      weeks of treatment, either medical or surgical. This study will investigate whether newer MRI&#xD;
      techniques, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography, are useful in demonstrating&#xD;
      gross changes or assessing response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting patients referred for clinically indicated cervical spine MRI by their treating&#xD;
      physicians to confirm cervical disc herniation will receive an additional MRI sequence,&#xD;
      diffusion tensor imaging. This will provide a baseline. The DTI sequence will add five&#xD;
      minutes to the procedure. Participants will return at 6 weeks for a follow up MRI of the&#xD;
      cervical spine to include DTI and tractography. Participants will be asked to complete an&#xD;
      anonymized questionnaire at enrollment and at follow up to provide information regarding&#xD;
      their condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI is a non-invasive diagnostic study of minimal risk which uses magnets instead of ionizing&#xD;
      radiation to acquire images. The images are then assembled by computer. Diffusion tensor&#xD;
      imaging (DTI) uses water diffusion to visualize structures in the brain and nervous system.&#xD;
      Tractography is performed using DTI and computer post-processing to track the fiber bundles&#xD;
      which exist in the brain and spinal cord and visualize them as two and three dimensional&#xD;
      images. Both techniques allow radiologists to detect abnormalities, in this case, cervical&#xD;
      spine disc herniation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow up studies will be compared to the baseline studies to determine which&#xD;
      demonstrates the highest sensitivity and specificity in identifying cervical spine&#xD;
      abnormalities in general and cervical spine herniation in particular.&#xD;
