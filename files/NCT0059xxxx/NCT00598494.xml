    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research sub-study is to determine the changes in heart function during&#xD;
      the bedrest period using ultrasound and MRI. This topic is important for medical care of&#xD;
      astronauts in space. It can enable physicians on the ground to monitor exercise protocols&#xD;
      that are used to prevent deconditioning-loss of strength during long space flights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation in this study would include ultrasound examinations with bicycle exercise&#xD;
      before, during, and after the 12-week bedrest period. MRI exams would be performed before and&#xD;
      after the bedrest period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each echo exam may last up to 1 hour. This time will be required to perform an ultrasound&#xD;
      examination before and during supine (lying down) bicycle exercise. The exercise period will&#xD;
      be approximately 10-15 minutes. The bicycle exercise will be a symptom-limited test. This&#xD;
      means that the test will be stopped if you experience any discomfort. An ultrasound&#xD;
      examination of your heart will be done to assess heart function. You will be asked to lie on&#xD;
      your left side on an examination table while a technician takes pictures of your heart with a&#xD;
      small probe that is gently pressed against your chest after applying a gel. The ultrasound&#xD;
      data will be processed to evaluate myocardial strain, a value that may be useful in&#xD;
      describing heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each MRI may last up to 1 hour. An MRI obtains body pictures created by using magnetic energy&#xD;
      rather than x-ray energy. To have the scan, you will lie on a table that slides into the&#xD;
      scanner, which is like a large tube. An MRI examination of your heart will be done to assess&#xD;
      heart function. You will be asked to lie still and follow simple breathing instructions&#xD;
      during the procedure. The MRI data will be processed to evaluate the volume of blood being&#xD;
      pumped by your heart, a value that may be useful in describing heart function.&#xD;

      NASA and NSBRI are making considerable investment in a bedrest study being conducted at the&#xD;
      Cleveland Clinic Foundation under the directorship of Peter Cavanaugh, primarily to assess&#xD;
      the impact of exercise on prevention of osteoporosis in a twelve-week bedrest study to&#xD;
      simulate microgravity. This provides an outstanding opportunity for synergistic add-on&#xD;
      studies to combine the resources of the bone team of NSBRI with those of the Cardiovascular&#xD;
      Alterations and Smart Medicine by conducting a series of detailed echocardiographic and&#xD;
      computed tomographic examinations of the heart in these patients. These studies will serve to&#xD;
      advance a number of the specific aims of a grant currently held by James D. Thomas from NSBRI&#xD;
      concerning both the primary effects of microgravity on the heart and its reversal with&#xD;
      exercise as well as the ability to prove out new echocardiographic methods for measuring the&#xD;
      cardiac response to exercise. Finally, they will provide an excellent opportunity to prove&#xD;
      out methodologies being developed for remote delivery of healthcare by image fusion from&#xD;
      free-flight studies to in-flight echoes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will to pursue the following specific aims with this synergistic study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To assess the impact of bedrest on cardiac atrophy, stiffening of the left&#xD;
      ventricular diastolic pressure volume curve, and exercise tolerance and ventricular mechanics&#xD;
      and demonstrate at least partial prevention of these changes with the proposed exercise&#xD;
      prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To demonstrate the ability of novel echocardiographic indices of ventricular&#xD;
      function (strain, torsion, IVPG) to predict functional capacity and response to exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To test whether pre-bedrest MRI examinations could be co-registered with&#xD;
      bedrest 3D echocardiographic exams to track atrophy and altered cardiac anatomy. The ability&#xD;
      of detailed 3D ground examinations to be compared precisely with in-flight 3D echos is a key&#xD;
      goal of autonomous medical care system for expedition class missions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed Protocol (summary):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-bedrest (within 1-3 weeks prior):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Resting two and three-dimensional echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Maximal supine bicycle test with echocardiographic assessment of wall motion, tissue&#xD;
           strain, tissue torsion, and intraventricular pressure gradients (IVPG) by color M-mode&#xD;
           flow propagation. In addition to the peak exercise assessment, we will also focus on the&#xD;
           submaximal level (heart rate ~100).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. MRI examination of the heart for LV volume and mass and subsequent cross registration&#xD;
           with echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six weeks of bedrest:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Resting two and three-dimensional echo exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Low-level supine bicycle exercise echo (HR no greater than 100) with torsion, strain,&#xD;
           and IVPG assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve weeks of bedrest:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Resting two and three-dimensional echo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Maximal supine bicycle test with echocardiographic assessment of wall motion, tissue&#xD;
           strain, tissue torsion, and IVPG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. MRI examination of the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the overall bedrest protocol (IRB 6504), patients will be randomized either to&#xD;
      complete bedrest with negative tilt vs. those who will undergo daily horizontal treadmill&#xD;
      exercise to replace the calcaneus impact measured pre-bedrest in the same subjects. This&#xD;
      provides an excellent opportunity for assessing the impact of this degree in type of exercise&#xD;
      on the cardiovascular system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this synergistic study will be answered as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To assess the impact of bedrest on cardiac atrophy, stiffening of the left&#xD;
      ventricular diastolic pressure volume curve, and exercise tolerance and ventricular mechanics&#xD;
      and demonstrate at least partial prevention of these changes with the proposed exercise&#xD;
      prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LV mass will be measured by MRI pre- and post-bedrest and by 3D echo at bedrest stages.&#xD;
      Two-way linear regression will be used to determine change over time in LV mass and to&#xD;
      compare the response to exercise. Similarly, exercise capacity will be analyzed. Among the LV&#xD;
      mechanics parameters that will be available for analysis at all 3 data acquisition points&#xD;
      are: (resting) LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volume, left atrial volume, transmitral E&#xD;
      and A waves and E-wave deceleration time, Doppler tissue annular E, A, and S waves, radial,&#xD;
      circumferential, and longitudinal strain at the midventricular level, LV torsion and peak&#xD;
      untwisting rate, and color M-mode IVPG. These same parameters will also be available for&#xD;
      analysis during low-level (HR 100) bicycle exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To demonstrate the ability of novel echocardiographic indices of ventricular&#xD;
      function at rest (strain, torsion, IVPG) to predict functional capacity and response to&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strain, torsion, and IVPG will be assessed at all stages and correlated with changes in&#xD;
      cardiac atrophy parameters (LV mass and volumes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To test whether pre/post bedrest MRI examinations can be co-registered with&#xD;
      bedrest 3D echocardiographic exams to track atrophy and altered cardiac anatomy. The ability&#xD;
      of detailed 3D ground examinations to be compared precisely with in-flight 3D echos is a key&#xD;
      goal of autonomous medical care system for expedition class missions.&#xD;
