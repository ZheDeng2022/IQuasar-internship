      Although the best treatment choice for chronic hepatitis B is not clarified yet, certain&#xD;
      therapeutic concepts could be derived from the experience of treating patients with chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A major advancement in treating&#xD;
      hepatitis C or HIV infection has been the development of combination therapy. Whether the&#xD;
      combination therapy using Peg-IFN alfa-2a plus ETV can achieve a long-term beneficial effect&#xD;
      against ETV alone is not clarified. A prior single-arm pilot study suggested that similar&#xD;
      combination therapy may be beneficial in patients with chronic hepatitis B. In this proposal,&#xD;
      we thus hypothesize that the efficacy by using combination therapy with pegylated IFN alfa-2a&#xD;
      plus ETV is superior to that by using ETV alone in that Peg-IFN may restore host immunity&#xD;
      against HBV and prolonged ETV can maximize viral suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of&#xD;
      Peg-IFN alfa-2a at a dose of 180 mcg administered subcutaneously per week and ETV 0.5 mg&#xD;
      daily for 24 weeks followed by ETV 0.5 mg daily monotherapy for an additional 120 weeks&#xD;
      versus ETV 0.5 mg daily monotherapy for 144 weeks in patients with HBeAg-positive chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis B. It will be an open-label, randomized, comparative, multi-center clinical trial.&#xD;
      The recruited patients will be equally randomized into two treatment groups. Treatment-free&#xD;
      follow-up period will be 48 weeks in both groups of patients. All subjects will be assessed&#xD;
      for loss of HBeAg, presence of anti-HBe, loss of HBsAg, presence of anti-HBs, suppression of&#xD;
      HBV DNA, and normalization of serum ALT at the end of treatment and end of follow-up.&#xD;
      Genotypic and virologic resistance to ETV will also be assessed at baseline and at end of&#xD;
      years 1, 2 and 3. The primary efficacy will be HBeAg seroconversion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there are several antiviral treatments effective for suppression of viral&#xD;
      replication but still failed to cure HBV infection in patients with chronic hepatitis B. The&#xD;
      short-term treatment goals are thus to control hepatitis activity, to obtain hepatitis B e&#xD;
      antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion, and to improve necroinflammatory activity and fibrosis of the&#xD;
      liver. Six drugs have been worldwide approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B at&#xD;
      present: conventional IFN (IFN) alfa, lamivudine (LAM), adefovir dipivoxil (ADV), pegylated&#xD;
      IFN (Peg-IFN) alfa, entecavir (ETV) and recently telbivudine (LdT). Conventional IFN alfa&#xD;
      monotherapy has a narrow range of efficacy, is associated with several adverse effects and is&#xD;
      inconvenient because of frequent injections. Lamivudine is better tolerated; but virologic&#xD;
      response to lamivudine is frequently not durable and prolonged lamivudine treatment is&#xD;
      commonly associated with the emergence of drug-resistant HBV mutants. Adefovir dipivoxil is&#xD;
      effective and has been approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in many countries,&#xD;
      but is nephrotoxic at doses higher than 10 mg per day for long time. Pegylated IFN alfa has&#xD;
      been shown to be superior to conventional IFN alfa and lamivudine, and has already been&#xD;
      approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. Overall, satisfactory virologic and&#xD;
      serologic responses could be achieved using pegylated IFN alfa alone in around 30-44% of&#xD;
      these patients. Entecavir, a carbocyclic deoxyguanosine analog, which is active against both&#xD;
      lamivudine- and adefovir dipivoxil-naïve and -resistant HBV, is the most potent anti-HBV&#xD;
      agent ever discovered. In addition, the 4-year drug resistance rate is &lt;1.0% in selected&#xD;
      lamivudine-naïve patients. LdT is another thymidine nucleoside analogue with potent in vitro&#xD;
      activity against HBV and approved for CHB. Recent phase III GLOBE trials have proved this&#xD;
      agent to be more effective in the treatment of HBeAg+ve and -ve chronic hepatitis B than&#xD;
      lamivudine. However, resistance to telbivudine was noted in around 10% of subjects after&#xD;
      104-week continuous therapy, although still fewer than that in patients receiving lamivudine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the best treatment choice for chronic hepatitis B is not clarified yet, certain&#xD;
      therapeutic concepts could be derived from the experience of treating patients with chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A major advancement in treating&#xD;
      hepatitis C or HIV infection has been the development of combination therapy. Whether the&#xD;
      combination therapy using Peg-IFN alfa-2a plus ETV can achieve a long-term beneficial effect&#xD;
      against ETV alone is not clarified. A prior single-arm pilot study suggested that similar&#xD;

      we thus hypothesize that the efficacy by using combination therapy with pegylated IFN alfa-2a&#xD;
      plus ETV is superior to that by using ETV alone in that Peg-IFN may restore host immunity&#xD;
      against HBV and prolonged ETV can maximize viral suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of&#xD;
      Peg-IFN alfa-2a at a dose of 180 mcg administered subcutaneously per week and ETV 0.5 mg&#xD;
      daily for 24 weeks followed by ETV 0.5 mg daily monotherapy for an additional 120 weeks&#xD;
      versus ETV 0.5 mg daily monotherapy for 144 weeks in patients with HBeAg-positive chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis B. It will be an open-label, randomized, comparative, multi-center clinical trial.&#xD;
      The recruited patients will be equally randomized into two treatment groups. Treatment-free&#xD;
      follow-up period will be 48 weeks in both groups of patients. All subjects will be assessed&#xD;
      for loss of HBeAg, presence of anti-HBe, loss of HBsAg, presence of anti-HBs, suppression of&#xD;
      HBV DNA, and normalization of serum ALT at the end of treatment and end of follow-up.&#xD;
      Genotypic and virologic resistance to ETV will also be assessed at baseline and at end of&#xD;
      years 1, 2 and 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate the rate of HBeAg seroconversion, primary efficacy parameter, to be around 35%&#xD;
      at the end of 3-year entecavir therapy, but decreases to be 30% at the end of 24-week&#xD;
      post-treatment follow-up. We also anticipate that by combining Pegasys, the rate of&#xD;
      seroconversion at the end of treatment is 50% and at the end of 24-week post-treatment&#xD;
      follow-up could be 45%. With a 5% nominal significance level (one-sided), 128 patients per&#xD;
      group under a 1:1 ratio (a total of 256 patients) will provide 80% power to detect a&#xD;
      difference of 15% in treatment response rates between group I and II. Because this will be a&#xD;
      4-year study for each patient, we thus anticipate that the dropout rate may be as high as&#xD;
      15%. Accordingly, a total of 294 patients will be recruited, in order to account for a&#xD;
      dropout rate of up to 15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A final analysis will be conducted when all patients have completed 144-week treatment and 48&#xD;
      weeks of follow-up. Primary and secondary efficacy parameters will be evaluated by an&#xD;
      intention-to-treat analysis. Exact (1-sided) 95%-confidence interval from the binomial&#xD;
      distribution will be provided for response rates in individual patient groups. All&#xD;
      categorical and continuous variables will be analyzed by chi-square test and Student t test,&#xD;
      respectively. For continuous variables with outliers, nonparametric test will be used&#xD;
      instead. The analysis of histologic response will include only those who receive the pre- and&#xD;
      post-treatment biopsy.&#xD;
