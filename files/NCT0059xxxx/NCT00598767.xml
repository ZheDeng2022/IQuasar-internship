      NASA has outlined the most urgent threats to life and health in manned spaceflight. One of&#xD;
      the threats is the risk of trauma and acute medical problems. One of the most important&#xD;
      provisions of acute and chronic medical services in space is the availability of high quality&#xD;
      diagnostic imaging with the potential for either ground based or onsite interpretation. The&#xD;
      principle diagnostic imaging modality for space crew use in space will be ultrasound. The aim&#xD;
      of the study is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To use state of the art 3 dimensional CT scanner to acquire images for segmentation and&#xD;
      registration supplying a template to judge physiologic or pathologic changes observed in&#xD;
      space with 3D ultrasound&#xD;

      In its Bioastronautics Critical Path Roadmap Baseline Document, NASA has outlined the most&#xD;
      urgent threats to life and health in manned spaceflight currently in need of countermeasures&#xD;
      development. This proposal specifically addresses one of four critical risks directly, that&#xD;
      being the risk of trauma and acute medical problems, ID# 43 in the Clinical Capabilities&#xD;
      discipline area. Critical for the provision of acute and chronic medical services in space is&#xD;
      the availability of high quality diagnostic imaging, with either ground-based or autonomous&#xD;
      interpretation. While development of novel sensor technology is actively pursued within the&#xD;
      NSBRI, it is clear that for the foreseeable future, the principal diagnostic imaging modality&#xD;
      for crew use in space will be ultrasound. For the past six years, the Cleveland Clinic has&#xD;
      worked with NASA and NSBRI in a comprehensive program to develop ultrasonographic&#xD;
      capabilities for use in manned space flight. Recent work has focused on enhancement of these&#xD;
      capabilities, including 3D imaging and novel compression and registration techniques for&#xD;
      assessing change over time in ultrasonic images. We now propose to extend these capabilities&#xD;
      in very significant ways, capitalizing on dramatic recent advances in telecommunications and&#xD;
      computerization to better address the critical countermeasures identified. Among the&#xD;
      convergent trends in ultrasound that we seek to capitalize on are the following: most&#xD;
      commonly applied diagnostic imaging test; Miniaturization; file storage; telemedicine;&#xD;
      wireless telemetry; therapeutic use; real-time 3D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to extend our work with the following Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Extension of our longstanding research in 3D ultrasound with a recently developed third&#xD;
           generation machine small enough to fit on the ISS, allowing more comprehensive imaging&#xD;
           to be done with less operator expertise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Utilization of a ultrafast 3D CT scanner to acquire full body 3D images for segmentation&#xD;
           and registration with subsequently acquired 3D ultrasound images, modelling future&#xD;
           missions for ground-based 3D CT or MRI could provide a template to judge physiologic or&#xD;
           pathologic changes observed in space with 3D ultrasound.&#xD;
