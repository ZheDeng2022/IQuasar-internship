    <measure>Change From Baseline Mean Diurnal Intraocular Pressure (IOP) in the Study Eye on Day 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured using a Goldmann applanation tonometer. Diurnal IOP, defined as the mean IOP over the day based on values obtained at 8 AM, 10 AM, 1 PM, and 4 PM, was calculated for each visit. Both eyes were tested, with the right eye preceding the left eye. The operator initially set the dial at 10 mmHg, then looked through the slit lamp and adjusted the dial to take the reading, and then recorded the results. The procedure was repeated on the same eye twice consecutively. If the measurements were within 2 mmHg or less of each other, the mean of the 2 readings was recorded as the IOP at that time point. If the 2 readings were more than 2 mmHg of each other, a third (consecutive) reading was taken and the median (middle) IOP was recorded as the IOP at that time point.</description>

    <description>Percentage of participants with IOP of 18 mmHg or Lower, 16 mmHg or Lower, or 14 mmHg or Lower at Any Visit Through Day 28. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured using a Goldmann applanation tonometer. Both eyes were tested, with the right eye preceding the left eye.

        <title>Change From Baseline Mean Diurnal Intraocular Pressure (IOP) in the Study Eye on Day 28</title>
        <description>Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured using a Goldmann applanation tonometer. Diurnal IOP, defined as the mean IOP over the day based on values obtained at 8 AM, 10 AM, 1 PM, and 4 PM, was calculated for each visit. Both eyes were tested, with the right eye preceding the left eye. The operator initially set the dial at 10 mmHg, then looked through the slit lamp and adjusted the dial to take the reading, and then recorded the results. The procedure was repeated on the same eye twice consecutively. If the measurements were within 2 mmHg or less of each other, the mean of the 2 readings was recorded as the IOP at that time point. If the 2 readings were more than 2 mmHg of each other, a third (consecutive) reading was taken and the median (middle) IOP was recorded as the IOP at that time point.</description>
