  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study. The goal of this study is to test whether Bevacizumab is safe enough&#xD;
      in patients with brain tumors so that a larger study can be conducted. This study will also&#xD;
      give us some information about whether the combination of Bevacizumab and radiation has&#xD;
      potential to become an effective treatment for regrowing brain tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab is an experimental drug that blocks a molecule called VEGF that is found in high&#xD;
      amounts in malignant gliomas. VEGF promotes the growth of blood vessels that bring nutrients&#xD;
      to tumor cells. In studies with laboratory animals, Bevacizumab slowed the growth of several&#xD;
      different types of human cancer cells by blocking the effects of VEGF. There is also evidence&#xD;
      that Bevacizumab enhances the effects of radiation on tumor cell&#xD;

             equal to 3.5cm. (Scan must be performed on a steroid dosage that has been stable for&#xD;
             at least 5 days. If the steroid dose is increased between date of imaging and&#xD;
             registration, a new baseline MRI is required).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  An interval of &gt; than or equal to 1 week (7 days) from any non-cytotoxic agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An interval of &gt; than or equal to 6 weeks (42 days) from the completion of radiation&#xD;
