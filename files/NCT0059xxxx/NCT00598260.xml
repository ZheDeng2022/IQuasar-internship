  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized cohort study of obstetric patients from Paley clinic at AEMC&#xD;
      and from other affiliated obstetric clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will try to determine if active management of risks in pregnancy at term by&#xD;
      inducing patients will not decrease the cesarean delivery rate or change neonatal outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes that will be measured include cesarean delivery rate, meconium, Apgar scores and&#xD;
      admissions to the NICU.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include patients who have their prenatal care at the Paley clinic in AEMC,&#xD;
      where the residents provide the prenatal care with supervision of OBGYN attending physicians,&#xD;
      or at other affiliated clinics that are staffed by care givers from our OBGYN department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients at our obstetric clinics are scheduled for weekly visits starting at 36 weeks. At 36&#xD;
      to 37 weeks of gestation, or earlier, each patient will be offered to participate in the&#xD;
      study. Those who refuse will continue to have the standard care and will not be considered as&#xD;
      part of the study. Those who wish to participate in the study will be consented and will then&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to the control group or to the AMOR-IPAT group with a ratio of 2:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factors will be identified for each patient participating in the study at the&#xD;
      gestational age of 36 to 37 weeks (using the digichart system, the medical records and&#xD;
      questioners) and the upper limit of the optimal time of delivery will be calculated for each&#xD;
      patient, according to the method used by the UPenn group, with the time always being at least&#xD;
      38 weeks and no more then 41 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients from the AMOR-IPAT group will be scheduled for induction of labor on the morning of&#xD;
      the day of the calculated upper limit (plus or minus 2 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To try and eliminate biases, a uniform method of induction will be applied to all the&#xD;
      patients participating in the study, no matter the group or the reason for the induction. The&#xD;
      induction will be performed with misoprostol 25mcg intravaginally every four hours (to a&#xD;
      maximum of three doses) for a Bishop score of 4 or less and as long as there is no&#xD;
      tachysystole which will be defined as six or more uterine contractions in ten minutes in&#xD;
      consecutive ten minute intervals. The misoprostol will be followed by a foley bulb inflated&#xD;
      with 80 cc of fluid if the cervix is still not favorable after three doses or when&#xD;
      tachysystole develops. Once the cervix is favorable induction will be continued with high&#xD;
      dose oxytocin (starting dose of six milliunits with increments of four milliunits every&#xD;
      thirty minutes), which is associated with less cesarean deliveries for dystocia than the low&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia will be applied according to the patient's wish, without limiting epidural&#xD;
      anesthesia to a certain degree of dilatation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After delivery information will be collected from the charts and the two groups will be&#xD;
      compared regarding the incidence of cesarean deliveries, but also regarding intrapartum&#xD;
      variables and major outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Student t test and the Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to compare continuous&#xD;
      demographic characteristics, past medical and surgical historic features and obstetric risk&#xD;
      factors that will be present in the two study groups. Universal chi squared tests will be&#xD;
      used to compare levels of various dichotomous variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical significance is defined as a probability value of less than 0.05. Using a power&#xD;
      analysis and by assuming a cesarean delivery rate of 20% in the control group and a change of&#xD;
      13% (as shown in the original study) we will need 191 patients in the control group and 96 in&#xD;
      the study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be collected by staff of the OBGYN department and maintained on departmental&#xD;
      secured password limited database. Obstetrical prenatal data is maintained on HIPPA compliant&#xD;
      password protected electronic medical records.&#xD;
