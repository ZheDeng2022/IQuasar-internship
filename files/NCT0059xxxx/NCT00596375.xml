      In Emergency Departments (ED) across the nation there is renewed interest in finding ways to&#xD;
      alleviate the pain and discomfort associated with many of the procedures that children must&#xD;
      undergo. In a policy by the American Academy of Pediatrics, a nationally recognized advocate&#xD;
      for children, physicians are urged to advocate for child-specific research in pain management&#xD;
      and the effective use of pain medication to ensure compassionate and competent management of&#xD;
      pain. (AAP Statement, 2001) Pediatric urethral catheterizations are one such procedure in&#xD;
      which children experience significant pain.(11) In present care, children over 2 months of&#xD;
      age do not routinely receive intervention for urethral catheterization related anxiety and&#xD;
      pain, and, anecdotal reports suggest that most require physical restraint to complete the&#xD;
      procedure. Lidocaine is an anesthetic agent that provides relief from pain during many&#xD;
      commonly performed ED procedures. Intraurethral Lidocaine has been shown to decrease pain&#xD;
      associated with urethral catheter placement in cystograms, however, Lidocaine is not&#xD;
      routinely used for urethral catheterizations in the CHOA ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate the potential use of Lidocaine as an anesthetic agent during&#xD;
      urethral catheterization of children. Recently, two specific studies were performed&#xD;
      investigating the use of Lidocaine to decrease discomfort associated with urethral&#xD;
      catheterization. Using the strengths of both previously published studies, our study will use&#xD;
      Lidocaine both topically and instilled into the urethra. Investigators plan to perform a&#xD;
      prospective three-arm double-blinded randomized clinical trial investigating the&#xD;
      effectiveness of Lidocaine jelly as a analgesic when used as a lubricant for urinary&#xD;
      catheterization. Investigators aim to demonstrate that Lidocaine used as a lubricant&#xD;
      anesthetic for urethral catheterization will provide a safe, time-efficient, and relatively&#xD;
      easy way to decrease pediatric pain in the emergency department setting.&#xD;

      In Emergency Departments (ED) across the nation there is renewed interest in finding ways to&#xD;
      alleviate the pain and discomfort associated with many of the procedures that children must&#xD;
      undergo. Children's memory and reaction to negative experiences in the care of medical&#xD;
      professionals has led to many changes in procedural pain management (4). One noxious&#xD;
      procedure that continues to be performed in the ED without the use of anesthetic agents is&#xD;
      urethral catheterization (11). In a policy by the American Academy of Pediatrics, a&#xD;
      nationally recognized advocate for children, physicians are urged to advocate for&#xD;
      child-specific research in pain management and the effective use of pain medication to ensure&#xD;
      compassionate and competent management of pain. (AAP Statement, 2001)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric urethral catheterizations are one such procedure in which children experience&#xD;
      significant pain. (11) The Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA) ED at Egleston performs an&#xD;
      average of greater than 150 pediatric urethral catheterizations per month. This procedure is&#xD;
      performed in most cases where children under 6 months of age present with unexplained fever.&#xD;
      Also, divisional guidelines call for urethral catheterization for urinanalysis and urine&#xD;
      culture on all uncircumcised boys under the age of 1 and all girls under the age of 2 who&#xD;
      present with unexplained temperature above 39.5 degrees. In a previous Friends funded&#xD;
      clinical trial, ED investigators studied sucrose use in children under 2 months of age which&#xD;
      was shown to decrease urethral catheterization discomfort. As such, this has become routine&#xD;
      care in the ED. (REF; for a review of sucrose for pediatric pain, see 6) In present care,&#xD;
      children over 2 months of age do not routinely receive intervention for urethral&#xD;
      catheterization related anxiety and pain, and, anecdotal reports suggest that most require&#xD;
      physical restraint to complete the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lidocaine is an anesthetic agent that provides relief from pain during many commonly&#xD;
      performed ED procedures. Examples of present Lidocaine use in the ED are laceration repair,&#xD;
      abscess drainage, and lumbar puncture. Given the anxiety, discomfort, and pain associated&#xD;
      with urethral catheterizations (1, 2, 3, 4), Lidocaine has begun to be used clinically in&#xD;
      this arena. Intraurethral Lidocaine has been shown to decrease pain associated with urethral&#xD;
      catheter placement in cystograms, however, Lidocaine is not routinely used for catheter&#xD;
      placement to obtain urine in the CHOA ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, two specific studies were performed investigating the use of Lidocaine to decrease&#xD;
      discomfort associated with urethral catheterization. The first published study supports the&#xD;
      use of intraurethral Lidocaine for catheterization.(5) In this investigation, Lidocaine was&#xD;
      repeatedly instilled into the urethra of ten 4- to 11-year-old patients for approximately 10&#xD;
      minutes prior to a scheduled cystogram. Patients in this study indicated significantly less&#xD;
      pain with Lidocaine as a lubricant when compared to those who received sterile lubricant&#xD;
      jelly. However, the placement of a catheter for cystogram requires the catheter to be in&#xD;
      place for the duration of the procedure (10 to 15 minutes); whereas catheterization in the ED&#xD;
      for urinalysis and urine culture requires catheter placement for a much shorter period of&#xD;
      time. The second study, which compared Lidocaine to lubricant jelly used as a topical&#xD;
      anesthetic prior to catheterization, found that preverbal patients experienced the same&#xD;
      discomfort with or without Lidocaine when evaluated using&#xD;
      Face-Legs-Activity-Cry-Consolability (FLACC) scoring.(11) Authors attempted to investigate&#xD;
      Lidocaine topically placed at the urethral meatus to provide relief. Although the&#xD;
      investigators did not achieve their goal of pain reduction using Lidocaine topically, they&#xD;
      did find that the incidence of positive urine culture was similar in both the Lidocaine and&#xD;
      placebo groups. Using the strengths of both previously published studies, our study will use&#xD;
      Lidocaine both topically and instilled into the urethra.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical care professionals are increasing their attention to pain and comfort measures for&#xD;
      children undergoing painful procedures in the ED. Pediatric urethral catheterization is one&#xD;
      such area that remains unaddressed. The use of Lidocaine as an anesthetic in common ED&#xD;
      procedures is well known. Investigation of Lidocaine use as an anesthetic lubricant has been&#xD;
      reported twice previously in pediatric literature with contradicting results. After critical&#xD;
      appraisal of these studies, our investigators conclude that additional investigation is&#xD;
      warranted with the following characteristics: Lidocaine should be placed both topically and&#xD;
      instilled into the urethra; Lidocaine should be compared to both routine care and placebo;&#xD;
      methodology should include blinded observations; methodology should evaluate pain response&#xD;
      utilizing numerous validated tools; and urine should be monitored to evaluate the biological&#xD;
      effects of Lidocaine on urine culture results. Investigators aim to demonstrate that&#xD;
      Lidocaine used as a lubricant anesthetic for urethral catheterization will provide a safe,&#xD;
      time-efficient, and relatively easy way to decrease pediatric pain in the emergency&#xD;
      department setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims &amp; Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA1: To study the potential use of Lidocaine as an anesthetic agent during urethral&#xD;
      catheterization of children presenting to Pediatric Emergency Department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: The use of Lidocaine jelly as a lubricant in urethral catheterizations in pediatric ED&#xD;
      patients significantly decreases distress associated with this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA2: To determine the average Lidocaine concentration present in urine obtained with&#xD;
      Lidocaine jelly used as lubricant during urinary catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: Urine Lidocaine concentrations associated with routine urethral catheterization utilizing&#xD;
      intraurethral Lidocaine installation will not approach known bacterial growth-limiting&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
