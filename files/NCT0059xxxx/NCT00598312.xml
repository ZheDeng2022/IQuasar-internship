    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of Leuprolide Acetate for&#xD;
      Injectable Suspension 22.5 mg in reducing serum testosterone to castrate levels in patients&#xD;
      with prostate cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, multi-center study in which a minimum of 165 patients will&#xD;
      receive one (1) of three (3) lots of Oakwood Laboratories' Leuprolide Acetate for Injectable&#xD;
      Suspension 22.5 mg for two cycles. A subset of patients (minimum of 12) will be assigned to&#xD;
      each lot (A, B or C) and will have additional blood sampling to characterize leuprolide&#xD;
      release kinetics for each dose administered.&#xD;
