      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this prospective natural history study on neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) study, we hope&#xD;
      to understand the factors leading to tumor progression and neurological disease burden in&#xD;
      NF2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 269 participants, ages 8-75, with a clinical or genetic diagnosis of NF2 will&#xD;
      participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be evaluated with a thorough physical and neurologic examination upon&#xD;
      enrollment. This initial outpatient evaluation will include magnetic resonance imaging with&#xD;
      contrast of brain and spine and blood collection for research use. Participants with&#xD;
      measurable hearing will have audiology assessment performed during the initial visit.&#xD;
      Participants with untreated vestibular schwannomas will have vestibular assessment performed&#xD;
      during the initial visit. Genetic studies performed outside will be acceptable as&#xD;
      confirmation of NF2 in enrolled patients. If needed to confirm NF2 with genetic studies, or&#xD;
      for research purpose, whole genome/whole exome sequencing may be performed on blood obtained&#xD;
      from subjects enrolled in this study. All participants will be evaluated by a speech language&#xD;
      pathologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed as outpatients for up to ten years, during which clinical, and&#xD;
      radiologic evaluation will be performed annually. Auditory testing will be performed annually&#xD;
      for participants with measurable hearing. Participants with initially untreated vestibular&#xD;
      schwannomas will be followed annually with vestibular testing. Speech and swallowing&#xD;
      reassessments will be repeated if worsening of speech or swallowing is reported. Blood will&#xD;
      be collected at each visit for blood biomarker testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope to understand the biologic basis for speech and swallowing dysfunction in patients&#xD;
      with NF2. We will study and report the strength of association of MRI findings, clinical&#xD;
      assessments cranial nerve deficits and speech/swallowing dysfunction. We hope to&#xD;
&#xD;
      identify imaging biomarkers of hearing loss in NF2. We will attempt to discover the mode of&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy in patients with NF2. Lastly, we will attempt to discover previously&#xD;
      unknown serum biomarkers associated with high tumor burden in NF2.&#xD;
