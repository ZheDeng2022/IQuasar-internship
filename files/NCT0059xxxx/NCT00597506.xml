  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find the safest and most effective dose of the drugs&#xD;
      bevacizumab and everolimus given in combination for the treatment of metastatic colorectal&#xD;
      cancer. Bevacizumab (also called Avastinâ„¢) is a drug that is given intravenously (through a&#xD;
      vein). Everolimus (also called RAD001) is a tablet that is taken by mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab is a protein that is thought to prevent the formation of blood vessels tumors&#xD;
      need to grow. RAD001 has multiple capabilities, like bevacizumab it may prevent the formation&#xD;
      of blood vessels needed by tumors and it also may stop tumor growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will try to find the safest dose of these drugs that can be tolerated when taken&#xD;
      in combination. The study will look at how the drugs work in the body, and will see if there&#xD;
      is any effect on metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, non-randomized expanded cohort trial of bevacizumab and RAD001 for patients&#xD;
      with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer is designed to assess preliminary efficacy as&#xD;
      well as the safety and tolerability of this combination. Patients will be accrued to this&#xD;
      study at Duke University Medical Center and The Duke Oncology Outreach Network (DON)&#xD;
&#xD;
      After satisfying eligibility and screening criteria, patients will be treated on 28 day&#xD;
      cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The treatment regimen is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
           10 mg/kg Bevacizumab intravenous on days 1 and 15 and 10mg everolimus (RAD001) daily by&#xD;
           mouth&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Toxicity will be assessed every visit, and as clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy will be assessed every 2 cycles, and as clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients may remain on treatment as long as they are deemed to be clinically benefiting&#xD;
           from treatment, do not have progressive disease on restaging imaging (Section 6.0), or&#xD;
           do not have any other reason for discontinuation of treatment as outlined in Section&#xD;
           3.4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will undergo correlative studies as outlined in the study protocol&#xD;
