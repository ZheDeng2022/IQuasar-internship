    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the quantity of fat that is released into the venous&#xD;
      system (blood) by reaming the femoral canal during intramedullary nailing of the femur using&#xD;
      two different reaming systems.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty patients who meet criteria for inclusion in this study will be assigned to one of two&#xD;
      groups by means of a computer-generated random number. Group A will consist of 10 patients&#xD;
      who undergo reaming with the Synthes reamer-irrigator-aspirator (RIA). Group B will consist&#xD;
      of 10 patients who undergo conventional reaming with the Zimmer Sentinel reamer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be transported to the operating room and will undergo general anesthesia.&#xD;
      After correct positioning of the patient on the radiolucent table, baseline data will be&#xD;
      collected. This data will consist of a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) and arterial&#xD;
      blood gas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard lateral approach to the proximal femur will be utilized. The starting point will&#xD;
      be identified using a guide pin and fluoroscopy using standard technique. Though the resident&#xD;
      may perform the approach, the attending surgeon will perform the case from the opening of the&#xD;
      canal with a drill through the completion of reaming. A TEE will be recorded from the time&#xD;
      the initial reamer engages the cortex until it is removed from the bone. A guide wire will be&#xD;
      passed across the fracture site and its position confirmed by fluoroscopic imaging. The&#xD;
      femoral canal will be reamed using either a conventional reaming technique or the RIA device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For conventional reaming, successive reamers will be used beginning with an 8mm end-cutting&#xD;
      reamer and increasing by 1.0 mm increments until cortical &quot;chatter&quot; is detected, then reaming&#xD;
      will proceed at 0.5 mm increments for two passes. This is the standard practice using current&#xD;
      technology. A Synthes titanium nail of the appropriate length which is 1.0 - 1.5mm less than&#xD;
      the last reaming will be chosen for implantation. TEE will be monitored during the pass of&#xD;
      the first reamer and the last.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For reaming with the RIA, a reamer-irrigator-aspirator of the appropriate size based on&#xD;
      pre-operative evaluation of the femoral canal size will be used to perform a single pass down&#xD;
      the femoral canal. A Synthes titanium femoral nail of the appropriate length will be selected&#xD;
      for implantation. TEE will be recorded during the reaming. An arterial blood gas will be sent&#xD;
      after positioning of the patient, when the guide wire is passed down the femoral canal and&#xD;
      after the proximal locking screws are placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proximal and distal locking screws will be placed in standard fashion. Wound closure and&#xD;
      post-operative care will be according to standard protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TEE will be evaluated in a blinded manner by two anesthesiology attendings certified to&#xD;
      use and evaluate the TEE. A grading system of 1 through 5 will be used, with 1 representing&#xD;
      little to no fat emboli and 5 representative of a large number of fat emboli. This data will&#xD;
      be forwarded to the principal investigator and used to fill the appropriate data sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outpatient follow-up will be performed in the usual manner, with sutures/staples being&#xD;
      removed at approximately 2 weeks, and radiographs being obtained at 6 and 12 weeks as the&#xD;
      attending physician deems clinically necessary. Follow-up for both limbs of the study will be&#xD;
      the same as patients not in the study who undergo femoral nailing.&#xD;
