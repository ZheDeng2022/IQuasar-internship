      The purpose of this study is to examine if PTK787/ZK222584 (vatalanib) will stabilize or&#xD;
      decrease rising biochemical markers along with progressive disease or syndrome symptoms in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase II study evaluating the safety and efficacy of PTK787/ZK222584&#xD;
      administered daily in subjects with neuroendocrine tumors that are experiencing progressive&#xD;
      disease and/or whose tumor-related syndrome symptoms (flushing and diarrhea) are considered&#xD;
      inadequately controlled despite optimal doses of octreotide therapy. Inadequate control is&#xD;
      defined as a minimum of 2 flushing episodes or 6 bowel movements per day for 7 consecutive&#xD;
      days. Subjects who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria and have completed all baseline&#xD;
      and screening testing will receive an initial dose of PTK787/ZK222584 1,250 mg once daily and&#xD;
      subjects will also remain on the scheduled doses of Sandostatin LAR 30 mg every 4 weeks. Both&#xD;
      drugs will be dosed on a flat schedule of mg, not by weight or body surface area. The&#xD;
      PTK787/ZK222584 medication will be taken orally with daily dosing. Each tablet of PTK787/ZK&#xD;
      222584 is 250 mg. The subject will take five tablets of study medication per day 2 tabs am&#xD;
      and 3 tabs pm. Subjects may continue to receive therapy as long as they do not experience&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicities or evidence of disease progression as defined by RECIST criteria.&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated with a daily log to assess the degree of symptom control (flushing&#xD;
      and diarrhea) and subjects will be monitored every 2 weeks for 3 months then monthly for&#xD;
      biochemical control and every three months for tumor response. Subjects will be monitored by&#xD;
      the Investigator every two weeks for 3 months then monthly for safety and efficacy.&#xD;
