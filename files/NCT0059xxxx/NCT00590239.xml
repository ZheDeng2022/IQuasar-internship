      -  The use of high resolution endoscopy (HRE), narrow band imaging (NBI) and&#xD;
           chromoendoscopy increases the detection rates of Barrett's esophagus (BE) and early&#xD;
           neoplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) will improve the accuracy for detection of&#xD;
           dysplasia/early neoplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1 - To create a video-atlas of non-dysplastic and dysplastic/early neoplastic&#xD;
      lesions in patients with BE. This will be used for training purposes and to assess learning&#xD;
      curve associated with these new technologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2 - To create a standardized classification system for the mucosal and vascular&#xD;
      patterns observed in patients with BE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3 - To determine the interobserver agreement using the video-atlas for the&#xD;
      mucosal and vascular patterns classification agreed upon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4 - To determine the endoscopic detection rate of esophageal cancer or&#xD;
      precancerous lesions removed during endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 5 - To determine the pathologic and clinical outcomes of patients undergoing&#xD;
      EMR/ablation; including morbidity, mortality and complications of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results to date (June 2008) : this study is active and open to enrollment. Currently 26&#xD;
      patients have enrolled in this study at the Kansas City VA medical center. In order to&#xD;
      participate, patients must be eligible for care at the KCVA hospital.&#xD;

      B. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Burden of disease Barrett's esophagus (BE) is an acquired&#xD;
      condition resulting from chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and is a well recognized&#xD;
      pre-malignant condition for the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) (1, 2). BE is&#xD;
      defined as the displacement of the squamocolumnar junction proximal to the gastroesophageal&#xD;
      junction with the presence of intestinal metaplasia (15). This condition entails a 30 to 50&#xD;
      fold greater risk for the development of EAC and has an incidence of development of EAC that&#xD;
      approaches 0.5% annually (3, 4). EAC is a highly lethal cancer and is the most rapidly&#xD;
      increasing cancer in the United States and Western Europe with an incremental increase of&#xD;
      4-10% per year. Although survival rates have improved during the recent years in some&#xD;
      countries, the overall 5-year survival rate is still a dismal 10% in most Western populations&#xD;
      (5-7). Clinical strategies for preventing deaths from this cancer focus on techniques for&#xD;
      identification of esophageal neoplasms in an asymptomatic, early, and curable stage.&#xD;
      Therefore, endoscopic screening of subjects with chronic reflux symptoms has been recommended&#xD;
      as a method of detecting BE and early cancer (8). Patients with BE are then routinely&#xD;
      enrolled in surveillance programs in an attempt to identify those who might benefit from&#xD;
      treatment at a pre-invasive stage of EAC with an ultimate aim of reducing cancer related&#xD;
      deaths (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations of current Barrett's surveillance protocol Current guidelines for surveillance&#xD;
      include taking biopsy specimens from endoscopically visible mucosal abnormality followed by&#xD;
      random 4-quadrant biopsies every 2 cm throughout the entire length of BE (15). Unfortunately,&#xD;
      the effectiveness of this strategy is hampered by numerous factors. Apart from being labor&#xD;
      intensive and time consuming for the patient; the accuracy of this protocol is limited by&#xD;
      sampling errors. Biopsy specimens from short segments or tongues of columnar mucosa generally&#xD;
      reveal intestinal metaplasia in only 40-60% of patients (16). In a study of 570 patients&#xD;
      undergoing upper endoscopy, BE was suspected in 146 patients; however, only 60 patients had&#xD;
      diagnosis confirmed by biopsy. Short segment BE (SSBE) was more frequently suspected than&#xD;
      long segment BE (LSBE) but was correctly diagnosed only 25% of the time compared with 55% for&#xD;
      LSBE (17). Similar to the distribution of the metaplastic tissue, the presence of dysplasia&#xD;
      or early adenocarcinoma within a Barrett's segment is patchy and focal. Standard endoscopy&#xD;
      and random biopsies might fail to detect these lesions. Early neoplastic lesions are not&#xD;
      visible to the eye of the endoscopist at standard endoscopy and random biopsies sample only a&#xD;
      small proportion of the epithelium at risk. Also, this &quot;hit and miss&quot; nature of biopsy&#xD;
      increases the cost of the procedure and limits the reliability of histologic interpretation&#xD;
      of dysplasia. The increasing use of endoscopy has led to more and more patients being&#xD;
      diagnosed with BE and offered surveillance. Also, the number of patients being followed up,&#xD;
      and to whom potentially curative therapy can be offered, have increased. The advent of newer&#xD;
      methods of endoscopic treatment of high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and early EAC in the form of&#xD;
      ablative therapy and EMR makes it highly desirable to diagnose dysplasia and EAC early in the&#xD;
      disease process. This may help in alleviating the morbidity and mortality associated with&#xD;
      esophagectomy for EAC. These compelling reasons coupled with the limitations of current&#xD;
      surveillance protocols make the development of new approaches aimed at improving efficacy of&#xD;
      Barrett's surveillance mandatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Novel imaging techniques and endoscopic therapies Significant effort has been expended on&#xD;
      development of new GI techniques in order to provide a precise and even a &quot;real time&quot;&#xD;
      endoscopic diagnosis. Chromoendoscopy is a technique that involves the application of agents&#xD;
      to improve characterization of the mucosa resulting in selective uptake or enhancement of&#xD;
      mucosal surface pattern (11). HRE units are equipped with charge-coupled devices with up to a&#xD;
      million pixels that allow clear visualization of fine mucosal details which may facilitate&#xD;
      the detection of early neoplastic lesions (9). NBI is a novel endoscopic technique that is&#xD;
      based on the optical phenomenon that the depth of light penetration into tissues is dependent&#xD;
      on the wavelength; the shorter the wavelength, the more superficial the penetration. Use of&#xD;
      blue light with narrow band filters enables detailed imaging of the mucosal and vascular&#xD;
      surface patterns within the BE segment with a high level of resolution and contrast without&#xD;
      the need for chromoendoscopy. The main chromophore in esophageal tissues in the visible&#xD;
      wavelength is hemoglobin, which has a maximum absorptive wavelength near 415 nm. This is&#xD;
      within the wavelength for NBI and responsible for revealing the superficial vasculature (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophagectomy was considered as the criterion standard for treatment of patients with early&#xD;
      EAC. However, it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, even in experienced&#xD;
      surgical hands and high-volume surgical centers. EMR has been used increasingly to replace&#xD;
      surgery as a curative treatment modality for early EAC in patients with BE (12, 13). It&#xD;
      allows effective local treatment of early cancer, histological analysis of all resected&#xD;
      specimens and thus confirmation of diagnosis and complete resection of the lesion. Ablative&#xD;
      therapies in BE patients have provided promising results as well (18, 19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. PRELIMINARY DATA Our group recently assessed the potential of NBI for the prediction of&#xD;
      histology during screening and surveillance endoscopy in BE patients (10). Images obtained by&#xD;
      this system were classified according to the mucosal (ridge/villous, circular,&#xD;
      irregular/distorted) and vascular (normal, abnormal) patterns and correlated with histology&#xD;
      in a prospective and blinded fashion. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive&#xD;
      value of the ridge/villous pattern for the diagnosis of intestinal metaplasia without&#xD;
      high-grade dysplasia (HGD) were 93.5%, 87%, and 95% respectively. The sensitivity,&#xD;
      specificity, and positive predictive value of the irregular/distorted patterns for HGD were&#xD;
      100%, 99%, and 95% respectively. These promising results have been validated by other&#xD;
      investigators. Similarly, Dr. Sharma has published several studies involving the use of&#xD;
      chromoendoscopy in patients with BE. In a study of 80 patients with columnar lined esophagus&#xD;
      using indigo carmine dye and 115x magnification endoscopy, three mucosal patterns as stated&#xD;
      above were identified. The presence of ridge/villous pattern for detecting intestinal&#xD;
      metaplasia had high sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (97%, 76%, and&#xD;
      92% respectively). Six patients had an irregular/distorted pattern and biopsies revealed HGD&#xD;
      in all these patients (11). Our group has been active in evaluating the role of ablative&#xD;
      therapies in patients with BE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We recently assessed the long-term efficacy of achieving complete reversal (endoscopic and&#xD;
      histologic) between multipolar electrocoagulation and argon plasma coagulation in patients&#xD;
      with BE and assessed factors influencing successful ablation. A total of 35 BE patients were&#xD;
      followed for at least 2 years following ablative therapy and complete reversal of BE was&#xD;
      achieved in 70% of the patients, regardless of the ablative technique (19). The International&#xD;
      Working Group on the Classification of Oesophagitis has been at the forefront for the&#xD;
      classification and grading of acid-peptic related esophageal diseases such as erosive&#xD;
      esophagitis and BE. Sharma et al developed and validated an endoscopic grading system for BE&#xD;
      (Prague C &amp; M criteria). The criteria includes assessment of the circumferential (C) and&#xD;
      maximal (M) extent of the endoscopically visualized BE segment along with endoscopic&#xD;
      landmarks. This grading system demonstrated a high validity for the endoscopic assessment of&#xD;
      visualized BE lengths (20).&#xD;
&#xD;

      This is a part of a multicenter study initiated at Kansas City. Patients will be recruited&#xD;
      from Amsterdam, Mainz, Wiesbaden and Kansas City.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Physical examination and questionnaire All patients will complete a validated GERD&#xD;
      questionnaire (GERQ) (21) that records duration, severity, and frequency of heartburn and&#xD;
      regurgitation with supplemental information on medications such as acid suppressive therapy,&#xD;
      aspirin, NSAIDs, etc. Demographic information and clinical findings such as height, weight&#xD;
      and waist circumference will be recorded .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic procedure The endoscopic procedures will be performed with a high-resolution&#xD;
      endoscope (Olympus GIF-Q240Z, GIF-Q160Z, or more recent versions) that has the capability of&#xD;
      performing NBI with the push of a switch. Standard methods of conscious sedation and&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary monitoring will be used during each procedure. The distal esophagus will be&#xD;
      carefully inspected for the presence of erosions, nodules and plaques. The presence and size&#xD;
      of hiatal hernia will be recorded. A plastic disposable distal attachment cap (e.g. Olympus&#xD;
      D-201-11802) with a free distal distance of 2-3 mm will be attached to the endoscope in order&#xD;
      to fix mucosal areas of interest until images and biopsies have been taken. The endoscopist&#xD;
      will be blinded to the previous BE histology of the patient. The classification of mucosal&#xD;
      and vascular patterns will be performed in a standardized manner into groups as described&#xD;
      above. Details of endoscopy findings and digital video recordings will be entered into an&#xD;
      endoscopy form .&#xD;
