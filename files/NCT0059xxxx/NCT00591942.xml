      The restoration of indirect partial and full coverage restorations in dentistry necessitates&#xD;
      the use of a luting agent to act as a means of mechanical and potentially, chemical retention&#xD;
      of the restoration. Upon the introduction of the first generation of glass Ionomer cements&#xD;
      for use as a luting agent, an elevated short-term post operative hypersentivity was reported.&#xD;
      In part, this adverse event was considered to be due to a desiccating effect of the cement as&#xD;
      water is utilized in the setting reaction and thus a desiccation of the dentinal tubules was&#xD;
      proposed as a potential mechanism leading to disruption of the neurosensory odontoblasts.&#xD;
      Further materials development in the field of dental cement luting agents has lead to the&#xD;
      introduction to the current market of resin formulations that have an alternative mechanism&#xD;
      of setting. Consequently, there are anecdotal reports of a decrease in the incidence of&#xD;
      post-operative sensitivity but no comparison with the effect of conventionally used dentin&#xD;
      desensitizing agents as a part of the bonding process of the restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this trial is a single blinded parallel design randomized clinical trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the perceived incidence of post-operative sensitivity when full coverage all ceramic&#xD;
      crowns or short-span three unit fixed partial dentures (dental bridge) is fabricated in the&#xD;
      posterior part of the mouth. The dental crowns or bridges will be bonded with conventional&#xD;
      glass ionomer cement or a Urethane dimethacrylate / Bis-GMA composite resin dental cement.&#xD;
      Outcome measures will be both objective clinical criteria and the use of a calibrated pain&#xD;
      survey instrument.&#xD;

      Background and Significance: The development of porcelain crowns for the predictable&#xD;
      restoration of teeth has been brought about by the development of bonding techniques to&#xD;
      enamel and dentin with the use of multi-step total etch adhesive systems along with the&#xD;
      evolution in small particle hybrid resin composites as adhesive luting agents. One of the&#xD;
      most common post-operative concerns of patients following delivery of full coverage crowns&#xD;
      and bridges is sensitivity to thermal conditions in the mouth (cold water, ice cream, etc.)&#xD;
      (Goodacre, Bernal et al. 2003). In order to understand the biological basis for these&#xD;
      materials it is important to understand the anatomy and neurophysiology of dentin. The&#xD;
      following is adapted from a paper provided by Dr. Charles Cox (Professor, University of&#xD;
      Alabama School of Dentistry) concerning dentin structure and mechanisms for reduction of&#xD;
      dentin hypersensitivity .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dentin is a vital tissue, harder than bone but weaker than enamel with a physiological&#xD;
      elasticity preventing tooth fracture. Dentin is approx. 74% mineral; the organic phase being&#xD;
      approx. 26% type-1 collagen with small amounts of proteins and water. The collagen matrix is&#xD;
      secreted as a biologically &quot;plastic&quot; material, which hardens by a variety of mechanisms.&#xD;
      Normal dentin is composed of millions of tubules or canals, running from the pulpal wall to&#xD;
      the Dentin-Enamel Junction (DEJ). The dimensions of these tubules or canals varies depending&#xD;
      on the position within the dentin structure. For instance, tubule diameter at the DEJ is 0.06&#xD;
      µm, and 3.0 µm at the pulpal wall (approx. 60,000 tubules / mm2). Most tubules are filled&#xD;
      with fluid, an odontoblast cell process, collagen, and occasional non-myelinated pulpal&#xD;
      nerves coursing approx. 150 µm towards the DEJ (Ten Cate 1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In normal (non-anesthetized) patients, Gysi (1900) reported that fluid distortion on the&#xD;
      cavity floor caused sharp pain. Brännström et al. (1966, 1969, 1976, 1979, 1980, 1996)&#xD;
      demonstrated dentin hypersensitivity (sharp pain) is the result of rapid fluid movement in&#xD;
      the tubule complex, aggravated by aggressive air-drying. Physiological testing in various&#xD;
      animal studies (Heyeraas 1985, Narhi 1983, 1985) confirmed the fluid pulsing or hydrodynamic&#xD;
      mechanism (Brännström 1966) as the prime cause of sudden dentin pain. Physiologically, any&#xD;
      rapid bi-directional fluid flow is the result of a sudden shift in tubule fluid from stimuli&#xD;
      (i.e. cold or rapid airflow; Brännström 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of dentin hypersensitivity is only one part of a successful dental complete&#xD;
      coverage restoration (dental crown or bridge). In evaluating the clinical service-life of&#xD;
      porcelain crowns there are three aspects of the bonding environment that needs to be&#xD;
      considered. These consist of the tooth preparation, the adhesive and the tooth or crown&#xD;
      preparation and the fit of the porcelain restoration to the tooth preparation. All ceramic&#xD;
      restorations need enamel and dentin reduction of at least 1.5 mm along with a smooth shoulder&#xD;
      and avoidance of sharp edges to avoid crack formation on the intaglio surface, proper&#xD;
      esthetics, physiological contours and strength of the final restoration.(Goodacre, Campagni&#xD;
      et al. 2001) Dental preparation for full coverage restorations (1.5 to 2 mm clearance which&#xD;
      often means 1.5 - 2 mm loss of tooth structure) are inherently non-conservative and with a&#xD;
      reduced amount of remaining tooth structure there is an elevated risk of post-operative&#xD;
      sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In today's society, having a dental restoration that provides minimal post-operative&#xD;
      sensitivity is only part of the demand from patients. There is an increasing expectation for&#xD;
      esthetic, &quot;life-like&quot; restorations that simulate if not replicate the natural tooth. This is&#xD;
      complicated especially in patients with heavy occlusion or are missing teeth. The development&#xD;
      of CAD/CAM milling technologies has laid the groundwork for use of high strength heat-pressed&#xD;
      zirconia [tetragonal zirconia polycrystals (TZP) a yttrium partially stabilized polycrystal&#xD;
      structure] as a supporting framework for supporting an esthetic, &quot;life-like&quot; Lucite-base&#xD;
      veneering ceramic material to provide an all ceramic form of full coverage dental&#xD;
      restorations for individual teeth or replacement of a single missing tooth with a 3-united&#xD;
      fixed partial denture (&quot;dental bridge&quot;). The use of press porcelain crown technology has&#xD;
      allowed the improvement of fit of refractory die porcelain crown fabrication relative to&#xD;
      conventional Pt foil techniques and may lead to greater predictability and reduced&#xD;
      microleakage (with enhanced service life of the dental restoration). The potential for an&#xD;
      enhanced service life may depend on a combination of silination with a bifunctional bis-GMA&#xD;
      primer and dual cured composite resin luting agent which may seal microcracks within the&#xD;
      intaglio surface of the porcelain and a sufficient bond to tooth structure for a reasonable&#xD;
      service life.&#xD;
