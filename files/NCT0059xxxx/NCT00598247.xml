  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study uses the drug PPX (also called Xyotax and CT-2103) in women with advanced&#xD;
      colorectal cancer. PPX is an experimental drug that has not been approved by the Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration (FDA). PPX has been shown in the laboratory and in studies in humans to&#xD;
      cause some cancer cells to die and some tumors to shrink. Women in some studies with PPX have&#xD;
      been shown to live longer than the men that receive the drug. Some studies in humans suggest&#xD;
      that estrogen (a hormone found in women) may protect women from getting colorectal cancer and&#xD;
      allow women that do get colorectal cancer to live longer than men that do.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see if women with colorectal cancer and a certain level of&#xD;
      estrogen experience tumor shrinkage after they receive the drug PPX. This study will also&#xD;
      study genes (genes are the cell's blueprint) in participant's tumors and in their blood.&#xD;
      Several genes can affect how people's bodies react to the cancer drugs. We want to see if&#xD;
      these predict response to the study drugs.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women with histologically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum.&#xD;
             The primary histologic diagnosis is sufficient if there is clear evidence by imaging&#xD;
             and/or markers of metastatic disease sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have failed or are intolerant of or ineligible for CPT-11, 5-FU, oxaliplatin,&#xD;
             bevacizumab and either cetuximab or panitumumab therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumor must be accessible for biopsy or paraffin embedded tissue must be available for&#xD;
             review.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SWOG performance status 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Estradiol levels &gt;30 pg/mL **This may be supplemented by exogenous estrogen (by gel)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AGC &gt;1,500, platelets &gt;100,000&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin &lt; 3 x upper limit of normal, Transaminase (AST and/or ALT) &lt; 2 x upper&#xD;
             limit of normal or &lt; 5 x upper limit of normal in patients with liver metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a creatinine of &lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal or a measured or&#xD;
             calculated creatinine clearance greater than 35 mL/min obtained within 7 days of first&#xD;
             receiving study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Except for cancer-related abnormalities, patients should not have unstable or&#xD;
             pre-existing major medical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least one measurable lesion according to the RECIST criteria which has not been&#xD;
             irradiated (i.e. newly arising lesions in previously irradiated areas are accepted).&#xD;
             Ascites, pleural effusion, and bone metastases are not considered measurable. Minimum&#xD;
             indicator lesion size: &gt; 10 mm measured by spiral CT or &gt; 20mm measured by&#xD;
             conventional techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to initiation of chemotherapy&#xD;
             (female patients of childbearing potential).&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other&#xD;
             cancer for which the patient has been disease-free for five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Estradiol levels &lt; 30 pg/mL, not responsive to supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of previous thromboembolic event, unless patient is on anticoagulation&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating woman. Woman or men of childbearing potential not using a&#xD;
             reliable and appropriate contraceptive method (either a barrier or hormonal method is&#xD;
             acceptable). Patients must agree to continue contraception for 30 days from the date&#xD;
             of the last study drug administration. (Postmenopausal woman must have been&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases, unless they are well controlled - i.e. on a&#xD;
             stable dose of steroids or if steroid therapy has been completed.&#xD;
