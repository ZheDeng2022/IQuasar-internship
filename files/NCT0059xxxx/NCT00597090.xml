    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand genetic susceptibility to infections and&#xD;
      the interactions of specific genetic polymorphisms of innate immune receptors with microbial&#xD;
      and fungal organisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Find out if some people are more likely to get severe infections, than others. To do&#xD;
           this we will compare patients with leukemia who develop severe infections to patients&#xD;
           who do not develop infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Find out if some people are more likely to develop lymphoma than others. To do this we&#xD;
           will compare patients with lymphoma to people without lymphoma who are of the same sex&#xD;
           and similar age and ethnic background to the patients with lymphoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A small number of patients will develop severe infection after chemotherapy or after&#xD;
      allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The ability of patients with leukemia or bone marrow&#xD;
      transplantation to fight infections is decreased. One reason is that chemotherapy transiently&#xD;
      destroys the type of white blood cells called neutrophils. Neutrophils are the first line of&#xD;
      defense of our body against infections. Bone marrow transplant patients may be receiving&#xD;
      edications to prevent graft versus host disease. Such medications may decrease the ability of&#xD;
      the body to fight infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People respond to infections in different ways. Some may be born with genes that make them&#xD;
      more likely to get certain types of infections. Specific genes may affect the response to&#xD;
      different microbes (pathogens). We want to find out which genes have normal changes in them&#xD;
      and lead to different responses to infections. We also want to find out how the ability to&#xD;
      fight infections is related to the way these genes work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Responses to infection are controlled by our immune system. Changes in genes of the immune&#xD;
      system that may alter control of infection may make people more susceptible to some types of&#xD;
      lymphoma The goals of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Find out if some people are more likely to get severe infections, than others. To do&#xD;
           this we will compare patients with leukemia who develop severe infections to patients&#xD;
           who do not develop infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Find out if some people are more likely to develop lymphoma than others. To do this we&#xD;
           will compare patients with lymphoma to people without lymphoma who are of the same sex&#xD;
           and similar age and ethnic background to the patients with lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to better understand genetic susceptibility to infections and&#xD;
      the interactions of specific genetic polymorphisms of innate immune receptors with microbial&#xD;
      and fungal organisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish this, blood specimens from patients with acute myeloid leukemia, RAEB, RAEBT or&#xD;
      acute lymphocytic leukemia, follicular or mantle cell lymphoma or recipients of allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) will be collected. We will genotype the genes of&#xD;
      innate immune receptors to identify genetic polymorphisms associated with higher frequency of&#xD;
      invasive infections or susceptibility to lymphoma. All specimens will be processed in the&#xD;
      Infectious Diseases Laboratory at MSKCC. RNA will be extracted from peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Genotyping will be done from genomic DNA or from cDNA generated&#xD;
      from RNA by RT-PCR. Cell lines will be created from PBMCs and will be analyzed in functional&#xD;
      assays for responses to bacterial and fungal products (cytokine secretion, upregulation of&#xD;
      cell surface molecules). All patient samples including genomic DNA, RNA, cDNA and cell lines&#xD;
      will be banked in the Infectious Disease laboratory at MSKCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to perform this study, patients diagnosed with acute leukemia will be asked to&#xD;
      provide blood, and permission to review the medical charts. We will collect (removed&#xD;
      prospectively) data regarding risk factors for infections, diagnosis of infections, response&#xD;
      to treatment and outcome.&#xD;
