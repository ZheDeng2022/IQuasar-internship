    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether prucalopride is safe and effective in&#xD;
      patients with chronic idiopathic constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all doses administered prucalopride given once daily for 4 weeks is safe and well&#xD;
      tolerated in patients with chronic idiopathic constipation.&#xD;

      This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel group, multicentre, Phase&#xD;
      II, dose comparison trial, in which 313 subjects, with a history of chronic idiopathic&#xD;
      constipation were enrolled. The trial was conducted in three phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a 4-week drug-free run-in phase,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a 4-week double-blind (DB) phase during which subjects were treated with R093877 (0.5&#xD;
           mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, or 4 mg capsule) or matching placebo once daily, prior to breakfast,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. a 4-week drug-free run-out phase (RO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To qualify for the run-in phase (Visit 1, Week 1) subjects had to have experienced, for at&#xD;
      least 3 months, 2 or less spontaneous, bowel movements (SBM)/week with the occurrence of&#xD;
      lumpy (scyballae) and/or hard stools, a sensation of incomplete evacuation for at least a&#xD;
      quarter of their stools, or straining during defecation at least a quarter of the time.&#xD;
