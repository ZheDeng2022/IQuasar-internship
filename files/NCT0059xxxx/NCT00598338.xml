  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether prucalopride is safe and effective in the&#xD;
      re-treatment of chronic constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retreatment is as effective and safe as treatment with prucalopride in patients with chronic&#xD;
      constipation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, Phase III trial with a parallel-group design, consisting of a 2 week&#xD;
      drug-free run-in period, followed by a 4-week double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment&#xD;
      period, a drug-free washout period of at least 2 weeks, and a second 4-week double-blind&#xD;
      treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the initial run-in period, the subject's bowel habit will be documented in a daily&#xD;
      diary and the existence of constipation will be confirmed. Eligible subjects will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated to double-blind treatment with either 4 mg prucalopride or placebo, given orally&#xD;
      once daily before breakfast, for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 4 weeks of treatment, each subject will enter a drug-free washout period. The length of&#xD;
      the washout period will be either 2 or 4 weeks, depending on how long it takes for the&#xD;
      subject to meet the criteria for constipation. If the subject is unable to re-qualify after a&#xD;
      4-week washout, the subject must be discontinued from the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who qualify for the second double-blind treatment period will receive the same&#xD;
      treatment as during the first treatment period, once-daily for an additional four weeks.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male and non-pregnant, non-breast-feeding female outpatients at least 18 years of age&#xD;
             (no upper age limit).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of constipation; the patient reported having, on average, 2 or fewer&#xD;
             spontaneous bowel movements per week that resulted in a feeling of complete evacuation&#xD;
             as well as the occurrence of one or more of the following for at least 6 months before&#xD;
             the selection visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  very hard (little balls) and/or hard stools at least a quarter of the stools;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  sensation of incomplete evacuation following at least a quarter of the stools;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  straining at defecation at least a quarter of the time. The above criteria were&#xD;
                  only applicable for spontaneous bowel movements, i.e. not preceded within a&#xD;
                  period of 24 hours by the intake of a laxative agent or by the use of an enema.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients who never had spontaneous bowel movements were considered to be constipated&#xD;
             and were eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Having functional constipation. Constipation that was not induced by secondary causes&#xD;
             of constipation (see exclusion criteria 1 through 7).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Willing and able to fill out his/her own diary and questionnaires without help, and&#xD;
             able to read and write English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Written informed consent, signed by the patient or legally acceptable representative&#xD;
             and by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Availability for follow-up during the study period as determined in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients in whom constipation was thought to be drug-induced, or who were using any&#xD;
             disallowed medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients suffering from endocrine disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients suffering from neurologic disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Presence of a megacolon/megarectum or a diagnosis of pseudo-obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Constipation as a result of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Known or suspected organic disorders of the large bowel (i.e. obstruction, carcinoma,&#xD;
             or inflammatory bowel disease). Results of a barium enema with flexible sigmoidoscopy&#xD;
             or of a colonoscopic examination performed within the last 12 months were needed to&#xD;
             rule out organic disorders. A colonoscopic examination or barium enema with flexible&#xD;
             sigmoidoscopy performed within the last 3 years was acceptable if the examination was&#xD;
             performed for an evaluation of constipation, and there was no history or evidence of&#xD;
             weight loss, anaemia, or rectal bleeding, and the patient had 3 consecutively negative&#xD;
             stool occult blood tests at screening. Patients with polyps discovered by colonoscopy&#xD;
             that were untreated (i.e. by polypectomy) were to be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Presence of known serious, uncontrolled illnesses: clinically significant cardiac,&#xD;
             vascular, pulmonary, endocrine, psychiatric disorders (including active alcohol or&#xD;
             drug abuse) or metabolic disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Clinically significant cancer within the past 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects known to be HIV positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Impaired renal function, i.e. serum creatinine concentration &gt;2 mg/dL (&gt;180&#xD;
             micromol/L) or creatinine clearance ≤50 mL/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Clinically significant abnormalities of haematology, urinalysis, or blood chemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Females of child-bearing potential without adequate contraceptive protection during&#xD;
             the study. Oral contraceptives, Depo Provera® and Norplant® had to be used for at&#xD;
             least 3 months prior to randomisation. Intrauterine devices (IUDs), sterilization, or&#xD;
             a double barrier method were other acceptable methods of birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Treatment with an investigational drug in the 30 days preceding the run-in phase of&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Previous treatment with either prucalopride formulation.&#xD;
