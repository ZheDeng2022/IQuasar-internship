    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different&#xD;
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and&#xD;
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Radiation therapy uses high energy&#xD;
      x-rays to kill tumor cells. Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of&#xD;
      radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal&#xD;
      tissue. Giving cetuximab together with 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy may kill&#xD;
      more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving cetuximab together with radiation&#xD;
      therapy works in treating patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer that cannot be&#xD;
      removed by surgery.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the progression free survival rate in patients treated with cetuximab and&#xD;
           radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the response rate, toxicity of the combined regimen, and clinical benefit&#xD;
           response in patients treated with cetuximab and radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours once weekly for 6-7 weeks. Patients&#xD;
      also undergo concurrent 3-dimensional image-guided conformal radiotherapy in 28-30 fractions&#xD;
      over approximately 5.5-6 weeks (2-4 hours after administration of cetuximab).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then&#xD;
      every 6 months for up to 3 years.&#xD;
