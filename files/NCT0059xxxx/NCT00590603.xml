      This is a phase I dose escalation study to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the&#xD;
      novel combination of Arsenic, Ascorbic Acid and Velcade, followed by a phase II study&#xD;
      conducted using the MTD estimated from the phase I portion.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Despite the fact the high dose therapy and autologous transplant can prolong life in patients&#xD;
      with multiple myeloma (MM), in most studies there appears to be a continuously declining&#xD;
      event free survival following auto-transplant indicating that few patients will be cured with&#xD;
      this approach. A high percentage of patients the relapse in the post transplant setting will&#xD;
      not be candidate for additional chemotherapy. We therefore, are investigating novel&#xD;
      strategies for controlling their disease in the post transplant setting. The key theoretical&#xD;
      issue for this study is whether concomitant Trisenox would permit the use of less toxic doses&#xD;
      of Velcade, resulting in a less toxic but equally effective regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I of this study uses dose escalation to estimate the maximum tolerated dose of Arsenic,&#xD;
      Ascorbic Acid and Velcade. Phase II is a subsequent treatment phase using the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose from Phase I. In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events,&#xD;
      treatment may continue for 6 cycles, plus two additional cycles if patient has achieved a&#xD;
      good response.&#xD;

    <description>Phase I/Cohort I&#xD;
Loading:&#xD;
Arsenic Trioxide (ATO): 0.25 mg/kg IV over 1-2 hr qd x 5 days (Monday-Friday)&#xD;
Ascorbic Acid: 1000 mg by IV infusion over 15 minutes after each infusion of arsenic trioxide qd x 5 days&#xD;
Maintenance cycles (21 days)&#xD;
ATO: 0.25 mg/kg IV over 1-2 hr once a week x 2 weeks every 3 weeks (one cycle) for a total of 6 cycles.&#xD;
Ascorbic Acid 1000mg IV will be given within 30 minutes of completion of ATO.&#xD;
Bortezomib 1 mg/m2 is administered intravenously in a 3-5 second bolus on days 1, 8 of a 21-day cycle. ATO is given at least one hour prior to Bortezomib. The first cycle will start on week 2, after loading dose week.&#xD;
Phase I/Cohort 1 is followed by Cohort 2. Phase II uses maximum tolerated dose from Phase I.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as localized plasmacytoma, detectable&#xD;
             M-spike by serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and/or urine protein electrophoresis&#xD;
             (UPEP), or free light chain assay, bone lytic lesions and/or bone marrow infiltration&#xD;
             with atypical plasma-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be at least four weeks since their prior therapy. Patients will not be&#xD;
             excluded because of any prior regimen they have received as long as they meet other&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate organ function, patients with elevated creatinine due to myeloma are not&#xD;
             excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum potassium greater than 4.0 milliequivalent (mEq)/dL and serum magnesium greater&#xD;
             than 1.8 mg/dL. If these electrolytes are below the specified limits on the baseline&#xD;
             laboratory tests, supplemental electrolytes should be administered to bring the serum&#xD;
             concentrations to these levels before administering arsenic trioxide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to Bortezomib, Trisenox, Ascorbic acid, or other agents used in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Corrected QT interval (QTc) interval greater than 460 msec in the presence of serum&#xD;
             potassium greater than or equal to 4.0 mEq/L and magnesium greater than or equal to&#xD;
             1.8 mg/dL, or underlying conduction disease that prevents measurement of the QTc&#xD;
             interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of ventricular tachycardia or any cardiac arrhythmia requiring the placement&#xD;
             of an automated intraventricular cardiac defibrillator or therapy with class I or&#xD;
             class II antiarrhythmic drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ejection fraction (EF) by multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan less than 35%.&#xD;
