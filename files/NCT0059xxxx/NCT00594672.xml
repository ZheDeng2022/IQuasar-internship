    <textblock>
      This study is a 5-year extension of the AREDS protocol, in which investigators followed the&#xD;
      natural course of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts. Participants in the&#xD;
      former AREDS protocol are eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have a complete eye examination once a year and are contacted at least once a&#xD;
      year between visits to check on their status. The eye examination includes measurement of&#xD;
      visual acuity (vision chart test) and examination of the inside of the eye after the pupils&#xD;
      have been dilated with eye drops. Photographs of the inside of the eye may be taken using a&#xD;
      special camera that flashes a bright light in the eye. A blood sample may be obtained to test&#xD;
      for cholesterol level and genes related to inflammation.&#xD;

      The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) Follow-Up protocol allows us to continue with the&#xD;
      follow-up of participants who were enrolled in the clinical trial of antioxidant vitamins and&#xD;
      zinc. The AREDS study was designed in the beginning to determine the clinical course and&#xD;
      prognosis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts.1 In addition, AREDS&#xD;
      evaluated the possible risk factors associated with the development of AMD and cataracts; the&#xD;
      nutritional risk factors were evaluated and published in October 2001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study results showed that antioxidant vitamins and zinc therapy reduced the risk of&#xD;
      developing advanced AMD in participants with intermediate and greater risk of developing AMD&#xD;
      (categories 3 and 4) by 25%. The risk of vision loss of three lines or more on the&#xD;
      logarithmic visual acuity charts was also reduced by 19% for these participants. For those&#xD;
      who developed AMD, their risk of vision loss was reduced by 25%. Antioxidants and zinc are&#xD;
      now recommended for participants who have an intermediate risk of developing advanced AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the AREDS clinical trial in September 2001, participants were invited for&#xD;
      follow-up for an additional five years to collect further data on the natural course of both&#xD;
      AMD and cataracts. Although the multi-center trial was complete in December 2005, we wish to&#xD;
      continue to follow-up on these participants at the NEI on an annual basis for a minimum of&#xD;
      five years from the date of enrollment in this study to collect additional data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although results from AREDS on the relationship of lutein/zeaxanthin and omega-3 long-chain&#xD;
      polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) intake with advanced AMD were informative, the&#xD;
      non-experimental sampling (observational) design limited our strength of inference. AREDS2, a&#xD;
      multi-center Phase III randomized clinical trial, was designed to assess the effects of oral&#xD;
      supplementation of high doses of macular xanthophylls (lutein and zeaxanthin) and/or omega-3&#xD;
      LCPUFAs as a treatment for AMD, cataract and moderate vision loss. In addition to this&#xD;
      objective, the study provided information on the clinical course, prognosis, and risk factors&#xD;
      for development and progression of both AMD and cataract. Other study goals included the&#xD;
      evaluation of eliminating beta-carotene and/or reducing zinc in the original AREDS&#xD;
      formulation on the progression and development of AMD. AREDS2 also sought to validate the&#xD;
      fundus photographic AMD scale developed from AREDS. Participants who completed AREDS2 are&#xD;
      invited for follow-up on an annual basis for at least five years from the date of enrollment&#xD;
      in this study to collect additional data.&#xD;
