      The hypotheses of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ondansetron will show a decrease in cocaine use from baseline in individuals with HIV&#xD;
           who are cocaine using.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ondansetron will show a decrease in cravings from baseline in individuals with HIV who&#xD;
           are cocaine using.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent and screening, HIV infected individuals who are cocaine dependent and&#xD;
      qualify for the study will be offered ondansetron 4mg BID for six weeks in an open label&#xD;
      format 4mg BID has been found to have efficacy compared to placebo. At screening and then at&#xD;
      each visit, they will be asked to provide urine and a drug of abuse screen will be conducted&#xD;
      to assess for cocaine. They will be asked to detail their recent cocaine use in the last&#xD;
      month and then will be given a visual analog scale to assess their craving for cocaine. They&#xD;
      will be asked to return weekly for 6 weeks to receive a week's supply of ondansetron and to&#xD;
      give a urine sample that will test for cocaine. They will fill out a time line follow back&#xD;
      for the past week and asked to assess their craving for cocaine on a visual analog scale.&#xD;

      In 1996, the use of protease inhibitors and triple therapy known as HAART (highly active&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapies) became widespread in the United States for the treatment of HIV.&#xD;
      This changed the disease process from a relentless and progressive one to a chronic one, with&#xD;
      the resulting need to focus on issues related to adherence. Because of unique aspects of&#xD;
      viral resistance with HIV, an adherence rate of 95% or higher is required to minimize or halt&#xD;
      the progression of the disease (DeMasi et al., 2001; Gross, Bilker, Friedman, &amp; Strom, 2001).&#xD;
      Cocaine use and dependence has been found to have deleterious effects on HIV infected&#xD;
      individuals (Fiala et al., 2005) Cocaine use hastens disease progression, increases viral&#xD;
      loads and decreases CD4 counts(Arnsten et al., 2002; Baldwin, Roth, &amp; Tashkin, 1998; Hurwitz,&#xD;
      ; Kapadia, Vlahov, Donahoe, &amp; Friedland, 2005; Lucas et al., 2006; Roth et al., 2002; Roth,&#xD;
      Whittaker, Choi, Tashkin, &amp; Baldwin, 2005) Cocaine use correlates with increased &quot;no show&quot;&#xD;
      clinic visits and decreased or no-adherence to HIV medications. (Hinkin et al., 2007;&#xD;
      Ingersoll, 2004; Palepu, Horton, Tibbetts, Meli, &amp; Samet, 2004; Sharpe, Lee, Nakashima,&#xD;
      Elam-Evans, &amp; Fleming, 2004) There appear to be multiple reasons for non-adherence in this&#xD;
      substance abusing population. Factors such as forgetting and running out of medications have&#xD;
      been implicated with substances such as crack cocaine and heroin. (Ingersoll, 2004; Kerr et&#xD;
      al., 2004)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A medication that decreases or ceases cocaine use potentially improves adherence at clinic&#xD;
      appointments as well as adherence to medication. In addition, it might indirectly decrease&#xD;
      the progression of the disease. Ondansetron, a serotonin type 3 receptor antagonist (5HT3),&#xD;
      at 4mg twice a day has been shown to have a greater rate of improvement in percentage of&#xD;
      participants with a cocaine-free week compared to placebo in cocaine dependent non HIV&#xD;
      infected treatment seeking individuals. (Johnson, B.A. 2006)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ondansetron is FDA approved for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting, postoperative&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting and radiation induced nausea and vomiting. Ondansetron has shown efficacy&#xD;
      for nausea and vomiting in HIV infected individuals for palliation, as well as for diarrhea&#xD;
      due to cryptosporidium infection.(Currow, Coughlan, Fardell, &amp; Cooney, 1997; Gompels et al.,&#xD;
      1993; Schworer, Hartmann, &amp; Ramadori, 1994) Until recently, ondansetron's cost was&#xD;
      prohibitive. However, as a generic drug it has become more affordable. Among the benefits of&#xD;
      this drug is the qualitative benefits for HIV infected individuals with nausea and diarrhea&#xD;
      as well as cocaine dependence. HIV medications can cause nausea (M. O. Johnson, Stallworth, &amp;&#xD;
      Neilands, 2003; M. O. Johnson et al., 2005; O'Brien, Clark, Besch, Myers, &amp; Kissinger, 2003;&#xD;
      Reynolds &amp; Neidig, 2002) and thus adherence might be improved with this medication in cocaine&#xD;
      using individuals. Ondansetron is well tolerated in HIV infected individuals, and according&#xD;
      to micromedex there are no known drug interactions with HIV medications (Gompels et al.,&#xD;
      1993)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ondansetron has a mild adverse events profile. In studies with cocaine dependent individuals&#xD;
      who were not HIV infected, our group found that Ondansetron had fewer side effects than&#xD;
      placebo (B. A. Johnson et al., 2006). Also, in that same study, Ondansetron recipients&#xD;
      attended more sessions than those of placebo. Both of these factors make this drug an&#xD;
      appealing option for cocaine dependent HIV infected individuals.&#xD;
