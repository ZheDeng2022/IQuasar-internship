      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of parent-child interaction therapy that includes&#xD;
      an emotion development component in treating depression in preschool children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While growing up, children experience a range of emotions that change with development and&#xD;
      environment. Although all young children experience sadness at times, a main characteristic&#xD;
      of young children is their ability to experience joy and excitement in pleasurable childhood&#xD;
      activities. When a child seems perpetually sad and no longer seems interested in previously&#xD;
      enjoyed activities, the child may be showing signs of early onset depression. Children who&#xD;
      are depressed are at increased risk for a wide range of social, psychological, physical, and&#xD;
      achievement-related problems. Two previous studies have established the validity of early&#xD;
      onset depressive syndrome in preschoolers, confirming the need for treatment during the&#xD;
      preschool period. This study will specifically adapt parent child interaction therapy (PCIT),&#xD;
      a proven effective treatment for preschool disruptive disorders, for use in preschoolers with&#xD;
      depression and will include an additional component to focus on emotion development (ED). The&#xD;
      study will evaluate the effectiveness of PCIT-ED in treating depression in preschool&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this two-stage study will last 16 weeks and will consist of initial&#xD;
      assessments, 14 weeks of therapy, and a final assessment. Stage I will be used to assess the&#xD;
      acceptability and reliability of the PCIT-ED manual, which will guide the treatment sessions.&#xD;
      The protocol and assessment schedule will be the same for Stage I participants and Stage II&#xD;
      participants assigned to PCIT-ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial assessments will include both child and parent participants. Child participants&#xD;
      will be asked to complete a series of tasks, which will include playing with games and toys,&#xD;
      making selections based on feelings, completing stories started by a research assistant, and&#xD;
      participating in other activities designed to be fun and exciting. Parents will be&#xD;
      interviewed about their child's feelings, emotions, behaviors, and development and also about&#xD;
      how their child gets along at home, in school, and with friends. Parents will also answer&#xD;
      questions concerning their own mental health and drug history, parenting style, and moods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then be randomly assigned to receive PCIT-ED or Developmental Education&#xD;
      Parenting Intervention (DEPI). Participants in both groups will attend fourteen 1-hour&#xD;
      therapy sessions over a period of 14 weeks. For those assigned to PCIT-ED, most sessions will&#xD;
      include both parent and child participants, but some will include parents only. During the&#xD;
      parent-only sessions, the goals and procedures of upcoming therapy visits will be explained&#xD;
      to parents. During sessions with both parent and child, participants will be taught positive&#xD;
      parent-child interaction skills, ways to manage emotions, and relaxation techniques. After&#xD;
      each therapy session, participants will be given homework that will involve practicing the&#xD;
      skills learned in therapy sessions at home. At three points during the study, parents will&#xD;
      also be asked to complete a brief questionnaire about their thoughts and feelings toward the&#xD;
      therapy process. The therapy sessions for the participants assigned to DEPI will provide&#xD;
      basic education in all areas of preschool development, with emphasis on social and emotional&#xD;
      development. The initial assessments will be repeated for all participants at the end of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
