  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and fatigue&#xD;
      have disrupted sleep, as was suggested in previous studies, and whether treating the&#xD;
      disruptions of sleep improves the fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eszoplicone, a new drug FDA approved for the treatment of insomnia, will be used to control&#xD;
      sleep disturbances in MS patients with fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last 7 weeks, 5 of which will involve being on medication. You will take&#xD;
      eszopiclone or placebo (sugar pill), keep a sleep diary and wear an actigraph, a device about&#xD;
      the size of a digital watch that monitors and records sleep activity. You will randomly be&#xD;
      chosen to get either placebo or medication. Half the subjects will get placebo and half&#xD;
      eszopiclone. The decision will be made by a pharmacist (who does not know you) according to a&#xD;
      randomization table. Neither you nor the investigating physician will know whether you are on&#xD;
      sugar pill or medication. At both the beginning and the conclusion of the study you will be&#xD;
      asked to fill out 2 questionnaires to evaluate fatigue and depression and undergo some memory&#xD;
      and speech tests. The testing will take about 2 hours. Actigraphy is a wrist-worn, watch like&#xD;
      device that records activity during waking and sleeping without application of any sensors.&#xD;
      It consists of a movement detector, so it can record movement and non-movement data for a&#xD;
      week or two. You should wear it continuously during wakefulness and sleep as you go about&#xD;
      routine daily activities. You should only take it off if you are going to shower, bathe or&#xD;
      swim. A sleep log is a graph on which, for 2 to 3 weeks, you will record bedtime, approximate&#xD;
      sleep time, times and duration of awakenings during the sleep period, final awakening time,&#xD;
      and naps taken during the day to the best of your knowledge. You will also be asked to avoid&#xD;
      getting pregnant. If you are a woman who may have the potential to get pregnant then a&#xD;
      pregnancy test may be performed at the beginning of the study, before you receive the&#xD;
      medication, at the first follow up visit and when you end the study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female subjects ages 18 - 64 inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Female subjects must be surgically sterile, at least 1 year post menopausal, or agree&#xD;
             to use a medically acceptable form of birth control throughout the study and for 2&#xD;
             weeks following the last study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Diagnosis of relapsing-remitting MS&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. MS and MS symptoms must be stable (no evidence of worsening or of exacerbations) for&#xD;
             at least 3 months prior to screening visit. The date of last recorded exacerbation&#xD;
             will be captured at enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. EDSS score &lt;/= 5&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Diagnosis of fatigue based on fatigue questionnaires, specifically the Fatigue&#xD;
             Descriptive Scale (FDS) in which a score of five higher is considered to be indicative&#xD;
             of fatigue (range 0-13)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Actigraphic evidence of sleep disturbances defined a sleep latency of 30 minutes or&#xD;
             longer, and/or total sleep time of less than 6.5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Finally a CESD score of under 20 (20 or more is suggestive of Major Depression)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnant and breast-feeding women&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects with any history of substance and/or alcohol abuse or dependence within 5&#xD;
             years prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects who are the sole caretaker of infants and young children because they may be&#xD;
             too sedated in the middle of the night in case they need to get up and take care of an&#xD;
             infant or a child.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with past history of allergy to eszopiclone or Zopiclone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with primary progressive Multiple Sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects with impaired cognition as measured by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)&#xD;
             score of 26 or less&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects with history suggestive of another primary sleep disorder including OSAS,&#xD;
             PLMS, or RLS&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Any patients with any known active DSM-IV axis I (i.e. schizophrenia, etc) or any&#xD;
             other psychiatric disorder which would compromise the investigator's ability to&#xD;
             evaluate the safety and efficacy of the study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients 65 years old and older because the drug at the 3 mg dose has not been FDA&#xD;
             approved to be used in this age group.&#xD;
