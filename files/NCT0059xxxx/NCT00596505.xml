  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of severe proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) may require the use of silicone&#xD;
      oil for long-term retinal tamponade to prevent recurrent retinal detachment. Massive bleeding&#xD;
      during surgery before proper release of traction and peri-silicone oil proliferation after&#xD;
      surgery were major causes of surgical failure. The likelihood of reproliferation rises in the&#xD;
      presence of significant preretinal blood. It is therefore crucial to reduce intraoperative&#xD;
      and postoperative preretinal hemorrhage in complicated diabetic vitrectomy with silicone oil&#xD;
      infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravitreal avastin has been noted to induce rapid regression of retinal and iris&#xD;
      neovascularization in proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Further, presurgical administration&#xD;
      of intravitreal avastin may reduce intraoperative bleeding during membrane dissection in PDR&#xD;
      with traction retinal detachment. The pretreatment of avastin may be particularly beneficial&#xD;
      in the treatment of severe active fibrovascular proliferation by decreasing the severity of&#xD;
      intraoperative and postoperative intraocular hemorrhage, leading to better surgical outcome&#xD;
      and early visual rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We conduct a prospective study to evaluate the effect of avastin on the severity of intra-&#xD;
      and post-operative bleeding, frequency of recurrent bleeding, and anatomical and functional&#xD;
      outcome in eyes with severe active PDR undergoing vitrectomy with silicone oil infusion.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      From January 2007 to June 2007, consecutive patients undergoing primary pars plana vitrectomy&#xD;
      with silicone oil infusion for complications of proliferative diabetic retinopathy will be&#xD;
      recruited for the prospective study. The selection criteria are: 1) anticoagulant therapy has&#xD;
      not been used prior to surgery or during post-operative follow-up period; 2) no medical&#xD;
      history of blood diseases associated with abnormal blood coagulation is present. Active PDR&#xD;
      is defined as visible large new vessels within the proliferative tissue with fresh preretinal&#xD;
      and/or vitreous hemorrhage. Decision of silicone oil infusion will be made before surgery&#xD;
      when potential creation of multiple breaks or incomplete traction release is anticipated&#xD;
      during surgery due to severe vitreoretinal adhesion. The morphological criteria set for&#xD;
      silicone oil infusion are: severe active fibrovascular proliferation with broad vitreous&#xD;
      attachment around the disc, arcade and extending to the periphery in at least 2 quadrants&#xD;
      (≥grade 5 in Eliott's grading system);8 presence of macular-off traction or combined traction&#xD;
      and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual recruited patient will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups: group 1 will&#xD;
      receive intravitreal injection of 1.25 mg of avastin (0.05 ml) 7 to 9 days before vitrectomy;&#xD;
      group 2 will not receive avastin pretreatment. Standard 3 port pars plana vitrectomy will be&#xD;
      performed followed by silicone oil (5000 CS) infusion. A total of 30 cases (15 in each group)&#xD;
      will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, patients will be kept in a prone position overnight, then allowed to lie on&#xD;
      either side during sleep thereafter, but maintained a head-down position during waking hours&#xD;
      for 2 weeks. Ophthalmological examinations will be performed in the first 4 days after&#xD;
      surgery, then weekly for 4 weeks, biweekly for 1 month, and then monthly for at least 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data will be collected for each patient.&#xD;
      These demographics and clinical findings include age, gender, study eye, types and duration&#xD;
      of diabetes mellitus, systemic diseases such as hypertension, renal insufficiency (24 hours&#xD;
      creatinine clearance estimated by Cockcroft and Gault equation), degree of intraoperative&#xD;
      bleeding, duration of the surgery, combined lens extraction, and the use of scleral buckle.&#xD;
      Data regarding the extent of preretinal blood in the first postoperative day; time, duration,&#xD;
      frequency and treatment of recurrent vitreous hemorrhage; and the duration of postoperative&#xD;
      follow-up will also be compiled. Results of ophthalmological examinations, including best&#xD;
      corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and lens status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative bleeding will be graded in 3 levels: grade 1 is defined as minor bleeding&#xD;
      stopped either spontaneously or by transient bottle elevation; grade 2 is defined as moderate&#xD;
      bleeding resulting in broad sheaths of clots requiring endodiathermy to the bleeding sites to&#xD;
      stop the bleeding; grade 3 is defined as thick clot formation covering half or more of the&#xD;
      posterior pole or interfering with the surgical plane. Postoperative preretinal blood will be&#xD;
      separated into 3 grades: isolated clots with total area less than 10 disc area and without&#xD;
      involvement of the posterior pole (grade1); broad sheaths of clots with total area more than&#xD;
      10 disc area without involving the posterior pole (grade2); broad sheaths of clots with total&#xD;
      area more than 10 disc area and with involvement of the posterior pole (grade3). Any&#xD;
      noticeable increase of preretinal blood will be defined as recurrent hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The severity of intraoperative bleeding, the extent of immediate postoperative preretinal&#xD;
      blood, reabsorption time of blood around the disc area, total reabsorption time of preretinal&#xD;
      blood, the rate and treatment of recurrent vitreous hemorrhage, and the change of&#xD;
      best-corrected visual acuity will be compared between groups 1 and 2. Visual acuity will be&#xD;
      graded into three levels: low (≤1 meter counting fingers), moderate (&gt;1 meter counting&#xD;
      fingers, but &lt; 20/200), and good (≥ 20/200).&#xD;
