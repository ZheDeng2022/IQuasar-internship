    <textblock>
      Women who undergo bilateral oophorectomy and receive chemotherapy are at risk of increased&#xD;
      bone loss. At present, despite having a risk factor profile that fits the indications for&#xD;
      assessment and treatment there are no routine interventions in this patient population i.e.,&#xD;
      the standard treatment is no treatment. We hope to identify whether or not an intervention&#xD;
      may be favorable in these women and change the standard of care in this vulnerable&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weekly therapy with alendronate + vitamin D (FOSAVANCE) will improve bone health as measured&#xD;
      by DEXA scans in women with gynecologic malignancies undergoing chemotherapy as compared with&#xD;
      patients receiving placebo.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the impact of bisphosphonates on bone mineral density (BMD=primary endpoint)&#xD;
           in women with gynecologic malignancies undergoing chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if bone loss in women with gynecologic malignancies undergoing chemotherapy&#xD;
           is correlated with any of the clinicopathologic parameters gathered in this&#xD;
           investigation i.e., race, tumor stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dramatic bone loss in women during the first five years following cessation of ovarian&#xD;
      function has been well documented (1). It is estimated that greater than 1.5 million&#xD;
      fractures related to osteoporosis (OP) will occur in the US annually (2) and that 33% of&#xD;
      women will have sustained hip fractures by age of 90 years(3). With increasing age also comes&#xD;
      increasing risk of many cancers, including ovarian, uterine, breast, lung, and colon cancers.&#xD;
      23,500 new cases of ovarian cancer and 38,400 new cases of uterine cancer were diagnosed in&#xD;
      the US last year (4). Many of these patients are postmenopausal at the time of diagnosis, and&#xD;
      many enter menopause secondary to surgical resection of the ovaries or chemotherapy prompting&#xD;
      ovarian failure. This population of women therefore, is at significant risk for osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the author's knowledge, there has only been one study examining bone loss in menopausal&#xD;
      women with gynecologic cancers undergoing chemotherapy (5). This was a small (n=25)&#xD;
      prospective observational study with no controlled treatment arm. The authors observed a&#xD;
      higher incidence of baseline bone loss and significant additional loss during chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatment. Bone loss has also been described in breast cancer patients undergoing&#xD;
      chemotherapy (6,7). Laboratory and animal studies demonstrate a deleterious effect of&#xD;
      cytotoxic chemotherapy on protein synthesis and DNA replication, resulting in altered or&#xD;
      diminished bone formation (8-10). We know of no intervention studies in postmenopausal women&#xD;
      with cancer undergoing chemotherapy i.e., comparing different osteoporosis prevention&#xD;
      strategies. Estrogen therapy is often contraindicated in gynecologic malignancies and&#xD;
      alternative treatments for bone loss prevention are not routinely used by gynecologic&#xD;
      oncologists. At present there are no guidelines and/or recommendations in the Gynecologic&#xD;
      Oncology community for preventative treatment of bone loss in individuals undergoing&#xD;
      chemotherapy (not even calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation recommendations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who undergo bilateral oophorectomy and receive chemotherapy are at risk of increased&#xD;
      bone loss. At present, despite having a risk factor profile that fits the indications for&#xD;
      assessment and treatment there are no routine interventions in this patient population i.e.,&#xD;
      the standard treatment is no treatment. We hope to identify whether or not an intervention&#xD;
      may be favorable in these women and change the standard of care in this vulnerable&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of placebo is justified in this investigation as our current standard of care does&#xD;
      not include any treatment for prevention of bone loss during chemotherapy. A recent survey of&#xD;
      our patients in active treatment at the BCCA revealed that only 1 of over 40 patients with&#xD;
      gynecologic malignancies undergoing chemotherapy was taking any medical therapy for bone loss&#xD;
      (Personal communication, J McAlpine J Pike). In order to provide some support for bone&#xD;
      mineral density (BMD), all patients enrolled in this study (treatment and control arms) will&#xD;
      receive Calcium (1000mg) and Vitamin D supplementation (1000 mg) during the 12 month study&#xD;
      period. FOSAVANCE was chosen as the bisphophonate in this investigation as it is the most&#xD;
      popular bisphosphonate in Canada and routinely prescribed to thousands of men and women. It&#xD;
      has undergone rigorous scrutiny at the federal and provincial levels. Recently, Vitamin D has&#xD;
      received considerable press for its &quot;anti-cancer&quot; activity in addition to its known&#xD;
      contribution to bone growth and remodeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized prospective trial in which women who have undergone surgery for&#xD;
      pathology confirmed ovarian (or more rarely advanced stage endometrial) malignancy and&#xD;
      scheduled to initiate 6 cycles of chemotherapy (without radiation) will be asked to&#xD;
      participate. The primary outcome measured will be change in bone mineral density on&#xD;
      consecutive DEXA scans as compared to baseline. All of these patients will have undergone&#xD;
      removal of their ovaries bilaterally. Some patients may have entered menopause naturally many&#xD;
      years prior to surgical resection of their ovaries. Patients will be told that there will be&#xD;
      no difference in their chemotherapy regimen, nor any perceived impact of bisphosphonates on&#xD;
      the success of chemotherapy in treating their disease process. Patients fitting the inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria (including blood tests and bone scan criteria) and consenting to&#xD;
      participate will be randomized to receive either weekly oral FOSAVANCE 70 mg alendronate/2800&#xD;
      IU cholecalciferol or placebo for the 12 months of the study duration. All patients will&#xD;
      receive calcium 1000 mg and vitamin D supplementation 1000 IU daily throughout the study&#xD;
      period. Bone DEXA scans will be obtained at baseline (post-surgery and prior to initiation of&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic regimen), and after 6 and 12 months of treatment and comparisons made&#xD;
      between BMD in the treatment vs. placebo groups. The use of placebo is justified in this&#xD;
      investigation as our current standard of care does not include any treatment for prevention&#xD;
      of bone loss during chemotherapy. Internationally, there is no recommendation in our&#xD;
      subspecialty to do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters will be collected on the enrolled patients: Age, race,&#xD;
      tobacco/smoking history, height/weight/BMI, chemotherapeutic regimen, past medical history,&#xD;
      tumor stage, grade, histology, complications, blood loss, length of hospital stay, 24 hour&#xD;
      creatinine clearance, and serum albumin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, , family history of osteoporosis and/or spinal or hip fractures, blood sampling&#xD;
      for alkaline phosphatase, calcium and 25(OH)vitamin D levels and a DEXA scan (bone scan) at&#xD;
      0, 6, and 12 months with bone mineral density (BMD) measurements of lumbar spine, left hip,&#xD;
      and femoral neck (T and Z-scores) will be obtained. These parameters are of specific interest&#xD;
      as they relate to the patients bone health and risk factors for bone loss. DEXA scans of&#xD;
      individual patients at 6 and 12 months will be compared to their starting/baseline DEXA, and&#xD;
      the differences in measurements then compared between patients in the treatment vs. placebo&#xD;
      arms. Careful monitoring of patients subjective complaints/comments, complete physical&#xD;
      examinations, and monthly laboratory work will be closely monitored throughout the study&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: THERE IS NO INTERVENTION IN THIS INVESTIGATION THAT ALTERS THE POSTOPERATIVE CARE,&#xD;
      CLINIC VISITS, CHEMOTHERAPY REGIMEN OR DURATION OF TREATMENT IN THESE PATIENTS AS COMPARED TO&#xD;
      OUR STANDARD OF CARE. Patients are free to remove themselves from the study at any time with&#xD;
      no compromise to their management.&#xD;

      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients recruited for this study come from the Gynecologic Oncology clinic via&#xD;
      referrals/consultations and are patients of the primary and co-investigators in this study.&#xD;
      Prior to enrollment, the investigators will have pathology results and will have made a&#xD;
      decision as to whether or not patients require further chemotherapy for their disease&#xD;
      process. If the basic inclusion and exclusion criteria are met by&#xD;
      demographic/medical/pathology parameters and the patient is interested and has consented for&#xD;
      the study, the additional blood work and bone scan will be obtained to ensure that all&#xD;
      criteria have been met. All investigators and support staff will be available to review the&#xD;
      protocol in detail with patients and phone numbers given to call us with any additional&#xD;
      questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no research nurse or BCCA resources used for this protocol. All discussion of the&#xD;
      consent will be done by the PI or one of the Co-investigators. Labs outside of routine BCCA&#xD;
      orders (i.e., vitamin D levels) will be done at an outside facility as will DEXA scans and&#xD;
      data analysis. Drug/placebo will be delivered by the principal investigator and no pharmacy&#xD;
      services are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a project looking to detect a 2-3% difference in BMD on DEXA scans as compared to the&#xD;
      individuals' baseline DEXA. Based on previous data 11 and our own power analysis this will be&#xD;
      achievable with a sample size of 30 patients in each arm (treatment vs. placebo) to ensure&#xD;
      sufficient power (Kalloger Consulting, Inc). Our initial analysis will be performed after 30&#xD;
      patients have been randomized (15 FOSAVANCE, 15 placebo). Iif a clear advantage is&#xD;
      demonstrated in the treatment group, the trial will be completed and treatment will be&#xD;
      offered to all patients undergoing chemotherapy for gynecologic malignancies. If the&#xD;
      difference is not yet statistically significant but a favorable trend is suggested we will&#xD;
      enroll further patients in order to sufficiently power this series, again with the above&#xD;
      specified goal of detecting a 2-3% difference in BMD, considered of clinical signficiance in&#xD;
      the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple parameters will be collected (outlined page 2) for descriptive statistics and&#xD;
      bivariate analysis, testing for an association of osteoporosis and clinicopathologic and&#xD;
      laboratory risk factors. These will be compared between the treatment and control arms to&#xD;
      ensure both groups are representative and without potential confounding variables. Paired&#xD;
      t-tests will be performed using statistical software (SAS) for the comparison of baseline, 6&#xD;
      and 12-month BMD values, with a significance level of 0.05 and a power of 0.80.&#xD;
