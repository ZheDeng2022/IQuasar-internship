      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase II dose(s) and&#xD;
           schedule of MSX-122&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To characterize the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and determine the overall safety and&#xD;
           tolerability of MSX-122&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of orally administered MSX-122&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the preliminary evidence for anti-tumor activity of MSX-122&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To perform correlative studies to elucidate signaling pathways involved in CXCR4&#xD;
           activation in blood and optional tissue specimens by IHC (immunohistochemistry) and RPPA&#xD;
           (reverse phase protein microarrays)&#xD;

    <description>Dosage form = capsule&#xD;
Starting Dose (First Patient Cohort - Dose Level 1) = 50 mg taken orally once daily, 7 days per week for 4 weeks (total of 28 days), followed immediately by a second course of 28 days with identical dosage form and schedule. (Each patient in each cohort treated for a minimum of 56 days, unless obviated by toxicity.)&#xD;
If there is no evidence of toxicity at the current dose level, then the dose of MSX-122 will be increased by 100% for the next patient cohort.&#xD;
If a grade 1-2 toxicity is observed, then the dose will be increased by 50% for the next patient cohort.&#xD;
If a grade 3 toxicity (non-dose limiting toxicity) is observed then the dose will be increased by 25% for the next patient cohort.</description>
