    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the type of surgery (orthopaedic, general&#xD;
      surgery, thoracic, etc.) affects the level of cytokines and thus potentially the risk of&#xD;
      multisystem organ failure.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      There is still debate concerning the appropriate timing of stabilization of long bone&#xD;
      fractures in patients with thoracic trauma2. While most surgeons agree that definitive&#xD;
      stabilization within 24 hours of injury is optimal, this is sometimes not possible nor wise.&#xD;
      When early definitive stabilization is not possible, there are differences between accepted&#xD;
      practice between European and North American surgeons. European surgeons prefer to wait five&#xD;
      days until definitive treatment, citing literature from Pape6 concerning the increased&#xD;
      incidence of pulmonary complications and multi-system organ failure (MOF) which is purported&#xD;
      to be higher in patients who undergo stabilization during the two to four day window. Pape&#xD;
      postulates that this may be in part due to a &quot;second hit&quot; to the inflammatory system. He&#xD;
      cites an increase in IL-6 and TNFÎ± in patients who are operated during this window.&#xD;
&#xD;
      North American surgeons tend to operate whenever it is felt that the patient is stable enough&#xD;
      to undergo surgical stabilization from a trauma surgery standpoint. Much less emphasis is&#xD;
      placed on the &quot;second hit&quot; etiology of multi-system organ failure. More emphasis in this&#xD;
      country is placed on the fat embolism theory of MOF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several flaws in the European literature which leave North American surgeons&#xD;
      unconvinced that delay is better in this population. First, Pape's large retrospective study&#xD;
      which reported on 4313 patients treated between 1975 and 1999 did not take into account the&#xD;
      dramatic changes in the management of critically ill patients which occurred during this time&#xD;
      interval. The conclusion that patients treated later in the study with the concept of &quot;damage&#xD;
      control orthopaedics&quot; may have had better outcomes because of improved ventilatory or&#xD;
      resuscitative techniques, rather than because of the timing of secondary surgery. In another&#xD;
      study, he made the conclusion that patients operated between days two and four had a worse&#xD;
      outcome than those operated after four days. Patients with a poor outcome also correlated&#xD;
      with elevated IL-6 levels on admission. This study was a prospective cohort study with&#xD;
      patients selected for early versus delayed treatment based on the convenience of getting to&#xD;
      the operating room and the patient's general condition. This study did not control for other&#xD;
      surgical procedures which may have been performed during the time periods studied. While&#xD;
      compelling, this study should be repeated using randomized controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is considerable literature1,4,7-10 which suggests that MOF is related to an&#xD;
      inflammatory mediated chain of events. Most inflammatory markers are elevated in trauma, and&#xD;
      IL-6 seems to be one which may be of prime importance in this cascade of events. It has been&#xD;
      shown that surgery of many kinds increases IL-6 levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, there is evidence that there is a genetic predisposition3,5 toward producing&#xD;
      high levels of cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a pilot study performed at UAB, we have found that there is an increased risk of&#xD;
      developing multisystem organ failure in patients undergoing long bone fracture fixation as&#xD;
      compared to those undergoing other types of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because a rapid processing is required for the initial blood draw (within 1 - 2 hours of&#xD;
      injury) to allow for an optimized analysis, it is of utmost importance that the research team&#xD;
      be allowed to immediately collect and process any remnant of the routine blood draw of an ER&#xD;
      trauma patient. This may occur prior to the consenting process. Should the patient refuse to&#xD;
      give consent to active blood collection, the samples used for the initial processing will be&#xD;
      sanitized of any identifying information and then discarded in an appropriate manner. After&#xD;
      the initial blood sample processing, and prior to analysis being performed on that sample,&#xD;
      the patient will be consented for permission to collect blood samples daily while in the&#xD;
      hospital until hospital day 7. During this time, a single vial of blood will be collected and&#xD;
      stored each day. Concurrently, patient data such as demographic data, medical record number,&#xD;
      mechanism of injury, list of surgeries and corresponding surgical data such as type, time and&#xD;
      length of surgery will be collected in an encrypted database. After approximately 100&#xD;
      patients have been enrolled, we will examine the database and select age, sex and injury&#xD;
      severity score-matched patients to include in the analysis of blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These blood samples will be run for cytokines using a commercially-available cytokine panel&#xD;
      and a SNP panel (single-nucleotide polymorphism) to determine if that patient is a&#xD;
      hyper-responder for cytokine production. These samples will be statistically analyzed to&#xD;
      determine if the genetic profile (SNP) can predict cytokine response and secondarily to&#xD;
      predict the change in daily cytokine levels based on the type of surgery each patient had.&#xD;
