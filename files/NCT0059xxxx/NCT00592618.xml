      Sleep studies in ESRD patients have identified increased prevalence of Sleep Apnea. Based on&#xD;
      current knowledge, treatment aimed at reducing oxidative stress might improve Sleep Apnea in&#xD;
      HD patients. The aim of our study is to investigate the effect of N-acetylsysteine on Sleep&#xD;
      Apnea in HD patients.&#xD;

      Background Cardiovascular disease is the commonest cause of morbidity and mortality in&#xD;
      chronic dialysis patients [1]. Sleep studies in ESRD patients have identified increased&#xD;
      prevalence of sleep apnea (SA), both obstructive (OSA) and central (CSA) in origin [2]. The&#xD;
      reported prevalence of SA in patients with ESRD ranges from 50% to 70% [3], which is&#xD;
      dramatically higher than the estimated prevalence of 2% to 4% in the general population [4].&#xD;
      SA has been recognized as a novel risk factor for cardiovascular disease in general&#xD;
      population [5]. Recent evidence showed that severity of SA in hemodialysis patients is&#xD;
      associated with severity of coronary artery calcifications [6]. Underlying mechanisms by&#xD;
      which SA adversely affects cardiovascular morbidity and mortality have not been fully&#xD;
      established yet. The presence of untreated SA may further impair fluid balance,&#xD;
      cardiovascular function and increase mortality through abnormal vagal or sympatomimetic&#xD;
      responces and hypoxia [7]. One intriguing possibility is oxidative stress, which has been&#xD;
      implicated in cardiovascular disease in patients with ESRD [8]. Recent study demonstrated&#xD;
      association between SA and decreased antioxidant status in hemodialysis patients [6].&#xD;
      Repeated apnea-related hypoxic events in patients with SA may trigger elevated oxidative&#xD;
      stress [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general population, the treatment of SA with CPAP improves oxygenation during sleep and&#xD;
      quality of life [10]. In the ESRD population, CPAP was used in a very preliminary study on 8&#xD;
      patients with some improvement in nocturnal oxygenation and 5 of 6 patients reported improved&#xD;
      daytime alertness [11]. Unfortunately, CPAP application itself may be stressful, poorly&#xD;
      tolerated and so disturb night sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hanly and Pierratos suggested that SA in hemodialysis patients may be a consequence of&#xD;
      inadequate treatment of uremia by standard 4-hours thrice-weekly HD procedure [12]. This&#xD;
      group reported that intensive nocturnal HD for 8 hours 6-7 times per week reduced the&#xD;
      severity of SA, although their patients continued to suffer from frequent arousals,&#xD;
      diminished sleep time, REM sleep and sleep efficiency [12]. Restoration of normal kidney&#xD;
      function by transplantation may lead to reversal of SA [13, 14].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several experimental and clinical studies showed that increased oxidative stress in dialysis&#xD;
      patients may be due to inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis by ADMA (Asymmetric&#xD;
      Dimethylarginine ), known to be endogenous inhibitor of NO synthetase [15]. ADMA may be&#xD;
      significantly reduced by dialysis [16]. Metabolism of ADMA is primarily by the enzyme DDAH ,&#xD;
      which activity is decreased by inflammation, oxidative stress, diabetes mellitus and&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia [17 ]. It was proposed that circulating ADMA may be one mechanism&#xD;
      accounting for the resistant hypertension and overfluid in dialysis patients [17 ].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on current knowledge, treatment aimed at reducing oxidative stress should decrease ADMA&#xD;
      levels [17 ], and it is logical to suggest that such a therapy might improve SA in HD&#xD;
      patients. One preliminary study on effect of antioxidant Vitamin E showed a small beneficial&#xD;
      effect on ADMA in chronic kidney disease [19 ].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our opinion, it is worth to check an ability of antioxidant therapy to produce a favorable&#xD;
      effect on parameters of SA in dialysis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is an active antioxidant proved to be safe and beneficial in&#xD;
      hemodialysis patents [19]. In our recent study, NAC effectively reduced the ototoxic effect&#xD;
      of gentamicin in chronic hemodialysis patients [20, 21]. Cheap and safe drug therapy may&#xD;
      appear more cost effective than such resource consuming therapies as CPAP and not readily&#xD;
      available treatments as prolong every night hemodialysis or kidney transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to investigate the effect of N-acetylsysteine on SA in HD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. Study population. The study will include 20 patients with ESRD, treated with chronic&#xD;
      hemodialysis in Assaf Harofeh Medical Center and suffering from sleep disturbances, such as&#xD;
      frequent arousals, snoring, daytime sleepiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be excluded from the study if they are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recently started treated with chronic dialysis: less than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Survived recent major illness, requiring hospitalisation in the last 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients with acute renal failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Currently treated with antioxidants ( NAC, vitamin E ets.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Current use of sleep pills Study protocol. We planned this study as a prospective&#xD;
           cross-sectional study where every patient will serve as his/her own control. Al the&#xD;
           patients will continue their previous dialysis and drugs regimen. The presence and&#xD;
           severity of SA will be accessed using the overnight polysomnography in the Sleep&#xD;
           Laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After performance of baseline overnight polysomnography the patients will receive orally NAC&#xD;
      1200 mg x 2/day for 4 weeks. At the end of this therapy, a follow up overnight&#xD;
      polysomnography examination will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical monitoring of all the patients will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Blood Pressure and Heart Rate - at each dialysis session 3 times a week. .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Review of medications and doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Body weight - at each dialysis session 3 times a week&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Dialysis adequacy: Kt/V at study start and end.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Biochemical studies: full chemistry, bicarbonate, ADMA, DDAH, NO - both at baseline and&#xD;
           follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The statistical analysis will be performed using the statistical&#xD;
      software SPSS-version 10. Parametric data will be expressed as means Â± standard deviation and&#xD;
      compared by the standard t-test. Non-parametric data will be compared using chi square test.&#xD;
      p value of 0.05 or less will be considered significant.&#xD;
