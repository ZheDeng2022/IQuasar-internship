  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The genetics of lactase divides the population into 2 phenotypes: Those who can(LP) and those&#xD;
      who cannot(LNP)digest lactose. This division may help modify disease risks according to&#xD;
      geographic population distribution. At least some of the putative mechanism of risk&#xD;
      modification may relate to an effect of undigested lactose on lower intestinal bacteria. The&#xD;
      effect may provide for support of beneficial microbes. The amount of lactose reaching the&#xD;
      colon is made easier in LNP than LP subjects who have to consume larger amounts to have&#xD;
      meaningful spillover into the lower bowel.The current study examines whether there are&#xD;
      quantifiable qualitative fecal bacterial differences to a standard intake of lactose(milk&#xD;
      sugar)between these 2 different phenotypic populations. Finding of differences would lend&#xD;
      support to the notion that for some diseases LP and LNP subjects face different risks even in&#xD;
      an area of uniform disease risk if they consume lactose (found in dairy foods).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point is comparison of 4 groups of specific bacteria between LP and LNP&#xD;
      participants before and after 2 weeks of lactose(in powder form mixed in water) consumption.&#xD;
      Classification is based on genetic analysis and secondarily on breath hydrogen results.&#xD;
      Results are compared within groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome is comparison of 4 groups of bacteria between LP and LNP subjects&#xD;
      against each group of stool samples obtained on the first visit. Results are obtained between&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional information and other secondary outcomes are to evaluate any relationship between&#xD;
      diet intake and the 4 groups of bacteria on the first visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another outcome will be to compare within groups any effect of lactose consumption on insulin&#xD;
      and glucose levels within the 2 groups.&#xD;

      Healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 49 are recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Each participant fills a lactose targetting diet questionnaire(3 day recall).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A 50g lactose challenge tets is administered,breath hydrogen and symptoms are recorded&#xD;
           for 4.5hrs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Blood is drawn for analysis of lactase genetic status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A stool sample is collected(10-15g)and analysed fo total anaerobes, enterococci,&#xD;
           bifidobacteria and lactobacilli.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. All subjects are withdrawn from dairy foods(calcium replacement suggested in diet) for 2&#xD;
           weeks and are aked to return to repeat parts 2 and 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. A voluntary segment has glucose and insulin measured for 4 hrs via an indwelling venous&#xD;
           catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Subjects are asked to consume 50g lactose in divided doses for 2 further weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. At the end they return and repeat sections 2 and 4 for the third time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Participants who volunteered to have glucose and insulin measured repeat this segment of&#xD;
           the study as well.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in arm 1 are grouped as lactose digesters based on genetic analysis and breath hydrogen results. In discrepant cases the genetic status is accepted. Arm 1 is initially withdrawn from dairy foods(lactose) and then asked to consume lactose 50g in divided doses mixed in water for 2 weeks.</description>
