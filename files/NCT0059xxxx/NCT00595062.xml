  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was started to validate the possibility of administering radiation therapy during&#xD;
      surgery to the tissue surrounding the tumor once the tumor has been removed. This surrounding&#xD;
      breast tissue is at greater risk for developing breast recurrences. This treatment may be as&#xD;
      effective as the conventional 5-6week radiation treatment in reducing the risk of further&#xD;
      local recurrences after breast-conserving surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through this study, we would like to confirm that this procedure is a safe alternative to&#xD;
      conventional breast radiation, with no additional side effects when compared with the&#xD;
      conventional surgery and radiation therapy.&#xD;

      This pilot trial will evaluate the feasibility of intra operative radiation therapy (IORT)&#xD;
      given in one fraction at the time of wide local excision as the only adjuvant radiation&#xD;
      treatment in a group of patients with early-stage invasive breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll 60 women, older than 60 years of age, with breast cancer not more than&#xD;
      2 cm in size and without evident additional tumoral foci around the tumor or in other areas&#xD;
      of the breast. An MSK radiologist will review your mammography to be sure you qualify for&#xD;
      this study. You may be asked to undergo additional mammography or other examinations, such as&#xD;
      breast ultrasound in order to verify that the tumor is located in a single quadrant of the&#xD;
      breast. Some of these procedures are routinely performed in all candidates for conservative&#xD;
      breast surgery.&#xD;
