      The purpose of this study is to perform ground-based research to study what happens to the&#xD;
      heart muscle in space. People who have problems with their aortic valve have an increase in&#xD;
      the amount of muscle in the left ventricle of the heart. After valve surgery, the amount of&#xD;
      muscle should decrease and return to normal. Astronauts lose heart muscle mass during space&#xD;
      flight. Our study will look at these changes in your heart, which we believe are similar to&#xD;
      what happens during long term space travel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will look at the accuracy of three dimensional ultrasound imaging (echo) in&#xD;
      monitoring the changes in heart size and function following aortic valve replacement. We are&#xD;
      studying ways to prevent health-related problems that men and women will face on&#xD;
      long-duration space missions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that serial two dimensional and three dimensional echo will show accurate&#xD;
      changes in the left ventricle mass and volume following aortic valve replacement for aortic&#xD;
      stenosis or regurgitation&#xD;

      Diagnostic Three Dimensional Echocardiography Study Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Aims The overall purpose of this study is to perform ground-based research, development,&#xD;
      and validation aimed at optimizing diagnostic ultrasound in manned spaceflight, with the&#xD;
      following unifying hypothesis: Serial 3D ultrasound examinations will enhance diagnostic&#xD;
      capabilities in manned spaceflight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To optimize acquisition methods for 3D sonography using reconstruction and real-time&#xD;
           techniques&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the utility of serial 3D ultrasound examinations in identifying renal&#xD;
           calculi and their complications including the development and resolution of&#xD;
           hydronephrosis and calyceal dilatation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the utility of serial 2D and 3D ultrasound examinations in demonstrating&#xD;
           cardiac remodeling (changes in cardiac dimensions, volume, mass and function) and&#xD;
           defining its determinants after left ventricular unloading following aortic valve&#xD;
           replacement for aortic stenosis or regurgitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine whether changes in plasma BNP levels accurately reflect changes in LV mass&#xD;
           and volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Serial 3D ultrasound examinations will allow accurate diagnosis of nephrolithiasis and&#xD;
           tracking of complications including hydronephrosis and calyceal dilatation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Serial 2D and 3D ultrasound will allow accurate tracking of changes in LV mass and&#xD;
           volume following aortic valve replacement (AVR) for aortic stenosis or regurgitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Changes in plasma BNP levels will fall in proportion to the decrease in LV mass and&#xD;
           volume.&#xD;
