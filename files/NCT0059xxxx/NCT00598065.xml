      The purpose of this study is to see if researchers can improve the detection of lung cancer&#xD;
      by using a new method which will help us to take multiple snapshot images of the lungs while&#xD;
      the patient is breathing. We are also investigating whether with the help of this new method&#xD;
      we can better measure the actual amount of radioactivity that is taken up by the cancer. The&#xD;
      name of this new method is respiratory gated PET/CT. Previous research has shown that PET&#xD;
      scans may be useful in investigating whether cancer has spread to other parts of the lung or&#xD;
      body. Using our standard method, smaller cancers are sometimes difficult to detect in the&#xD;
      lungs because the PET images are taken over several minutes and the patient is breathing&#xD;
      during that time. That means the cancer may appear &quot;blurred&quot; on the images (like a poor&#xD;
      photograph) or may not be identified at all. In this study, in addition to the images that&#xD;
      were ordered by your doctor, we will take additional images of your lungs while you are&#xD;
      following a breathing command (&quot;breath in-hold-breath out&quot;). We will then compare the images&#xD;
      of your cancer during the regular PET study with those taken during the breathing commands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses to be tested in this pilot study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Respiratory gated image acquisition reduces partial volume effects on PET image that may&#xD;
           render lung lesions undetectable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Breath-hold CT may detect small lung lesions that are beyond the limit of detection in&#xD;
           shallow-breathing CT scans, related to respiratory motion which causes blurring&#xD;
           artifacts around smaller lung lesions.&#xD;

      Positron emission tomography is now a clinically accepted imaging modality for the evaluation&#xD;
      of pulmonary nodules as well as for the staging of patients with lung cancer. PET imaging&#xD;
      with the radiotracer 18 Fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) has a high accuracy for the&#xD;
      differentiation between benign and malignant lung lesions and for the detection of nodal&#xD;
      metastases. This is because malignant tumors are characterized by an increase in glucose&#xD;
      metabolism as compared to most normal tissues. In clinical practice, PET images are&#xD;
      interpreted visually or semiquantitatively, using a standardized uptake value (SUV). Previous&#xD;
      studies have shown that SUV thresholds can be used with high accuracy to distinguish between&#xD;
      benign and malignant lesions that exhibit increased uptake of FDG. In addition, the SUV is&#xD;
      frequently used as a surrogate marker for the evaluation of a response to chemo- or radiation&#xD;
      therapy. Unfortunately, the accuracy of SUV measurements may be affected by lesion motion&#xD;
      during the image acquisition. This is a particular problem in PET imaging of the lung. Normal&#xD;
      respiratory motion, and hence lesion motion, causes a smearing effect, whereby the&#xD;
      concentration of radiotracer within a given lesion is spread out over a larger area. For the&#xD;
      same reason small lesions and lesions with relatively low uptake of radiotracer may become&#xD;
      undetectable during normal breathing (partial volume effect). PET images are acquired for&#xD;
      several minutes, image acquisition during breath hold is therefore not an option for clinical&#xD;
      scans. However recently published work from UCLA (Auerbach et al. J Nucl Med., February 2006)&#xD;
      shows that 3 lesions per patient on average can be missed on shallow breathing scans compared&#xD;
      to breath-hold CT scans. These lesions did not show any FDG uptake on clinical PET scans. The&#xD;
      goal of this pilot study is to evaluate whether respiratory gating during PET image&#xD;
      acquisition enables the detection of those lesions which are identified during the&#xD;
      breath-hold CT scan.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age â‰¥ 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have at least one lung lesion or lung cancer on prior chest Xray or&#xD;
             chest CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sign informed consent. Eligible patients should give their consent at the beginning of&#xD;
             the clinical PET scan. Following clinical CT and PET scans, breathhold CT should&#xD;
             follow. Then, these breath-hold CT images will be reviewed by one of the investigating&#xD;
             physicians to determine if the patient qualifies for the study. If there is a small&#xD;
             lesion (&lt; 5 mm) gated PET images will be acquired.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are unable to follow breathing instructions either due to language&#xD;
             difficulties or hearing impairment This will be determined by one of the consenting&#xD;
             individuals when they approach the patient to ask for informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are too ill to hold their breath.&#xD;
