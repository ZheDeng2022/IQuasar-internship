      The study will evaluate the effectiveness of a standardized EEG method with the intended&#xD;
      clinical users in the intended clinical settings with the intended population (patients who&#xD;
      would typically receive a clinician's evaluation for ADHD). Multiple sites will be examined&#xD;
      to provide a sample of patients across numerous communities with different demographics. The&#xD;
      goal is to evaluate if the predictive accuracy of EEG will not be inferior to that of a&#xD;
      widely-used and extensively validated ADHD scale in the prediction of ADHD in the intended&#xD;
      use population as evaluated by Best Estimate Diagnosis.&#xD;

        The study focuses on individuals who have consecutively presented to participating clinics&#xD;
        with suspected attention and/or behavior concerns and would receive a clinician's&#xD;
        comprehensive evaluation for ADHD. The study population includes male and female&#xD;
        participants aged 6-17.99 years regardless of race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic origin.&#xD;
        Because of inclusion of patients with consecutive presentation to provide a representative&#xD;
        clinical sample, the exact numbers for sub-groups will not be controlled. The study&#xD;
        population will include patients with comorbid conditions. The non-ADHD subgroup will&#xD;
        include patients with other causes of attentional concerns, which may include other common&#xD;
        psychiatric disorders, organic causes of attention problems (such as poor hearing, vision&#xD;
        disturbances, remote head injury, substance abuse), and/or no diagnosis.&#xD;
