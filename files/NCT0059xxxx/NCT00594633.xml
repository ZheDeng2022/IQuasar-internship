  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A significant number of brain tumor patients who received radiation or chemotherapy have&#xD;
      thinking problems as a result of their treatment. The purpose of this study is to find out if&#xD;
      treatment with Aricept (donepezil) may improve some aspects of thinking abilities in patients&#xD;
      with brain tumors who received radiation or chemotherapy. This research will also study&#xD;
      whether persons having particular genes for a blood-borne substance called apolipoprotein E&#xD;
      (APOE) are more likely to have thinking problems after radiation or chemotherapy treatment&#xD;
      for their brain tumors. The findings of this study will help us find out whether Aricept can&#xD;
      improve thinking abilities after cancer treatment, and whether some of the thinking&#xD;
      difficulties may be in part related to having certain genes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A significant proportion of brain tumor patients treated with radiation or chemotherapy who&#xD;
      are in disease remission experience cognitive sequelae from their treatment. Cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction can be of sufficient severity to interfere with their ability to function at&#xD;
      premorbid professional and social levels. There are, however, no approved pharmacological&#xD;
      interventions for improving cognitive functions in cancer patients who display&#xD;
      treatment-related cognitive deficits. Donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, has been&#xD;
      shown to provide cognitive and functional benefits in patients with Alzheimer's disease,&#xD;
      vascular dementia, and in patients with other neurological diseases without known cholinergic&#xD;
      deficiency. The proposed pilot study will examine the efficacy of donepezil in improving&#xD;
      cognitive functions in adult brain tumor patients treated with radiation and/or chemotherapy&#xD;
      who have mild to moderate cognitive difficulties. Neuropsychological measures of executive,&#xD;
      psychomotor speed, attention, and memory abilities will be administered prior to, during and&#xD;
      following donepezil therapy. The proposed study will also test the hypothesis that the&#xD;
      apolipoprotein E (APOE) e-4 allele correlates with the development of cognitive impairment&#xD;
      after radiation or chemotherapy treatments. The proposed investigation is unprecedented and&#xD;
      may provide preliminary information about (1) a pharmacological therapy that could improve&#xD;
      cognitive functions in this population, and (2) a genetic risk factor that may increase&#xD;
      vulnerability to radiation or chemotherapy-induced cognitive decline.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will undergo a brief cognitive evaluation prior to (baseline/Time 1), Cognitive Re-Evaluation (about 12 weeks after Time 1), Cognitive Re-Evaluation (about 12 weeks after Time 2) ,Cognitive Re-Evaluation (about 6 months after discontinuation of Donepezil). Then pt will be tx with donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. They will undergo a four-week dose titration (i.e., 5mg QD during weeks 1-4) to reach a final dose of 10mg QD of oral donepezil there after for a maximum of 24 weeks.</description>
