  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to determine whether acamprosate is more effective at&#xD;
      providing relief for tinnitus than a placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acamprosate has been suggested to be effective in reducing tinnitus annoyance in a&#xD;
      preliminary study. Study evidence indicates that tinnitus is related to increased excitatory&#xD;
      spontaneous brain activities. Acamprosate may help restore the excitatory/inhibitory balance&#xD;
      in the brain and thus reduce tinnitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study includes three phases. The first phase is an open-label screening study&#xD;
      used to identify tinnitus subjects responding to acamprosate. These responding subjects will&#xD;
      enter the second phase, which is a double blind, placebo-controlled study aimed at confirming&#xD;
      the subjects' responses to acamprosate. In the third phase, clinical parameters of both&#xD;
      responders and non-responders will be compared using a multi-linear regression model to&#xD;
      determine characteristics that define the sub-group of tinnitus patients that are likely to&#xD;
      benefit from acamprosate treatment. Participation in the study requires that individuals come&#xD;
      to Portland, Oregon at least 6 times over 16 months for evaluation and data collection.&#xD;

      The current study includes three phases. The first phase is an open-label screening study&#xD;
      used to identify tinnitus subjects responding to acamprosate. These responding subjects will&#xD;
      enter the second phase, which is a double blind, placebo-controlled study aimed at confirming&#xD;
      the subjects' responses to acamprosate. In the third phase, clinical parameters of both&#xD;
      responders and non-responders will be compared using a multi-linear regression model to&#xD;
      determine characteristics that define the sub-group of tinnitus patients that are likely to&#xD;
      benefit from acamprosate treatment. Participation in the study requires that individuals come&#xD;
      to Portland, Oregon at least 6 times over 16 months for evaluation and data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements: Subjects will be brought in for baseline evaluation for Phase II four weeks&#xD;
      after finishing their course of acamprosate during Phase I. Subjects will receive a full&#xD;
      audiometric evaluation. Subjects with active otologic disease at that time will be excused.&#xD;
      Tinnitus pitch and loudness matching per Johnson and Goodwin, (1981) will be performed noting&#xD;
      octave confusion. Loudness matching will be performed using a 1 kHz tone presented to the ear&#xD;
      contralateral to the tinnitus of interest to minimize complications tinnitus was often too&#xD;
      high a level to test (beyond the limits of the equipment). This problem occurs less often&#xD;
      when using a 1 kHz comparison tone because most subjects have reasonable auditory thresholds&#xD;
      at that frequency. Minimum masking levels (MML) will be determined by measuring the level at&#xD;
      which a 2 kHz to 12 kHz band of noise completely masks the tinnitus in the ipsilateral ear.&#xD;
      Residual inhibition or post-masking change testing will be conducted at the end of the&#xD;
      tinnitus testing. The 2 kHz to 12 kHz band of noise will be elevated to 10 dB above the MML&#xD;
      (if tolerable) and remain on continuously in the ear ipsilateral to the tinnitus for 60&#xD;
      seconds. At that point, the masking will be turned off and the subject will be asked to&#xD;
      identify any changes in their perceived tinnitus. If partial or complete residual inhibition&#xD;
      occurs, their duration will be timed with a stopwatch and recorded. Subjects will also be&#xD;
      instructed to complete VAS scores for tinnitus loudness and annoyance, the Tinnitus Handicap&#xD;
      Inventory (THI; Newman et al, 1996) which is a 25-item questionnaire that is currently the&#xD;
      most widely used estimator of the impact of tinnitus on an individual daily life, and the&#xD;
      Maudsley Obsessional-Compulsive Inventory (MOCI; Rachman and Hodgson, 1980) questionnaire,&#xD;
      which will not be used as a primary outcome measurement, but will be used in the multiple&#xD;
      linear regression analysis of Phase III. Upon completing Phase II of the study, the subjects&#xD;
      who do not experience improvements in their tinnitus from acamprosate will be given&#xD;
      information about other tinnitus management options and given the opportunity to be evaluated&#xD;
      and managed at the OHSU Tinnitus Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures for Phase II will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rated tinnitus loudness: VAS scores for tinnitus loudness Rated tinnitus loudness: VAS scores&#xD;
      for tinnitus annoyance Tinnitus Severity: Tinnitus Handicap Index Matched tinnitus loudness:&#xD;
      Loudness match re: 1kHz tone in the contralateral ear to tinnitus (unless subject has&#xD;
      bilateral or unilateral profound hearing loss) Minimum Masking Level: MML with broad band&#xD;
      noise in ipsilateral ear to tinnitus (unless subject has bilateral or unilateral profound&#xD;
      hearing loss) The Prototype 2 of the Tinnitus Functional Index is a 30-question evaluation&#xD;
      tool currently under development with funding from the Tinnitus Research Consortium through a&#xD;
      multi-center study hosted by the OHRC. The TFI will serve as a secondary outcome measure of&#xD;
      tinnitus severity in Phases II and III. Thus far in development, the TFI has demonstrated&#xD;
      good reliability, validity and high sensitivity to measuring treatment-related changes in&#xD;
      tinnitus severity (responsiveness). The TFI has not been published, but the investigators&#xD;
      believe that it would be beneficial to this study and provide an opportunity to use the TFI&#xD;
      in a new clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes measures and the MOCI and TFI will be recorded five times during the&#xD;
      study: At the baseline visit (Figure 1, beginning of period 3), at the end of the first 24&#xD;
      weeks (between periods 3 and 4), at the end of the wash out period (between periods 4 and 5),&#xD;
      at the end of the second 24-week period (end of period 5) and 4 weeks after the completion of&#xD;
      the Phase I trial. All audiometric and tinnitus measures and the questionnaire scores will be&#xD;
      entered into the PATS data base.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short-term vs. long-term measures: Tinnitus loudness matching and MML measures provide&#xD;
      quantitative measures about the immediate status of a subject's tinnitus. Loudness and&#xD;
      annoyance are more integrative, depending on the subject's perception of the tinnitus, but&#xD;
      are still reflective of the immediate tinnitus conditions of the subject. THI and TFI&#xD;
      quantify the direct and indirect impact of the tinnitus on the individual. These tools&#xD;
      evaluate tinnitus effects that are often cumulative over long periods of time (e.g.&#xD;
      depression, insomnia, changes in social interactions). Medications that alter brain chemistry&#xD;
      may have an impact on either or both short and long-term tinnitus measures so both categories&#xD;
      are being evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: Subjects will randomly be assigned to Group 1 (A/B) or Group 2 (B/A) after&#xD;
      completion of Phase I and its subsequent washout period (Figure 1, periods 1 and 2). Group 1&#xD;
      will receive acamprosate (Campral) at a dose of 666 mg. three times daily for 24 weeks&#xD;
      followed by a 4-week washout period and then by taking matched placebos for next 24 weeks.&#xD;
      Group 2 will receive placebo for 24 weeks followed by a washout and 24 week acamprosate&#xD;
      trial. The experiment will be double-blinded. The subjects will know that they could be&#xD;
      taking either a placebo or acamprosate. To insure subjects are blind to the intervention, the&#xD;
      Campral will be placed in identical capsules to those used for the cellulose placebos that&#xD;
      will be produced for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data acquisition: VAS sheets will be completed during the initial Phase II baseline visit and&#xD;
      6 sets of time/dated sheets (one for loudness, one for annoyance, plus two spare sheets) will&#xD;
      be sent home with subjects. Equivalent sets of the THI, TFI and MOCI will be included with&#xD;
      the VAS sheets and subjects given instruction (verbally and in writing) on how to complete&#xD;
      and return all data sheets in self-addressed stamped envelopes. Sheet acquisition will follow&#xD;
      the course that it did in Phase I, however, they will only be collected monthly instead of&#xD;
      weekly. The subject will return to the clinic after 24 weeks for testing including VAS, THI,&#xD;
      TFI and MOCI evaluations. At that time they will receive their supply of capsules (medication&#xD;
      or placebo) and new sets of VAS, THI and MOCI sheets and mailing envelopes for the second&#xD;
      period of Phase II (Figure 1, period 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychoacoustic measures of tinnitus will be measured during the baseline visit, during the&#xD;
      24-week return visit, and at the conclusion of the 52-week study.&#xD;
