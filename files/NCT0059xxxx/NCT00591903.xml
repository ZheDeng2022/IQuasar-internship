  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The concept of diabetic cardiomyopathy was initially defined more than 30 years ago, as&#xD;
      cardiac failure in diabetic subjects in the absence of underlying coronary artery disease.&#xD;
      Diabetes is also thought to contribute to earlier stage cardiac systolic dysfunction and/or&#xD;
      to isolated diastolic dysfunction, in excess of underlying coronary artery disease and&#xD;
      hypertension. More globally, it is recognized that subjects with type 2 diabetes have more&#xD;
      extensive cardiovascular disease and a worse outcome for a similar level of disease than&#xD;
      non-diabetic subjects. Despite this epidemiological evidence, the biological programming&#xD;
      underpinning the myriad presentations of the diabetic heart' are poorly characterized in&#xD;
      humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proteomics has emerged as an unbiased technology that enables the measurement of large&#xD;
      numbers of steady-state protein levels. The potential to identify a diabetes associated&#xD;
      proteomic signature in the heart would be a novel approach to identify putative biological&#xD;
      programs altered by the diabetic state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A portion of the right atrial appendage is removed to insert the cardiac bypass machine&#xD;
      cannula in certain cardiothoracic procedures. This tissue is usually discarded, however, we&#xD;
      propose that it could be employed to examine whether otherwise similar subjects with and&#xD;
      without diabetes have distinct atrial proteomic signatures. This pilot study may provide&#xD;
      insight into potential biological pathways that orchestrate the worse cardiac prognosis in&#xD;
      type 2 diabetic versus non diabetic control subjects.&#xD;
