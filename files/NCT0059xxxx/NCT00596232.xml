      The purpose of this study is to investigate how mucus (phlegm or spit) is broken down once it&#xD;
      forms in the airways (bronchial tubes) of people with lung disease. This research study will&#xD;
      also examine whether blood groups have an effect on lung function or the type of mucus found&#xD;
      in the lung. This study is not designed to be a treatment for asthma, emphysema, cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis, or other lung disease. It is designed to help the investigators learn more about&#xD;
      the causes of airway disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Accumulation of mucus in the airway involves the process of overproduction and reduced&#xD;
      clearance of mucin glycoproteins. To date, little attention has been focused on mechanisms of&#xD;
      mucin clearance from the airway. We hypothesize that there is enzymatic degradation of mucins&#xD;
      (&quot;mucinase activity&quot;) in the airway, which acts to break down mucins and facilitate their&#xD;
      clearance. We further hypothesize that glycosidases function as mucinases by removing&#xD;
      peripheral monosaccharides from oligosaccharides, including oligosaccharides on mucins.&#xD;
      Removal of terminal or capping sugars on mucin side chains may be an important mechanism in&#xD;
      mucin degradation and clearance from the lung. If mucinase activity exists in the airway then&#xD;
      mucus collected from human subjects should demonstrate evidence of mucin degradation ex vivo,&#xD;
      especially at 37º celsius. As part of our protocol we propose to examine changes in airway&#xD;
      mucus ex vivo under different experimental conditions. Our primary readout will be measures&#xD;
      of sputum rheology, namely viscosity and elasticity. Our consultant for this methodology will&#xD;
      be Dr Susan Muller (Chemical Engineering, University of California, Berkeley). In order to&#xD;
      conduct experimental studies in this way we will need multiple samples from the same&#xD;
      subjects. Thus, up to 10 or more sputum samples per subject will be collected on different&#xD;
      days. In addition, we are interested in the biochemical properties of sputum and saliva,&#xD;
      specifically the composition of mucin molecules found in these fluids.&#xD;
