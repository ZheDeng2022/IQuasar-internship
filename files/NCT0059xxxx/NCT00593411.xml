  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The collection of data from the myriad of services described is significantly impacted by NIH&#xD;
      guidelines defining medical research involving humans as well as the recent implementation of&#xD;
      HIPAA constraints which further complicate the conduct of retrospective clinical outcomes&#xD;
      research. Simple case reports or case series analysis now involve IRB participation as well&#xD;
      as voluminous documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The solution to this dilemma lies in developing and promoting secure, confidential&#xD;
      prospective clinical databases for storing clinical data for subsequent retrospective&#xD;
      de-identified inquiry. These databases function in a way analogous to &quot;tissue banks&quot; for&#xD;
      subsequent basic science research. Patients consent to prospective entry of their clinical&#xD;
      information into the database so long as they continue to be a patient with the Department of&#xD;
      Neurological Surgery or the Departments or Divisions in association with the affiliated&#xD;
      programs briefly described above. The consent is obtained during the patient's first&#xD;
      inpatient or outpatient encounter in parallel with the HIPAA consent. It can be withdrawn by&#xD;
      request of the patient at any time, but it does not expire unless the patient withdraws it,&#xD;
      or the patient severs their patient care relationship with UCI Neurosurgery or the affiliated&#xD;
      programs. The database is stored on a separate secure server maintained and backed up by the&#xD;
      UCIMC Information Technology Department. Access to the database is restricted at multiple&#xD;
      levels, with the majority of personnel allowed only limited access for data entry purposes.&#xD;
      Only the database programmer/coordinator, the Department Administrator and the Chairman of&#xD;
      the Department will have unrestricted access to the database. Authority for permission for&#xD;
      levels of security clearance and access to the database, for other individuals, will be&#xD;
      vested in the Chairman of the Department of Neurological Surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A separate IRB proposal will be formulated for individual study related to the acquisition of&#xD;
      data from the de-identified database. Since these future studies will be performed on data&#xD;
      sets derived from the previously consented subjects of this IRB-approved project, the&#xD;
      requirement for additional consent forms are not anticipated. As a result IRB research&#xD;
      proposals utilizing the database can be expedited. Once the specific study is approved, the&#xD;
      investigator(s) are provided with the clinical information from the database in the form of a&#xD;
      de-identified data set.&#xD;

      The Department of Neurological Surgery is entering a period of rapid growth accompanied by&#xD;
      significant investment in its infrastructure. The goals of this effort is to re-establish a&#xD;
      full academic mission and for the return of a residency program as part of this paradigm with&#xD;
      the target of initiating the program in three to five years. This rebuilding project will be&#xD;
      based on the pre-existing neurotrauma and critical care program and three new comprehensive&#xD;
      and multidisciplinary clinical programs and medical center product lines. These include&#xD;
      neuro-oncology, operative and non-operative spine services and cerebrovascular services. The&#xD;
      care and treatment of patients with ischemic stroke is a part of the cerebrovascular program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aggressive and accelerated clinical outcomes research and rapid peer-review publication is a&#xD;
      mission critical need for successfully applying to re-establish the residency training&#xD;
      program. The collection of this data will also strengthen marketing and will promote the&#xD;
      advancement of the multidisciplinary programs. While the Neurosurgery Department is central&#xD;
      to the multidisciplinary program evolution these affiliated programs and product lines&#xD;
      involve multiple departments. These include: Neurology with the stroke service and neurology&#xD;
      critical care services; Radiology with the neuroradiology and interventional neuroradiology&#xD;
      services; the Hematology/Oncology Services associated with the Chao Family Comprehensive&#xD;
      Cancer Center; Radiation Oncology; Otolaryngology Services; Orthopedic Spine Services; and,&#xD;
      Physiatry with the Physical and Rehabilitative Medicine Services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MD Analyze is a commercially available relational data base software program designed to&#xD;
      accumulate clinical data for future analysis. It allows the investigators to determine what&#xD;
      clinical data they wish to collect, including, but not limited to history, physical,&#xD;
      laboratory, radiographic, surgical and follow-up information. It can be programmed to allow&#xD;
      data entry from any data collection instrument so desired by the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients treated by the investigators in their practices at UCI will be asked to sign consent&#xD;
      and HIPAA forms making them aware of their rights and protection regarding their health care&#xD;
      information and giving informed consent to collect and analyze their health care data.&#xD;
      Throughout the course of their care they may be asked to complete various surveys or data&#xD;
      collection instruments depending on their diagnosis and treatment. See Appendix A for copies&#xD;
      of the data collection instruments and surveys. The system allows the personal clinical data&#xD;
      to be de-identified (i.e., made anonymous). A full-time data entry clerk will collect and&#xD;
      enter clinical data into the MD Analyze data base. This person will also be asked to search&#xD;
      and retrieve data based on investigators' research questions after their proposals have been&#xD;
      IRB approved. Only the Department Chairman, the Data Base Manager, and the Department&#xD;
      Administrator will have access to personal identification data. This information will not be&#xD;
      available to the investigators. Potential investigators of the data base will have to provide&#xD;
      documentation of IRB approval of their project to the Chair before their requested data set&#xD;
      can be harvested from the data base. The chair will then direct the Data Base Manager to&#xD;
      generate a report of the requested data. The report of de-identified data will then be&#xD;
      securely delivered to the investigator. The Data Base Manager will maintain a file of all&#xD;
      requests for data and a copy of the IRB approval for investigators research and data request.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minors may be asked to complete surveys and questionnaires appropriated to their reading&#xD;
      level. Patients may withdraw at any time by making a request to their physician investigator&#xD;
      or their staff.&#xD;
