  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Digital osteoarthritis (DO) which affects the interphalangeal joints and the&#xD;
      Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) of the thumb is a common disease, the prevalence of which increases&#xD;
      with age (36% of the population aged over 70). Certain forms of DO with clinical&#xD;
      manifestations involving inflammatory features are particularly refractory to usual&#xD;
      treatments (analgesics, NSAIDs, braces and local injections). The mechanism of osteoarthritis&#xD;
      involves two major cytokines: interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha. TNF alpha&#xD;
      is particularly involved in the inflammation process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to study the efficacy of TNF alpha blockers (2 injections of&#xD;
      adalimumab compared to placebo injections in patients with severe and refractory hand&#xD;
      osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope that such new therapeutic option may induce substantial pain relief.&#xD;

      Objective: To demonstrate the efficacy of two subcutaneous injections of anti-TNF alpha&#xD;
      (adalimumab) in patients with DO refractory to usual treatments (NSAIDs - analgesics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized placebo-controlled multicenter (20 sites (amendment 18/12/2008)) trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial duration: 6 months follow-up per patient, total trial duration: 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients: 84(up)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose of administration: Two subcutaneous injections separated by a 2-week interval of either&#xD;
      adalimumab or placebo. Therapeutic precautions inherent to the prescription of anti-TNF alpha&#xD;
      are based upon those recommended in rheumatoid arthritis. With only two injections of&#xD;
      anti-TNF alpha, the risk of complications (infectious in particular) inherent to the anti-TNF&#xD;
      alpha appears to be extremely slight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection: Patients with digital osteoarthritis (DIP and PIP) according to American&#xD;
      College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria (with a recent X-ray, less than 6 months, of the&#xD;
      hands, showing signs of digital osteoarthritis), symptomatic for more than 3 months (at least&#xD;
      three finger joints) and scored more than 40 mm on a pain visual analog scale (VAS) despite&#xD;
      use of a level 1 analgesic (acetaminophen: 4 g daily) andNSAIDs. Main Exclusion criteria are&#xD;
      contraindications to anti-TNF alpha according to international guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Patients will be seen at a screening visit, then during treatment administration (W0&#xD;
      and W2) and at follow-up visits: W6, 10, 14 and 26. NSAIDs will be stopped at the time of&#xD;
      screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy evaluation: The efficacy endpoint is improvement in pain on a pain VAS at different&#xD;
      times of assessment (primary endpoint at W6). A more than 50% improvement, in comparison with&#xD;
      baseline, will be considered to be significant. Secondary endpoints are: number of tender&#xD;
      joints, number of swollen joints, morning stiffness, global assessment of handicap by&#xD;
      patient, global assessment of handicap by physician, the DREISER'S algofunctional index,&#xD;
      Cochin hand index, weekly evolution of pain ( patient record), and recording of analgesic use&#xD;
      (acetaminophen or NSAIDs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical data: Statistical analysis will be performed on the inter-group difference in the&#xD;
      intention-to-treat population. khi-2 will be used only for criteria number 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated result: Significant superiority of adalimumab over placebo which would provide a&#xD;
      therapeutic solution in difficult-to-treat patients with hand OA.&#xD;
