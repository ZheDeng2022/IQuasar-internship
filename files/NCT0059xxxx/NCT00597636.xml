  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help us better understand the cellular changes that may lead&#xD;
      to the development of lung cancer. We want to compare people who have never smoked and yet&#xD;
      have been diagnosed with lung cancer to never smokers who have not developed lung cancer. We&#xD;
      hope to use the information obtained in this study as the basis for future studies and will&#xD;
      not regard the results from this study as final.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cases will be eligible for inclusion if:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have been diagnosed with a lung cancer or have had previous surgical treatment&#xD;
             for their lung cancer and have smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime,&#xD;
             are/were not regular cigar or pipe smokers, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have had no prior chemotherapy or radiation treatment within the last year&#xD;
             (Exception: genotyping analysis/screening can be performed on specimens from&#xD;
             individuals who had chemo/radiation treatment within the last year as germline DNA&#xD;
             will not be affected)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They speak and read English&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They understand and agree to sign informed consent, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They agree to give us a blood sample, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They agree to complete the study questionnaire, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They agree to have their pathology information reviewed by study personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Controls will be eligible for inclusion if:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have not been diagnosed with any type of cancer, exclusive of nonmelanoma skin&#xD;
             cancer and have smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, are/were not&#xD;
             regular cigar or pipe smokers, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They speak and read English&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They understand and agree to sign informed consent, and&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  They agree to complete the study questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who do not meet the inclusion criteria for either the case or control groups&#xD;
             will not be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All individuals who otherwise meet the eligibility requirements above, but who have&#xD;
             had chemotherapy or radiation therapy within 1 year of evaluation will be excluded&#xD;
             (Exception: genotyping analysis/screening can be performed on specimens from&#xD;
             individuals who had chemo/radiation treatment within the last year as germline DNA&#xD;
             will not be affected).&#xD;
