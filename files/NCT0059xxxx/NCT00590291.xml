    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to discover genes that may cause Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)&#xD;
      or Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM). Many human diseases are inherited or passed from parent&#xD;
      to child in families. These diseases occur because of damage to a gene(s), the genetic&#xD;
      material that is also called DNA. Scientists can now use modern molecular techniques to&#xD;
      locate and to find certain genes within the DNA (genetic material) of a person, and to follow&#xD;
      their inheritance in a family. To find these disease-causing genes requires studies of many&#xD;
      affected with the disease and their family members. The purpose of this study is to locate&#xD;
      and to find the genes for coronary artery disease (CAD) which occurs when one or more of the&#xD;
      arteries that carry oxygen-rich blood from your heart to the rest of your body develop&#xD;
      blockages; or, arteriovenous malformation (AVM) which causes abnormal vascular connections&#xD;
      between arteries and veins, particularly near the heart. Findings of the genes causing CAD&#xD;
      and AVM will have far-reaching effect on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of coronary&#xD;
      artery disease and arteriovenous malformation. These studies will lead to possible genetic&#xD;
      diagnosis, early detection of persons at risk for developing CAD or AVM (even in the absence&#xD;
      of symptoms), development of effective drugs, more rational and specific therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions, treatments and ultimately, prevention of coronary heart disease. Approximately&#xD;
      3-5 years are required to find one human disease gene.&#xD;

      For each participant, 10 ml of blood for lymphoblastoid cell line immortalization, 10-20 ml&#xD;
      blood for DNA extraction, or two buccal swabs. If gene identified, blood samples from&#xD;
      children to identify the children affected with this gene will be obtained. When available,&#xD;
      biopsy tissues for extracting DNA, RNA, protein, or for cell biological studies will be&#xD;
      obtained. Human genomic DNA will be prepared from peripheral blood lymphocytes, biopsy&#xD;
      tissue, or cell lines derived from Epstein Barr virus transformed lymphocytes 15. DNA will be&#xD;
      used for a variety of purposes including linkage analysis and mutational screening.&#xD;
