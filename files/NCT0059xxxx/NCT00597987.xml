  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect a blood sample from patients that may be used for&#xD;
      research purposes. These blood samples will be used by researchers at this institution to&#xD;
      study the causes of breast and ovarian cancer, and to better understand how these cancers&#xD;
      develop. We are trying to discover differences in the ways cells work in women with a high&#xD;
      genetic risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer. Early data suggest that some genes may&#xD;
      be turned on or off in different ways based upon whether or not a woman has a high genetic&#xD;
      risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer. The primary objective is to test the hypothesis&#xD;
      that BRCA1 haploinsufficiency regulates gene expression on the X chromosome. This hypothesis&#xD;
      will be tested by comparing the gene expression profiles of BRCA1 heterozygotes (cases) to an&#xD;
      age-matched group of unaffected women who are not BRCA1 mutation carriers (controls).&#xD;

      The specific aim of this project is to test the hypothesis that BRCA1 haploinsufficiency&#xD;
      regulates gene expression on the X chromosome. This hypothesis will be examined by&#xD;
      determining if X chromosome gene expression profiles, derived from lymphocyte RNA, of BRCA1&#xD;
      mutation carriers (cases) can be distinguished from an age-matched group of women who do not&#xD;
      have BRCA1 mutations (controls). Neither cases nor controls will have a history of cancer.&#xD;
      This investigation will provide valuable insight into the biologic function of BRCA1 and its&#xD;
      role in breast and/or ovarian tumorigenesis. Blood samples from cases will be collected from&#xD;
      patients who have previously undergone genetic counseling through the Clinical Genetics&#xD;
      Service at MSKCC and tested positive for a germline mutation in BRCA1. Blood samples from&#xD;
      controls will be obtained from two sources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First from specimens already collected under IRB Protocol #99-030, entitled &quot;Collection of&#xD;
      Tissue, Blood, and Cells to be Used for Studying the Causes, Prevention, Diagnosis, and&#xD;
      Treatment of Breast Cancer (T. King, PI). Controls will also be collected from patients who&#xD;
      have previously undergone genetic counseling through the Clinical Genetics Service at MSKCC&#xD;
      and tested negative for germline mutations in BRCA1. Isolation of total RNA from blood will&#xD;
      be performed using the PAXgene™ Blood RNA System. This study will use lymphocyte RNA samples&#xD;
      from 50 individuals with BRCA1 mutations and 50 age-matched controls. Gene expression&#xD;
      profiling will be performed in the Genomics Core Laboratory of MSKCC under the supervision of&#xD;
      Agnes Viale, PhD. Class comparison analysis will be performed on the gene expression data in&#xD;
      the Biostatistics Department under the supervision of Adam Olshen, PhD. It is anticipated&#xD;
      that this study will be completed in approximately 1 year.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        For acquisition of control specimens, samples already collected under IRB approved protocol&#xD;
        99-030 will be used. This protocol was a tissue and blood acquisition protocol entitled&#xD;
        &quot;Collection of Tissue, Blood, and Cells to Be Used for Studying the Causes, Prevention,&#xD;
        Diagnosis, and Treatment of Breast Cancer&quot;. Patients have already given consent and signed&#xD;
        a research authorization for to use their blood specimens for this purpose. Controls will&#xD;
        also be collected from patients who have previously undergone genetic counseling through&#xD;
        the Clinical Genetics Service at MSKCC and tested negative for a germline mutations in&#xD;
        BRCA1. These individuals will be approached and asked to donate a sample at the time of&#xD;
        their results appointment. Blood samples from cases will be collected from patients who&#xD;
        have tested positive for a germline mutation in BRCA1. These women will have been&#xD;
        participants in MSKCC protocols such as 96-51 and 97-29, or tested at outside institutions&#xD;
        and receiving followup care at MSKCC. Any patient with a presumed pathogenic mutation in&#xD;
        BRCA1 will be eligible for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be eligible without regard to age, racial, or ethnic status. Subjects with&#xD;
        any personal history of cancer will be excluded. Attending physicians authorized to obtain&#xD;
        informed consent may exercise discretion in excluding individuals for appropriate medical&#xD;
        or other (e.g., minors, mentally impaired) reasons. Patients with an unclassified variant&#xD;
        in BRCA1 will be excluded as the functional significance of these variations is unknown.&#xD;
