  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical and radiological outcome of patients&#xD;
      that are treated with two different orthopedic implants. The study population will consist of&#xD;
      patients that have sustained unstable hip fractures. The two different implants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis states that there should not be any significant differences between the&#xD;
      two implants.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Intertrochanteric hip fractures are common injuries in the elderly population. They often&#xD;
      signify generalized physical deterioration. Operative management has become the standard of&#xD;
      care to prevent life threatening complications and dates back to the 1940's. The design of&#xD;
      implants has evolved significantly since then.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sliding hip screw replaced static fixation of the femoral head in the 1950's. As a result&#xD;
      of this improvement in design, failures have been reduced to 9-16%. The sliding hip screw&#xD;
      allows for stable collapse of the femoral neck. This can lead to significant shortening of&#xD;
      the proximal femur in comminuted fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatment modalities focus on obtaining a satisfactory union of the fracture, often&#xD;
      at the expense of anatomical alignment. Severely comminuted fractures treated with a standard&#xD;
      plate-hip-screw device thus commonly result in significant degrees of mal-union and&#xD;
      shortening. In the past, implants designed to restore and maintain the anatomy of the hip&#xD;
      have resulted in high failure rates with the implant breaking out of the femoral head. In the&#xD;
      mid 1980's, recognition of this led to the development of various intramedullary devices for&#xD;
      fixation of these fractures. The weight-bearing portion of the implant is therefore shifted&#xD;
      medially, resulting in reduced lever forces on the implant and femur. Additionally, the IM&#xD;
      device does not rely on fixation to the lateral cortex of the femur with screws. From a&#xD;
      biomechanical standpoint, the intramedullary device has distinct advantages, as it is a load-&#xD;
      sharing device more closely located to the axis of weight bearing than the plate-hip-screw&#xD;
      device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advances in intramedullary designs have been promising, but the clinical results variable.&#xD;
      The relatively high rate of fracture at the tip, specifically at the level of the locking&#xD;
      bolts, has hampered the widespread popularity of intramedullary devices. Additionally, the&#xD;
      large diameter of the proximal aspect of the implants required extensive reaming of the&#xD;
      greater trochanter and partial detachment of the gluteus medius. This may lead to abductor&#xD;
      weakness and a Trendelenburg gait. Some studies have found increased re-operation rates for&#xD;
      these early hip-nail devices compared to the plate -hip-screw implant. Other studies have&#xD;
      shown decreased blood loss and operative time with the nails. A meta-analysis of the&#xD;
      literature favors the sliding hip screw design. Unfortunately, most studies focus on&#xD;
      radiological failure rate rather than patient function and relate to the first generation of&#xD;
      IM devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The newest generation of nails (like the IM studied here) has attempted to correct the&#xD;
      shortcomings of earlier designs. The proximal aspect of the nail diameter is minimized. The&#xD;
      distal locking screw is located far away from the distal end of the nail and the locking bolt&#xD;
      is placed in an oblique fashion. Design alterations to the femoral head fixation portion of&#xD;
      the nail by using a helical blade rather than a screw may improve fixation in the femoral&#xD;
      head. These new designs seem to compare favorably in recent clinical tests. Early&#xD;
      mobilization for patients with the intramedullary device (IM) seems to be better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of the pilot study indicate an earlier return to full mobility and shorter operating&#xD;
      time in the IM group. This study included all intertrochanteric fracture types and did not&#xD;
      demonstrate a clear benefit of the IM in many other parameters. The currently proposed&#xD;
      multi-centre study will focus on the unstable A2 intertrochanteric fracture pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the significantly increased cost of the new intramedullary devices compared to&#xD;
      the standard plate-hip-screw, a significant overall improvement in patient function should be&#xD;
      realized before the general use of these new devices could be recommended.&#xD;
