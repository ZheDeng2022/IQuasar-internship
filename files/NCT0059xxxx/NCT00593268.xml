  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project we are collecting cerebrospinal fluid and blood from patients at Vanderbilt&#xD;
      Medical Center who have a subarachnoid hemorrhage which has followed the rupture of a brain&#xD;
      aneurysm. We then propose to study the cerebrospinal fluid using a novel microscopic laser&#xD;
      directed mass spectrometric analysis (MALDI) available at Vanderbilt. The cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
      and blood will then be analysed for different biological markers, protein expression and gene&#xD;
      expression. These markers will then be statistically correlated with clinical data including&#xD;
      prediction of vasospasm, time to vasospasm and response to standard therapy.&#xD;

      In this project we are collecting cerebrospinal fluid and blood from patients at Vanderbilt&#xD;
      Medical Center who have a subarachnoid hemorrhage which has followed the rupture of a brain&#xD;
      aneurysm. We then propose to study the cerebrospinal fluid using a novel microscopic laser&#xD;
      directed mass spectrometric analysis (MALDI) available at Vanderbilt. The cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
      and blood will then be analysed for different biological markers, protein expression and gene&#xD;
      expression. These markers will then be statistically correlated with clinical data including&#xD;
      prediction of vasospasm, time to vasospasm and response to standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to determine cerebrospinal fluid and serum markers which will be&#xD;
      predictive of vasospasm. This in turn may lead to improved outcomes in this population of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be compared to excess cerebrospinal fluid collected from patients who are&#xD;
      undergoing lumbar puncture in the Neurology Clinic or excess cerebrospinal fluid from&#xD;
      patients undergoing cranial surgery for other causes like tumor excision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients enrolled in the study, cerebrospinal fluid will be collected by either lumbar&#xD;
      puncture or external ventricular catheter. Specimens will be collected immediately&#xD;
      pre-operatively if an external ventricular drain is in place or intraoperatively if an&#xD;
      external ventricular drain is not present. We will also collect cerebrospinal fluid post&#xD;
      operatively after placement of an external ventricular drain regularly from the excess&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid that has been collected in the drainage bag. CSF will be collected in a&#xD;
      serial fashion at multiple time points: immediately post operatively, during vasospasm and&#xD;
      before the external ventricular drain is removed.&#xD;
