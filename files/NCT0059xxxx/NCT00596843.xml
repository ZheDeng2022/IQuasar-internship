      The purpose of this study is to determine if a 6-session motivational interviewing&#xD;
      intervention is more effective than a 6-session educational intervention at reducing&#xD;
      behaviors that may lead to infection, transmission, and progression of HIV and hepatitis C&#xD;
      among out of treatment injecting drug users.&#xD;

      This 4.5-year community-based study is a randomized field experiment that uses a two-group&#xD;
      design. Participants are randomized into either an Educational intervention group or a&#xD;
      Motivational intervention group. We are comparing the effectiveness of the Motivational&#xD;
      intervention with the Educational intervention. We are also estimating the costs and&#xD;
      evaluating the cost-effectiveness of the Motivational intervention relative to the&#xD;
      Educational intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have the following aims and related hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To compare the effectiveness of a 6-session personalized motivational intervention to&#xD;
      a 6-session educational intervention in terms of injection risk, sexual behavior, alcohol&#xD;
      use, and knowledge and perception related to HBV and HCV; H1. Relative to the Educational&#xD;
      intervention group, a greater proportion of the Motivational intervention group will report&#xD;
      no injection risk at 6- and 12-month follow-up interviews. No injection risk is operationally&#xD;
      defined as either no injections in the past 30 days, or no direct or indirect sharing of&#xD;
      syringes and other injection equipment in the past 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2. Relative to the Educational intervention group, a greater proportion of the Motivational&#xD;
      intervention group will report no sexual risk at 6- and 12-month follow-up interviews. No&#xD;
      sexual risk is operationally defined as either no sex (oral, vaginal, or anal) in the past 30&#xD;
      days, or no unprotected oral, vaginal, or anal sex in the past 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3. Relative to the Educational intervention group, the Motivational intervention group will&#xD;
      report greater decreases in frequency of alcohol consumption and quantity of alcohol&#xD;
      consumed. Frequency of alcohol consumption is defined as &quot;number of days drank alcohol in the&#xD;
      past 30 days,&quot; and quantity of alcohol consumed is defined as &quot;the average number of drinks&#xD;
      per drinking day during the past 30 days.&quot; H4. Relative to the Educational intervention&#xD;
      group, participants in the Motivational intervention group will report greater increases in&#xD;
      knowledge and more accurate perceptions of severity of disease and efficacy of protective&#xD;
      actions regarding hepatitis B and C at Session 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To estimate the cost and cost-effectiveness of a 6-session personalized motivational&#xD;
      intervention relative to a 6-session educational intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H5. The Motivational Intervention will cost more than the Educational Intervention, but will&#xD;
      be cost-effective at eliminating injection risk behavior and sexual risk behavior and at&#xD;
      reducing alcohol use&#xD;
