      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the safety and potential efficacy of&#xD;
      sustained-release bupropion (Zyban®) for the treatment of nicotine dependence in patients&#xD;
      with bipolar affective illness. It is hypothesized that bupropion will produce a significant&#xD;
      enhancement of smoking abstinence compared to placebo and will be safe for use in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the safety and potential efficacy of&#xD;
      sustained-release bupropion (Zyban®) for the treatment of nicotine dependence in patients&#xD;
      with bipolar affective illness. we propose to conduct a preliminary study of the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of bupropion SR (with flexible dosing up to 300 mg/day) in comparison to placebo in&#xD;
      medication-maintained and stabilized outpatients with bipolar I and II disorder who are&#xD;
      currently depressed despite mood-stabilizing medication and who are also nicotine-dependent&#xD;
      cigarette smokers, and who are motivated to quit smoking. Subjects will be n=32 subjects&#xD;
      between 18 and 65 years of age who meet DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder (either Type I&#xD;
      or II), and nicotine dependence, and smoke at least 15 cigarettes per day, with an FTND score&#xD;
      at baseline &gt;5, expired breath CO &gt;10, and plasma cotinine &gt;150 ng/ml, and are motivated to&#xD;
      quit smoking within thirty days of the initial intake. Subjects must be on a stable dose of a&#xD;
      mood stabilizer (e.g. lithium, valproate, carbamezepine, topiramate, gabapentin or atypical&#xD;
      antipsychotic), and be in complete remission from active manic or hypomanic and psychotic&#xD;
      symptoms as judged by a psychiatric evaluation. Subjects will be recruited through outpatient&#xD;
      departments at Connecticut Mental Health Center (CMHC) and its satellite clinics. Study&#xD;
      medications will be given for 9 weeks duration, beginning at 1 week prior to the &quot;quit date&quot;.&#xD;
      Bupropion [as the intermediate-release (IR) formulation] will begin at 75 mg po qd x 3days,&#xD;
      then increase to 150 mg [as bupropion SR formulation] qd x 4 days, and then increased to a&#xD;
      final dose of up to 150 mg po bid (300 mg/day) by Day 15 (the target quit date; TQD) as&#xD;
      tolerated, and this dose will be continued for an additional eight (8) weeks at up to 150 mg&#xD;
      po bid. We will allow flexible dosing above 150 mg/day to allow for adjustments needed if a&#xD;
      bipolar subject does not tolerate the full dose of Zyban at 300 mg/day. Zyban will then be&#xD;
      discontinued at the end of Week 10. Primary outcome measures are endpoint (7-day) smoking&#xD;
      abstinence and adverse events.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. SCID for DSM-IV diagnoses of bipolar I or bipolar II disorder, and nicotine&#xD;
             dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Young Mania Rating Scale Total Score &lt;12 at study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. BPRS Total Score &lt; 20 at study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. HAM-D 17-Item Score &gt;12 and &lt;25 at study entry. NB: We have set an upper limit for&#xD;
             allowable HAM-D 17-item scores since higher scores would typically trigger the&#xD;
             initiation of an antidepressant trial, and this study involves a placebo-controlled&#xD;
             augmentation of existing medication therapies with bupropion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) score of 4 or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Smoking at least 15 cigarettes per day, and have expired breath CO level &gt;10 ppm and&#xD;
             plasma cotinine level &gt;150 ng/ml at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Be on a stable dose of a mood stabilizer for at least 1 month (e.g. lithium,&#xD;
             valproate, carbamazepine, atypical antipsychotic) as judged by the study psychiatrists&#xD;
             (T. George, M.D. and H. Blumberg, M.D.), and judged by well-trained trained&#xD;
             psychiatric clinicians (e.g. J. Vessicchio, M.S.W. or K. Sacco, Psy.D.) to be in&#xD;
             remission from active manic, hypomanic, major depression and psychotic symptoms based&#xD;
             on a clinical interview and SCID-IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Be able to provide informed consent to participate in this study as judged by clinical&#xD;
             evaluation, and scoring at least 80% on a post-consent &quot;test&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Meet criteria for current abuse or dependence for any other alcohol or illicit&#xD;
             substance within the past 3 months of study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Current evidence by SCID-IV and clinical evaluation of suicidality, homocidality or&#xD;
             psychosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Meet DSM-IV criteria for current major depression at the time of baseline evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A history of hypersensitivity or other known adverse reactions (e.g. hyperstimulation,&#xD;
             severe agitation) to bupropion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any serious documented medical disorders which might be contraindicated with bupropion&#xD;
             (i.e. anorexia or bulimia nervosa, history of seizure disorder, history of major head&#xD;
             injury with loss of consciousness for a period greater than five minutes), or if the&#xD;
             results of psychiatric/medical screening suggest reason concern of a trial of&#xD;
             bupropion (e.g., a history of severe cardiac, renal or hepatic disease, diabetes&#xD;
             mellitus or thyroid abnormalities which in the opinion of the study internist Dr. Lynn&#xD;
             Sullivan would preclude participation in this study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Evidence of clinically significant EKG abnormalities as judged by the study internist,&#xD;
             Lynn E. Sullivan, M.D. (Department of Internal Medicine, YUSM), or her designate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Prescription of monoamine oxidase inhibitors or the Wellbutrin® formulation of&#xD;
             bupropion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The presence of manic, mixed manic or hypomanic symptoms in the past one (1) month&#xD;
             prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. A lifetime history of antidepressant-induced mania or hypomania.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. A history of suicidal ideation while taking antidepressants.&#xD;
