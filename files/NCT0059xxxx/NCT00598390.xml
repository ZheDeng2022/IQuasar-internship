  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to measure brain CB1 receptors in the hope to better&#xD;
      understand how they work, so that one day we can understand how the CB1 receptors are&#xD;
      involved in psychiatric, neurological, and behavioral disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MePPEP is a ligand that is highly selective for the cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor. This&#xD;
      receptor is considered the most common G-coupled protein receptor in the brain (Pacher et&#xD;
      al., 2006). The CB1 receptor is the site of action of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannbinol (THC), the&#xD;
      active compound in marijuana, and is found primarily on the presynaptic terminals of&#xD;
      dopaminergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic neurons (Howlett et al., 2002). The function of the&#xD;
      CB1 receptor is not entirely clear; however, it has been implicated in several neurological&#xD;
      and psychiatric disorders, and a selective inverse agonist, rimonabant, is currently in use&#xD;
      in Europe for the treatment of obesity (Van Gaal et al., 2005). [11C]MePPEP was developed to&#xD;
      enhance our understanding of the in vivo characteristics of the CB1 receptor (e.g., receptor&#xD;
      density and receptor occupancy with pharmaceuticals).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this protocol is to establish an accurate method to measure CB1 receptor&#xD;
      levels in brain by performing test/retest brain imaging studies. The results of this overall&#xD;
      study are required to apply this PET ligand in various neurological and psychiatric disorders&#xD;
      in the future.&#xD;
