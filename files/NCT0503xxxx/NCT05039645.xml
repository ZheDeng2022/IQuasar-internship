  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the clinical trial is to investigate adherence to, and effects of, the Bluedrop&#xD;
      Monitoring System (BMS) in high-risk patients with at least one previous diabetic foot ulcer&#xD;
      (DFU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BMS is a remote thermovisual monitoring system, which allows the condition of the soles&#xD;
      of the feet to be remotely monitored for thermal and visual signs of inflammation, both of&#xD;
      which may signal the onset of certain conditions, such as diabetic foot ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is comprised of the Delta Foot Scanner (DFS) device and its accompanying Sentinel Review&#xD;
      Interface (SRI) software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Covid-19 pandemic has driven the need for remote patient care where possible. Although&#xD;
      this is challenging for people with foot ulcers, prevention is the key. Remote thermovisual&#xD;
      monitoring might help reduce recurrent foot ulcers and therefore the number of necessary&#xD;
      hospital visits which always puts the patient at increased risk of Covid infection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the introduction of preventative foot care guidelines DFUs have a high re-ulceration&#xD;
      rate. In the first 12 months following healing, 30-50% will develop a subsequent DFU and by&#xD;
      year 5 this rate increases to 70%. Temperature monitoring has been proposed as a way to&#xD;
      reduce this re-ulceration rate but has not been widely adopted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the existing evidence groups such as the International Working Group on the Diabetic&#xD;
      Foot (IWGDF) have recommended temperature monitoring for the prevention of recurrent foot&#xD;
      ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these recommendations the technique has not been widely adopted. This is likely due&#xD;
      to a number of factors, but NICE, in their guidance document for the prevention and&#xD;
      management of foot ulcers (NG19) states:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;While temperature foot monitoring was found to be the only effective form of augmented&#xD;
      self-examination, the intervention tool was felt to be quite difficult to use and required a&#xD;
      strongly motivated population to actually perform consistently and fill out the required log&#xD;
      books&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bluedrop Medical have developed a product which leverages the existing evidence on&#xD;
      temperature monitoring but builds it into a device which also includes the ability to take&#xD;
      photographic images, is easy to use, and can integrate well with the healthcare system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the clinical trial is to demonstrate that patients will use the device&#xD;
      consistently over the course of the study. It will also be used to determine the clinician&#xD;
      reported utility of thermovisual data to conduct a remote assessment or remote intervention.&#xD;

    <description>When the patient reports for a scheduled or unscheduled visit the clinic will carry out an in-person visual assessment of the feet. Visible signs of skin damage on the plantar surface of the feet will be recorded. In addition to this, at the end of the study, a blinded clinician will retrospectively review the 4 thermovisual scans taken prior to the schedule or unscheduled visit and record any signs of skin damage. The level of agreement between the in-person visual assessment and the remote assessment using the scans will then be determined.Identified skin issues in both the in-person and remote assessments will be categorized and grouped together using headings such as DFU, callus, discoloration, deformation. The location of the issue will also be recorded (e.g. plantar surface, interdigit, etc).&#xD;
The degree of agreement between the dichotomous scores from in-person visual assessment and the remote scan assessment will be determined using Cohen's kappa (Îº).</description>

The relative depth of the ulcer, presence of infection or ischaemia or both will be used to categorise the wound grade and stage. The SINBAD Classification System assigns a SINBAD score from 0 to 6 to each ulcer based on a set of criteria, and larger scores indicate more severe ulcers.</description>

    <description>Study is open arm with no blinding or randomisation. Patients will receive standard care including frequent clinical visits, education, and preventative foot care/podiatry as required. Patients will also be given a DFS thermovisual scanner device. Patients will be instructed to use the DFS on a daily basis, at home, to record thermovisual data about the soles of their feet.&#xD;
Data collected from the DFS device will be transmitted to a remote, cloud-based server for daily review using the SRI software. If a temperature difference of &gt;2.2Â°C between similar points on the left and right feet is identified for 2 consecutive scans, or visible signs of skin damage are observed, the site will be notified and sent a report containing the findings. Once notified the site will contact the patient by telephone and determine the best course of action based on standard practices (e.g. offloading, attending an appointment).</description>
