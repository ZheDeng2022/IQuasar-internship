  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled study aims to investigate the effects of an intervention targeting&#xD;
      parental reminiscing style on preschoolers' memory (i.e., episodic and autobiographical) and&#xD;
      metacognition (i.e., confidence judgment and memorability-based heuristic).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been demonstrated that parental reminiscing plays an important role in preschoolers'&#xD;
      cognitive development among which memory (Waters &amp; al., 2019). Specifically, both&#xD;
      correlational and interventional studies show that children of parents using a&#xD;
      high-elaborative style during reminiscing (i.e., frequent, detailed and collaborative&#xD;
      discussions about the past) recount their memories in a more detailed and coherent way (Wu &amp;&#xD;
      Jobson, 2019). Besides, some correlational studies (e.g., Langley et al., 2017) seem to also&#xD;
      reveal an effect of parental reminiscing on children's ability to learn new information, as&#xD;
      assessed in clinical neuropsychology by episodic memory tasks. However, the mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying these influences are currently unclear. Indeed, several non-mutually exclusive&#xD;
      hypotheses are frequently suggested (e.g., among which the development of metacognition&#xD;
      (Rudek &amp; Haden, 2005)) but, to date, have never been tested. Identifying these mechanisms&#xD;
      could contribute to design interventions targeting parental reminiscing and to determine in&#xD;
      which clinical contexts to use them. Currently, interventional studies in the field are&#xD;
      scarce (for a review, see Corsano &amp; Guidotti, 2019) and lack of consensus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aims of the present study are multiple. First, we aim to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a brief intervention program to improve the way parents reminisce with their&#xD;
      child. After the intervention, we expect an increase in the frequency of use of the targeted&#xD;
      behaviors and thus an increase in the level of parental elaboration. The second goal of this&#xD;
      study is to explore the effects of the improvements in parental reminiscing style on&#xD;
      children's memory skills, both autobiographical memory (i.e., ability to recount one's own&#xD;
      memories) and episodic memory (i.e., ability to learn new information). Regarding&#xD;
      autobiographical memory, we anticipate to replicate the results shown in other interventional&#xD;
      studies (i.e., an increase in the amount of information reported by children at the end of&#xD;
      the intervention; for a review, see Corsano &amp; Guidotti, 2019). Regarding episodic memory,&#xD;
      based on the results of correlational studies (e.g., LÃ©onard et al., in prep), we anticipate&#xD;
      after the intervention to show among children an improved ability to learn new information.&#xD;
      Beyond these primary aims, secondary aims are also targeted in this study. Currently, the&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying the relation between parental reminiscing and child's memory are still&#xD;
      relatively unknown. A hypothesis that is frequently suggested is the development of&#xD;
      metacognition (Rudek &amp; Haden, 2005). One purpose of this study is to test this assumption by&#xD;
      focusing on 2 metacognitive skills that develop during the preschool years: (a) the ability&#xD;
      to make confidence judgments, (b) the ability to use the memorability-based heuristic. After&#xD;
      the intervention, we expect children to make more accurate confidence judgments and to use&#xD;
      more successfully the memorability-based heuristic to guide their memory decisions.&#xD;
      Therefore, we may obtain information on the active ingredients of the relation between&#xD;
      parental reminiscing and memory. Then, in an exploratory way, we explore whether such an&#xD;
      intervention could improve parental cognitions as well as parents' perception of reminiscing&#xD;
      with their child. We anticipate an improvement in parental cognitions and a more positive&#xD;
      perception of reminiscing. Finally, we are interested in assessing parents' adherence to the&#xD;
      intervention by exploring their feelings about its format, content and feasibility in daily&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all these purposes, a randomized controlled trial is currently being conducted. 2&#xD;
      experimental groups have been created and parent-child dyads were assigned to one of them&#xD;
      using a stratified randomization on children's age and when possible on children's gender.&#xD;
      Participants from both groups begin the study with an assessment of all variables of interest&#xD;
      (i.e., baseline1). Immediately after this baseline assessment, participants from Group 1&#xD;
      receive the intervention. Participants from Group 2 (i.e., a waiting-list group acting as a&#xD;
      control group) receive exactly the same intervention but later (i.e., after a second baseline&#xD;
      assessment which is held after the completion of the intervention by the Group 1).&#xD;
      Approximatively 2 weeks after the intervention, the dyads in each group undergo a&#xD;
      post-intervention assessment (i.e., follow-up 1; similar to the baseline assessments).&#xD;
      Besides, 6 months later, the Group 1 will participate in a follow-up session to check the&#xD;
      persistence of the effects over time (i.e., follow-up 2). If the intervention is successful,&#xD;
      this long-term follow-up may allow us to show either the maintenance of effects over time&#xD;
      (e.g., an increase in parental elaboration) and/or the appearance of some effects (e.g.,&#xD;
      effects on child outcomes due to the time it takes for the improvement in parental style to&#xD;
      have an effect on them).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, all parents are provided with an 8-session intervention (i.e., 1 session/week)&#xD;
      targeting different aspects of parental reminiscing: (a) the promotion of child participation&#xD;
      (e.g., through parent's use of feedbacks), (b) the structure of reminiscing (e.g., parent's&#xD;
      use of open-ended questions) and (c) the content addressed during reminiscing (e.g.,&#xD;
      contextual information). Parents learn to use the target behaviors through different&#xD;
      standardized techniques: (a) psychoeducation, (b) modeling and (c) supervised practice. Due&#xD;
      to Covid-19 epidemic, the intervention is held completely online (i.e., 4 e-learnings and 4&#xD;
      videoconferencing sessions).&#xD;

Parent-child dyads were assigned to one of the 2 groups using a stratified randomization on children's age and when possible on children's gender.&#xD;

    <description>Assessment of children's use of the memorability-based heuristic when performing the aforementioned story-recall tasks. Indeed, this measure was allowed by the inclusion in each story of 8 low-memorable events and 8 high-memorable events. Children's use of the memorability-based heuristic was measured by contrasting their tendency to be more or less conservative in memory decisions for low-memorable versus high-memorable events. Index: a signal detection analysis (Macmillan &amp; Creelman, 2005) will be performed to calculate response bias scores.</description>
