  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study of the diaphragm is an important point in the assessment of COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasonographic evaluation of the diaphragm is considered a simple, non-invasive, available&#xD;
      bedside technique. Ultrasonography can be used for evaluation of the site, structure, and&#xD;
      motion of the diaphragm, assessment of excursion, and thickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is ultrasonographic assessment of the diaphragm in COPD patients and its&#xD;
      relation to disease severity&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was conducted on eighty patients, forty COPD patients who were diagnosed and&#xD;
      classified into four groups according as following: The first group: included 10 patients&#xD;
      with a mild stage. The second group: included 10 patients with a moderate stage. The third&#xD;
      group: included 10 patients with a severe stage. The fourth group: included 10 patients with&#xD;
      a very severe stage. The study also included forty healthy individuals of the same age and&#xD;
      sex as COPD patients. All participants gave their informed consent for inclusion before&#xD;
      sharing in the study. Every person was submitted to: Full medical history, Clinical&#xD;
      examination,Chest x-ray, spirometry and ultrasonographic assessment of diaphragm function&#xD;
      (thickness and excursion)&#xD;
