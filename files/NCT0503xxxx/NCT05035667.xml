  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines how supportive care clinic patients have made decisions or had&#xD;
      discussions about how their caregivers or family should manage their social media account(s)&#xD;
      after death. Collecting information on the use of social media and preferences will allow for&#xD;
      a better understanding of patient's needs in the dying process and may identify populations&#xD;
      in need of education, identify a possible source of anxiety and stress, and allow for an&#xD;
      informed discussion of digital legacy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Identify the proportion of patients with advanced cancer in the supportive cancer clinic&#xD;
      who have had discussions regarding their social media account (e.g. Facebook, Twitter,&#xD;
      Instagram) management after death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Identify the proportion of social media participation among advanced cancer patients seen&#xD;
      in the supportive care clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the baseline awareness advanced cancer patients seen in the supportive care&#xD;
      clinic have regarding how their Facebook account may be managed after death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate affect changes and distress as a result from the conversation regarding their&#xD;
      social media account management after death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Evaluate if discussion of social media account management among patients with advanced&#xD;
      cancer in the supportive cancer clinic will increase their awareness of and motivation to&#xD;
      address their social media account management options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete questionnaires over 30 minutes about level of anxiety and social media use&#xD;
      and management.&#xD;

    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Will be measured by Question 10 in the survey: &quot;I have had conversations with my family or friends regarding how I would like any of my social media accounts managed after death&quot;, which contains five options: Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neither Agree or Disagree, Agree, or Strongly Agree. The results will be dichotomized into either &quot;Strongly Agree/Agree&quot; or &quot;Neither Agree or Disagree/ Disagree/Strongly Disagree&quot;. A two-sided 95% confidence interval will extend a maximum of 0.063 from the proportion of main interest.</description>
