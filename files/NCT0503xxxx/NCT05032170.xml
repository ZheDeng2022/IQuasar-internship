  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today, tooth- or implant-supported single crowns and short-span fixed partial dentures can be&#xD;
      fabricated on the basis of an intraoral scan, but the scanning accuracy decreases with&#xD;
      increasing length of the jaw section to be captured. An accurate scan is also made more&#xD;
      difficult by edentulous jaw sections, as these provide the scanner with few landmarks for&#xD;
      proper three-dimensional image composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With respect to both edentulous and edentulous patients with dental implants, the currently&#xD;
      available literature does not provide a firm basis for deciding whether such patients can&#xD;
      already be scanned with sufficient accuracy. It is considered problematic in this context&#xD;
      that the findings on digital impression accuracy, regardless of whether teeth or implants&#xD;
      have been scanned, are based almost exclusively on the results of in vitro studies.&#xD;
      Conclusions about the accuracy of intraoral scanners under clinical conditions with moving&#xD;
      patients and limited accessibility to the structures to be imaged, especially in the presence&#xD;
      of blood, saliva or sulcus fluid, are extremely limited based on these data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the clinical scanning accuracy of two&#xD;
      current intraoral scanning systems for the three-dimensional acquisition of the position of&#xD;
      two interforaminal dental implants in the edentulous mandible. The influence of artificial&#xD;
      landmarks to achieve increased scan accuracy will also be tested.&#xD;
