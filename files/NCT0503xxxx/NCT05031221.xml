    <textblock>
      Yoga may confer health benefits in people with overweight or obesity that enhance weight loss&#xD;
      and weight loss maintenance. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of integrating&#xD;
      yoga into an established behavioral weight loss program and describe the effects on glucose&#xD;
      control, appetite, dietary intake, physical activity, and psychological health.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Innovative approaches to improve long-term behavioral weight loss (BWL) program outcomes are&#xD;
      critically needed. Current BWL programs typically produce modest (~5-10%) short-term (~6&#xD;
      month) weight loss, but substantial weight regain by 1-year is common and well-documented.&#xD;
      There has been a growing interest in examining the effects of yoga on weight loss and&#xD;
      cardio-metabolic disease risk among adults with overweight, obesity, metabolic syndrome,&#xD;
      pre-diabetes, and diabetes. Overall, results are somewhat promising, but reviews and&#xD;
      meta-analyses all conclude that existing studies suffer from significant methodological&#xD;
      shortcomings. Moreover, yoga is broadly, variably, and often incorrectly defined, reflecting&#xD;
      how key aspects of traditional yoga practice, with specific mind, body, and breath-based&#xD;
      practices were lost in translation when yoga was commercially adopted as a form of exercise&#xD;
      in the West. These key aspects warrant inclusion in yoga intervention research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objectives of the proposed research are to 1) Evaluate the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of adding a 12-week traditional, multi-component yoga program to a standard BWL&#xD;
      intervention (BWL+yoga), and 2) Explore changes in clinical/cardiometabolic, psychological,&#xD;
      and energy balance/behavioral measures relevant for reducing cardio-metabolic disease risk.&#xD;
      The yoga intervention was developed in collaboration with a world-renowned expert in&#xD;
      traditional yoga practices following three decades of dedicated study, practice, and teaching&#xD;
      (Mr. Paul Dallaghan). The program includes specific postures (asana), breathing (pranayama),&#xD;
      and meditation (inner focus) techniques performed with an underlying focus on self-awareness&#xD;
      delivered in-person and virtually. These specific techniques have been practiced historically&#xD;
      and described for their benefits in the original Sanskrit teachings but are often excluded&#xD;
      from yoga programs developed in the West. The overarching hypotheses are that these specific&#xD;
      Hatha (body-breath) and Pantanjala (mind) yoga practices will be feasible in the context of a&#xD;
      BWL, will support the adoption of changes in diet and physical activity, and improve mental&#xD;
      and physical health.&#xD;

    <description>A 12-week, one-arm proof-of-concept and feasibility study will be conducted at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (CU-AMC) to assess the processes critical for the success of future randomized trials including: a) Evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of adding a multi-component yoga program to a standard BWL intervention and b) Examining pre-post changes in relevant clinical/cardiometabolic, psychological, and energy balance/behavioral outcomes to inform the design of future trials. Participants will receive a comprehensive, group-based BWL intervention consistent with current guidelines for obesity treatment and a carefully designed multi-component yoga intervention delivered through pre-recorded videos delivered through a cloud-based platform that will be completed in-person and at-home (BWL+yoga).</description>
