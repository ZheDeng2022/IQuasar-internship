  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to analyze the effectiveness of a brief educational&#xD;
      intervention supported by an infographic versus that supported by PowerPoint on the&#xD;
      understanding of pain in elite athletes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: to analyze whether a greater understanding of pain has effects on the&#xD;
      intensity, extent and characteristics of pain experienced in the year after the intervention.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>In the control group, there will be a face-to-face intervention of 15 minutes of education on pain explained by Verbal form with supporting Powerpoint presentation. In the intervention group, the same pain education will be carried out, explained verbally but with the support of an infographic instead of a Powerpoint. The educational intervention will be carried out by one of the Unicaja Baloncesto Physiotherapists (research assistant), previously instructed by the research team.</intervention_model_description>
