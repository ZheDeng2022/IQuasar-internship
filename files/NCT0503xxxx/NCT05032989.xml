  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mandibular 3rd molars are the most commonly impacted teeth in oral cavity followed by&#xD;
      maxillary 3rd molars and maxillary canines respectively. Impaction is a condition where a&#xD;
      tooth fails to erupt in its final functional position, theoretically owing to inadequate&#xD;
      space distal to the second mandibular molar and the anterior border of the ascending ramus of&#xD;
      the mandible . Surgical removal of the third molar is the most common procedure carried out&#xD;
      by a maxillofacial surgeon in the dental office. Surgical extractions are time consuming,&#xD;
      expensive and cause morbidities such as pain, swelling, dry socket, trismus, and nerve injury&#xD;
      when compared to non-surgical extractions. Various classifications have been proposed for&#xD;
      mandibular 3rd molars, most common of which, is based on angulation of impacted tooth to the&#xD;
      long axis of 2nd molar. Distoangular impacted 3rd molars are very difficult to remove because&#xD;
      of lack of space distal to the tooth and lack of interdental space available for the&#xD;
      application of elevator. Cowhorn forcep engages between the bifurcation of the mandibular&#xD;
      molars and below the bone crest and causes displacement of tooth by upward movement or by&#xD;
      splitting mesial and distal root. In our study cowhorn forcep are fist placed between 2nd and&#xD;
      3rd molar below the cementoenamel junction after its placement an apical pressure in applied&#xD;
      and this rotation results an upward and distal movement and displacement of impacted tooth&#xD;
      from the socket which then can easily be removed with cow horn forcep or molar crown forcep.&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to present the minimal invasive technique for the extraction of&#xD;
      distoangular and vertical impacted mandibular 3rd molars using cow horn forcep in comparison&#xD;
      to conventional surgical techniques to avoid complications associated with open surgical&#xD;
      techniques .&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total 128 patients will be recruited and divided into 64 patients in each group (two groups)&#xD;
      attending in Dr. inshrat ul ebad institute of oral health sciences, Ojha, fulfilling&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and undergoing extraction of 3rd molars will be included in this study.&#xD;
      The participant will be briefed about the nature and purpose of the study. They will be&#xD;
      ensured that their information will be used for the study purpose only. Informed consent from&#xD;
      the participants will be obtained. Complete history from the patients will be taken and&#xD;
      pre-operative evaluation will be done by clinical (pain and swelling) and radiographical&#xD;
      (angulation of the tooth) examination. All the patients would undergo extraction of 3rd&#xD;
      molars via both either conventional surgical technique or the proposed technique in the&#xD;
      study. Followup will be done after 3 days to evaluate the same post-operative variables (pain&#xD;
      and swelling) after extraction of 3rd molar and both techniques will then be compared in&#xD;
      terms of variables measured.&#xD;
