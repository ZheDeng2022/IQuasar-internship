    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to assess the effects of a 2-month cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation program on cardiorespiratory fitness in long COVID19 patients. Quality of&#xD;
      life, functional capacity, functional respiratory capacity, inflammatory profile, coagulation&#xD;
      markers, cognitive functions and brain O2 saturation will also be assessed before and after&#xD;
      the exercise rehabilitation program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some symptoms such as breathlessness and fatigue appear to persist for several months after&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection in about 50% of cases. Stress, anxiety, neurological and cognitive&#xD;
      disorders have also been reported in the long-term side effects associated with the disease.&#xD;
      Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation programs are recognized as an essential component of the&#xD;
      management of people with chronic respiratory disease. These programs are based on exercise&#xD;
      training with aerobic exercises, muscle strengthening, breathing exercises. Beyond the&#xD;
      benefit on morbi-mortality, a marked improvement in symptoms, fitness and quality of life is&#xD;
      observed in chronic respiratory diseases. Several hospital departments, research teams and&#xD;
      scientific organizations as the WHO recommend the use of rehabilitation programs for COVID-19&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to assess the effects of a 2-month cardiopulmonary rehabilitation&#xD;
      program on cardiorespiratory fitness in long COVID19 patients. Secondary objectives include:&#xD;
      to characterize baseline and intervention-related changes in quality of life, functional&#xD;
      capacity, functional respiratory capacity, inflammatory profile, coagulation markers,&#xD;
      cognitive functions, neurovascular coupling and cortical pulsatility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have signed a written consent form before taking part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 patients who have had COVID-19 with persistent breathlessness and fatigue symptoms after&#xD;
      at least 3 months after the diagnosis will be randomly assigned to one of the 2 following&#xD;
      study arms : 1/ cardiopulmonary exercise training program; 2/ control group.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will follow a 2-month exercise training program, thrice-weekly trainings. The training sessions will start with a 5-min warmup, followed by an aerobic training (20 min) after which 20-min of resistance/muscular training will take place. The program will end with respiratory exercises and cool down period (10 min). Training will be adapted to individuals' baseline capacity as measured by the baseline cardiorespiratory test.&#xD;
A certified kinesiologist will supervise trainings. Heart rate, oxygen saturation and rating of perceived exertion (Borg Scale, 6-20) will be measured during training sessions.</description>
