      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 461 conditions that affect the bones (skeletal disorders). Many of these are not&#xD;
      well understood and do not have any specific treatments. Researchers want to collect more&#xD;
      data about these conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To gain more information about the causes of skeletal disorders and how they progress over&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 2 months or older with known or suspected skeletal disorders. Also, healthy&#xD;
      family members of affected enrolled participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can take part in the study either remotely or in person. Those who take part&#xD;
      remotely may send in medical records, blood samples, photographs, and other materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants medical records will be reviewed. They may give blood and/or urine samples. They&#xD;
      will give blood, saliva, or tissue samples for genetic tests. They may have genetic&#xD;
      counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants ages 2 years and older may have different kinds of imaging scans, such as&#xD;
      x-rays. For these scans, they may have to lie still while machines take pictures of their&#xD;
      bones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with skeletal disorders who come to the clinic will be examined. They may be&#xD;
      asked to stay in the hospital for a few days to take extra tests. They may have a bone or&#xD;
      skin biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with skeletal disorders may be photographed to show the effects of their&#xD;
      disorder and how it changes over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants with skeletal disorders, their blood or tissue samples may be used to make a&#xD;
      special type of stem cell. These cells can be used in the laboratory to make many other types&#xD;
      of cells. A large supply of these cells may be created for research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last indefinitely.&#xD;

      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a clinical and laboratory study of rare skeletal disorders using a combination of&#xD;
      both retrospective and prospective methods. This is a single site study taking place at the&#xD;
      NIH Clinical Center with the added ability for participants to submit medical records and&#xD;
      specimens remotely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To provide a protocol in which subjects with rare skeletal disorders can&#xD;
      be evaluated and studied and to allow for the receipt of tissues and clinical specimens from&#xD;
      individuals and investigators outside of the NIH&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: To perform genetic testing including genes currently known to cause&#xD;
      skeletal disorders as well as those currently without association with skeletal disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: To define or further define genetic etiologies of known and unknown&#xD;
      skeletal disorders and create genotype-phenotype correlations when possible&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints: To describe natural history of individual disorders if enough data is&#xD;
      collected on a particular condition(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study cohort will include individuals with known (via clinical, radiographic or molecular&#xD;
      diagnosis) or suspected skeletal disorders who are at least 2 months of age with no&#xD;
      requirement on sex, ethnicity, disease severity, or geographic location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment may occur at the NIH Clinical Center or remotely via telephone or videoconference&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indefinite&#xD;
