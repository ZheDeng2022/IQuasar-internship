  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is necessary to develop a technique of sentinel lymph node detection using radioactive&#xD;
      fluorescent dual contrast agent consisting targetable albumin for specific marker to&#xD;
      accurately determine whether or not the sentinel lymph nodes have metastasized or&#xD;
      non-metastasized. Therefore, investigators would like to conduct a clinical trial to evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of radioactive fluorescent dual contrast agent to detect sentinel lymph&#xD;
      nodes for patient-specific minimally invasive surgery.&#xD;

&#xD;
      To analyze the effectiveness of radioactive fluorescent dual contrast agent (99mTc-MSA-ICG)&#xD;
      for detecting sentinel lymph node, total 10 lung cancer patients will participate in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
