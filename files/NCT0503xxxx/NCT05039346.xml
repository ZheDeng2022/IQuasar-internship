  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is limited knowledge regarding the quality of life and needs of patients with advanced&#xD;
      high grade gliomas, especially during the end of life. By doing this research, we are able to&#xD;
      assess caregiver and patient symptoms and needs during the end of life phase of patients with&#xD;
      brain tumors.&#xD;

      Purpose: This is a pilot study to prospectively assess the symptoms and quality of life of&#xD;
      patients and with advanced high grade glioma and their care takers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: The aim of this study is to investigate the symptoms of patients with advanced&#xD;
      high grade glioma. Patients who failed 3rd line chemotherapy and who require at least&#xD;
      occasional assistance will be prospectively followed and their symptoms will be prospectively&#xD;
      assessed. Patient's caregiver will be interviewed following the death of the patient to&#xD;
      assess clinical symptoms in the last weeks of life and around the time of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Patients will undergo clinical symptom assessment via questionnaire. Patients will&#xD;
      be followed by regular semi-structured phone interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should a patient pass, four weeks following this, the patient's care giver will be&#xD;
      interviewed.&#xD;
