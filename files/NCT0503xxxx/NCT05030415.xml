        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent for study participation must be obtained before any study&#xD;
             assessment is performed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female patients 18 years or older at the time of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are willing and capable of cooperating to the extent and degree required&#xD;
             by the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who read and sign an approved informed consent for this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical diagnosis of cutaneous lichen planus, lichen planopilaris, frontal fibrosing&#xD;
             alopecia at least 6 months prior to enrollment as determined by patient interview of&#xD;
             his/her medical history, biopsy proven lichen planus and by confirmation of diagnosis&#xD;
             through physical examination by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failure to at least one topical treatment (including but not exclusively topical&#xD;
             corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, topical vitamin D analogues) and/or&#xD;
             systemic treatments (including but not exclusively systemic retinoids, griseofulvin,&#xD;
             sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, light therapy, methotrexate, etc.) for 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Forms of diagnosed lichen planus other than cutaneous or lichen planopilaris&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous exposure to ixekizumab or any other biologic drug directly targeting IL-17A&#xD;
             or IL-17RA receptors (e.g., secukinumab, brodalumab, etc)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of skin comorbidities that may interfere with study assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Plans for administration of live vaccines during the study period or within 6 weeks&#xD;
             before randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any investigational treatment within 4 weeks prior to Randomization, or within&#xD;
             a period of 5 half-lives of the investigational treatment prior to Randomization,&#xD;
             whichever is longer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently enrolled in any other clinical trial involving any investigational agent or&#xD;
             device&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core&#xD;
             antibody (HBcAb), or hepatitis C antibody. If a patient has a documented negative&#xD;
             result for any of these tests within 1 year of baseline, that particular test is not&#xD;
             required at screening. Patients with isolated positive HBcAb or with positive&#xD;
             hepatitis C antibody may undergo additional tests and consultations, and may enter the&#xD;
             study only if active hepatitis B infection or carrier status has been definitively&#xD;
             ruled out&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or HIV seropositivity&#xD;
             (HIV testing is not required at screening for patients with a negative HIV result&#xD;
             within the past 1 year prior to baseline)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of lymphoproliferative disease or any known malignancy or history of&#xD;
             malignancy of any organ system within the past 5 years (except for skin Bowen's&#xD;
             disease, non-invasive squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, actinic keratosis&#xD;
             that have been treated, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or non-invasive malignant&#xD;
             colon polyps that have been removed)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or evidence of ongoing alcohol or drug abuse, within the last 6 months prior&#xD;
             to randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of elevated liver functioning tests 2-3 times of its normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current requirement for systemic immunosuppressive/ immunomodulatory agent (including&#xD;
             but not exclusively metronidazole) other than study Ixekizumab; if currently on&#xD;
             immunosuppressive/ immunomodulatory therapy, excluded if not possible to have washout&#xD;
             period of 2 weeks for topicals and 4 weeks for systemic required&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe concomitant illness(es) that, in the investigator's judgment, would adversely&#xD;
             affect the patient's participation in the study. Examples include, but are not limited&#xD;
             to patients with short life expectancy, patients with uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c&#xD;
             ≥9%), patients with cardiovascular conditions (eg, stage III or IV cardiac failure&#xD;
             according to the New York Heart Association classification), severe renal conditions&#xD;
             (eg, patients on dialysis), neurological conditions (eg, demyelinating diseases),&#xD;
             active major autoimmune diseases (eg, lupus, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid&#xD;
             arthritis, etc.), other severe endocrinological, gastrointestinal, hepato-biliary,&#xD;
             metabolic, pulmonary or lymphatic diseases. The specific justification for patients&#xD;
             excluded under this criterion will be noted in study documents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other medical or psychological condition (including relevant laboratory&#xD;
             abnormalities at screening) that, in the opinion of the investigator, may suggest a&#xD;
             new and/or insufficiently understood disease, may present an unreasonable risk to the&#xD;
             study patient as a result of his/her participation in this clinical trial, may make&#xD;
             patient's participation unreliable, or may interfere with study assessments. The&#xD;
             specific justification for patients excluded under this criterion will be noted in&#xD;
             study documents&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Women unwilling to use adequate birth control, if of reproductive potential* and&#xD;
             sexually active. Adequate birth control is defined as agreement to consistently&#xD;
             practice an effective and accepted method of contraception whenever engaging in&#xD;
             heterosexual intercourse throughout the duration of the study and for 16 weeks after&#xD;
             last dose of study drug. These include: hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine device&#xD;
             (IUD), a double barrier method (eg, condom + diaphragm), or male partner with&#xD;
             documented vasectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For females, menopause is defined as at least 12 consecutive months without&#xD;
                  menses; if in question, a follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) of ≥25 mU/mL must be&#xD;
                  documented. Hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation&#xD;
                  must be documented, as applicable; if documented, women with these conditions are&#xD;
                  not required to use additional contraception.&#xD;
