  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will include video-recorded data from 20 adults (age 18-85yrs) residing in San&#xD;
      Luis Obispo, CA. Participants will also have their height and weight measured, complete&#xD;
      demographic questionnaires, and one 3hour session with video recordings in a combination of&#xD;
      naturalistic condition and semi-structured environments. The video data will be used to train&#xD;
      machine learning models to automatically classify physical behavior as compared to&#xD;
      ground-truth measures of manual annotation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional, single observation study. Individuals will be drawn from local&#xD;
      surrounding clinics and the general community. All recruitment will include both men and&#xD;
      women. Selection criteria include individuals between the ages of 18-85 years, no major&#xD;
      chronic illness that impair mobility and able to complete activities of daily living without&#xD;
      assistance. Participants will complete one three hour session where there will be one video&#xD;
      camera set up within the home (i.e., static cameras). For approximately 30 minutes of the&#xD;
      session they will complete a semi-scripted routine that will include sit to stand&#xD;
      transitions, a timed up and go test, and scripted activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will use a video camera to record participant behavior within their daily life.&#xD;
      For two of the three hours, researchers will be video recordings the participants normal&#xD;
      (unscripted) activities. â€¢ For one hour of the session we will use two cameras, one that will&#xD;
      be held by a researcher and one that will be set up on a tripod. During this hour we will ask&#xD;
      participants to follow a semi-structured protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 minutes recording the empty space&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 minutes that include a timed up a go test (sit up from a chair and walk 10 feet),&#xD;
           repeat the test 3 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 minute walk test (walk continuously for 6 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Four stage balance test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The remainder of the time, participants will complete standard activities of daily&#xD;
           living like household chores, eating or drinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be annotated using an established behavioral observation software by training&#xD;
      research assistants (ground-truth). The image data from videos will be used to train machine&#xD;
      learning models to classify physical activities (e.g. ,'walking', 'sitting' or 'standing&#xD;
      up&quot;), information about behavior (e.g., location and purpose of the activity), and&#xD;
      performance (e.g., walking speed and sit to stand transition times).&#xD;
