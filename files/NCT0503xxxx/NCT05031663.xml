  <brief_summary>

      This research study will test the effects of almonds on immune functions and immune response&#xD;
      to influenza vaccine in overweight middle-aged men&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a parallel-group, free-living, observer-blind, randomized controlled&#xD;
      dietary intervention trial on 54 overweight middle-aged men. This study will be carried out&#xD;
      in two phases: Phase 1 will examine the effects of almonds on clinically relevant markers of&#xD;
      immune function, and Phase 2 will assess the antibody response to influenza vaccination&#xD;
      following almond consumption. Participants will attend a baseline clinic and will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of two groups. The Almond group will receive 15% of daily energy intake in&#xD;
      the form of almonds as a snack and the Control group will receive an isocaloric&#xD;
      carbohydrate-based commercial snack (pretzels). The intervention will be for 12 weeks, at&#xD;
      which time both group participants will receive the influenza vaccination, and continue the&#xD;
      same dietary intervention for another 16 weeks.&#xD;
