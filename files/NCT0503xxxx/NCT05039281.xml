  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial tests the safety and side effects of atezolizumab in combination with&#xD;
      cabozantinib and whether they work to shrink tumors in patients with glioblastoma that has&#xD;
      come back (recurrent). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may&#xD;
      help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor&#xD;
      cells to grow and spread. Cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of&#xD;
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving atezolizumab and cabozantinib may help control the&#xD;
      disease in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety of atezolizumab in combination with cabozantinib. (Phase I) II. To&#xD;
      evaluate the progression-free survival at six months (PFS-6) of atezolizumab in combination&#xD;
      with cabozantinib. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), overall response&#xD;
      rate (ORR) and duration of response of atezolizumab in combination with cabozantinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Profiling tumor immune cell populations (i.e., macrophage migration inhibitory factor&#xD;
      [mIF] and immunohistochemistry [IHC] analyses of CD4, CD8, PD1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 expression).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Profiling of tumor, e.g., deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), messenger (m) ribonucleic acid&#xD;
      (RNA), microRNA and epigenetic profiling (DNA methylation), whole exome sequencing, RNA&#xD;
      sequencing, and microRNA sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Peripheral blood collection for evaluation of circulating chemokines/cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Stool collection for gut microbiome profiling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1 and cabozantinib&#xD;
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 3&#xD;
      months thereafter.&#xD;

             teaspoon (2.5 ml) of red blood, or any other history of significant bleeding (e.g.&#xD;
             pulmonary hemorrhage) within 12 weeks before first dose of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy (in the absence of therapeutic&#xD;
             anticoagulation)&#xD;
&#xD;
