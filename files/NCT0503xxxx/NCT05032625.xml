      There is significant mortality associated with necrotizing soft tissue infections, it is&#xD;
      imperative to decrease mortality and complications associated with this disease is&#xD;
      determined. To accomplish this goal, study team will create a prospectively maintained&#xD;
      database of all NSTI patients admitted at department of surgery. Investigators will asses the&#xD;
      predictors of poor outcome and follow these patients for 1 year in clinic and asses the&#xD;
      functional quality of life by incorporating 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) score.&#xD;

      RATIONALE AND BACKGROUND Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) are severe&#xD;
      life-threatening, rapidly-spreading, soft tissue infections of the subcutaneous tissue,&#xD;
      fascia, or muscle caused by bacteria. Due to the rapid progression of disease, early&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment are crucial to a patient's survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the aggressive nature of these infections and the significant mortality associated with&#xD;
      them, it is imperative that the optimal standard of care to decrease mortality and&#xD;
      complications associated with this disease is determined. To accomplish this goal, study team&#xD;
      will create a prospectively maintained database of all NSTI patients admitted at department&#xD;
      of surgery. Investigators will follow these patients for 1 year in clinic and asses the&#xD;
      functional quality of life by incorporating 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) score. This&#xD;
      RAND 36-Item Health Survey (Version 1.0) taps eight health concepts: physical functioning,&#xD;
      bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to&#xD;
      personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and&#xD;
      general health perceptions. It is a validated scale freely available for research to assess&#xD;
      the quality of life after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The short term objectives are to evaluate 30-day mortality and to establish the predictors of&#xD;
      poor outcome. The long term objectives are to measure quality of life after NSTI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHARACTERISTICS OF THE STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Population The study population will include all patients â‰¥ 18 years presenting with&#xD;
      necrotizing soft tissue infections admitted to Westchester Medical Center, who will undergo&#xD;
      surgical management&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Recruitment All patients admitted with a diagnosis of NSTI who undergo or about to&#xD;
      undergo surgery for NSTI and meet initial screening criteria will be approached by the&#xD;
      surgeon to determine if patient will agree to participate in the research study. The PI or PI&#xD;
      approved research personnel will explain the study to the patient or their legally authorized&#xD;
      representative (LAR). The patient/LAR will be given adequate time to ask questions and&#xD;
      consider participation in this study. Should the patient agree to be in the study, the PI or&#xD;
      PI-approved research personnel will have the patient/LAR fill out the consent and HIPAA forms&#xD;
      and they will be given a copy of both documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This study will be a prospective observational study. There will be no study&#xD;
      related interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration Investigators aim to enroll approximately 300 subjects between three years.&#xD;
      Each patient will be followed for 1 year. Therefore, we expect the study will be open for at&#xD;
      least 4 years. 3 years for enrollment and 1 year to complete the data analysis and&#xD;
      manuscript.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Data Collection Patients will be identified by the Department of Surgery morning report&#xD;
      and by Emergency General Surgeons. The Emergency General Surgeons (listed at the beginning of&#xD;
      the protocol), will notify the Department of Surgery's Clinical Research (DSCRU) unit when a&#xD;
      patient meets study criteria. After obtaining consent, the patients will be followed up for&#xD;
      one year. Data will be collected at the following time points: Pre-operative, Operative,&#xD;
      Post-Operative ,2- month post-op, 4- months post-op, 8- months post-op and 1 year post-op.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics: age, sex, race and ethnicity Comorbidities: anemia, bleeding disorder, cancer,&#xD;
      cardiac disease, chronic urinary tract infection, dialysis, hyperlipidemia,&#xD;
      hypo/hyper-thyroidism, immunocompromised, prior infection, liver disease, obesity, peripheral&#xD;
      vascular disease, renal disease, diabetes, hypertension and Transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social History: recreational drug use, tobacco and alcohol. Medications: use of&#xD;
      anticoagulants and antiplatelets, Vitals: systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), temperature (temp), respiratory rate (resp. rate), height,&#xD;
      weight and BMI (body mass index, Modified frailty index (Mfi) and Charleston's comorbidity&#xD;
      index Lab reports: the lab tests that are done as standard of care during the hospital stay&#xD;
      will be collected. The following lab values will be collected for the study only if they are&#xD;
      available in subject's medical record: hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood count&#xD;
      (differential), sodium, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), lactate, pH, glucose, creatinine, platelet&#xD;
      count, histopathology and culture for microbiology of the tissues resected during surgery,&#xD;

      partial thromboplastin time), cultures from blood, urine, sputum, trachea, wound and&#xD;

      and blood products received General: Number of drains, planned/unplanned procedures and&#xD;
      amount of blood loss Type and number/s of surgery: Time from admission to Ist debridement&#xD;

      length of stay, (ICU LOS), ventilator days, transfer back to ICU, time of drain removal and&#xD;
      mortality. Antibiotics (Regimen, combination, duration), hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT)&#xD;
      (Y/N), infectious disease consulted (Y/N) Complications: wound infection. Pneumonia, acute&#xD;
      kidney injury, multi-organ dysfunction, sepsis, urinary tract infection, venous thrombosis,&#xD;
      pulmonary embolism, adult respiratory distress syndrome Disposition: home, acute&#xD;
      rehabilitation center, subacute rehabilitation center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will follow patients for 1 year after discharge. Follow-up visits are done in&#xD;
      the clinic after 2 weekss, 1 month, 2-months, 4-months, 8-months and 1 year of discharge. We&#xD;
      will examine surgical site, asses pain, 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) scores&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research staff will review each chart and retrieve the information included in the data&#xD;
      collection form (please see attached). After data is collected, the research team along with&#xD;
      the Principal Investigator along with all Co-Investigators will analyze the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Chi-square difference tests will be used to assess significant&#xD;
      differences in predictors on categorical outcomes. T-tests will be used to assess mean&#xD;
      differences in predictors on continuous outcomes. Univariable and multivariable logistic&#xD;
      regression analyses will be conducted for outcomes such as all-cause mortality, pneumonia,&#xD;
      sepsis, and multi-organ failure. Univariable and multivariable linear regression will be&#xD;
      performed for hospital length of stay.&#xD;
