  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most of clinical cohorts focused on the course of asthma over time and on the different&#xD;
      phenotypes of asthma have investigated children and adults separately. The passage from&#xD;
      childhood to adulthood is scarcely explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, we decided to explore the course of asthma severity from teenage to&#xD;
      adulthood in children with severe asthma. The secondary objectives are to assess the quality&#xD;
      of life and socioeconomic status in adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be both retrospective (data collected during childhood) and prospective (data&#xD;
      collected during adulthood), multicentric and observational&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is one of the most frequent pediatric chronic disease; between 30% and 50% of&#xD;
      preschoolers have one to more episodes of wheezing, but less than half of them will have&#xD;
      asthma persisting during childhood .Over the past decades, several longitudinal studies have&#xD;
      described the different trajectories of asthma depending on the initial phenotype. The&#xD;
      results of the MAS study (Melbourne Asthma Study), including 330 patients followed from the&#xD;
      age of 7 to the age of 35 and then 50 years, showed that the most symptomatic asthma at&#xD;
      school age was most at risk of persisting into adulthood. Risk factors for persisting&#xD;
      symptomatic asthma were female gender, history of atopic dermatitis, changes in respiratory&#xD;
      function in childhood, parental history of asthma, early onset of asthma, and frequency&#xD;
      exacerbations in childhood. Thus, severe childhood asthma is more likely to persist in&#xD;
      adulthood while mild asthma is more likely to go into remission. Long-term remission is still&#xD;
      possible; in the MAS cohort, 15% of patients with severe childhood asthma were in complete&#xD;
      remission by the age of 50 years.Severe asthma is poorly represented in studies from the&#xD;
      general population or neonatal cohorts, as it remains rare in children. However, there are&#xD;
      several clinical studies supporting at least a partial improvement in symptoms in adulthood.&#xD;
      Thus, in a Dutch cohort of asthmatic children followed in a tertiary center and re-assessed&#xD;
      in their 2nd and 3rd decades, asthma symptoms returned to at least partial remission in 52%&#xD;
      of patients. However, only a minority of them (42%) had complete remission of their symptoms&#xD;
      and normal respiratory function.Most of the clinical cohort studies examining the prognosis&#xD;
      of asthma during time explored separately children and adults. Some biomarkers are lacking in&#xD;
      children and the passage from childhood to adulthood is not explored. The usual phenotypic&#xD;
      description takes into account the presence or absence of atopy, the frequency of symptoms,&#xD;
      the factors triggering exacerbations, the severity of the disease, some biomarkers of&#xD;
      inflammation and the level of control under treatment. The difficulty of accessing biomarkers&#xD;
      from the deep lung in children and the binary analysis of some variables such as atopy make&#xD;
      the description and the analysis of risk factors for persistence of asthma in adulthood&#xD;
      difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the prognosis of asthma is not only influenced by biological and environmental&#xD;
      factors, but also by social factors throughout life. Thus, a low socioeconomic level is a&#xD;
      recognized risk factor for severe acute asthma and poor asthma control.Finally, beyond the&#xD;
      medium and long term prognosis, severe asthma is associated with an impaired quality of life,&#xD;
      in children as well as in adults.In this context, the main objective of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the course of asthma from childhood to young adulthood in a population of children&#xD;
      with severe persistent asthma. The secondary objectives are to determine the phenotypic&#xD;
      evolution of asthma (in particular atopic co-morbidities); to Compare the severity of asthma&#xD;
      in adulthood according to the initial phenotypes of asthma in childhood, integrating&#xD;
      clinical, functional, radiological, and biological parameters (including biomarkers from the&#xD;
      deep lung);to describe the quality of life of these patients in adulthood and their&#xD;
      socio-economic status.The primary endpoint is the classification of the severity and control&#xD;
      of asthma in adulthood according to the GINA criteria.The secondary endpoints will be :&#xD;
&#xD;
      - When assessing severe asthma in childhood: Demographic data: age, sex, term of birth,&#xD;
      socio-economic level of parents according to INSEE (high, intermediate or low), geographic&#xD;
      origin of parents, body mass index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Environmental data: exposure to irritants and potential allergens. Anamnestic data: history&#xD;
      of familial asthma, time to disease progression, history of pneumonia, bronchopulmonary&#xD;
      dysplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Associated co-morbidities: existence of allergic rhinitis assessed by the SFAR diagnostic&#xD;
      score and the ARIA severity score, atopic dermatitis, food allergy, clinical gastroesophageal&#xD;
      reflux disease or proven by pHmetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of additional assessments: bronchial endoscopy, functional respiratory data, blood&#xD;
      eosinophilia, existence of allergen sensitization&#xD;

      of school or professional absenteeism for asthma out of the 12 last months.&#xD;
&#xD;
