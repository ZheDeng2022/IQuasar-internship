  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will study the extent to which soft drink information labels -- designed to curb unhealthy&#xD;
      consumption -- are well-targeted to the most biased consumers.The study team will deploy&#xD;
      novel methods for evaluating the targeting properties of information labels via an&#xD;
      incentive-compatible online shopping experiment. At a high-level, we will ask whether the&#xD;
      treatment effects of the information labels are concentrated on individuals with the biggest&#xD;
      self-control problems and with the least knowledge of nutrition. We will first use the&#xD;
      methodology from Allcott et al. (2019) to estimate the internality for each participant. We&#xD;
      will then have participants make shopping decisions for soft drinks, first absent any&#xD;
      information labels and then, for those not in the control group, in the presence of an&#xD;
      information label. The within-subject design of the soft drinks experiment will allow us to&#xD;
      estimate how the effects of the labels covary with consumers' internalities, and thus to&#xD;
      determine whether the labels are well-targeted.&#xD;

      We will use online ads to recruit people who are shopping online for soda, and direct them to&#xD;
      a two-stage online Qualtrics experiment. In the first stage (Part I), we will elicit&#xD;
      subjects' nutritional literacy and self-control for resisting sugary drinks, following the&#xD;
      methodology of Allcott et al. (2019). Allcott et al. (2019) show that these two measures&#xD;
      explain 31% of sugary drinks consumption in a nationally-representative sample of&#xD;
      approximately 20,000 households, after controlling for detailed demographic information and&#xD;
      elicitations of &quot;tastes&quot; for various types of drinks. Additionally, Allcott et al. (2019)&#xD;
      demonstrate how these measures can be used to provide an estimate of over-consumption of&#xD;
      sugary drinks at the individual level. Consequently, the first stage allows us to obtain&#xD;
      estimates of the internality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A week later, we will recruit participants in the first stage to participate in the second&#xD;
      stage of the experiment (Part II). We create a time delay to minimize the potential effect of&#xD;
      the first-stage questions on the second-stage choices. In the second stage, we will first ask&#xD;
      participants to select their three favorite sugary drinks from a list. We will then ask&#xD;
      participants to make an initial set of choices between those drinks and sugar-free&#xD;
      alternatives (e.g., Seagram's Ginger Ale versus 365 Ginger) at various relative prices.&#xD;
      Specifically, we will elicit their willingness to pay using a multiple price list, as is&#xD;
      standard in the behavioral economics literature, where consumers answer a series of questions&#xD;
      about whether they would prefer to buy a sugar-sweetened beverage at price X or a sugar-free&#xD;
      alternative at price Y. Choices will be incentive-compatible: for each consumer we will honor&#xD;
      their choice in a randomly selected decision (i.e., we will purchase the chosen package of&#xD;
      soft drinks for them plus award them any additional money associated with that choice).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following an initial set of choices, we will ask subjects to choose again. In this second set&#xD;
      of choices, we will randomize whether participants see the soft drink options paired with an&#xD;
      information label. We will also randomize the types of labels, including: (i) an inflated&#xD;
      nutrition label that draws attention to the differences in calories and sugar content, (ii)&#xD;
      the stoplight warning label developed by Grummon, Hall, et al. (2019), and (iii) a graphic&#xD;
      warning label developed by Donnelly et al. (2018). The control group will instead make the&#xD;
      same choices without seeing any label. Leveraging the within-subject nature of design, we&#xD;
      will then estimate how well-targeted each information label is by estimating how the&#xD;
      subjects' internalities covary with their changes in the prices at which they are willing to&#xD;
      buy soft drinks after seeing the information label.&#xD;
