  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment for early stage, estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer is&#xD;
      lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by 16-25 treatments of adjuvant&#xD;
      whole-breast radiation therapy plus or minus hormone therapy. However, the COVID-19 pandemic&#xD;
      has necessitated changes in the way breast cancer is treated in order to reduce contact&#xD;
      between individuals, reduce spread of the novel coronavirus, and lessen the impact on health&#xD;
      care resources. As elective surgeries are being cancelled, current pandemic guidelines&#xD;
      recommend that patients be started on hormone treatment while waiting for surgeries to be&#xD;
      re-instated. Only after this surgery occurs will patients receive radiation treatment,&#xD;
      dramatically extending the time between diagnosis and end of treatment. Emergency pandemic&#xD;
      guidelines in the UK and other countries recommend 5 fractions of pre-operative radiation&#xD;
      therapy where appropriate. Based on previous work in the SIGNAL 1.0 and SIGNAL 2.0 clinical&#xD;
      trials, the investigators are proposing treating patients with early stage breast cancers&#xD;
      with one single fraction of stereotactic neoadjuvant radiation during the pre-operative&#xD;
      waiting period. This will allow patients to complete radiation therapy upfront while reducing&#xD;
      the number of patient visits to hospital. This will also allow investigators to evaluate the&#xD;
      ability of single-fraction targeted radiation to induce a pathologic complete response.&#xD;

    <description>To evaluate whether a pathologic complete response can be achieved when radiotherapy is delivered in a single 21 Gy fraction, establishing whether tumour response has a linear function with time in the context of delayed surgery. Pathologic complete response will be treated as a dichotomous variable (yes/no). Results will be stratified based on whether patients were also placed on neoadjuvant hormone treatment.</description>
