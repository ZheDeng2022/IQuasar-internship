  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of Verity-BCG in patients with intermediate&#xD;
      and high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and to compare our findings to the&#xD;
      standard of care BCG formulation, OncoTICE (BCG) in order to examine our hypothesis that&#xD;
      Verity-BCG is at least non-inferior to OncoTICE in achieving 24-month Recurrence Free&#xD;
      Survival in NMIBC patients who are at high risk of recurrence and have never been treated&#xD;
      with intradermal or intravesical BCG before, with the exception of tuberculosis vaccination&#xD;
      in childhood.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, active control, double-blind clinical trial aimed at&#xD;
      demonstrating non - inferiority of VERITY-BCG to OncoTICE, the current standard of care, with&#xD;
      respect to two-year Recurrence Free Survival (RFS) rates in NMIBC BCG - naïve patients that&#xD;
      are at high risk for recurrence (defined as &gt;50%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Recurrence will be defined as the reappearance of any of the NMIBC tumors as confirmed by&#xD;
      cystoscopic biopsy or TURBT.&#xD;

    <description>Change in Quality of Life as measured by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life questionnaire for NMIBC (EORTC-QLQ-NMIBC24) over 36 months.&#xD;
The EORTC QLQ-NMIBC24 is a 24-item self-administered questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life in patients with intermediate to high-risk NMIBC. Items are ranked by the patient from 1 to 4 indicating the extent to which they have experienced those symptoms or problems. 1 = Not at All, 2 = A little, 3=Quite a bit, 4 = Very Much.&#xD;
- High Score is equivalent to more problems, except for items on sexual function and sexual enjoyment for which a high score is interpreted as better function.</description>

    <description>Change in functioning and symptom status as measured by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life questionnaire for Cancer Patients (EORTC-QLQ-C30) over 36 months.&#xD;
The EORTC QLQ-C30 consists of 30 items and measures Health Related Quality of Life as well as presence of symptoms across all cancer types. The QLQ-C30 includes nine multi-item scales:&#xD;
5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social)&#xD;
3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting);&#xD;
A global health and quality-of-life scale*&#xD;
Several single-item symptom measures&#xD;
28 Items are ranked 1 to 4. 1 = Not at All, 2 = A little, 3=Quite a bit, 4 = Very Much.&#xD;
*2 items are ranked 1 to 7. 1=Very Poor, 7 = Excellent.&#xD;
High score = More symptoms or worse problems&#xD;
*High Score = Better overall health or Quality of life.</description>

                  bilateral salpingectomy);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has had a cessation of menses for at least 12 months without an alternative&#xD;
                  medical cause, and a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) test confirming&#xD;

             or practice an effective method of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Male patients must agree to refrain from donating sperm during the treatment period and for&#xD;
        at least 120 days after the last dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;

             urethra documented by radiological imaging or biopsy, performed within 12 months of&#xD;
             the start of treatment. Should the imaging or biopsy be performed outside the window&#xD;
             it will be up to the physicians' discretion to re-scan/biopsy. This is considered T4&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known positive HIV serology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of a urinary tract infection; treatment should be withheld until urine&#xD;
             culture is negative and antibiotic therapy is stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Trauma to the urinary bladder. In case of gross hematuria, therapy should be stopped&#xD;
             or postponed until the hematuria has been successfully treated or has resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to BCG vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy: pregnant women are excluded from this study because VERITY-BCG is an agent&#xD;
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with VERITY-BCG, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with VERITY-BCG.&#xD;
