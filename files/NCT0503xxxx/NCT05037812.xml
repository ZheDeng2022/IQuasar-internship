  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain control in the setting of orthopaedic trauma has always been imperative for patient&#xD;
      comfort and to enhance functional recovery. However, the current opioid epidemic makes&#xD;
      effective pain control even more critical. Furthermore, the Center of Medicare and Medicaid&#xD;
      Services have developed tools for rating physician care, of which, pain control is considered&#xD;
      a contributing part. The operative management of tibial plateau fractures requires adequate&#xD;
      pain control to allow for early motion of the joint. Recently, multimodal pain therapy has&#xD;
      been proposed as way to accomplish effective postoperative pain relief. This is difficult for&#xD;
      this injury as any form of regional analgesia such as nerve blocks are not possible due to&#xD;
      the possibility of compartment syndrome. The goal of the proposed research study is to&#xD;
      determine the effectiveness of periarticular multimodal analgesia in the setting of tibial&#xD;
      plateau fractures. Effectiveness of the multimodal analgesia is defined as lower pain scores&#xD;
      and decreased narcotic intake in the perioperative setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected outcomes of the study are based on the extensive total knee arthroplasty&#xD;
      literature that shows decreased pain and narcotic usage in the peri-operative period with&#xD;
      peri-articular multimodal analgesia injections. Furthermore, a recent study by other&#xD;
      investigators showed decreased pain and narcotic usage in the first post-operative day&#xD;
      following femur fractures of any kind. These data display the promise for the use of&#xD;
      peri-articular multimodal analgesia in the setting of tibial plateau fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the rise of patient-centered care and outcome driven re-imbursement, pain control is one&#xD;
      of the main factors in both these domains. The Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services has&#xD;
      developed the Total Performance Score for Hospitals, which is factored into the reimbursement&#xD;
      for provided services. Pain Management is one of the main contributors to the score.&#xD;
      Moreover, pain control has been shown to improve patient satisfaction, which is of increasing&#xD;
      importance in medicine today.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While some lower extremity fractures can be managed with a nerve block, tibial plateau&#xD;
      fractures have a significant risk of developing compartment syndrome that preclude these&#xD;
      patients from receiving a nerve block as it does not allow clinical monitoring. As such, the&#xD;
      remaining options are to control pain with IV and oral narcotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no data on the effectiveness of peri-articular multimodal analgesia for tibial&#xD;
      plateau fractures. The majority of evidence behind these injections in reducing&#xD;
      peri-operative pain and decreasing narcotic use comes from the total knee arthroplasty&#xD;
      literature. Numerous studies have investigated the effect of these injections and shown a&#xD;
      decrease in perioperative pain and use of perioperative narcotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have looked at multimodal analgesia injections in femur fractures of all kinds.&#xD;
      They found that in patients receiving the injection, their pain was decreased over the first&#xD;
      postoperative day along with consuming fewer narcotics over the same time frame.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the randomization in these studies resulted in an unequal distribution of&#xD;
      injuries that may have biased the results. They noted, &quot;further investigations are required&#xD;
      to establish the efficacy of this multimodal protocol for the individual surgical procedures&#xD;
      considered&quot;. Five patients with tibial plateau fractures have experimentally been treated&#xD;
      with a local multimodal analgesia at the applying institution. All five have had a&#xD;
      subjectively decreased amount of pain with no evidence of peroneal nerve palsy, compartment&#xD;
      syndrome, or infection. If the proposed study finds similar results in decreasing pain and&#xD;
      narcotic use, not only would patients have an overall better experience, but this would also&#xD;
      help in decreasing narcotic related adverse events in the hospital.&#xD;
