  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Previous epidemiological and animal studies have suggested a strong relationship&#xD;
      between prediabetes and Alzheimer's disease. Recently, we demonstrated that plasma β-amyloid&#xD;
      (Aβ), a potential biomarker for Alzheimer's disease, was elevated in individuals with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. However, few studies have investigated the associations of plasma Aβ40 and Aβ42&#xD;
      concentrations with prediabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: we aimed to investigate the associations of plasma Aβ40 and Aβ42 concentrations&#xD;
      with risk of prediabetes in two independent studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: We performed a case-control study and a nested case-control study within a&#xD;
      prospective cohort study. In the case-control study, we included 571 newly diagnosed&#xD;
      individuals with prediabetes and 571 control participants. Prediabetes individuals were&#xD;
      consecutively recruited from subjects who attended the outpatient clinics of Department of&#xD;
      Endocrinology at Tongji Medical College Hospital from 2012 to 2015. Concomitantly, we&#xD;
      recruited healthy controls from a general population undergoing a routine health checkup in&#xD;
      the same hospital. One healthy control was selected at random for each prediabetes&#xD;
      individuals according to age (±3 years) and sex. The inclusion criteria of participants were&#xD;
      as follows: age ≥30 and ≤80 years, BMI &lt;40 kg/m2, no history of prediabetes and diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus, no history of receiving pharmacological treatment for hyperlipidemia, nor any&#xD;
      clinically systemic disease, any acute illness, and chronic inflammatory or any infective&#xD;
      disease. An independent nested case-control study was conducted within an ongoing cohort&#xD;
      study, namely the Tongji-Ezhou cohort. Briefly, 5533 participants, including 3101 retired&#xD;
      employees and 2432 working employees, were enrolled from Echeng Stell and received healthcare&#xD;
      for a baseline investigation between 2013 and 2015. The first follow-up for all participants&#xD;
      was finished by mid-2020. Considering the low incidence of prediabetes among young working&#xD;
      employees, we performed the nested case-control study among retired employees. During the&#xD;
      follow-up, 119 new-onset prediabetes cases were diagnosed within the retired employees&#xD;
      according to fasting plasma glucose. We randomly selected the control participants who&#xD;
      matched 2:1 to the cases by age (±3 years) and sex from the retired employees with normal&#xD;
      fasting plasma glucose. The inclusion criteria were the same as the case-control study; 2&#xD;
      new-onset prediabetes cases aged &gt;80 years were excluded. Additionally, 17 cases without&#xD;
      enough plasma were excluded. Finally, 100 individuals with new-onset prediabetes and 200&#xD;
      well-matched control participants were included for the analysis of the nested case-control&#xD;
      study. These two studies were approved by the Ethics and Human Subject Committee of Tongji&#xD;
      Medical College. All enrolled participants in the two studies were of Chinese Han ethnicity&#xD;
      and provided informed written consent. Plasma Aβ40 and Aβ42 concentrations were&#xD;
      simultaneously measured by validated assay platforms from Meso Scale Discovery (MSD;&#xD;
      Rockville, MD, USA).&#xD;
