  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease (AERD), although uncommon in the general population,&#xD;
      is an important phenotype of severe asthma and nasal polyposis where it occurs in 15% of&#xD;
      severe asthmatics, and up to 30% of those with nasal polyposis. An important therapy for AERD&#xD;
      is aspirin therapy after desensitization (ADAT). This is an inexpensive and proven therapy to&#xD;
      improve the burden of sinus disease in AERD. Aspirin desensitization is the mechanism by&#xD;
      which tolerance is induced in AERD patients. This is a 1-2 day outpatient procedure whereby&#xD;
      increasing doses of aspirin are administered and the patients invariably experience some&#xD;
      degree of hypersensitivity reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to understand the effect of medications on the aspirin desensitization. It is&#xD;
      known that the leukotriene modifier medications decrease the severity of the reactions in&#xD;
      AERD. Other treatments such as antihistamines and the biologic agent omalizumab might have an&#xD;
      effect on either blocking or blunting reactivity in AERD during desensitization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dupilumab is a new respiratory biologic approved for atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic asthma&#xD;
      and nasal polyposis. As such, it is well situated to be used for many AERD patients whose&#xD;
      disease cannot be well controlled. The effect of dupilumab on the aspirin desensitization&#xD;
      process and reaction is unknown and is the topic of this investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine the effect of dupilumab on reactions during aspirin&#xD;
      challenge/desensitization.&#xD;

    <measure>Rate of positive challenges to aspirin challenge</measure>
    <time_frame>Aspirin challenge = 6 weeks after starting dupilumab/placebo. Aspirin challenge day = up to 8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Aspirin challenge reactions will be defined as either 1) &gt;15% drop in FEV1 or 2) &gt;25% drop in peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) or 3) &gt;5 point change in composite symptom score.&#xD;
Spirometry is a standardized measure of airflow obstruction used to define lower airway reaction to aspirin in AERD.&#xD;
Nasal inspiratory flow rates are measured using an inverted peak flow meter and have been correlated with nasal obstruction occurring during nasal reactions to aspirin in AERD.&#xD;
Symptom Score - symptoms are a typical part of an aspirin reaction with increase in congestion, itching, cough, and chest tightness.</description>

    <description>Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks the receptor component for IL-4 and IL-13, which are key drivers of type 2 inflammation.&#xD;
8 of 16 subjects will randomly receive dupilumab. All subjects will undergo an aspirin challenge/desensitization procedure. To achieve adequate steady state levels of dupilumab, the dosing regimen will be a 600mg loading dose of dupilumab followed by 300mg subcutaneous at 1 week, 3 weeks and 5 weeks. Aspirin challenge/desensitization will take place at week 6 after dupilumab loading dose.</description>
