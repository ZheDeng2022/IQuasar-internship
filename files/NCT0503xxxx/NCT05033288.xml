  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares carbon ion therapy, surgery, and proton therapy to determine if one has&#xD;
      better disease control and fewer side effects. There are three types of radiation treatment&#xD;
      used for pelvic bone sarcomas: surgery with or without photon/proton therapy, proton therapy&#xD;
      alone, and carbon ion therapy alone. The purpose of this study is to compare quality of life&#xD;
      among patients treated for pelvic bone sarcomas across the world, and to determine if carbon&#xD;
      ion therapy improves quality of life compared to surgery and disease control compared with&#xD;
      proton therapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Demonstrate whether carbon ion therapy provides improved patient reported health related&#xD;
      quality of life (PRO-HRQOL) outcomes and less significant toxicities compared with surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Demonstrate whether carbon ion therapy provides improved local control versus proton&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete quality of life questionnaires over 20 minutes at baseline (before any&#xD;
      therapy), 2-4 and 5-9 months after completion of therapy, and then annually for up to 5&#xD;
      years. Patients' medical records are also reviewed.&#xD;
