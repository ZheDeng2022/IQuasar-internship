  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibroblast-activation protein (FAP) is a type Ⅱ transmembrane serine protease and is&#xD;
      overexpressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs are the predominant component in&#xD;
      the stroma of epithelial neoplasms. FAP can be detected in various of malignant neoplasms and&#xD;
      is associated to tumor cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. Recently, a novel&#xD;
      molecular probe, gallium 68-labelled FAP inhibitor (68Ga-FAPI), has been developed and used&#xD;
      for visualization of tumor stroma by targeting FAP. Recent studies show favorable diagnosis&#xD;
      efficiency in a variety of tumors, especially in gastrointestinal cancer, but the previous&#xD;
      studies were all small-sample data or case reports. Therefore, further large-size research is&#xD;
      necessary to confirm the advantages of 68Ga-FAPI in various of malignant tumors.&#xD;

      The morbidity and mortality of malignant tumors are increasing. It is one of the major&#xD;
      diseases that affect human health. At present, the conventional imaging diagnosis methods of&#xD;
      a variety of malignant tumors are mainly CT and MRI based on anatomical imaging. Different&#xD;
      from traditional imaging methods to visually display the lesion, nuclear medicine molecular&#xD;
      imaging can not only locate the tumor location, but also image the expression and activity of&#xD;
      specific molecules and biological processes. This molecular imaging method integrating&#xD;
      anatomy and function is a noninvasive imaging to realize the early diagnosis and differential&#xD;
      diagnosis, curative effect evaluation and follow-up observation of a variety of tumors.&#xD;
      Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) uses specific molecular probes to&#xD;
      target tumor. It can provide detailed information about the biochemical changes of tumor&#xD;
      tissues at the cellular and molecular levels. It has better sensitivity and specificity than&#xD;
      conventional imaging methods. At present, the most commonly used imaging agent in clinic is&#xD;
      18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG). 18F-FDG PET/CT is a valuable imaging modality in the&#xD;
      management of patients with malignant tumors, but it is not a specific imaging agent for&#xD;
      tumor application. The physiological uptake of gastrointestinal tract, infected tissues, or&#xD;
      inflammatory cells can cause high 18F-FDG uptake resulting in a significant increase of the&#xD;
      false positive rate; in addition, some tumors including well-differentiated hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and gastric signet ring cell carcinoma have low 18F-FDG&#xD;
      uptake resulting in a high false negative rate. Therefore, it is very important to develop&#xD;
      new molecular probes for targeting tumor.&#xD;
