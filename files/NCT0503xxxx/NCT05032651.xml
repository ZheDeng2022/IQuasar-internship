  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been known well for a long time that End stage renal disease (ESRD) patients usually&#xD;
      need ESA to maintain their hemoglobin (Hb) to improve both mortality as well as quality of&#xD;
      life. Later, several large-scale RCTs showing normalization of Hb in this population&#xD;
      increased the risk of thromboembolic event, which leaded current guidelines to recommend the&#xD;
      therapeutic goal for anemia in ESRD should be within a range (usually between 10-12 gm/dl)&#xD;
      rather than above or below a certain level (or value). In addition to ESA dose, many factors&#xD;
      contribute to the severity of anemia in this population, such as iron status, chronic blood&#xD;
      loss, adequacy of dialysis, chronic inflammation, renal wasting, et al. To put all these&#xD;
      factors together, maintaining the Hb levels within the target level is a challenge to&#xD;
      physician. It was reported that only one third of Hb within the target at any given time. Our&#xD;
      data showed, for those under maintenance hemodialysis and without any blood transfusion in&#xD;
      observation period, near two third of patients' Hb level were within the target range.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For better anemia management, NKF-K/DOQI developed and published guidelines using protocol or&#xD;
      algorithm for EPO prescription.6 Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely&#xD;
      applied to medicine in the field of reducing human error, robotic surgical system and&#xD;
      decision- making aid. Since then, there were several studies working on decision making&#xD;
      programs to set up model of predicting the ESA dose needed for target Hb level. Artificial&#xD;
      neural network (ANN) model is most commonly used for ESA dose-response prediction. However,&#xD;
      the effectiveness of these kinds of AI is not confirmed clinically and the result not&#xD;
      satisfactory. In other words, it is still inconclusive whether contemporary AI has any role&#xD;
      in decision making aid when prescribing ESA dose for dialysis patient, a typical trial and&#xD;
      error which AI supposed should be very helpful with.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the mentioned above, we are going to conduct this clinical try to test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that AI is not inferior to physician in prescribing ESA dose for hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients to maintain hemoglobin(Hb) level to meet the target&#xD;
