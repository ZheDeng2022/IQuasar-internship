      The primary objective of the study is to assess the impact of AlloCare mHealth remote&#xD;
      monitoring on the early post-transplant period in solid organ transplantation.The outcome&#xD;
      measure for primary objective is overall reduction in Readmission Rate to hospital in 90 days&#xD;
      for all causes. Patients will be assessed across 4 different organ groups (Kidney, Liver,&#xD;
      Lung and Heart Transplantation). The secondary objective is to consider the impact of mHealth&#xD;
      and app-based monitoring on variables known to impact long term outcomes over the first 12&#xD;
      months post transplantation, as well as impact on quality of life. The outcome measures for&#xD;
      secondary objective are: 1. Tacrolimus Variability (Time in Therapeutic Range,) as a&#xD;
      surrogate to adherence and compliance 2. BPAR within 3,6, and 12 months 3. Patient&#xD;
      satisfaction at 90 days 4. SF-36 change at 90 days 5. HbA1c monitoring (diabetic patients&#xD;
      only)&#xD;

      If a patient is randomized to the AlloCare App arm and does not have access to a smartphone&#xD;
      to utilize AlloCare App, a device will be provided for the duration of the study for use,&#xD;
      with the AlloCare app installed. Otherwise, patients will be allowed to use their own device&#xD;
      . The device and data plan will be covered by the sponsor for the duration of the study.&#xD;
      Enrollment on the Allocare app with weekly transmission of patient data to the transplant&#xD;
      programs is expected. In addition, all patients will have AlloSure dd-cfDNA surveillance per&#xD;
      their institutional schedule. These patients will be compared to the current standard: Paper&#xD;
      binder, with written diary, also including AlloSure with weekly visits as needed per center&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will follow an AlloSure cfDNA testing schedule based on medical necessity and&#xD;
      outlined as the standard of care by the institution. The mHealth remote monitoring is weekly&#xD;
      for the first 90 days and then monthly until 12 months post-transplant. The remainder of the&#xD;
      schedule will follow the current standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If study sites are unable to follow this recommend schedule, please create an amended&#xD;
      schedule of events for review by the sponsor. DSA (optional) is aimed to be collected as part&#xD;
      of their post-transplant surveillance. The EMR will be examined at 3,6, and 12 months post&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AlloCare App is a smart phone-based app that empowers transplant patients to manage their&#xD;
      health by enabling them to adhere to and track their health activities and transmit data on&#xD;
      their compliance to their care team &amp; community providers. Primary functionality of the&#xD;
      application involves medication management, which includes up to date medication lists&#xD;
      derived directly from the EHR, scheduling of medication and medication reminders and&#xD;
      adherence tracking. In addition, the user can record and monitor other wellness activities&#xD;
      such as water intake, steps, mood, sleep etc. Support for testing adherence is provided by&#xD;
      allowing the user to connect to patient care managers directly through the app, schedule both&#xD;
      in-center and mobile blood-draws and providing lab visit reminders. Lastly, the app provides&#xD;
      the user with support through multi-modality educational materials and a virtual connection&#xD;
      to a community of other post-transplant patients, as well as to their own care givers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also be offered mobile phlebotomy if they are unable to visit a local lab. This&#xD;
      is a service provided by CareDx for all patients needing Allosure test for clinical decision&#xD;
      making. The mobile blood draw will be ordered by your providers as clinically necessary and&#xD;
      coordinated by CareDx, which will draw all regular tests, urine sample as well as the&#xD;
      AlloSure. Results are couriered to your lab of choice for analysis. This can be your own&#xD;
      hospital lab so you can directly see the results in your hospital EMR. AlloSure results will&#xD;
      be sent to the center in the same format as you are currently receiving them. Patients&#xD;
      utilizing AlloCare App for post-transplant monitoring will be able to review their Allosure&#xD;
      results on the App.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For investigators who do not have an electronic medical record (EMR) with transplant&#xD;
      functionality and/or a fully functional transplant management database, the OTTR SaaS&#xD;
      platform is an option that can be provided for the duration of the investigation, to allow&#xD;
      capture of all critical data fields. OTTR SaaS is a fully HIPAA compliant Transplant patient&#xD;
      management application with pre- and post-transplant longitudinal workflow management and&#xD;
      data capture capabilities.&#xD;
