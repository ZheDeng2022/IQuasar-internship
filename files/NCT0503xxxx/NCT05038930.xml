    <textblock>
      Introduction Patients with severe brain injury are often restricted to bed rest during the&#xD;
      early period of brain injury which may lead to unwanted secondary complications. There is&#xD;
      lack of evidence of when to initiate the first mobilisation. The Sara Combilizer® is an easy&#xD;
      and efficient tool for mobilising patients with severe injuries, including brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through a randomised cross-over trial the investigators will investigate the impact of early&#xD;
      mobilisation on patients with severe acquired brain injury caused by traumatic brain injury,&#xD;
      subarachnoid brain injury or intracranial haematoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesise that mobilisation using the Sara Combilizer® does not affect&#xD;
      partial oxygenation of brain tissue.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to quantify cerebral oxygenation, when mobilising&#xD;
      patients with severe brain injury using a Sara Combilizer® to the seated position and during&#xD;
      passive standing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is conducted at the Department of Neurointensive care and Neuroanaesthesiology,&#xD;
      Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the International Conference on harmonisation-Good Clinical Practice guidelines and&#xD;
      the Danish &quot;Good Clinical Practice&quot; administrative order, a table regarding the&#xD;
      responsibilities of sponsor/investigators before, during and after the clinical trial, will&#xD;
      be filled and signed in order to avoid misunderstandings. This table can be found in the&#xD;
      Trial Master File (TMF) located at the primary investigator's office and the sponsor's&#xD;
      office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as a cross-over study with patients randomly assigned to (1) an&#xD;
      initial intervention protocol on the first day and with a passive sedentary protocol on the&#xD;
      second, or (2) an initial passive sedentary protocol on the first day followed by an&#xD;
      intervention protocol on the second day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation Included patients will, after stabilisation of ICP, be randomised to start with&#xD;
      either the intervention or sedentary protocol, with the opposite protocol on the second day.&#xD;
      A computer-generated randomisation algorithm will be created in REDCap, with age and Glasgow&#xD;
      Coma Score (GCS) as dichotomised stratification variables. Age will be divided into young (18&#xD;
      to 60 years) and old (61+ years), and the GCS into severe brain injury (GCS 3-8) and moderate&#xD;
      to mild injury (GCS 9-15). The following four composite groups of age and GCS will ensure an&#xD;
      equal distribution of the patients within each stratum.&#xD;

    <description>Phase 1. The patient will be positioned in a supine position for 20 minutes on the Sara Combilizer®. When necessary, the head of the patient can be elevated to a maximum of 30 degrees during the 20 minutes baseline measurements.&#xD;

Phase 3. The patient will be moved to the standing position for 20 minutes with an elevation angle of the Sara Combilizer of at least 70 degrees. If patients become haemodynamically unstable during the seated or standing position, they will be returned to the supine position, and the intervention will be terminated.&#xD;
