  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite older adults being exposed to an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (ASCVD), they are generally underrepresented in cardiovascular prevention programmes.&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of implementing an integrated exercise and&#xD;
      cardiovascular health education programme (HE programme) on older adults at risk of ASCVD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial. (1) The control group will receive&#xD;
      a basic lifestyle modification talk and governmental education leaflets. (2) The experimental&#xD;
      group will receive an integrated exercise and health education programme (HE programme) based&#xD;
      on self-efficacy theory. Physical activity level, exercise self-efficacy and ASCVD risk&#xD;
      profile including blood pressure, cardiac endurance, and anthropometric outcomes will be&#xD;
      investigated via physiological assessments, medical history-taking or questionnaires at&#xD;
      baseline, Week 6, and Week 12. Meanwhile, study feasibility will be primarily evaluated in&#xD;
      terms of programme acceptability, intervention integrity, recruitment rate and retention rate&#xD;
      throughout the process and at Week 12.&#xD;
