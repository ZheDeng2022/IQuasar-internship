    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators want to assess spiritual resources, spiritual distress and&#xD;
      spiritual coping in patients with psychiatric disorders of the affective spectrum with a new&#xD;
      designed questionnaire the Spiritual Distress and Resources Questionnaire (SDRQ)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The inclusion of the spiritual dimension in healthcare has been a recommendation of the World&#xD;
      Health Organization (WHO) since 1984. According to the WHO, 'spiritual' refers &quot;to those&#xD;
      aspects of human life relating to experiences that transcend sensory phenomena. This is not&#xD;
      the same as 'religious', though for many people the spiritual dimension of their lives&#xD;
      includes a religious component. The spiritual aspect of human life may be viewed as an&#xD;
      integrating element holding together the physical, psychological and social dimensions. It is&#xD;
      often perceived as being concerned with meaning and purpose&quot;. Today there is a growing body&#xD;
      of scientific evidence for therapeutic relevance of the spiritual dimension in different&#xD;
      fields of medical health care. Based on this increasing scientific evidence, medical&#xD;
      associations such as the Royal College of Psychiatrists recommend the assessment of spiritual&#xD;
      needs for therapeutic goals. Despite those long-standing calls and findings, these&#xD;
      recommendations have not yet been widely implemented. Even in palliative care, patients&#xD;
      indicate that their spiritual concerns are often inadequately addressed. Many clinicians&#xD;
      report that they lack the required communication skills to adequately address spiritual&#xD;
      concerns, while patients are not used to bring up their spiritual needs by themselves. As&#xD;
      spiritual needs can only be integrated into care delivery if known to the practitioners, an&#xD;
      explicit assessment is necessary. There are numerous instruments to assess spiritual aspects&#xD;
      in the context of health care research - but only few to be used in a clinical context.&#xD;
      Furthermore, there are many instruments that take into account the specific spiritual needs&#xD;
      at the end of life in palliative care, while there are fewer established instruments in the&#xD;
      care of chronic diseases. To close this gap, the investigators constructed and validated a&#xD;
      new screening tool for assessing spiritual distress and resources, the Spiritual Distress and&#xD;
      Resources Questionnaire (SDRQ) in patients with chronic pain in a previous project within the&#xD;
      National Research Program &quot;Smarter Health Care&quot; (NRP 74).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this NRP 74 project showed clearly: Spiritual aspects are considered as&#xD;
      important in the context of chronic pain by health care professionals and patients alike.&#xD;
      They could be important resources to be integrated in a multimodal pain therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators want to assess spiritual resources, spiritual distress and&#xD;
      spiritual coping in patients with psychiatric disorders of the affective spectrum. To compare&#xD;
      the results with the results of chronic pain patients, similar questionnaires as in the above&#xD;
      mentioned study within NRP 74 will be used. Additionally, the investigators want to assess&#xD;
      the proportion and characteristics of patients who wish spiritual aspects to be integrated in&#xD;
      the therapeutic setting. Overall, the goal is to create knowledge to adequately address&#xD;
      spiritual aspects in those patients who wish the integration of their spiritual needs into&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The SDRQ is a validated self-rating instrument to assess spiritual distress and resources. It focuses on beliefs, attitudes, experiences and practices of various kinds (every day and extraordinary), as well as on (dis-)connectedness. It consists of 22 items covering three subscales: spiritual resources, spiritual distress, and spiritual coping (Peng-Keller et. al., 2020, submitted). We constructed five additional questions to find out more why patients want to include spiritual aspects in their treatment.</description>

        To investigate the objectives, 220 psychiatric patients suffering from an affective&#xD;
        disorder (ICD F3/F4) will be recruited consecutively. Because we assess a questionnaire&#xD;
        with 22 items for our primary objective, the number of 220 patients seems reasonable. The&#xD;
        project population consists of psychiatric patients at the outpatient and day-clinics of&#xD;
        the Center for Social Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and&#xD;
        Psychosomatics, University Hospital for Psychiatry of Zurich.&#xD;
