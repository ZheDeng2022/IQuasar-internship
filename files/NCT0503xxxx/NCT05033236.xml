  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) frequently exhibit&#xD;
      postoperative bleeding complications which are still a major cause for morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. One major contributing factor is the loss of platelets and impaired platelet&#xD;
      function. During cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) blood comes in close contact with foreign&#xD;
      surfaces which induces a series of reactions; especially the complement system as part of the&#xD;
      innate immunity is highly activated. Due to the strong crosslink between complement system,&#xD;
      platelet function and the plasmatic coagulation it is likely that complement activation&#xD;
      during CPB has an impact on the overall process of clot formation. Besides the activation of&#xD;
      the complement system there is growing evidence that the occurrence of mitochondrial DNA&#xD;
      (mtDNA) during CPB might be related to further platelet activation . Activated platelets may&#xD;
      enhance micro-thrombosis leading to organ failure and thereby contributing to postoperative&#xD;
      morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One major complication during and after CABG surgery is bleeding requiring transfusion and&#xD;
      even reoperation in about 2%- 8% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As bleeding complications increase patient morbidity and mortality, this study is designed to&#xD;
      investigate the possible mechanisms of platelet loss during CABG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that increased complement activation during CPB leads to platelet&#xD;
      activation and loss of platelets. Further the degree of complement activation and levels of&#xD;
      mtDNA might correlate with postoperative bleeding, transfusion requirements and clinical&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;

      2.1. Primary Study Objective The aim of the study is to examine the correlation between&#xD;
      complement activation (c5b-9) and platelet decline during elective coronary artery bypass&#xD;
      graft (CABG) on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2. Further Study Objectives A secondary aim of the study is to investigate the specific&#xD;
      pathway of complement activation, the mtDNA levels and the interaction with platelet&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore correlations between levels of complement factors [c5b-9, C1q (C1r/C1s), C3a, C5a,&#xD;
      MBL, Factor B, Factor D], mtDNA level [human NADH dehydrogenase 1 gene] and platelet function&#xD;
      [MPV/PTC ratio and FACS for platelet activation factor 4 (PFA)] will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further it will be explored whether the level of complement activation and levels of mtDNA&#xD;
      and the plasmatic coagulation system correlate with transfusion requirements, postoperative&#xD;
      morbidity (need for revision surgery, cardiovascular events including thromboembolic events,&#xD;
      sepsis, single or multiple organ failure according to SOFA Score), and in hospital mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be also a correlation conducted between levels of complement [see above] and&#xD;
      concentration of coagulation factors [F I - F XIII, FXa, FXIIa, Kallikrein, Bradykinin,&#xD;
      endogenous thrombin potential (ETP)], transfusion requirements, mtDNA and platelet function&#xD;
      to postoperative morbidity (need for revision surgery, cardiovascular events including&#xD;
      thromboembolic events, sepsis, single or multiple organ failure according to SOFA Score) and&#xD;
      in hospital mortality.&#xD;
