  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the United States (US) is estimated at more than&#xD;
      30 million people, with an estimated 88 million more adults meeting the criteria for having&#xD;
      prediabetes and being at risk for progressing to type 2 diabetes. The significant burden of&#xD;
      diabetes, as well as the high individual and societal cost it bears, renders this disease&#xD;
      among the highest public health priorities for the health authorities and policy makers. In&#xD;
      response to the rising diabetes prevalence, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#xD;
      (CDC) established the National Diabetes Prevention Program (National DPP) in 2010 as a&#xD;
      framework for diabetes prevention by providing evidence-based, affordable, and high-quality&#xD;
      lifestyle change programs (LCPs). The National DPP LCP is a yearlong education-based&#xD;
      curriculum focused on achieving modest weight loss (5% to 7%) and increasing participants'&#xD;
      physical activity to reduce the risk of progressing to type 2 diabetes. To ensure&#xD;
      high-quality programs and meaningful impact on participants, the CDC sets standards for&#xD;
      organizations that wish to offer an LCP through the Diabetes Prevention Recognition Program&#xD;
      (DPRP). The DPRP plays a critical role in ensuring that organizations can effectively deliver&#xD;
      the evidence-based lifestyle change program with quality and fidelity. To achieve recognition&#xD;
      status, organizations must periodically provide evidence that they are following a&#xD;
      CDC-approved curriculum and achieving meaningful results on session attendance, body weight&#xD;
      change, and physical activity minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent analysis of National DPP data has shown that the attrition rates in this program are&#xD;
      substantial and that they differ by age and race. Moreover, the attrition rates were&#xD;
      inversely associated with the program success, as reflected by the LCP outcomes, and,&#xD;
      specifically, participants' weight and level of physical activity. In view of these findings,&#xD;
      the CDC is undertaking an effort to increase participant retention in the National DPP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will evaluate the pilot use of a free-of-charge mobile device-based&#xD;
      serious health game (WellQuest™) within the frame of the National DPP LCP. WellQuest™ was&#xD;
      designed with the goals to improve participant engagement and retention in the LCP, to&#xD;
      encourage adoption and maintenance of healthy lifestyle habits among LCP participants, and to&#xD;
      reinforce knowledge of the LCP curriculum.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study will be a 2-arm parallel group cluster randomized, prospective, observational study in a real-world setting of organizations delivering the National DPP LCP. Cohorts will be randomized 1:1 to experimental or control arms. Participants in the experimental arm will download WellQuest™ and be instructed on use of the game. Participants in the control arm will proceed with routine National DPP participation. The study will focus on session attendance during the first 6 months of the 12-month program. Data will be received from 2 main sources. A secondary data analysis will be conducted on individual-level data collected by each participating organization (eg, demographics, sessions attended, body weight, minutes of physical activity). For the experimental arm only, individual-level data collected via the game use will include game downloads and daily time spent playing the game. Data on satisfaction will be collected via surveys disseminated through the game.</intervention_model_description>
