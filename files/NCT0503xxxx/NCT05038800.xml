  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics, and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of MK-0482. There are 2 parts of this&#xD;
      study. Part 1 is a dose escalation which will follow an accelerated titration design (ATD).&#xD;
      Part 2 is a dose expansion in the same relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML subtypes as in Part 1.&#xD;
