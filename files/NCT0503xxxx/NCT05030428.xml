    <textblock>
      Study CKJX839B12302 is a pivotal Phase III trial to evaluate the benefits of inclisiran on&#xD;
      major adverse cardiovascular (MACE) events in participants with established cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (CVD).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that treatment with inclisiran sodium 300 mg&#xD;
      s.c. administered on Day 1, Month 3 (Day 90), and every 6 months thereafter taken in addition&#xD;
      to well-tolerated high-intensity statin therapy in participants with established ASCVD will&#xD;
      significantly reduce the risk of 3-Point-Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (3P-MACE)&#xD;
      defined as a composite of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and non-fatal&#xD;
      ischemic stroke. This will be compared to placebo in adjunct to well-tolerated high-intensity&#xD;
      statin therapy.&#xD;
