  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to quantify the improvement of post- stroke individuals' ability&#xD;
      to move their arms during and after robot assisted therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While researchers know that robot assisted therapies improve motor performance over the&#xD;
      course of weeks, they do not know how motor performance is affected over the course of&#xD;
      minutes or hours. A better understanding of how robot assisted therapies affect motor&#xD;
      performance on short time scales may help us to prescribe more effective therapy doses to&#xD;
      maximize motor recovery after neurological injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will allow us to obtain a detailed understanding of the performance of the device&#xD;
      as described above.&#xD;

    <measure>Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) Action Research Arm Test (ARAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in ARAT score from baseline (without the device) assessed after approximately 60 minutes of use with the device.</time_frame>
    <description>The ARAT is a 19 item measure divided into 4 subscales (grasp, grip, pinch and gross movement) and arranged in order of decreasing difficulty, with the most difficult task examined first, followed by the least difficult task. Task performance is rated on a 4-point scale, ranging from 0 (no movement) to 3 (movement performed normally). ARAT measures activities of daily living, coordination, dexterity, upper extremity function.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reachable Workspace</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in from baseline (without the device) of Range of Motion assessed after approximately 60 minutes of use with the device.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be instructed to individually flex and extend the elbow and shoulder to trace the largest possible circle that they can reach while keeping the hand and elbow raised to the height of the shoulder while the motion of the arm is tracked with motion capture. This protocol was originally developed by Sukal et al (2007); to asses post-stroke motor abilities. A larger workspace area indicates fewer upper extremity motor impairments.</description>

    <intervention_name>Compliant Passive Arm Support</intervention_name>
    <description>The device is a mechanical device that consists of two linkages, elastic bands, a commercial posture brace, and a hook-and-loop fastener. The design of the device, with several compliant elements, ensures that one device fits many without joint alignment concerns. No motors or other actuators add energy into the system, meaning that it is stable.</description>
