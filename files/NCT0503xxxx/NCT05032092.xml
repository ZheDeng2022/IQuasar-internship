  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate the efficacy of comprehensive genomic tumour profiling (CGP) from liquid&#xD;
           and/or tissue biopsy in patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate and describe the impact of treatment decisions based on CGP on individual&#xD;
           progression free survival in patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate and describe similarities and differences between the treatment suggestions&#xD;
           based on CGP/IHC (immuno-histochemistry) of tissue biopsy and liquid biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic carcinoma the primary efficacy objective&#xD;
      of the study is, to observe and describe the PFS (progression-free survival) of the matched&#xD;
      treatment compared to the PFS of the most recent therapy.&#xD;

      The SOUND study will be exploring the treatment rates and outcomes of CGP-driven targeted&#xD;
      treatment in patients with advanced or metastasized cancer. It will use a substantially&#xD;
      larger gene-panel than previous studies in Austria. Departing from the routine clinical&#xD;
      practice, study patients will have the opportunity to have CGP from liquid and/or tissue&#xD;
      biopsy. The treatment decision will be discussed within a molecular tumour board consisting&#xD;
      of experts in clinical oncology, human genetics and pathology. The treatment decision process&#xD;
      will be supported and documented by a software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the SOUND study will cover the whole analysis process, the reasons for the&#xD;
      treatment decision, reasons for getting or not-getting a matched treatment as well as the&#xD;
      outcome, treatment and hospitalisation costs. The SOUND study will give valuable insights&#xD;
      into the clinical practice of CGP-driven therapy in Austria and describe the experience and&#xD;
      the possible restrictions. Considering the differing conditions in Austria, the SOUND study&#xD;
      will generate data that might be useful for best practice sharing with other countries in the&#xD;
      future.&#xD;
