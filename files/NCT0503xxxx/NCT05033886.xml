  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for women in menopause who have moderate to severe hot flashes. It is for women&#xD;
      who are unable to use hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Menopause, a normal part of life, is&#xD;
      the time after a woman's last period. Hot flashes often occur during menopause. They can&#xD;
      disrupt a woman's daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study medicines (also called investigational products, or IP) are tablets of fezolinetant&#xD;
      or placebo. An investigational product means that the product is not yet licensed. In this&#xD;
      study, a placebo is a dummy treatment that looks like fezolinetant but does not have any&#xD;
      medicine in it. The study will compare fezolinetant with the placebo to learn if fezolinetant&#xD;
      reduces the number and severity of hot flashes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women that want to take part in the study will be given an electronic handheld device with an&#xD;
      app to track their hot flashes. Some women may be able to use the app on their own&#xD;
      smartphone. In the last 10 days before their next clinic visit, the women will record&#xD;
      information about their hot flashes. They can take part in the study if they have an average&#xD;
      of 7 or more moderate to severe hot flashes each day. Women will be picked for 1 of 2&#xD;
      treatments (fezolinetant or placebo) by chance alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who take part in the study will take 2 tablets every day for 24 weeks. Treatment will&#xD;
      be double-blinded. That means that the women in the study and the study doctors will not know&#xD;
      who takes which of the study medicines (fezolinetant or placebo). The women will continue&#xD;
      recording information about their hot flashes on the electronic device or their phone. They&#xD;
      will also use another device to answer questions about how hot flashes affect their daily&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, the women will visit their study clinic several times for a check-up. This&#xD;
      will happen during Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 27. Some women may be able to have home&#xD;
      visits instead, from Week 2 to Week 20. At the check-up, they will be asked if they have any&#xD;
      medical problems. Other checks will include vital signs (heart rate, temperature and blood&#xD;
      pressure) and some blood samples taken for laboratory tests. At some check-ups, the women&#xD;
      will have a physical exam. In Week 2 and Week 24, the women will have an ECG to check their&#xD;
      heart rhythm. Women who have a uterus will also have a test called a transvaginal ultrasound.&#xD;
      A probe is gently placed inside the vagina. Sound waves will create a picture of the organs&#xD;
      in the pelvis. This will allow the study doctor to look more closely at the uterus and&#xD;
      surrounding organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last check-up (at Week 27) will be 3 weeks after they take their last tablets of study&#xD;
      medicine (fezolinetant or placebo).&#xD;

    <description>The Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) is a National Institutes of Health Roadmap initiative designed to improve participant-reported outcome (PRO) measures using state-of-the-science methods. The PROMIS SD SF 8b assesses self-reported sleep disturbance over the past 7 days and includes perceptions of restless sleep; satisfaction with sleep; refreshing sleep; difficulties sleeping, getting to sleep or staying asleep; amount of sleep; and sleep quality. Because it assesses the participant's experience of sleep disturbance, the measure does not focus on specific sleep-disorder symptoms or ask patients to report objective measures of sleep (e.g., total amount of sleep, time to fall asleep and amount of wakefulness during sleep). Responses to each of the 8 items range from 1 to 5, and the range of possible summed raw scores is 8 to 40. Higher scores on the PROMIS SD SF 8b indicate more of the concept measured (disturbed sleep).</description>

    <description>Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA). An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study Investigational Product (IP), whether or not considered related to the study IP. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of study IP. This includes events related to the comparator and events related to the (study) procedures. A TEAE is defined as AE observed after starting administration of the study drug and 21 days after the last dose of study drug.</description>
