  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food allergy is a potentially life-threatening condition, and its prevalence continues to&#xD;
      increase despite public health efforts. There are currently no known therapies that can&#xD;
      reliably prevent food-induced anaphylaxis. This is an open-label study designed to determine&#xD;
      the ability acalabrutinib to prevent signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis during an oral food&#xD;
      challenge in food-allergic adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 15 million people (including 8% of children) in the US have a food allergy and&#xD;
      are at risk for life-threatening systemic reactions to foods. There is an unmet need for&#xD;
      treatments capable of preventing such reactions. This is a phase II, single-center, open&#xD;
      label trial involving the use of acalabrutinib (brand name CalquenceÂ®) to prevent&#xD;
      food-induced anaphylaxis in adults with food allergy. Acalabrutinib is FDA-approved to treat&#xD;
      certain medical conditions, but it is not approved to treat allergies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult participants with a physician-diagnosed food allergy to peanut and/or tree nuts will be&#xD;
      enrolled. These participants will undergo an oral food challenge to peanut or a tree nut&#xD;
      under close physician supervision to determine participants' baseline reactivity. After a&#xD;
      rest period, the participants will take 4 oral doses of acalabrutinib 100 mg, and then repeat&#xD;
      the oral food challenge to see if acalabrutinib will reduce participants' reactivity to&#xD;
      peanut or tree nuts.&#xD;
