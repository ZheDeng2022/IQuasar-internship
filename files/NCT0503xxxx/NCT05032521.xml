  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of a patient with shock is based on improving tissue oxygenation through&#xD;
      hemodynamic optimization. Lactate is a marker of tissue hypoperfusion commonly used in the&#xD;
      ICU. In principle, hyperlactatemia can be caused by either increased tissue production&#xD;
      (tissue hypoperfusion: type A), decreased lactate uptake (type B), or a combination of both&#xD;
      mechanisms. It is important to correctly determine the cause(s) of hyperlactatemia, as this&#xD;
      determines the treatment (expanders, inotrope, vasopressor, blood derivative transfusion),&#xD;
      and the patient's morbidity and mortality. A classic example of this concept is volume&#xD;
      expanders, which are frequently used to correct hyperlactatemia secondary to tissue&#xD;
      hypoperfusion, but are associated with mortality if used excessively (fluid overload). In&#xD;
      clinical practice, it is difficult to differentiate the exact causes of hyperlactatemia (type&#xD;
      A and type B). From work carried out over the last 20 years in septic shock and then in other&#xD;
      states of shock and in the operating theatre, it has been shown that the arteriovenous CO2&#xD;
      gradient (pCO2gap) measured from arterial and venous blood gases is a marker of tissue&#xD;
      hypoperfusion with better predictive ability than the usual markers (clinical examination,&#xD;
      SVO2....). Furthermore, when we relate pCO2gap to the arteriovenous O2 difference (pCO2gap&#xD;
      /C(a-v)O2), this ratio allows us to distinguish with greater accuracy between states of acute&#xD;
      circulatory failure associated with anaerobiosis (tissue hypoperfusion, type A) and those&#xD;
      related to the underlying disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, several studies have demonstrated a strong ability of the pCO2gap and the pCO2gap/CavO2&#xD;
      ratio to predict the severity of shock, mortality of the shock patient, hyperlactatemia, and&#xD;
      correction of hyperlactatemia with hemodynamic treatment. As a result, many authors have&#xD;
      proposed algorithms for the management of shock patients based on the measurement of these&#xD;
      CO2-derived indexes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that the use of an algorithm based on CO2gap and the&#xD;
      CO2gap/CavO2 ratio is superior in terms of correction of hyperlactatemia to usual practice&#xD;
      based on clinical and macro-hemodynamics.&#xD;
