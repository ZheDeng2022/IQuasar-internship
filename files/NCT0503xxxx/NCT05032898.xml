      Objective: The aim of this study is to provide high quality data and give a comprehensive&#xD;
      overview of characteristics, clinical features, management and prognosis during exacerbations&#xD;
      and stable periods among inpatients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease in real-world China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Criteria: Details are shown in the Eligibility Criteria part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures and Measurements: At admission, each eligible subject will be given an in-depth&#xD;
      interview to collect the demographics, smoking history, medical history, management of&#xD;
      disease during stable period, etc. During hospitalization, treatment and auxiliary&#xD;
      examination results including laboratory and lung function tests will be recorded if&#xD;
      available. To ensure the quality and uniformity of spirometry data, training on performing&#xD;
      spirometry will be provided to each study site by professional doctors from central site. At&#xD;
      discharge, physicians will record the discharge diagnoses and clinical outcomes including&#xD;
      death, intensive care unit admission, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease assessment test&#xD;
      (CAT) score and total direct cost for each participant. During follow-ups, clinical outcomes&#xD;
      including death and exacerbation events, change of medication, new-developed complications,&#xD;
      auxiliary examination results, and economic burden will be collected.&#xD;
