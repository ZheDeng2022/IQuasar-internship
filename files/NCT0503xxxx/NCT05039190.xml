  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, seamless and group&#xD;
      sequential phase 2/3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HBM9161 (HL161)&#xD;
      subcutaneous injection in patients with generalized myasthenia gravis Phase 3 study design: A&#xD;
      total of 120 subjects with positive AChR-Ab or MuSK-Ab and up to 24 subjects with negative&#xD;
      AChR-Ab and MuSK-Ab are planned for this phase (The randomization will end after&#xD;
      approximately 120 subjects with positive serum AchR-Ab or MUSK-Ab are enrolled) and&#xD;
      randomized into 2 treatment regimens in a 1:1 ratio. Arm 1 will receive HBM9161 680 mg; Arm 2&#xD;
      will receive placebo. Whether or not AChR-Ab or MuSK-Ab is positive, and whether or not&#xD;
      concomitant steroids are used will be randomization stratification factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, eligible subjects will be screened into the double-blind treatment phase and blindly&#xD;
      assigned to receive either HBM9161 680 mg or placebo for the first treatment period,&#xD;
      administered once weekly (QW) for 6 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who complete the first treatment period will start the administration of the second&#xD;
      treatment period if they meet the dosing criteria for the second treatment period at Week 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second treatment period will be administered once weekly (QW) for a total of 6 doses in&#xD;
      the first treatment period, followed by an observation period (4 weeks) and a follow-up&#xD;
      period. Subjects will be dosed for up to two treatment cycles during the study.&#xD;
