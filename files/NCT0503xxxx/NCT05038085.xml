    <textblock>
      In terms of postpartum care and depression, follow-up and controls should be continued online&#xD;
      in order not to interrupt the follow-up and treatment of women. In this context, in order to&#xD;
      prevent the development of postpartum depression and to increase maternal attachment, it is&#xD;
      planned to deliver the progressive muscle relaxation exercise and individual health education&#xD;
      program that we planned in our study through online applications. This study will be&#xD;
      conducted to evaluate the effect of online health education and progressive muscle relaxation&#xD;
      exercise program on postpartum depression and maternal attachment.The study was planned as a&#xD;
      parallel randomized controlled experimental study conducted in a Family Health Center in&#xD;
      Ankara, with a single-center, stratified block randomization (parity: primiparous,&#xD;
      multiparous; EPDS score: 0-9, 10-30).The number of pregnant women to be included in the study&#xD;
      was calculated as 56.Personal Information Form, Prenatal Attachment Scale, Edinburgh&#xD;
      Postpartum Depression Scale and Postpartum Attachment Scale will be used to collect data.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sample Power analysis was performed to determine the number of samples. For this, the&#xD;
      information in a similar study (Aydın Özkan et al., 2020) was used as a reference. The&#xD;
      minimum number of participants required to be included in each group was determined as 24,&#xD;
      with a total of 48 (α=0.01, 1-β=0.95). However, considering the loss rate (18.75%) in Aydın&#xD;
      Özkan's study, which was taken as a reference, the total number of participants was&#xD;
      determined as 56 (experimental: 28, control: 28).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization In order to prevent imbalance between the groups, pregnant women will be&#xD;
      assigned to the experimental and control groups by the tanned block randomization method.&#xD;
      Pregnant women will be stratified according to parity (primiparous-multiparous) and Edinburgh&#xD;
      Postpartum Depression Scale score (0-9 points, 10-30 points). In this context, 8 groups will&#xD;
      be formed as shown below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Set 1: Primiparous and pregnant women with EPDS scores between 0 and 9 Set 2: Primiparous and&#xD;
      pregnant women with a EPDS score of 10-30 Set 3: Multiparous and pregnant women with EPDS&#xD;
      score between 0 and 9 Set 4: Multiparous and pregnant women with a EPDS score of 10-30 Data&#xD;
      Collection Personal Information Form, Prenatal Attachment Scale, Edinburgh Postpartum&#xD;
      Depression Scale and Postpartum Attachment Scale will be used to collect data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose and content of the study will be explained by interviewing 35-week-old pregnant&#xD;
      women who applied to FHCs for pregnancy follow-up. Their compliance with the sampling&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be evaluated. Then, an informed consent form will be signed by the&#xD;
      pregnant women who agree to take part in the study. Personal information form, Prenatal&#xD;
      Attachment Scale and Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale will be administered to pregnant&#xD;
      women participating in the research. Then, the pregnant women will be randomized by&#xD;
      stratified blocking according to their parity and EPDS score averages, and the assignment of&#xD;
      the experimental and control groups will be made. Contact information (Phone numbers and&#xD;
      e-mail addresses) will be taken at the first encounter.Experimental Group Application 36-37&#xD;
      with pregnant women in the experimental group. There will be a total of two online&#xD;
      interviews, once a week, starting from the first week. Before the first interview, women will&#xD;
      be sent a PKGE video explained by the researcher via e-mail or Whatsapp application, and they&#xD;
      will be asked to watch it before the interview. In the first meeting, basic information about&#xD;
      postpartum depression and what to do to prevent postpartum depression will be explained. The&#xD;
      women will then be asked to describe the PKGE. The interview will be terminated when it is&#xD;
      confirmed that the women have understood correctly and fully. Afterwards, &quot;Relaxation&#xD;
      Exercises CD Audio Recordings&quot; belonging to the Turkish Psychological Association will be&#xD;
      sent to the women, and they will be asked to do PCGE at least 3 days a week until delivery,&#xD;
      accompanied by the instructions on the CD. In the second meeting; If postpartum depression&#xD;
      develops, what should be done and maternal attachment will be explained, and women's opinions&#xD;
      and questions about PCGE will be taken. In this interview, women will be asked to continue&#xD;
      PCGE at least 3 days a week from the day they feel ready, starting at the latest 1 week after&#xD;
      delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the application process to women, &quot;Don't forget to do your relaxation exercise&quot; every&#xD;
      other day, &quot;Weekdays to talk to your nurse about the training issues you have received.&#xD;
      Weekend …. You can call or send a message about the issues you want to consult between the&#xD;
      hours of the day. message will be sent. If the woman wants to have an interview, she will be&#xD;
      called at the specified times and interviewed and the participant's questions will be&#xD;
      answered. If it is noticed that an issue that needs help from different disciplines or that a&#xD;
      postpartum complication develops, he will be referred to the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale and the Postpartum Attachment Scale will be&#xD;
      administered at the sixth week postpartum. The scales will be converted into an online&#xD;
      questionnaire and mothers will be asked to fill in by sending their contact address.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group application Prenatal Attachment Scale and Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale&#xD;
      will be administered to women at 35 weeks of pregnancy, Postpartum Attachment Scale and&#xD;
      Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale will be administered to women at 6 weeks postpartum.&#xD;
      The scales will be converted into an online questionnaire and women will be asked to fill in&#xD;
      by sending their transportation address. No intervention will be applied to the women in the&#xD;
      control group during the study.&#xD;
