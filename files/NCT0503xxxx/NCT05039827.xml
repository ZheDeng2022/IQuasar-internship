  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lateral epicondylitis or tennis elbow is one of the most common lesions of the arm. This&#xD;
      injury is a major challenge, as it is difficult to treat, prone to recurrence and may last&#xD;
      for several weeks or months, with an average duration of a typical episode which has been&#xD;
      reported to be between six months to two years. This is an RCT study. Subjects who fulfilled&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be taken for the study. Before conducting the actual method for&#xD;
      subjects, lateral epicondylitis evaluation is done. First day before treatment, pain&#xD;
      evaluation were done by using Numeric Pain Rating Scale. Muscle power was assessed by MMT&#xD;
      (Manual Muscle Testing) and the function level are tested by Patient-Related Tennis Elbow&#xD;
      Evaluation (PRTEE) questionnaire and asked to mark the results. Subjects will be divided into&#xD;
      2 groups randomly by lottery method. Each group consists of 15 patients. Group A will be&#xD;
      given MWM; Group B will be given soft tissue mobilization. Both groups will be given with the&#xD;
      above said methods for alternative days in a week as per 3 sessions per week for 4 weeks. At&#xD;
      the end of program subjects will be reassessed by recording muscle strength, pain intensity&#xD;
      and functional level. Finally pre and post recordings will be compared and analyzed&#xD;
      statistically.&#xD;

    <description>The Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) (an outcome measure) that is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity in adults.The 11-point numeric scale ranges from '0' representing one pain extreme (e.g. &quot;no pain&quot;) to '10' representing the other pain extreme (e.g. &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot; or &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;)</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Grip Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>4 week</time_frame>
    <description>Manual muscle testing as used to test grip strength. It involves testing key muscles from the upper and lower extremities against the examiner's resistance and grading the patient's strength on a 0 to 5 scale accordingly[1]:&#xD;
Flicker of movement Through full range actively with gravity counterbalanced Through full range actively against gravity Through full range actively against some resistance Through full range actively against strong resistance</description>

    <description>Patient Related Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) was used.The PrTEEQ is a 15-item questionnaire, it's designed to measure forearm pain and disability in patients with lateral epicondylitis. The patients have to rate their levels of tennis elbow pain and disability from 0 to 10, and consists of 2 subscales. There is the pain subscale (0 = no pain, 10 = worst imaginable) en the function subscale (0 = no difficulty, 10 = unable to do)</description>
