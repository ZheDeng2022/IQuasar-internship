  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to investigate the effects of long-term fasting on size, mass,&#xD;
      composition and function of metabolic active tissues in several organs that reexpand possibly&#xD;
      rejuvenated after 1-4 months. Additionally, the lipid metabolism is investigated in depth.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fasting displays numerous positive effects on metabolism, health and aging. Surprisingly, few&#xD;
      considerations are given to long-term fasting periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The metabolic switch from food-derived glucose to adipose tissue-derived fatty acids and&#xD;
      ketones as primary cellular fuel is the key to fasting metabolism. Fasting has been shown to&#xD;
      improve cardiovascular risk factors and gut microbiota in humans. It provokes profound&#xD;
      changes in lipid metabolism. However, many questions are still open concerning the&#xD;
      mobilization, exchange, and function of lipids during long-term fasting. Furthermore, recent&#xD;
      results show the ability of periodic restrictive nutritional strategies to trigger organ&#xD;
      regeneration. This promising regenerative power has not been investigated comprehensively in&#xD;
      humans. In addition, the knowledge about the role of human faecal microbiota in health and&#xD;
      disease is increasing. Only little is known about its composition and function during&#xD;
      fasting. We found indications that the gut microbiome could influence energy metabolism and&#xD;
      consequently could influence the dynamic of the metabolic switch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term fasting under medical supervision according to the Buchinger Wilhelmi fasting&#xD;
      program has been demonstrated to be safe and well-tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current project investigates the effects of a 9Â±3 days fasting period by a multi-systemic&#xD;
      approach focusing on lipid metabolism and the gut microbiome in 100 subjects. Additionally,&#xD;
      the body composition in combination with muscle performance will be analyzed in-depth in a&#xD;
      subgroup of 32 subjects.&#xD;
