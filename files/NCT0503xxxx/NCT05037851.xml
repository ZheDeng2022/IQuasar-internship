  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PC945 for the prevention of fungal&#xD;
      aspergillus infections in the lung in patients who have received a lung transplant.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 of the study comprises a 12 week Prophylaxis or Pre-emptive Therapy Phase. Part 2&#xD;
      comprises a 4-week Safety Follow-Up Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will screen single or double lung transplant recipients due to receive a&#xD;
      mold-active antifungal: either as de novo prophylaxis or as pre-emptive therapy (for subjects&#xD;
      with Aspergillus spp. colonization of the respiratory tract but no evidence of pulmonary&#xD;
      fungal disease). Only subjects who fulfill all the inclusion and none of the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of post-randomization pulmonary fungal disease or colonization will be&#xD;
      adjudicated in all subjects in a blinded fashion by an independent Data Review Committee&#xD;
      (DRC) using the 2010 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplant criteria [Husain S&#xD;
      et al., 2011]. Pulmonary fungal disease will be categorized by the DRC as bronchial&#xD;
      anastomotic infection, tracheobronchitis, fungal pneumonia, or colonization, and will be&#xD;
      further categorized as proven or probable.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The study will be an open-label study. For the purposes of the exploratory efficacy assessments, however, the Data Review Committee determining the presence of pulmonary fungal disease will be blinded as to treatment assignment. The Sponsor will limit knowledge of treatment assignment to as few sponsor personnel as possible to reduce bias.</masking_description>

&#xD;
          1. Subject is â‰¥18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has received either a single or double lung transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject or Legally Authorized Representative has provided written or electronic&#xD;
             informed consent in a manner approved by the applicable Institutional Review Board&#xD;
             (IRB) or Ethics Committee&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject is able to perform and willing to comply with the study visits, laboratory&#xD;
             assessments, and other study-related procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Females of child-bearing potential must be non-lactating, must have a negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test at screening, and must agree to be abstinent or to use contraception&#xD;
             until 30 days after the last dose of PC945 or of SoC anti-mold prophylaxis or&#xD;
             pre-emptive therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        6a. Cohort 1 (de novo prophylaxis immediately post transplant): subject must be ready to be&#xD;
        randomized and start anti-mold prophylaxis within 48 hours of returning to the intensive&#xD;
        care unit (ICU) after the transplant surgery or&#xD;
&#xD;
        6b. In Cohort 2 (pre-emptive therapy): subject must meet all of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspergillus spp. colonization of the respiratory tract confirmed within 91 days (13&#xD;
             weeks) after a lung transplant. Colonization is defined according to the 2010 ISHLT&#xD;
             Consensus Statement definition criteria for colonization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Without evidence of pulmonary fungal disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be ready to start anti-mold medication within 72 hours after the positive&#xD;

             who receives a mold active antifungal agent within 24 hours before, during, or after&#xD;
             the transplant procedure will not be excluded if the mold active medication was&#xD;
             stopped within 48 hours of returning to the ICU after the transplant surgery, or prior&#xD;
             to randomization (whichever happens first)&#xD;

             opinion of the Investigator, may jeopardize adherence to the protocol requirements or&#xD;
