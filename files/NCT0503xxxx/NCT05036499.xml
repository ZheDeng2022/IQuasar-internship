  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a pressing public health need to develop novel interventions that aim to reduce&#xD;
      alcohol consumption and concurrent alcohol among hazardous drinkers with comorbid chronic&#xD;
      pain. The proposed study will draw upon NIH treatment development guidelines (Stage 1) to&#xD;
      translate and innovate past work to address a major public health priority. Specifically, we&#xD;
      propose to develop (Phase IA) and pilot test (Phase IB) a brief, integrated, single-session,&#xD;
      computer-based personalized feedback intervention (PFI) designed to 1) enhance knowledge&#xD;
      regarding adverse pain-related anxiety-alcohol interrelations; and (2) increase motivation&#xD;
      and intention to reduce hazardous drinking.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hazardous alcohol use contributes to mental and physical health problems, disability, and may&#xD;
      lead to increased risk of premature death. Among individuals with chronic pain the rate of&#xD;
      hazardous alcohol use is elevated compared to the general population, yet, hazardous alcohol&#xD;
      users with chronic pain remain an underserved group. There is a critical need to test&#xD;
      alternative and complimentary approaches to the implementation of effective interventions to&#xD;
      reduce hazardous alcohol use among this high-risk segment of the general population; doing so&#xD;
      in an integrated fashion (i.e., jointly targeting alcohol and affective mechanisms that may&#xD;
      maintain pain-alcohol associations) may provide a more efficient and targeted intervention&#xD;
      approach. Targeting pain-related anxiety, a transdiagnostic vulnerability factor that is&#xD;
      prospectively associated with both hazardous drinking and chronic pain, may be beneficial.&#xD;
      Thus, more work is needed to evaluate the benefit of targeting elevated pain-related anxiety&#xD;
      among hazardous drinkers with chronic pain. Our approach will follow a staged model&#xD;
      consistent with NIH guidelines for developing and standardizing behavioral interventions.&#xD;
      Phase IB activities will include a proof-of-concept and highly rigorous randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial designed to compare pain-related anxiety/alcohol PFI (PA-PFI) to assessment only among&#xD;
      a sample of 130 hazardous drinkers with chronic pain who have elevated levels of pain-related&#xD;
      anxiety. This study represents an important and pivotal step in the larger landscape of&#xD;
      translating basic research to more efficacious strategies for reducing hazardous drinking&#xD;
      among underserved populations with medical comorbidities. The proposed intervention would be&#xD;
      highly disseminable and relevant to millions of hazardous drinkers with chronic pain. Given&#xD;
      the collective public health impact of chronic pain and hazardous drinking, the proposed&#xD;
      study will yield findings that enhance scientific knowledge, enhance our understanding of&#xD;
      mechanisms in reciprocal pain-alcohol relations, and inform the development of novel&#xD;
      treatments for hazardous drinkers with chronic pain with elevated pain-related anxiety that&#xD;
      are adaptable and easily implemented across a variety of healthcare settings.&#xD;
