  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Review the data of patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) at the&#xD;
      Department of Cardiovascular Surgery in Ruijin hospital from March 2020 to March 2021,&#xD;
      including medical history, head and neck CTA, head CT scan, and early postoperative (within 7&#xD;
      days after surgery) neurological complications (defined as a composite of stroke, delayed&#xD;
      awakening and severe delirium) . Case-control and retrospective cohorts were built to explore&#xD;
      risk factors of early postoperative neurological complications, And its association with&#xD;
      baseline carotid-cerebral vascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Describe the epidemiological data of early postoperative neurological complications (stroke,&#xD;
      delayed awakening, and severe delirium) after CABG surgery (within 7 days after surgery);&#xD;
      explore independent risk factors of compound neurological complications, build predictive&#xD;
      models; compare the effects of carotid-cerebral artery disease on early postoperative&#xD;
      compound neurological complications.&#xD;
