  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Academic centre for Malignant Hyperthermia of Masaryk University (ACMHMU) was established&#xD;
      in 2021 in Brno, Czech Republic and consists of four academic departments of Medical Faculty&#xD;
      of Masaryk University in two tertiary university hospitals, University Hospital Brno and St.&#xD;
      Anne Faculty Hospital. These departments collaborated and operated since 2002 and since 2019&#xD;
      is Brno one of the of centre of EMHG (www.emhg.org).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We evaluated every referral to the MH centre since 2002 then. IVCT results, clinical data,&#xD;
      personal and family history and molecular genetic data, have been recorded in an electronic&#xD;
      medical record. Potential MHS patients, probands, were investigated according to the European&#xD;
      Malignant Hyperthermia Group (EMHG) recommendations using IVCT and/or RYR1 and CACNA1S&#xD;
      sequence variant screening. Each proband is a representative of one unrelated family. As the&#xD;
      diagnostic guidelines were changing in the time, so was our diagnostic algorithm with the&#xD;
      development of new knowledge and methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Originally before 2015, for each proband or the nearest relative in case that the index case&#xD;
      could not be tested, MH must be confirmed/excluded by IVCT. Only with a positive IVCT&#xD;
      positive result (MHS, MHEh, MHEc), genetic diagnosis was originated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iIn 2015, a new EMHG guideline for the diagnosis of MH was issued and significantly moved the&#xD;
      DNA diagnosis of MH to the forefront and we started to use genetic testing as a first&#xD;
      diagnostic step. Not finding the diagnostic variant does not exclude MH susceptibility and&#xD;
      IVCT needs to follow for final diagnosis. IVCT has been providing according to the best&#xD;
      practise and EMGH guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, the genetic diagnosis of MH in the Czech Republic has been in several stages -&#xD;
      starting with standard scoring of 33 most common causal diagnostic variants of the RYR1 gene&#xD;
      by using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) (SALSA MLPA probemix&#xD;
      P281-A3/P282-A3 RYR1, MRC Holand). In case of a negative result, direct sequence analysis of&#xD;
      the RYR1 and CACNA1S gene sections followed, where the remaining causal diagnostic variants&#xD;
      occur. Since 2021 MLPA and direct sequencing of hot spots regions of RYR1 and CACNA1S was&#xD;
      routinely replaced by next-generation sequencing (NGS) at the level of a panel of genes&#xD;
      associated with neuromuscular diseases (including RYR1, CACNA1S and STAC3).&#xD;
