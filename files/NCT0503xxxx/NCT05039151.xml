  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Septic shock is a common reason for admission to intensive care units and severe infections&#xD;
      are responsible for 6 million deaths a year worldwide. Fluid management appears to be a major&#xD;
      issue in resuscitation and particularly in septic shock, where generalised oedema is almost&#xD;
      systematic and is a major factor in poor prognosis during sepsis. The formation of oedema&#xD;
      corresponds to an imbalance, according to Frank-Starling's law of the heart, between the&#xD;
      vascular compartment and the interstitial compartment, which is composed of the interstitial&#xD;
      liquid and an extracellular matrix. This extracellular matrix consists essentially of a&#xD;
      network of collagen and fibroblast fibres. Even though all of the plasma in the body transits&#xD;
      through the interstitium in 24 hours and desite its major importance in the microenvironment&#xD;
      and intercellular communication, the interstitial compartment has not been fully described.&#xD;
      In oncology, interstitial tissue seems to contribute to tumour growth through changes in&#xD;
      matrix composition and pressure in the interstitium. This pressure actively contributes to&#xD;
      the regulation of transcapillary filtration, and thus to the oedema and hypovolemia observed&#xD;
      during sepsis. In usual conditions, the fibroblasts exert a tension on the collagen fibres of&#xD;
      the matrix via integrin Beta-1 (ITGB1). This tension is released under the action of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory mediators, resulting in negative pressure which potentiates the formation of&#xD;
      oedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown in an endotoxemia model that there is a thousandfold higher concentration&#xD;
      of ITGB1 in the interstitium compared to the vascular compartment, suggesting a local&#xD;
      secretion of this cytokine. The alteration of the extracellular matrix could also play a role&#xD;
      in the perpetuation of oedema during septic shock. Considered as an organ in its own right,&#xD;
      interstitial tissue is far from playing a passive role between the vascular compartment and&#xD;
      the cells. The hypothesis is that interstitial fluid analysis could improve our understanding&#xD;
      of the physiopathology of sepsis, in particular on the alteration of the mechanisms of fluid&#xD;
      movement regulation, which remains very poorly understood while being closely associated with&#xD;
      prognosis in patients with sepsis.&#xD;
