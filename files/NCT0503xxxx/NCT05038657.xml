  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AURORA is a phase II open-label trial of Atezolizumab in patients with urinary tract squamous&#xD;
      cell carcinoma (UTSCC). UTSCC is the most common of the rare urinary tract cancer&#xD;
      histologies, comprising 2.1-6.7% of urinary tract cancers overall. There are few data&#xD;
      available to guide treatment decisions for UTSCC. The AURORA trial will test the hypothesis&#xD;
      that PD-L1 inhibition with atezolizumab immunotherapy is clinically effective, tolerable and&#xD;
      safe, in patients with urinary tract squamous cell carcinoma (UTSCC). Translational endpoints&#xD;
      will aim to determine characteristics for responsiveness to this treatment. AURORA was&#xD;
      developed on behalf of the International Rare Cancers Initiative (IRCI) and the National&#xD;
      Cancer Research Institute Bladder and Renal Group.&#xD;
