  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct a small-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 24 adult smokers&#xD;
      enrolled in the TTP. Participants will receive either the Free4Good mobile app for positive&#xD;
      psychology skills training or a breathing relaxation mobile app control (Breathe2Relax). All&#xD;
      participants will be receiving tobacco cessation treatment in the Tobacco Treatment Program&#xD;
      at MD Anderson as standard of care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this pilot protocol are to test the adherence, acceptability, user satisfaction,&#xD;
      and preliminary efficacy of a smartphone mobile health app, Free4Good, which incorporates&#xD;
      skills training in positive psychology vs. a relaxation app, Breathe2Relax (control&#xD;
      condition), in a small randomized controlled trial of smokers (N = 24). Adherence will be&#xD;
      measured directly through app usage data. Acceptability and user satisfaction will be&#xD;
      measured via specific items included on a User Satisfaction Questionnaire. Efficacy outcomes&#xD;
      include evidence of increased engagement in positive psychology-related quitting strategies&#xD;
      (measured by the Quitting Strategies Questionnaire) and smoking abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory analyses including covariates such as nicotine dependence, mood, and depressive&#xD;
      symptoms may be examined as appropriate, as these measures have been shown to predict&#xD;
      abstinence outcomes in a variety of studies.1-4 Changes in mood and/or depressive symptoms&#xD;
      may also be characterized&#xD;
