      To study the inflammatory response during and after radiotherapy, especially by measuring the&#xD;
      concentration of an enzyme called autotaxin and its product LPA in the blood plasma.&#xD;
      Autotaxin and LPA cause fibrosis in other situation, but they have not been tested in&#xD;
      radiation-induced fibrosis. We will determine if the duration and magnitude of the autotaxin&#xD;
      and LPA responses are prognostic for the 15-28% of patients who will develop fibrosis. This&#xD;
      fibrosis will be detected by ultrasound and a novel application of elastography, which should&#xD;
      provide much earlier and quantifiable fibrotic changes compared to conventional physical&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;

        We will study a low risk group of 44 post-menopausal patients with luminal A breast cancer&#xD;
        after they have received breast conserving surgery (lumpectomy). Women who have smoked or&#xD;
        received chemotherapy will be excluded to minimize variables.&#xD;
