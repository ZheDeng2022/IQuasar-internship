  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of CST-2032 when administered with pre-administered&#xD;
      CST-107 on safety, tolerability, cognition, cerebral perfusion, and cerebral metabolism in&#xD;
      patients with cognitive impairment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase1, randomized sequence of placebo, low-, mid- and high-dose CST-2032 in&#xD;
      Subjects with cognitive impairment. Sixteen (16) subjects with cognitive impairment will be&#xD;
      enrolled. The first subject enrolled will be dosed as a sentinel. If no significant safety&#xD;
      issues are noted in the sentinel subject, the remaining subjects will be dosed starting 24&#xD;
      hours after the Day 4 dose for the sentinel subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have the option to attend all study visits as outpatients or be admitted for a&#xD;
      4-5-night confinement period at the research facility. Subjects will receive matching placebo&#xD;
      for CTS-2032, 1mg, 3mg, and 9 mg CST-2032 two hours after a pre-administered dose of 3 mg&#xD;
      CST-107 in a randomized sequence on Days 1, 2, 3 and 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive assessments (CANTAB) and a verbal fluency test will be administered daily. If&#xD;
      operationally feasible, subjects will also undergo arterial spin labeling (ASL) magnetic&#xD;
      resonance (MRI) imaging of the brain on Days 1 and 4.&#xD;

    <description>Measures changes in visual and motor coordination and vigilance. In this task, a small circle (target) continuously moves across the screen in a semi-randomized fashion, so as to minimize the subject's ability to predict the trajectory of the target. The subject is instructed to use his/her finger on the touch screen to move a small dot so that it is consistently within the center of the moving target on the screen. During the test, the speed of the circle is adjusted in response to the subject's ability to keep the dot in the circle, ensuring that the test is adapted to the individual subject.</description>

Subjects are given 1 minute to say aloud as many words they can think of that begin with the letter F, avoiding repetitions or the same words with different endings. The total score is the number of correct words generated. Subjects are also given 1 minute to say aloud as many animals they can think of, avoiding repetitions.
