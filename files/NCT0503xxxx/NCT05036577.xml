    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, single center, open label pilot study of Orelabrutinib combined with&#xD;
      Rituximab, high-dose (HD) Methotrexate and Dexamethasone in newly-diagnosed primary central&#xD;
      nervous system lymphpoma (PCNSL). The purpose is to evaluate the safety and to find the&#xD;
      optimal dose of Orelabrutinib in this combination treatment for newly-diagnosed PCNSL&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      The eligible patients will be treated with Orelabrutinib combined with Rituximab, high-dose&#xD;
      Methotrexate and Dexamethasone during induction treatment (6 cycles; 21 days/cycle):&#xD;
      Rituximab 375 mg/m2, intravenous infusion, d1; HD-MTX 3.5 g/m2 intravenous infusion (3h), d2;&#xD;
      Dexamethasone 10-15 mg, iv, d2-4. Orelabrutinib will be given 72h after MTX infusion or until&#xD;
      MTX clearance. Orelabrutinib dose escalation will follow the &quot;3+3&quot; design. The starting dose&#xD;
      of Orelabrutinib is 150 mg/d and the dose will be escalated to 200 mg/d, throughout the whole&#xD;
      cycle. For CR/CRu patients after completion of induction treatment, daily Orelabrutinib will&#xD;
      be administered as maintenance treatment for up to 1 year or until disease progression,&#xD;
      intolerable toxicity, death, informed consent withdrawal or lost of follow up (whichever&#xD;
      occurs first). Patients will be evaluated every 2 cycles during induction therapy and every&#xD;
      12 weeks during maintenance therapy.&#xD;
