  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The working hypothesis is that hypertension during the first post-transplant trimester is&#xD;
      partly explained by the patient's hypervolemia. The main objective of the single-center&#xD;
      observational study &quot;HTA ô Connect&quot; is to study the relationship between hypertension and&#xD;
      extracellular hyperhydration, thanks to repeated self-measurements of blood pressure and&#xD;
      impedancemetry between the 30th and the 90th day post-transplant, in 150 incident kidney&#xD;
      transplant patients from our department, the ITUN (Institute of Urology-Nephrology&#xD;
      Transplantation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population involves 150 incident kidney transplant patients, presenting to the&#xD;
      Nantes University Hospital Transplant Institute for 1 month (D30), and presenting with&#xD;
      hypertension ≥ 140/90mmHg and not treated with a diuretic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected at the patients' homes will be used to establish a relationship between blood&#xD;
      pressure and extracellular water volume. The data collected will not be used to follow up&#xD;
      patients who participated in the study in this first stage of exploration.&#xD;

      Evaluation parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Blood pressure :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At inclusion and at the end of the study (in consultation at D30 and D90,&#xD;
                respectively), blood pressure will be measured 3 times after a few minutes of rest&#xD;
                in a sitting position Hypertension in consultation will be defined by values &gt;&#xD;
                140/90 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Between D30 and D90, blood pressure will be measured by self-measurement using&#xD;
                DM-certified devices, 3 times in the morning at breakfast and in the evening before&#xD;
                bedtime, in a sitting position after a few minutes of rest. The operation will be&#xD;
                repeated 3 days a week (Monday to Wednesday) between the 30th and the 90th day&#xD;
                post-transplant. Self-measurement hypertension will be defined by values &gt; 135/85&#xD;
                mmHg. Self-measurement blood pressure data will be directly transmitted to the&#xD;
                &quot;INTEGRALIS&quot; specialty medical record of transplant patients at the ITUN via the&#xD;
                epatient application (https://www.idbc.fr/e-patient/).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Weight :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Weight will be measured only once at the inclusion consultation (D30) and at the&#xD;
                end of the study (D90).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Between D30 and D90 the weight will be measured by self-measurement using DM&#xD;
                certified scales. The operation will be repeated once in the morning and once in&#xD;
                the evening at the time of blood pressure measurements, 3 days a week (Monday to&#xD;
                Wednesday) between the 30th and the 90th day after transplantation. The data from&#xD;
                the self-measurement of weight will be directly transmitted to the &quot;INTEGRALIS&quot;&#xD;
                medical record of the transplanted patients at the ITUN&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Impedance measurement :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At inclusion and at the end of the study in consultation, respectively at D 30 and&#xD;
                D90, impedancemetry will be measured once&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Between D30 and D90, impedancemetry measurements will be collected at the same time&#xD;
                as blood pressure measurements at the patients' homes by self-measurement 3 times&#xD;
                in the morning and 3 times in the evening, 3 days a week (from Monday to Wednesday)&#xD;
                between the 30th and the 90th day after transplantation. The impedancemetry will be&#xD;
                collected with the help of a bluetooth-connected BIODYLIFEZM self-measurement&#xD;
                device. The impedancemetry data collected via bluetooth will be directly&#xD;
                transmitted to the &quot;INTEGRALIS&quot; specialty medical record of the transplanted&#xD;
                patients at the ITUN.&#xD;
