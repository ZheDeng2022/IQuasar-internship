  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Managed Access Program (MAP) Cohort Treatment Plan is to provide guidance&#xD;
      to the Physician for the treatment and monitoring of patients in the Cohort MAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Physician should follow the suggested treatment guidelines. Furthermore, the Physician&#xD;
      must comply with the MAP Agreement Letter and applicable local laws and regulations.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior to inclusion of a patient in the Cohort, the requesting Physician must submit a request&#xD;
      for access to the product in GEMS (Grants, External Requests and Managed Access System)&#xD;
      accessible through&#xD;
      https://www.novartis.com/our-focus/healthcare-professionals/managed-access-programs providing&#xD;
      the rationale for the request and relevant medical history of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The request is then assessed against the MAP and Cohort inclusion/exclusion criteria by the&#xD;
      medical team experienced with the product and indication. Upon the required approvals, the&#xD;
      patient is included in the Cohort.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  If patient is receiving tamoxifen or toremifene, a washout period of 5 half-lives&#xD;
             prior to treatment initiation is required&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is postmenopausal. Postmenopausal status is defined either by:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior bilateral oophorectomy, Age ≥60, Age &lt;60 and amenorrhea for 12 or more months&#xD;
             (in the absence of chemotherapy, tamoxifen, toremifen, or ovarian suppression) and&#xD;

        postmenopausal range. (NCCN v4 2018) Note: For women with therapy-induced amenorrhea,&#xD;
        serial measurements of FSH and/or estradiol are needed to ensure postmenopausal status&#xD;
        (NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2017). Ovarian radiation or treatment with a luteinizing&#xD;

             estradiol and/or FSH are in the premenopausal ranges according to central/local&#xD;
             laboratory definition Patients who have undergone bilateral oophorectomy are not&#xD;
