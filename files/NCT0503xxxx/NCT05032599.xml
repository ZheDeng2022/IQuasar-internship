  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a FIH, single center, open label, non-randomized, single-arm, Phase I clinical trial&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CD5 CAR T cells in subjects with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. At least 18 subjects will be enrolled. After&#xD;
      the collection of PBMC and about 5 days before infusion, lymphodepletion (fludarabine at 30&#xD;
      mg/m^2/day and cyclophosphamide at 250 mg/m^2/day; for prior-SCT donor-derived CAR T-cell&#xD;
      infusion) or intensified lymphodepletion (fludarabine at 30 mg/m^2/day and cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      at 30 mg/kg/day; for new donor-derived CAR T-cell infusion) will be administrated for 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then this study will be using BOIN1/2 approach from starting dose 1: 1×10^6 (±30%) to dose 2:&#xD;
      2×10^6 (±30%). If the manufactured cells were not sufficient to meet the preassigned standard&#xD;
      dose criteria, patients are given infusion at a low dose of 5×10^5 (±30%) /kg.&#xD;

        following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Candidates with relapse or refractory CD5+ T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, who&#xD;
             have progressed on after treatment with all standard therapies or intolerant of&#xD;
             standard care, have limited prognosis with currently available therapies and had no&#xD;
             available curative treatment options (such as SCT or chemotherapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female, aged 1-70 years&#xD;
