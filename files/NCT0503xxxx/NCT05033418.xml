      Dual Treatment of Chronic Pain and Insomnia within an Interdisciplinary Pain Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Program&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to develop a dual treatment model for chronic pain and insomnia by&#xD;
      combining evidence-based approaches for each condition, addressing an important gap in the&#xD;
      research on and treatment of chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insomnia is frequently comorbid among patients with chronic pain. Estimates suggest that&#xD;
      50-80% of patients receiving treatment for chronic pain also report significant insomnia.&#xD;
      Patients with comorbid insomnia and chronic pain are at higher risk of negative outcomes&#xD;
      compared to individuals without insomnia. More specifically, studies have found that higher&#xD;
      levels of insomnia are associated with increased difficulty in reducing opioid use, higher&#xD;
      pain intensity, greater functional limitations, lower self-efficacy, higher pain&#xD;
      catastrophizing, and more depressive symptoms compared to patients with less severe insomnia.&#xD;
      Importantly, for patients with clinically significant insomnia symptoms, insomnia often does&#xD;
      not improve to a meaningful extent as a result of chronic pain treatment alone. Accordingly,&#xD;
      there is a significant need for dual treatment models that address both chronic pain and&#xD;
      insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) CBT-I is viewed as the &quot;gold standard&quot;&#xD;
      treatment for clinical insomnia. In this treatment model, insomnia is viewed as originating&#xD;
      from varying precipitating events (e.g., illness, life changes, pain symptoms), but&#xD;
      maintained through sleep-related behaviors that increase sleep-related arousal, fragment&#xD;
      sleep, and condition an association between bed/nighttime and wakefulness. Accordingly, CBT-I&#xD;
      uses conditioning principles to decrease pre-sleep arousal and recondition a pattern of&#xD;
      rapid, consolidated sleep. The key components of this intervention are sleep restriction&#xD;
      therapy (SRT), which limits time in bed initially to the duration of actual sleep per night,&#xD;
      and stimulus control (SC), which involves modification of factors that associate&#xD;
      bed/nighttime with wakefulness (e.g., time awake in bed, wakeful activities in bed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted to evaluate this treatment&#xD;
      among patients with insomnia and a variety of comorbid chronic pain conditions.8 When&#xD;
      compared to usual care or a waiting list control group, patients assigned to receive CBT-I&#xD;
      have reported significantly better improvements in insomnia symptoms. In addition, results&#xD;
      indicate that the effects of CBT-I delivered to patients with chronic pain have been&#xD;
      maintained or improved over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interdisciplinary Pain Rehabilitation and Outcomes for Chronic Pain and Insomnia&#xD;
      Interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation programs (IPRPs) are evidence-based treatments for&#xD;
      chronic pain. These programs emphasize functional restoration and typically involve physical&#xD;
      and occupational therapy, medical visits, and mental health visits. Although these programs&#xD;
      typically include sleep hygiene training, research indicates that while patients experience&#xD;
      significant gains in improving pain, functioning, and quality of life, IPRPs alone are&#xD;
      insufficient for improving clinical insomnia. Hybrid interventions for pain and insomnia have&#xD;
      demonstrated successful outcomes for treating sleep disturbance and chronic pain. However,&#xD;
      the incorporation of CBT-I into and IPRP has not been previously studied. This gap in&#xD;
      research has been previously documented and represents an important area for future study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Current Study The current study aims to assess the effectiveness of CBT-I within the&#xD;
      context of a 10-week outpatient IPRP and evaluate whether participation leads to superior&#xD;
      outcomes compared to pain rehabilitation alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Insomnia severity will be associated with pain-related outcomes among patients&#xD;
      presenting for chronic pain treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: CBT-I participation will be associated with significant improvement in insomnia&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Compared to a waitlist control group, patients who participate in CBT-I will&#xD;
      have superior treatment outcomes from a pain rehabilitation program.&#xD;
