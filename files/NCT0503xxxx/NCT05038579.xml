    <textblock>
      Dementia is a neurodegenerative syndrome that leads to cognitive deficits and, consequently,&#xD;
      affects functionality and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will explore the clinical impact of a customized cognitive stimulation program,&#xD;
      using Musiquence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dementia is a clinical syndrome characterized by a progressive and irreversible deterioration&#xD;
      of cognitive functioning that impairs behavioral and functional domains. Within&#xD;
      non-pharmacological approaches, Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) is the most studied and&#xD;
      well-established intervention for individuals with mild to moderate dementia. The underlying&#xD;
      assumptions behind cognitive-based interventions of CST are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. IwD can benefit from cognitive stimulation if mobilized relatively preserved cognitive&#xD;
           functions (e.g., crystallized abilities such as semantic memory and verbal skills), and;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Even in advanced age, exposure to enriched environments (i.e., socially and cognitively&#xD;
           challenging) can enhance cognitive reserve and neuroplasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning the first assumption of cognitive-based interventions (a1), it is known that even&#xD;
      in moderate to advanced stages of dementia, musical memory is one of the abilities that&#xD;
      remain intact. It is hypothesized that music processing abilities precede the development of&#xD;
      lexical language functions. This hypothesis is corroborated by findings that demonstrate that&#xD;
      IwD are still responsive to music even when unable to communicate verbally or recognize&#xD;
      words. Additionally, music is frequently associated with life experiences. Also, literature&#xD;
      has reported that memories associated with specific music would be recollected longer than&#xD;
      memories with no association to music; this suggests that using music as a reminiscence&#xD;
      element on cognitive stimulation programs can have a promising effect on cognition. According&#xD;
      to the second assumption of CST (a2), facilitating an enriching environment for IwD using,&#xD;
      for , music and reminiscence elements could impact cognitive reserve and neuroplasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, Ferreira et al. developed a platform - Musiquence - that incorporates music&#xD;
      and reminiscence in cognitive stimulation activities for IwD. Musiquence allows the&#xD;
      gamification and personalization of 6 types of activities:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reality Orientation - a quiz-like activity that includes date and time information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Creative Drawings - a puzzle-like game in which the participant draws the missing&#xD;
           pieces.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activities of Daily Living (ADL) - a puzzle-like game in which the participants have to&#xD;
           perform a set of chores (i.e., brush the teeth), and the missing pieces are completed&#xD;
           with real physical objects (i.e., toothpaste).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Search Objects activity - exploration game in which the participants must find hidden&#xD;
           images (e.g., cats) that are only visible through a virtual magnifying glass.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Knowledge Quiz - participants must select the correct answer to a question among&#xD;
           incorrect ones.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Association activity - participants must categorize the items according to the&#xD;
           instructions. For example, separate cars from motorcycles and locate them in the correct&#xD;
           container.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The platform is compatible with different technologies that allow adaptation to the patients'&#xD;
      needs (motor difficulties, vision problems, tremble). Cognitive stimulation content can be&#xD;
      personalized to the user since the caregivers can add text, images, and music when creating&#xD;
      the tasks.&#xD;
