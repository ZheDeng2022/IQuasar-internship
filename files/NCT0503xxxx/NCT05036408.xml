    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies the effect of an interdisciplinary program with strong patient&#xD;
      involvement on managing long-term chronic pain for cancer survivors. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to determine whether enrolling patients into an interdisciplinary program can&#xD;
      improve mobility with physical and occupational therapy and participation in online group&#xD;
      psychotherapy that teaches coping skills to enhance quality of life.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To test the feasibility of an interdisciplinary functional restoration program in cancer&#xD;
      survivors with chronic pain and restoring physical function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the preliminary effect of functional restoration program (FRP) in restoring&#xD;
      physical function and reducing pain which ultimately decreases opioid consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients participate in the cancer pain rehabilitation program for 6 weeks, including&#xD;
      educational sessions over 2 hours once weekly, group psychological interventions, group&#xD;
      physical therapy, and 1:1 physical and occupational therapy treatment per the patient's&#xD;
      treatment plan. Patients may also undergo osteopathic manual treatments per physical and&#xD;
      occupational therapy assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at 3 months.&#xD;

    <measure>Preliminary effect of the Functional Restoration Program in reducing pain (PSEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention, End of intervention (6 weeks), 3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ) score: the PSEQ is a 10-item questionnaire, developed to assess the confidence people with ongoing pain have in performing activities while in pain. Scores can range from 0 - 60 and is done by simple addition. High PSEQ scores are strongly associated with clinically-significant functional levels and provide a useful gauge for evaluating outcomes in chronic pain patients. Higher scores (and a higher percentile) represent lower confidence to function with pain.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Impaired control&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The individual may express overall desire to cut down or regulate substance use&#xD;
                  and may report multiple unsuccessful efforts to decrease or discontinue use&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The individual may spend a great deal of time obtaining the substance, using the&#xD;
                  substance, or recovering from its affects&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The individual's daily activities revolve around the substance in some instances&#xD;
                  of more severe substance use disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Craving is manifested by intense desire or urge for the drug that may occur at&#xD;
                  any time&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Social impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Recurrent substance use may result in failure to fulfill major role obligations&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  The individual may continue substance use despite having persistent or recurrent&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pharmacologic criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Tolerance is signaled by requiring a markedly increased dose of substance to&#xD;

                  consumed&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Withdrawal is a syndrome that occurs when blood or tissue concentrations of a&#xD;
                  substance decline in an individual who had maintained a prolonged heavy use of&#xD;

                       treatment with prescribed medications are specifically not counted. However,&#xD;
                       prescription medications can be used inappropriately based on criteria above&#xD;
                       and substance use disorder can be correctly diagnosed when there are other&#xD;
                       symptoms of compulsive and drug seeking behavior&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Substance use disorders occur in a broad range of severity from mild to severe with&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  For our research purposes, our exclusion criteria included any individual who met&#xD;
             criteria for mild, moderate, and severe substance use disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those with severe cognitive or psychiatric impairments that preclude participation in&#xD;
             group sessions will be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should not have any uncontrolled illness of any kind including ongoing or&#xD;
             active infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects, who are not be able to comply with the safety monitoring requirements of the&#xD;
             study. Those who miss more than half the sessions will be considered to not have&#xD;
