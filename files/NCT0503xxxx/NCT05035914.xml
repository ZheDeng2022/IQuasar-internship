      1. Determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) and / or phase II recommended dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
           the allotinib combined mXELIRI protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the safety and tolerance of the combination of anlotinib and mXELIRI in the&#xD;
           second-line treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of two phases, the dose-escalation phase, and the expansion phase. 9-12&#xD;
      patients with advanced colorectal cancer will be included in the dose escalation study.&#xD;
      Patients who met the inclusion criteria would be treated with anlotinib QD for 2 weeks, and&#xD;
      then stopped for 1 week, combined with mXELIRI. Every 21 days was a treatment cycle. Safety&#xD;
      information was collected until the disease progression or intolerable toxicity, so as to&#xD;
      determine the MTD and / or RP2D of anlotinib combined with irinotecan in patients with&#xD;
      advanced colorectal cancer. The study adopted the traditional 3+3 design .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome in dose-expansion phase was objective response rate(ORR).&#xD;
