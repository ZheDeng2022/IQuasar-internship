  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to adapt and evaluate the feasibility of the BeatIt behavioral&#xD;
      activation intervention for people with intellectual disabilities and low mood to be&#xD;
      implemented with autistic individuals, with and without intellectual disabilities.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has two specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adapt BeatIt materials for use with autistic adults with and without Intellectual&#xD;
           Disability (ID). Focus groups engaging key stakeholders will inform the adaptation of&#xD;
           BeatIt for autistic adults (i.e., BeatIt-ASD). A stakeholder advisory team will provide&#xD;
           input through the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of BeatIt-ASD for&#xD;
           autistic adults. This includes examining if the data demonstrate the feasibility and&#xD;
           acceptability of the BeatIt-ASD program for autistic adults and provide preliminary&#xD;
           evidence for behavioral change (i.e., increased engagement in meaningful activities and&#xD;
           reduced depressive symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted BeatIt intervention&#xD;
      for autistic adults and provide preliminary evidence for reduction of depression symptoms via&#xD;
      regulation of routines and achievement of meaningful goals.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Week 1 (initial assessment) to week 16 (outcome) to week 22 (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The GDS is a 20-item self- and caregiver-reported questionnaire of psychological function over the past week with all items on a &quot;0&quot; (Never/No) to 2 (Always/A lot) scale.

    <time_frame>Week 1 (initial assessment) to week 16 (outcome) to week 22 (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The ABCL is a caregiver-report measure of adaptive functioning and psychopathology (e.g., anxiety, depression symptoms). Most of the items are on a 3 point scale including: (0) Not true, (1) Somewhat or sometimes true, and (2) Very often or often true. Higher scores equal more symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 1 (initial assessment) to week 16 (outcome) to week 22 (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The ASR is a self-reported measure of adaptive functioning and psychopathology (e.g., anxiety, depression symptoms). Most of the items are on a 3 point scale including: (0) Not true, (1) Somewhat or sometimes true, and (2) Very often or often true. Higher scores equal more symptoms.</description>
