  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many Black Americans continue to be suffer from diabetes especially Black men. Although&#xD;
      previous diabetes efforts have reduced overall disease burden, they have failed to eliminate&#xD;
      racial and geographic disparities. The story of John Henry, the &quot;steel-drivin' man&quot;&#xD;
      represents strength and self-determination among Black Men. But often these traits lead men&#xD;
      to &quot;manup&quot; about their health and prevents them from taking care of their diabetes. This&#xD;
      study examines how we can assist Black men in improving their diabetes. Based on the traits&#xD;
      of John Henry, we will conduct a culturally-tailored study to 1) determine if our education&#xD;
      program including coping strategies and motivation text messages lowers A1c; and, 2) how&#xD;
      program operates in a rural setting while learning how we can best improve it for a larger&#xD;
      study. We hope to have the information to conduct a larger study with Black men in rural&#xD;
      areas to improve their diabetes outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As the United States' 7th leading cause of death, improving diabetic outcomes is a public&#xD;
      health priority. Black American men disproportionately suffer from diabetes more than White&#xD;
      counterparts. John Henryism endorses traditional masculine norms for Black Men, such as&#xD;
      self-determination and strength, as assets. However, these norms can also act as barriers to&#xD;
      diabetes self-management as they restrict access to support from family and friends at a time&#xD;
      when it is most needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this application is to pilot a targeted, culturally-tailored, diabetes&#xD;
      self-management intervention for 50 rural Black men to improve diabetes-related outcomes. Aim&#xD;
      1: Implement a 6-month diabetes self-management intervention, grounded in John Henryism, with&#xD;
      two arms consisting of the active intervention group and a delayed intervention group to test&#xD;
      the intervention's effect on the primary outcome of A1c change. Aim 2: Determine the&#xD;
      feasibility of conducting a 6-month culturally-tailored diabetes self-management intervention&#xD;
      for Black men in a rural NC community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention includes a 10-week education program focusing on self-management, social&#xD;
      support and coping strategies; and, daily motivational text messages. Aim 1 analysis includes&#xD;
      repeated measures t-test (or the non-parametric equivalent Wilcoxon Matched Pairs test) to&#xD;
      compare the mean scores of the both groups pre and post intervention. Aim 2 analysis focuses&#xD;
      on key parameters required for conducting a future trial. This innovative study leverages the&#xD;
      self-reliance and active coping mechanisms of John Henryism by fostering self-determination&#xD;
      to properly self-manage diabetes while providing stress management and coping skills to&#xD;
      buffer John Henryism's adverse effects.&#xD;
