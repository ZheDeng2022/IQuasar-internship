  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Corona virus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a rapidly spreading disease that involves almost every&#xD;
      part of the world. Although numerous attempts are being carried out to prevent and treat the&#xD;
      disease, there is no consensus about the gold standard treatment. In the recent study&#xD;
      (El-Badrawy et al., 2021) our group published a controlled study investigating the role of&#xD;
      inhalable sodium bicarbonate (SB) as adjuvant treatment of non-severe CT- identified COVID-19&#xD;
      pneumonia. The study concluded that sodium bicarbonate 8.4% inhalation with its nasal&#xD;
      instillation could be a possible adjuvant therapy for patients with non-severe COVID-19&#xD;
      pneumonia. Nevertheless, our previous study suffers from some limitations being non&#xD;
      randomized, with a small sample size and short duration of follow up. Moreover, the study&#xD;
      included only moderate cases of COVID-19 and excluded mild and severe cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present protocol is designed to avoid the limitations of our previous study in an attempt&#xD;
      to obtain clear answer about the role of inhalable SB as an adjuvant treatment of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The emergence of new mutants of Corona virus is a new problem that can face the synthesized&#xD;
      new anti COVID vaccines. The use of SB in treatment of COVID-19 may overcome Corona virus&#xD;
      whatever its mutant variant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothize that SB may neutralize the effect of sialic acid through change of pH and change&#xD;
      of the negative change, therefore prevent attachment, fusion and transport of the virus into&#xD;
      the host cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theory:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SB inhalation may affect COVID-19 in respiratory tract through the following mechanism (Singh&#xD;
      et al., 2020):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Alkalinisation of cell lysosomes; a mechanism similar to that of CQ and HCQ as reported&#xD;
           by Singh et al 2020 that inhibit viral entry, transport and post-entry events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reaction with sialic acid on respiratory epithelial cells by buffering of the negative&#xD;
           charge or change the pH of sialic acid that prevent entry of viruses into respiratory&#xD;
           epithelial cells and/ or reinfection of the released viruses from the infected cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The aim of the study is to investigate the role of SB 8.4% as adjuvant therapy in the&#xD;
           treatment of COVID- 19 patients proved to be RT-PCR positive (mild, moderate and&#xD;
           severe).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients and Methods Duration of the study: In the period between September 2021 and&#xD;
           March 2022 Place of the study: Isolation department (for hospitalized cases) and&#xD;
           COVID-19 surveillance clinic (for mild cases treated at home), Mansoura University&#xD;
           hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the period between September 2021 and March 2022, all consecutive patients suspected&#xD;
           as COVID-19 presented to the respiratory evaluation zone and outpatient clinic of our&#xD;
           university will be subjected to RT-PCR test for COVID. Patients proved to be RT-PCR&#xD;
           positive will be included in the present study. The study will include all grades of the&#xD;
           diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Children less than 18 years, pregnant ladies, those who will refuse enrollment or&#xD;
           discontinue follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) including two arms: control&#xD;
           group receiving standard treatment as per the routine protocol of the Egyptian Ministry&#xD;
           of Health (Masoud et al., 2020) according to the degree of the disease, and a study&#xD;
           group receiving the standard treatment in addition to the adjuvant inhalable SB.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Method of randomization: Eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
           receive either the standard treatment in addition to the adjuvant inhalable SB or&#xD;
           standard treatment alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study is open-label. Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
           Baseline assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Both groups were subjected to the following; full history, clinical examination,&#xD;
           complete blood count, C- reactive protein, D dimer, liver function and kidney function&#xD;
           tests. Radiological assessment with chest CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical, laboratory and radiological investigations were done at the time of diagnosis&#xD;
           before start of treatment, after one week, one month, two months, and three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical assessment of the disease was defined according to World Health Organization&#xD;
           (WHO, 2021 (table 1) Table 1: WHO Severity definitions (World Health Organization, 2021)&#xD;
           Critical COVID-19 Defined by the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome&#xD;
           (ARDS), sepsis, septic shock, or other conditions that would normally require the&#xD;
           provision of life-sustaining therapies such as mechanical ventilation (invasive or&#xD;
           non-invasive) or vasopressor therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
           Severe COVID-19:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Defined by any of:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Oxygen saturation &lt; 90% on room air. Respiratory rate &gt; 30 breaths/min in adults. Signs&#xD;
           of severe respiratory distress (accessory muscle use, inability to complete full&#xD;
           sentences, central cyanosis, or presence of any other general danger signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Moderate disease Adolescent with clinical signs of pneumonia (fever, cough, dyspnea,&#xD;
           fast breathing) but no signs of severe pneumonia, including SpO2 ≥ 90% on room air Mild&#xD;
           disease Symptomatic patients (fever, cough, fatigue, anorexia, myalgias, diarrhea,&#xD;
           nausea, vomiting, anosmia or ageusia) PCR +ve for COVID-19 without evidence of viral&#xD;
           pneumonia or hypoxia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Baseline investigations:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following laboratory studies will be done for all patients (Samprathi &amp; Jayashree,&#xD;
           2021):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  a complete blood count (CBC),&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  serum creatinine, and liver function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  D-dimer.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Radiological assessment by CT:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • CT images for each patient will be assessed for the following abnormalities:&#xD;
           ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, nodules, number of lung lobes affection,&#xD;
           interlobular septal thickening and pleural effusion. In cases of GGO and consolidation,&#xD;
           the severity of the lung affection is evaluated according to Bernheim et al. (2020),&#xD;
           with each of the five lung lobes assessed and scored for the degree of involvement and&#xD;
           classified as: score 0, no involvement (0% affected); 1, minimal (1-25%); 2, mild&#xD;
           (26-50%); 3, moderate (51-75%); and 4, severe (76-100%). A total severity score is&#xD;
           obtained by summing the five lobe scores, with a range between 0 and 20. A score of 1-5&#xD;
           is graded as 'minimal', 6-10 as 'mild', 11-15 as 'moderate' and 16-20 as 'severe.&#xD;

                and of invasive ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Number of days of hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
           II. Laboratory and Radiological Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • For all patients, a complete blood count (CBC), CRP and D-dimer at baseline, day 7,&#xD;
           day 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Radiological assessment using CT chest at baseline, one week and one month later.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Risk of COVID-19 infection transmission to health care workers from nebulizers as a&#xD;
           method for aerosol generation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) advises that&#xD;
           patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 may continue to use their nebulizer&#xD;
           because the aerosols produced by them are generated from fluid within the nebulizer&#xD;
           chamber that does not carry patient-derived viral particles. Indeed, if a particle in&#xD;
           the aerosol comes into contact with contaminated mucous membrane, it ceases to be&#xD;
           airborne and therefore will not be aerosolized. In any case, healthcare workers should&#xD;
           use appropriate hand hygiene (wash hands and put on fresh gloves) when helping patients&#xD;
           remove nebulizers and oxygen masks (British Thoracic Society, 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Practical advices (Cazzola et al., 2021):&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Pre-nebulization&#xD;
&#xD;
                • Washing hands&#xD;
&#xD;
                • Ensure the device is clean&#xD;
&#xD;
                • Ensure adequate protection for health care workers and bystander hosts&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. During nebulization • Separate room or negative pressure room (hospital/clinic);&#xD;
                when possible, outside the house on a porch or patio or in a garage and in any&#xD;
                case, near open windows or in areas of increased air circulation (home) • Mouth&#xD;
                piece preferred over facemask&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Post-nebulization&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Cleaning and disinfection of nebulizer&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Cleaning of the surface and areas of nebulization&#xD;
