  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out how much oxygen is used during a cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      exercise test (CPET) in women who have mild cardiotoxicity after standard treatment for&#xD;
      HER2-positive breast cancer, and to see whether the results of this test can be used to&#xD;
      predict how well participants' heart and lungs will work if they continue to receive this&#xD;
      kind of treatment.&#xD;

        Potential research participants will be identified by a member of the participant's&#xD;
        treatment team, the protocol investigator, or research team at Memorial Sloan Kettering&#xD;
        Cancer Center (MSK). If the investigator is a member of the treatment team, s/he will&#xD;
        screen their potential participant's medical records for suitable research study&#xD;
        participants and discuss with the subject their potential for enrolling in the research&#xD;
