  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to use Onconscreen plus 520 Panel (Burning Rock, China) to conduct NGS&#xD;
      testing in sputum, tissues and blood samples of patients with advanced NSCLC. In order to&#xD;
      explore the use of sputum as a diagnosis method for NSCLC patients, we will collect relevant&#xD;
      clinical information and follow-up treatment information. The primary endpoint will reveal&#xD;
      the effectiveness, accuracy, and feasibility in sputum, as compared to tissues and blood&#xD;
      samples. This study aims to study the feasibility and advantages/disadvantages of using&#xD;
      sputum as an noval body fluid biopsy option.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the advancements in the development of targeted therapy, the detection of actionable&#xD;
      genes has become routine practice in diagnosing lung cancer, especially in non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer (NSCLC). Due to its non-invasiveness and great accessibility, plasma-based&#xD;
      mutation profiling, with a sensitivity of approximately 70% relative to tissue samples, is&#xD;
      widely used in clinical settings. Profiling using other body fluids such as pleural effusion,&#xD;
      ascites, cerebrospinal fluid have been actively explored. Circulating cell-free DNA has also&#xD;
      been shown to be present in other bodily fluids such as sputum and urine, which have&#xD;
      potential to serve as liquid biopsy media for comprehensive mutation profiling. In this&#xD;
      study, we investigated the potential of sputum obtained from NSCLC patients for mutation&#xD;
      profiling using matched tissue, plasma and sputum from more than 30 advanced-stage NSCLC&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline tissues, plasma and sputum samples from more than 30 newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC&#xD;
      patients with 520 Panel sequencing (tissue 1000X, sputum 1000X, plasma cfDNA 10000X), in&#xD;
      different methods will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1、Compare different sample types with concordence rate, sensitivity, and specificity.&#xD;

    <description>Concordance rate was defined as the fraction of the total number of true positive and true negative patients relative to the cohort or indicated subgroup;&#xD;
Sensitivity rate means true positive rate, true positive patients were defined as those who carried at least one genomic alteration that were detected in both matched samples.&#xD;
Specificity rate means ture negative rate, patients were as defined true negative if no alteration was detected from either matched sample.</description>
