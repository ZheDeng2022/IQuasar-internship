  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab in treating&#xD;
      patients with classic Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to&#xD;
      treatment (refractory) that have been previously treated with brentuximab vedotin or&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitors. Brentuximab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody, brentuximab, linked to a&#xD;
      toxic agent called vedotin. Brentuximab attaches to CD30 positive cancer cells in a targeted&#xD;
      way and delivers vedotin to kill them. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab in&#xD;
      combination may be an effective treatment in patients with relapsed or refractory classic&#xD;
      Hodgkin lymphoma previously treated with brentuximab vedotin or checkpoint inhibitors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) with brentuximab vedotin&#xD;
      (brentuximab)/nivolumab used in combination in patients in patients previously treated with&#xD;
      brentuximab in combination with standard chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the ORR with brentuximab/nivolumab in combination in patients previously&#xD;
      treated with checkpoint inhibitors alone or in combination with standard chemotherapy for HL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the complete response rate (CRR) and progression-free survival (PFS) with&#xD;
      brentuximab/nivolumab in patients previously treated with brentuximab in combination with&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy for HL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the CRR and PFS with brentuximab/nivolumab in patients previously treated&#xD;
      with checkpoint inhibitors alone or in combination with standard chemotherapy for HL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate safety of this regimen using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology&#xD;
      Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 5.0 (v 5.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the tolerability of this regimen using patient-reported outcomes including&#xD;
      Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO)-CTCAE or pediatric PRO-CTCAE, neuropathy (Functional&#xD;
      Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity [FACT/GOG-NTX]), and&#xD;
      fatigue quality of life (QOL) by strata.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine the number of patients who proceed to autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cell transplantation (HSCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine the number of patients who successfully undergo stem cell collection among&#xD;
      those planning to proceed to autologous HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and nivolumab IV over&#xD;
      60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 16 cycles in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve complete response or&#xD;
      partial response at any time after 4 cycles may discontinue study therapy to proceed to&#xD;
      autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for&#xD;
      2 years, and then every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;
