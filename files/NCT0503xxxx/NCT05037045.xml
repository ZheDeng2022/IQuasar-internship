  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an prospective study to evaluate the effect of gene polymorphisms on therapeutic&#xD;
      responses to glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) in patients with T2DM.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many guidelines recommend the preferential use of GLP-1 RA after single drug or multiple oral&#xD;
      hypoglycemic drugs and basic insulin therapy for poor glycemic control. However, the clinical&#xD;
      responsiveness to GLP-1 RA varies among patients with T2DM. It has been reported that genetic&#xD;
      factors are the important reasons for individual variation in therapeutic response of&#xD;
      antidiabetic drugs. At present, dozens of gene loci related to therapeutic response of&#xD;
      antidiabetic drugs have been screened, which are of great clinical significance in guiding&#xD;
      clinical individualized treatment, improving the efficacy and safety of drugs, and reducing&#xD;
      the drug costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GLP-1 RA was injected subcutaneously at standard dose and frequency for consecutive 6 months.&#xD;
      The patients were visited at moths 0, 3, and 6, and medical histories, physical examinations,&#xD;
      and routine clinical laboratory tests were performed during these visits. The general&#xD;
      anthropometric parameters considered for this study were height (m), weight (kg), and waist&#xD;
      and hip circumferences (cm) at baseline, 3 months and 6months after exenatide treatment.&#xD;
      After an overnight fast, venous blood samples were obtained both in the fasting state and 2 h&#xD;
      later during a standard 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. Parameters were measured at&#xD;
      baseline, the end of months 3 and 6 after administration of exenatide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood was collected at follow-up and genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral&#xD;
      blood leucocytes. We further explored the association of gene polymorphisms with the&#xD;
      therapeutic effect of GLP-1 RA in patients with T2DM.&#xD;
