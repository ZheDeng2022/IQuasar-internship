  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers have found a new way to treat cancer using T cell therapy. The therapy used in&#xD;
      this study is T Cell Receptor (TCR) Gene Therapy Targeting KK-LC-1, a cancer germline antigen&#xD;
      that is expressed by certain cancers. This therapy is a type of treatment in which a&#xD;
      participant s T cells (a type of immune system white blood cell) are changed in the&#xD;
      laboratory to attack cancer cells and given back to the participant. This treatment might&#xD;
      help people with KK-LC-1 positive cancers which may include gastric, breast, cervical, lung&#xD;
      and other epithelial Cancers. Epithelial cancers are cancers that begin in the cells that&#xD;
      line an organ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of different doses of KK-LC-1 TCR T&#xD;
      cells plus aldesleukin to treat metastatic or refractory/recurrent KK-LC-1 positive cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults aged 18 and older with metastatic or refractory/recurrent KK-LC-1 positive epithelial&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with HLA typing (a blood test needed for eligibility) and&#xD;
      KK-LC-1 testing of the cancer tumor (to determine if the cancer is KK-LC-1 positive). A new&#xD;
      biopsy may be needed if tumor from an outside location is not available for KK-LC-1 testing.&#xD;
      Eligible participants will come to the NIH campus to have a screening evaluation which will&#xD;
      include physical exam, review of medical history and current medications, blood and heart&#xD;
      tests, imaging (X-ray, CT scan, MRI or PET scan), and evaluation of participant s veins that&#xD;
      are used for drawing blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant is eligible for the study based on the screening evaluation, they will&#xD;
      have a baseline evaluation prior to receiving the experimental treatment which may include&#xD;
      additional laboratory or imaging tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a large IV catheter inserted into a vein to undergo a procedure called&#xD;
      leukapheresis. Leukapheresis is the removal of the blood by a machine to collect specific&#xD;
      white blood cells. The remaining blood is returned to the body. This procedure is needed to&#xD;
      collect the cells that will be modified to target the cancer. The cells are grown in the lab&#xD;
      and given back to the participant through an injection into the participant's tumor. It takes&#xD;
      11-15 days to grow the cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the cells are growing, the participant will be admitted to the hospital about one week&#xD;
&#xD;
      before the cell infusion to receive 2 types of chemotherapy through an IV catheter over 5&#xD;
      days. The main purpose of the chemotherapy is to make the cells more effective in fighting&#xD;
      the cancer tumors. The cells will be given 1-2 days after the last dose of chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Within 24 hours after the cell infusion, participants will be given a cell growth factor&#xD;
      called aldesleukin through an IV for up to 4 days. Aldesleukin is thought to help the cells&#xD;
      live longer in the participant s body. Participants will recover in the hospital until they&#xD;
      are well enough to go home, which is usually about 7-12 days after the cell infusion or last&#xD;
      dose of aldesleukin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a follow-up visit at approximately 40 days after the date of cell&#xD;
      infusion. This visit will be to evaluate the safety of the cell therapy and the response of&#xD;
      the cancer to the treatment which will include physical examination, lab tests, and imaging&#xD;
      studies. If a participant has stable disease or their cancer has responded to the treatment,&#xD;
      they will be seen again at 12 weeks post cell infusion, every 3 months x 3 visits, and then&#xD;
      every 6 months x 5 years. If a participant s cancer progresses after this therapy, they will&#xD;
      be return to their home doctor for further management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving cell therapy, participants will be followed on a long-term gene therapy&#xD;
      protocol. Participants will have blood drawn periodically to test if the cells have grown or&#xD;
      changed. These blood tests will take place immediately before the cells, and then at 3, 6,&#xD;
      and 12 months for the first year and possibly annually thereafter based on the results. These&#xD;
      tests can be drawn locally and sent to the NIH. After a participant is off the study, they&#xD;
      will be contacted by telephone or mailed questionnaire for a total of 15 years after cell&#xD;
      therapy....&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      KK-LC-1 is a cancer germline (CG) antigen with expression restricted to germ cells (which&#xD;
      lack MHC class I expression) in adults and epithelial cancers including lung, breast and&#xD;
      gastric.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This limited expression pattern makes it an ideal target for T Cell Receptor (TCR) gene&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TCR T cell therapy targeting CG antigens has been shown to induce objective responses without&#xD;
      autoimmunity or off-target toxicity in participants with melanoma, synovial sarcoma and&#xD;
      cervical cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      T cells genetically engineered with a TCR targeting KK-LC-1 display specific reactivity&#xD;
      against HLA-A01:01, KK-LC-1 target cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KK-LC-1 TCR T cells can mediate tumor regression in pre-clinical mouse models of cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the maximally tolerated dose of KK-LC-1 TCR T cells plus aldesleukin for the&#xD;
      treatment of metastatic KK-LC-1 positive epithelial cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants greater than or equal to 18 years old with metastatic or refractory/recurrent&#xD;
      KK-LC-1 positive epithelial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior first line systemic therapy is required unless the participant declines standard&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must be HLA-A-01:01-positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase I clinical trial that will test the safety and efficacy of escalating doses&#xD;
      of KK-LC-1 TCR T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte-depleting preparative regimen of&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by a single infusion of KK-LC-1 TCR T cells and&#xD;
      high-dose aldesleukin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Re-treatment will be allowed for a small number of subjects&#xD;

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed KK-LC-1 positive&#xD;
             epithelial cancer (KK-LC-1 positivity assay performed at Rutgers Cancer Institute of&#xD;
             New Jersey). KK-LC-1 expression will be determined by in situ hybridization (ISH).&#xD;
             KK-LC- 1 score of 25% or greater will be considered positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be HLA-A 01 by low resolution typing, and HLA-A 01:01 by one of the&#xD;
             high resolution type results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable metastatic or refractory/recurrent KK-LC-1+ epithelial cancer (determined&#xD;
             by ISH).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All participants must have received prior first line standard therapy or be ineligible&#xD;
             to receive available therapies with known survival benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with three or fewer brain metastases that have been treated with surgery&#xD;
             or stereotactic radiosurgery are eligible. Lesions that have been treated with&#xD;
             stereotactic radiosurgery must be clinically stable for one month before protocol&#xD;
             treatment. Participants with surgically resected brain metastases are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;18 years of age. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available&#xD;
             on the use of KK-LC-1 TCR in participants &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status &lt;1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  leukocytes &gt;=3,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count &gt;=1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets &gt;=100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  hemoglobin &gt;=9.0 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) =&lt;2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        --creatinine clearance &gt;=60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for participants with&#xD;
&#xD;
        creatinine levels above institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serology:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Seronegative for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in&#xD;
                  this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Participants who are HIV&#xD;
                  seropositive can have decreased immune-competence and thus are less responsive to&#xD;
                  the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen, and seronegative for hepatitis C antibody.&#xD;
                  If hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then the participant must be tested for&#xD;
                  the presence of antigen by RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of the study agent on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this&#xD;
             reason and because other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be&#xD;
             teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry and up to four months after treatment. Women of childbearing potential must have&#xD;
             a negative pregnancy test. Women of childbearing potential are defined as all women&#xD;
             except women who are postmenopausal or who have had a hysterectomy. Postmenopausal&#xD;
             will be defined as women over the age of 55 who have not had a menstrual period in at&#xD;
             least one year or a participant that has received a treatment (i.e. chemotherapy or&#xD;
             pelvic radiation) that has resulted in them becoming postmenopausal. Should a woman&#xD;
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating&#xD;
             in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because there is a potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with KK-LC-1 TCR transduced PBL, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with KK-LC-1 TCR transduced PBL. These potential&#xD;
             risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  More than four weeks must have elapsed since any prior systemic therapy at the time&#xD;
             the participant receives the KK-LC-1 TCR T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants may have undergone minor surgical procedures within the past three weeks,&#xD;
             as long as all toxicities have recovered to Grade 1 or less&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to cyclophosphamide, fludarabine&#xD;
             or aldesleukin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements. Participants with abnormal pulmonary function tests but stable&#xD;
             obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease may be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency&#xD;
             Disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent opportunistic infections (The experimental treatment being evaluated in&#xD;
             this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Participants who have decreased&#xD;
             immune competence may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more&#xD;
             susceptible to its toxicities).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with autoimmune diseases such as Crohn s disease, ulcerative colitis,&#xD;
             rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hepatitis or pancreatitis, and systemic lupus&#xD;
             rythematosus. Hypothyroidism, vitiligo and other minor autoimmune disorders are not&#xD;
             exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants on active systemic immunosuppressive therapy that cannot be safely&#xD;
             withheld.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a history of coronary revascularization or ischemic symptoms unless&#xD;
             participant has a normal cardiac stress test.&#xD;
