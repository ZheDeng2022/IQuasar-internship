      The aims of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate peripheral and central auditory and vestibular function in group of adults with&#xD;
           idiopathic PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the relationship between the presence of significant auditory and vestibular&#xD;
           dysfunctions to patients' demographic, clinical (motor and non-motor manifestations) and&#xD;
           treatment variables&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of central nervous system&#xD;
      that mainly affects the motor system . The worldwide data showed a rising prevalence of PD&#xD;
      with age. Meta-analysis showed a prevalence of 41/100,000 in 40-49 years old; 107/100,000 in&#xD;
      50-59 years; 173/100,000 in 55-64 years; 428/10,000 in 60-69 years; 425/10,000 in 65-74&#xD;
      years; 1087/10,000 in 70-79 years; and 1903/100,000 in &gt;80 years. Some differences in&#xD;
      prevalence have been observed in different geographic location and in relation to sex .&#xD;
      Patients with PD have multiple non-motor symptoms (NMSs) including fatigue, sensory symptoms,&#xD;
      autonomic disturbance. sleep disorders, neuropsychiatric abnormalities etc . In the last&#xD;
      decade and even in early stages of PD, studies reported hearing and/or vestibular&#xD;
      dysfunctions in patients with PD with an estimated frequency of 25-50% . In the last decade&#xD;
      and even in early stages of PD, studies reported vestibular dysfunctions in patients with PD&#xD;
      with an estimated frequency of 14-25% compared to 5 -7.4% of the general population matched&#xD;
      for age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiologic mechanisms of NMSs with PD are complex. Experimental as well as&#xD;
      functional neuroimaging (e.g. SPECT and functional MRI) studies found that outputs from basal&#xD;
      ganglia are directed to the inferior colliculus, medial geniculate nucleus, and temporal&#xD;
      cortex. Motor or NMSs, occur due to loss not only of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia&#xD;
      nigra but also in other dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic areas of the brain including&#xD;
      serotoninergic, noradrenergic, and cholinergic systems. Lewy bodies and neurites consisting&#xD;
      of Î±-synuclein, the main pathological features of PD, were observed in brain hemispheres as&#xD;
      well as, spinal cord, brainstem nuclei and fiber tracts including vestibular nuclei and&#xD;
      efferent neuronal system within the inner ear .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic basic audiologic and vestibular evaluation and electrophysiological testing as&#xD;
      brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP), videonystagmography (VNG) and cervical (cVEMP)&#xD;
      and ocular (oVEMP) vestibular evoked myogenic potentials are easily available and applicable&#xD;
      in many parts of the world as diagnostic tests to objectively evaluate peripheral and central&#xD;
      auditory and vestibular dysfunctions for many disease including PD . This may provide early&#xD;
      drug intervention and rehabilitation for patients and improve their qualities of life.&#xD;
