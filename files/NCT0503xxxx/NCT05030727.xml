      The aim of this study is to detect early renal dysfunction that may occur during the surgical&#xD;
      procedure in geriatric patients who will undergo laparotomy surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In elderly patients undergoing surgery, accurate estimation of organ function is often not&#xD;
      possible. Accurate measurement of kidney function is vital to the routine care of patients.&#xD;
      Determining kidney function status can predict the progression of kidney disease and prevent&#xD;
      toxic drug levels in the body.The biochemical marker creatinine, found in serum and urine, is&#xD;
      widely used in the estimation of GFR. Although glomerular filtration rate decreases with&#xD;
      aging, creatinine also decreases in the elderly due to muscle loss. Even moderately elevated&#xD;
      blood creatinine may be indicative of severe kidney failure. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) is&#xD;
      the volume of blood plasma cleared of creatinine per unit time. It is a fast and&#xD;
      cost-effective method for measuring kidney function. Creatine is a breakdown product of&#xD;
      creatine phosphate found in skeletal muscle. Its production in the body depends on muscle&#xD;
      mass. The CrCl ratio approximates the GFR calculation as it freely filters the glomerular&#xD;
      creatine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High serum creatinine levels and decreased CrCl ratio are usually indicators of abnormal&#xD;
      kidney function.One of the markers of acute kidney injury is to look at plasma NGAL values.&#xD;
      Plasma NGAL (neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin) increases in response to damaged&#xD;
      kidney status and can predict acute kidney injury as an early marker. Data on investigating&#xD;
      plasma NGAL values as a predictive biomarker of acute kidney injury in patients undergoing&#xD;
      non-cardiovascular surgery are very limited NGAL is produced from the epithelium of kidneys,&#xD;
      lungs, colon, liver, adipose tissue, and inflammatory cells. NGAL is elevated in serum and&#xD;
      urine after acute tubular injury, making it possible to diagnose kidney damage within 2 hours&#xD;
      of injury. However, the increase of other traditional markers such as creatinine may be&#xD;
      delayed for up to 48 hours after acute kidney injury.To determine the roles of primary&#xD;

      This study will be performed on 60 patients aged 64 years and older who will undergo major&#xD;
      abdominal laparotomy surgery in Marmara University Pendik E.A.H Operating Room, whose&#xD;
      informed consent forms have been obtained from the patients. Patients with severe cardiac and&#xD;
      respiratory distress, liver and kidney failure, and those who did not consent to the study&#xD;
      will not be accepted into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative (0.hour baseline), postoperative 24.,48. BUN, Creatinine, Lactate values in the&#xD;
      blood of the patients at 1 hour, and for plasma NGAL, blood samples will be taken at the&#xD;
      preoperative, postoperative 6th and 24th hours. And the results will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No group will be formed in the study, which includes a total of 60 patients. All patients&#xD;
      will be anesthetized by induction of anesthesia (2 mg/kg propfol/ 1-2 mcgr/kg remifentanil/&#xD;
      0.6 mg/kg rocuronium), and intraoperative inhaler Desflurane + intravenous Remifentanil will&#xD;
      be used to provide maintenance anesthesia. Patients will be given intravenous fluids of 4-8&#xD;
      ml/kg/hr with PVI monitoring, if necessary, without fluid restriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistically is acceptable for the area under the ROC curve to be above 0.700. It has been&#xD;
      determined that we need a minimum of 60 people in order to show that an area with a minimum&#xD;
      level of 0.700 is statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the aim of our study is to detect early renal dysfunction that may occur during the surgical&#xD;
      procedure in geriatric patients who will undergo laparotomy surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In elderly patients undergoing surgery, accurate estimation of organ function is often not&#xD;
      possible. Accurate measurement of kidney function is vital to the routine care of patients.&#xD;
      Determining kidney function status can predict the progression of kidney disease and prevent&#xD;
      toxic drug levels in the body. Glomerular filtration rate measurement includes the injection&#xD;
      of inulin and its clearance by the kidneys. However, the use of inulin is invasive, time&#xD;
      consuming and an expensive procedure. Alternatively, the biochemical marker creatinine, found&#xD;
      in serum and urine, is widely used in the estimation of GFR. Although glomerular filtration&#xD;
      rate decreases with aging, creatinine also decreases in the elderly due to muscle loss. Even&#xD;
      moderately elevated blood creatinine may be indicative of severe kidney failure. Creatinine&#xD;
      clearance (CrCl) is the volume of blood plasma cleared of creatinine per unit time. It is a&#xD;
      fast and cost-effective method for measuring kidney function. Creatine is a breakdown product&#xD;
      of creatine phosphate found in skeletal muscle. Its production in the body depends on muscle&#xD;
      mass. The CrCl ratio approximates the GFR calculation as it freely filters the glomerular&#xD;
      creatinine. However, it is also secreted by the peritubular capillaries, causing CrCl to&#xD;
      overestimate GFR by about 10% to 20%. Despite the marginal error, it was an accepted method&#xD;
      for measuring GFR due to the ease of measurement of CrCl. Creatinine clearance can be&#xD;
      estimated using serum creatinine levels. The Cockcroft-Gault (C-G) formula uses the patient's&#xD;
      weight (kg) and gender to estimate CrCl (mg/dL). To correct for lower CrCl in females, the&#xD;
      resulting CrCl is multiplied by 0.85 if the patient is female. The C-G formula is age&#xD;
      dependent as the main predictor for CrCl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      eCCr = (140 - age) x (kg) x [0.85 if female] / 72 x [Serum creatinine (mg/dL)] High serum&#xD;
      creatinine levels and decreased CrCl ratio are usually indicators of abnormal kidney&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the markers of acute kidney injury is to look at plasma NGAL values. Plasma NGAL&#xD;
      (neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin) increases in response to damaged kidney status&#xD;
      and can predict acute kidney injury as an early marker. Data on investigating plasma NGAL&#xD;
      values as a predictive biomarker of acute kidney injury in patients undergoing&#xD;
      non-cardiovascular surgery are very limited NGAL is produced from the epithelium of kidneys,&#xD;
      lungs, colon, liver, adipose tissue, and inflammatory cells. NGAL is elevated in serum and&#xD;
      urine after acute tubular injury, making it possible to diagnose kidney damage within 2 hours&#xD;
      of injury. However, the increase of other traditional markers such as creatinine may be&#xD;
      delayed for up to 48 hours after acute kidney injury.&#xD;
