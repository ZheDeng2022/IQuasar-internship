  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) pandemic, public health departments have&#xD;
      issued guidelines to limit viral transmission. In this environment, people will feel urges to&#xD;
      engage in activities that violate these guidelines, but research on guideline adherence has&#xD;
      been reliant on surveys asking people to self-report their typical behaviour, which may fail&#xD;
      to capture these urges as they unfold. Guideline adherence could be improved through&#xD;
      behaviour change interventions, but considering the wide range of behaviours that COVID-19&#xD;
      guidelines prescribe, there are few methods that allow observing changes of aggregate&#xD;
      guideline adherence in the 'wild'. In order to administer interventions and to obtain&#xD;
      contemporaneous data on a wide range of behaviours, the researchers use ecological momentary&#xD;
      assessment. In this preregistered parallel randomised trial, 95 participants aged 18-65 from&#xD;
      the United Kingdom were assigned to three conditions using blinded block randomisation, and&#xD;
      engage in episodic future thinking (n = 33), compassion exercises (n = 31), or a sham&#xD;
      procedure (n = 31) and report regularly on the intensity of their occurrent urges (min. 1,&#xD;
      max. 10) and their ability to control them. The researchers investigate whether state&#xD;
      impulsivity and vaccine attitudes predict guideline adherence, while assessing through which&#xD;
      mechanism these predictors affect behaviour.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Multiple times per day, for one week.</time_frame>
    <description>Throughout each day, participants would receive 5 ecological momentary assessment surveys that were available for 1 hour. In randomised order, they were asked whether since the last survey they had felt an urge to not wash their hands, not cover their mouths when coughing or sneezing, not socially distance (e.g. to hug, shake hands), not leave details for contact tracing, or whether they had felt an urge to leave their house, touch their face, or avoid getting tested when it would have been better to do the opposite - from a COVID-19 standpoint. Participants responded using a slider [0,10], where 0 indicated no urge, 1 indicated a very weak urge, and 10 indicated a very strong urge.</description>
