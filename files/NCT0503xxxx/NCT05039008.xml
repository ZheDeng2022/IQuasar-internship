  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. The main physical sequela of patients with hemophilia is the development of a&#xD;
      progressive, degenerative intra-articular lesion, known as hemophilic arthropathy). This&#xD;
      sequela is manifested by chronic pain, limited range of motion, axial abnormalities, and&#xD;
      periarticular muscle atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective. To assess the safety and effectiveness of an intervention through blood flow&#xD;
      restriction, regarding the frequency of bleeding and the improvement in the perception of&#xD;
      muscle activation and strength, functionality, joint pain, joint status and the perception of&#xD;
      quality of life in patients with hemophilic arthropathy. knee and ankle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design. Randomized, multicenter, single-blind clinical study. Method. 60 patients with&#xD;
      hemophilia A and B will be recruited in this study. Patients will be recruited in 3 regions&#xD;
      of Spain. The dependent variables will be: bleeding frequency (self-registration), pain&#xD;
      (measured with the visual analog scale and pressure algometer), quality of life (SF-36&#xD;
      scale), joint status (Hemophilia Joint Health Score scale), strength (dynamometer) and muscle&#xD;
      activation (surface electromyograph) and functionality (6-Minutes Walking test, Quick&#xD;
      Disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand). Three evaluations will be carried out:&#xD;
      pre-treatment, post-treatment and after a follow-up period of 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results. Observe the safety of blood flow restriction in hemophilia patients. To&#xD;
      analyze the efficacy of blood flow restriction in improving muscle strength and activation,&#xD;
      chronic pain, functionality, and the perception of quality of life in patients with&#xD;
      hemophilic knee and ankle arthropathy.&#xD;

    <description>A self-registration will be used to evaluate the frequency of bleeding, and thus the safety of the technique. This self-registration will be given to each patient at the beginning of the study and they must fill in the number of hemarthrosis and their main characteristics: date, origin (traumatic or spontaneous) and location (knee or ankle). The self-registration will be delivered to the evaluator in each of the study evaluations (post-treatment and follow-up).</description>

    <time_frame>Screening visit, within the first seven days after treatment and after four weeks follow-up visit</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analog scale will be used to assess the perception of joint pain, being valued with a range of 0 to 10 points (from no pain to the maximum pain suffered or imaginable) in the joints evaluated</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline pressure pain threshold after treatment and at four weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening visit, within the first seven days after treatment and after four weeks follow-up visit</time_frame>
    <description>With a pressure algometer (model Wagner FPN100) we will measure the pressure pain threshold, at the joint level and at a distance (in another part of the body). This device measures in Newton / cm2 the pressure at which the subject perceives pain under pressure. A pressure will be made on the chosen point, which we will increase at an approximate speed of 50kPa / s until the patient warns us that the sensation begins to be painful. Hemophilic arthropathy will be assessed in the knee (inner edge of the patella) and ankle (lateral malleolus).</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline muscle strength after treatment and at four weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening visit, within the first seven days after treatment and after four weeks follow-up visit</time_frame>
    <description>With a pressure dynamometer (microFET®2 Digital Handheld model) we will measure the strength of the quadriceps and triceps surae. This device measures in Newton the force that the patient exerts in the requested muscular action. The higher the value, the greater the muscle strength. We will carry out the measurements bilaterally. The patient will be asked 4 maximum isometric contractions of 5 seconds, with a rest of 30 seconds between them, against the dynamometer located in the hand of the evaluator</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline electrical activity of the muscles after treatment and at four weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening visit, within the first seven days after treatment and after four weeks follow-up visit</time_frame>
    <description>Using surface electromyography (model SHIMMMER2, Shimmer, Ireland), we will evaluate the electrical activity of the musculature and its level of activation. The placement of the electrodes will be marked on the standing subjects, and they will be placed following the European recommendations for the use of the SEMG. A bipolar SEMG system will be used with circular electrodes 10 mm in diameter, 20 mm apart, placed longitudinally, in the direction of the fibers of the studied muscle, and with a remote reference electrode.</description>

    <time_frame>Screening visit, within the first seven days after treatment and after four weeks follow-up visit</time_frame>
    <description>Using the generic Short Form 36 (SF-36v2) scale, the perception of quality of life of the patients included in the study will be evaluated. This scale consists of 36 items and a range from 0 to 100 points (where a higher score indicates a better perception of quality of life).</description>

The range of motion of the knee and ankle joint will be measured using a universal goniometer, using the protocol for measuring joint motion described by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.</description>
