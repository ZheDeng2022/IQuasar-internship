  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxygen treatment is common in management of preterm babies requiring intensive care. Delivery&#xD;
      of too much or too little oxygen increase the risk of damage to eyes and lungs, and&#xD;
      contributes to death and disability. Oxygen control in preterm infants requires frequent&#xD;
      adjustments in the amount of oxygen delivered to the baby. This is generally performed&#xD;
      manually by a clinician attending the baby, and generally directed to maintaining a specific&#xD;
      range of blood oxygen saturation. The manual control often results in only half of the time&#xD;
      in the specified range, with the baby experiencing high and low blood oxygen saturations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technology being studied is designed to assist the clinician in maintaining blood oxygen&#xD;
      saturation within target range by measuring oxygen saturation and automatically adjusting the&#xD;
      amount of oxygen delivered for babies receiving high velocity nasal insufflation (an advanced&#xD;
      form of high flow oxygen therapy). The proposed study will evaluate the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of the automatic control of oxygen by the new technology, as compared to manual control,&#xD;
      among babies receiving high velocity therapy in a neonatal intensive care unit.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Detailed Description: Supplemental oxygen is commonly administered to babies in neonatal&#xD;
      intensive care units. The goal of oxygen therapy is to maintain normal oxygenation while&#xD;
      minimizing hypoxemia and hypoxemia. Preterm infants are particularly vulnerable to oxygen&#xD;
      toxicity and oxidative stress leading to retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), bronchopulmonary&#xD;
      dysplasia (BPD), and periventricular leukomalacia (PVL). It's also well known that preterm&#xD;
      infants experience hypoxic events exposing the baby to low oxygen levels. These hypoxic&#xD;
      events vary as the infant matures, but exposure to prolonged and frequent episodes of&#xD;
      hypoxemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The delivery of oxygen is&#xD;
      generally controlled by a clinician, and the control decisions are generally made using a&#xD;
      non-invasive measure of blood oxygen saturation called pulse oximetry (SpO2) and is a&#xD;
      standard of care in the neonatal intensive care unit. The most frequent item adjusted by&#xD;
      clinicians to maintain SpO2 within specific target ranges is the fraction of the inspired&#xD;
      oxygen (FiO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study by Reynolds, et al., caregiver manual control of oxygen delivered to NICU&#xD;
      babies receiving high velocity therapy resulted in only 49% of the total 24-hour study period&#xD;
      with the babies within the target SpO2 range (90-95%). by the caregiver based on the&#xD;
      monitored oxygen saturation. Similar to the Reynolds findings, Hagadorn et al., conducted a&#xD;
      study in 14 centers and showed that preterm infants under 28 weeks' gestation receiving&#xD;
      oxygen spent on average only 48% of the time with SpO2 within the prescribed target range,&#xD;
      about 36% of the time above and 16% of the time with SpO2 below the target range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preterm infants have frequent fluctuations in SpO2 due to their cardio-respiratory&#xD;
      instability requiring frequent adjustments of FiO2 . Consequently, these particularly&#xD;
      vulnerable infants spend significant time with SpO2 outside the optimal target range and are&#xD;
      often exposed to extremes of hypoxemia and hyperoxaemia. The automatic oxygen control system&#xD;
      continuously monitors the oxygen saturation and adjusts the oxygen delivery to maintain&#xD;
      oxygen saturation within the target range. The efficacy of this mode of oxygen control was&#xD;
      demonstrated by Reynolds, et al. in 2018 from two centers in the United Kingdom. Automated&#xD;
      control of FiO2 can significantly improve compliance of oxygen saturation targeting and may&#xD;
      significantly reduces exposure to hypoxemia as well as hyperoxaemia. The high velocity nasal&#xD;
      insufflation therapy is a common mode of non-invasive respiratory support in preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike prior studies, this study will include a set of hypothesis-driven safety endpoints&#xD;
      (proportion of time above or below target range), stratification by body mass at enrolment,&#xD;
      and skin pigmentation phenotype. The objective of this randomized control trial is to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of the controller (Vapotherm Oxygen Assist Module [OAM]) in maintaining&#xD;
      the SpO2 within target range for premature infants receiving high velocity therapy and&#xD;
      presenting with a labile FiO2 requirement.&#xD;
