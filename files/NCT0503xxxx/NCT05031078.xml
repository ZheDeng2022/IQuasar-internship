    <textblock>
      This is a single center, longitudinal cohort study in which subjects will receive 9-valent&#xD;
      HPV vaccine according to package insert (i.e., one dose of 9-valent HPV vaccine on day (D) 0&#xD;
      followed by a second dose 2 months later and a third dose 6 months later).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune responses in the blood, saliva, bone marrow, and lymph nodes will be assessed in&#xD;
      subjects receiving the HPV vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for immunologic testing will be collected at screening (from D-60 to D-7), on&#xD;
      D0 (before vaccination), D1, D7, D14, D30, D60 (before vaccination), D61, D67, D74, D90, D180&#xD;
      (before vaccination), D187, D194, D210, D365, and D730. Saliva samples for antibody testing&#xD;
      will be collected on D0 (before vaccination), D30, D60 (before vaccination), D90, D180&#xD;
      (before vaccination), D210, D365, and D730.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Axillary lymph node sampling by fine needle aspiration will be done in all groups at D-30 and&#xD;
      2 additional times in per group. Group 1 will have lymph node sampling done D14 and D30 after&#xD;
      the first dose. Group 2 will have lymph node sampling done D74 and D90. Group 3 will have&#xD;
      lymph node sampling D194 and D210. Bone marrow sampling will be done for all groups at D730.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human papillomaviruses (HPV) cause cervical, anal, oropharyngeal, vulvar, vaginal, and penile&#xD;
      cancers. There are over 200 types of HPV; 12 are known to cause cancer. The current HPV&#xD;
      vaccine is a subunit vaccine, meaning it is made of only part of the virus (a protein) and&#xD;
      cannot infect humans. The HPV vaccine is highly effective at preventing disease by HPV types&#xD;
      that cause 90% of cancer cases and 90% of genital warts cases in women and men who do not&#xD;
      have ongoing or prior HPV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most vaccines protect by generating antibodies. Importantly, the HPV vaccine, first approved&#xD;
      in 2006, has been shown to make high levels of antibodies against HPV that last for &gt;10&#xD;
      years. The durability of HPV vaccine antibody levels is exceptional compared to other&#xD;
      approved and experimental subunit vaccines whose antibody levels drop more rapidly. However,&#xD;
      how the HPV vaccine - let alone any vaccine - generates long-lasting antibodies is not&#xD;
      understood. Understanding how vaccines make high levels of long-lasting antibodies will help&#xD;
      the efforts to successfully and reliably design new vaccines that make these highly desired&#xD;
      responses (like vaccines against new pandemics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators designed this study to better understand how the HPV vaccine generates such&#xD;
      high levels of long-lasting antibodies in humans. To do this, the investigators need to study&#xD;
      early immune responses in lymph nodes, which is where cells that make antibodies (B cells)&#xD;
      are activated by the vaccine. The investigators will also need to study immune responses in&#xD;
      blood. For example, to measure the levels of antibodies in blood and also the levels of cells&#xD;
      that help B cells (helper T cells). As the HPV vaccine can protect against oropharyngeal&#xD;
      cancer, the study team aim to understand the level of antibodies in the saliva and how the&#xD;
      antibodies compare to blood. Finally, antibodies themselves are not long-lived as proteins,&#xD;
      but the cells that make these antibodies are (specialized B cells called plasma cells).&#xD;
      Plasma cells are found in the bone marrow. It is important that the research team finds and&#xD;
      study these cells making antibodies against HPV, so the investigators can better understand&#xD;
      how they contribute to long-lasting antibody levels.&#xD;
