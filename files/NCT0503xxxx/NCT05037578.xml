      This pilot study plans to examine feasibility and outcomes of a&#xD;
      culturally/religiously-tailored church-based dementia screening intervention among older&#xD;
      adult African American church members and community members who use church outreach services&#xD;
      in 4 African American churches.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to conduct an exploratory pilot study to examine feasibility&#xD;
      and outcomes of a culturally/religiously-tailored church-based dementia screening&#xD;
      intervention among older adult African American church members and community members who use&#xD;
      church outreach services in 4 African American churches (N=100). Our secondary outcomes are&#xD;
      to assess the impact of the intervention on dementia-related stigma and linkage to care.&#xD;
      Intervention content is based on the Theory of Planned Behavior; intervention delivery is&#xD;
      based on the Social-Ecological Model - both guided by a faith community engagement approach.&#xD;
      Trained faith leaders will deliver the tailored intervention through multilevel church&#xD;
      outlets: individual self-help resources (e.g., risk checklist, commitment to screening&#xD;
      cards); group ministry discussion guides/seminar on dementia; church-wide services using&#xD;
      sermon guides, responsive readings, and church bulletin inserts; and church-community level&#xD;
      text messages, dementia screening, and linkage to care services. Two screening events will be&#xD;
      held at each church. We will also conduct a process evaluation that will include post-test&#xD;
      study focus groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1. Test a religiously/culturally-tailored, church-based dementia screening&#xD;
      intervention on receipt of dementia screening, stigma, and LTC use among an older adult&#xD;
      African American church-populations at 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis. The tailored church-based dementia screening intervention will evidence increased&#xD;
      screening and LTC rates, and lower dementia-related stigma beliefs at 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2. Evaluate predictors of receipt of dementia screening at 4 months among older&#xD;
      adult African American church-populations to determine modifiable screening&#xD;
      facilitators/barriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3. Conduct a process evaluation to examine study intervention implementation&#xD;
      facilitators, barriers, and dose along with exposure and satisfaction to identify essential&#xD;
      intervention components.&#xD;

    <description>This intervention will be delivered through church-based multilevel activities by trained church leaders using religiously/ culturally-tailored study materials (sermon guides, responsive readings, educational games, brochures, educational/testimonial videos) packaged in a culturally-tailored. Intervention churches will receive the Project Grace Tool Kit and intervention implementation directions to seek cognitive screening. These churches will hold a Project Grace Kickoff event, where a sermon, and other tool kit materials will be distributed. After the Kick-off, liaisons will deliver 1-2 Tool Kit materials/activities per month through targeted multilevel church activities over 4 months. Delivery of intervention components will coincide with existing, multilevel activities that occur in churches through: a) churchwide services, b) outreach ministry groups; and c) individual level activities (e.g., text/voice/email health promotion messages from church) over 4 months.</description>
