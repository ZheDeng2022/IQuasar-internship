      Compare the maximum pain and anxiety experienced between the group using a virtual reality&#xD;
      headset and the control group in an adult woman during a hysterosalpingography examination&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In France, 1 couples out of 5 consults for suspected infertility. Hysterosalpingography is&#xD;
      the first line diagnostic examination in this course and can sometimes be therapeutic. This&#xD;
      gynecological examination is invasive in nature, this exam requires an administration of&#xD;
      iodinated contrast product by the endocavitary route.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hysterosalpingography is the most painful examination in this treatment path and pain's&#xD;
      assessment is classified as strong by the French National Authority for Health (Haute&#xD;
      Autérité de Santé) and anxiety-inducing. For these patients, drug analgesic treatments remain&#xD;
      ineffective or contraindicated in outpatient mode. Ionizing irradiation is a constraint that&#xD;
      makes hypnosis unsuitable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies show the contribution of a virtual reality headset in reducing pain and&#xD;
      anxiety by inducing patients in an hypnotic environment. This tool standardizes interventions&#xD;
      based on changes in consciousness. It is an easy-to-use, non-drug analgesia with few side&#xD;
      effects and inexpensive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The environment offered by this medical device is based on evidence to peacefully escort&#xD;
      patients on a journey of natural elements. Calm music is made up of key elements of musical&#xD;
      therapy. A medical anesthesiologist and hypnotherapist wrote the hypnotic induction. And, the&#xD;
      voice is the one of an experienced sociologist in practice. A simple meditation modeled on&#xD;
      heart synchronization sets a persistent goal during this immersion.&#xD;
