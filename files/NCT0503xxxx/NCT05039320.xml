    <textblock>
      This will be a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled two-arm parallel groups study of&#xD;
      the effect of oral probiotics containing Streptococcus salivarius K12 on oral biofilm,&#xD;
      salivation rate, and secretory immunoglobulin A salivary level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess the effect of oral probiotics containing Streptococcus&#xD;
      salivarius K12 strain on oral biofilm, unstimulated salivary flow rate, and salivary&#xD;
      secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) levels.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Thirty consenting patients aged 20-24 years who will meet the inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      recruited in the study. At the preparatory phase patients will be recruited and randomized,&#xD;
      their oral hygiene protocols will be standardized, researchers will be calibrated and&#xD;
      trained. The main phase will include a double-blind, randomized, two-arm parallel group,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study of probiotics effects, and wash-out period. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomly divided into 2 groups (group 1 - probiotics, group 2 - placebo). Clinical&#xD;
      examination will be performed at baseline, after 4 weeks (probiotic/placebo intake) and 6&#xD;
      weeks (wash-out), and will include the assessment of DMFT index, oral hygiene level (the&#xD;
      Turesky Modification of the Quigley-Hein Plaque Index (TMQHPI)), gingival inflammation (PMA&#xD;
      index), salivation rate (unstimulated salivary flow), and salivary concentration of secretory&#xD;
      immunoglobulins A.&#xD;

      Preparatory phase of the study Patient training Oral hygiene instructions will be given and&#xD;
      the compliance with the recommendations will be controlled with weekly visits to the dental&#xD;
      office. The participants will be familiarized with the assessment techniques and trial&#xD;
      procedures Qualification and calibration of the observers The clinical examinations will be&#xD;
      performed by two dentists who are the members of Therapeutic Dentistry Department, Sechenov&#xD;
      University, Moscow, Russia. The examiners will be trained and calibrated to obtain an intra-&#xD;
      and inter-examiner agreement of 90%, using Kappa statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Thirty people aged 20-24 years will be examined and randomly assigned to one of&#xD;
      the study groups: Group 1 will use tablets containing probiotic (Streptococcus salivarius&#xD;
      K12). Group 2 will use tablets containing placebo. The allocation concealment will be&#xD;
      performed by the use of containers numbered by a &quot;third party&quot; (person, who will not&#xD;
      participate in the study). The tablets in bottles without any titles will be placed in the&#xD;
      containers. The tablets in both groups will look similar. The patient on enrolment will&#xD;
      receive a container of tablets. Neither patients nor researchers will be aware of the type of&#xD;
      tablets used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment protocol The patients will use the prescribed tablets (&quot;Bactoblis&quot;, registration&#xD;
      number: AM.01.06.01.003.Е.000024.07.18; 20.07.18, MEDICO DOMUS, d.d.o. (18116, Nis, Serbia))&#xD;
      for 4 weeks 1 tablet per day. The end of the treatment course will be followed by a two-week&#xD;
      wash-out period. During the wash-out period, patients will have to stop taking their&#xD;
      prescribed tablets. A wash-out period is necessary to assess the stability of the results&#xD;
      achieved. Control examinations will be carried out in the following periods: 4 weeks and 6&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
      The examination will include determination of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DMFT index, oral hygiene level (TQHPI), gingival tissue condition (PMA index), unstimulated&#xD;
      salivary flow rate, and a concentration of secretory immunoglobulins A in saliva (ELISA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and reporting. Data will be collected at the following points: at baseline,&#xD;
      and after 4 and 6 weeks of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the study will be maintained for two (2) years after the date the investigation is&#xD;
      completed, terminated or until the records are no longer required to support the protocol,&#xD;
      whichever date is later. Patient records and data are eligible for inspection and/or copying&#xD;
      by applicable regulatory authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data handling and record keeping Data entry will be completed in the RedCap database (which&#xD;
      will cover all the created CRFs). The data will be exported into CSV file format, which will&#xD;
      then be used for data analysis. Only de-identified data will be used for data analysis. All&#xD;
      hard copy documents will be shredded within five years after completion of the study upon&#xD;
      Sponsor approval. Collected de-identified data will be sent to a biostatistician for&#xD;
      statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse reactions. There is no expectation of any adverse outcomes or reactions due to a&#xD;
      patient using probiotics or placebo. However, hypersensitivity reactions to some of the&#xD;
      tablets' components are still possible. All participants will be given access to contact info&#xD;
      of the investigators. Any adverse reactions should be reported immediately to the&#xD;
      investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reasons for Withdrawal or Termination&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following is a list of possible reasons for study treatment discontinuation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening Failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject withdrawal of consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject is not compliant with study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse Event that in the opinion of the Investigator would be in the best interest of&#xD;
           the subject to discontinue study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Protocol violation requiring discontinuation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lost to follow-up All subjects are free to withdraw from participation at any time, for&#xD;
           any reason, specified or unspecified, and without prejudice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan All analyses will be performed using per-protocol population: all&#xD;
      subjects will be analyzed who did not substantially deviate from the protocol as to be&#xD;
      determined on a per-subject basis by the study principal investigator immediately before&#xD;
      database lock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be presented as means and standard deviations with 95% confidence intervals,&#xD;
      medians and 25 and 75 percentiles, and percentages depending on the type of variables. The&#xD;
      normality and sphericity of distribution of continuous variables will be assessed with&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wilk and Leven's tests, respectively. If the assumptions of normality and sphericity&#xD;
      are satisfied, repeated measures mixed ANOVA model will be performed followed by post-hoc&#xD;
      Tukey test with adjustment for multiple comparisons. If the aforementioned assumptions are&#xD;
      not satisfied, the differences between groups will be assessed using Mann-Witney U-test and&#xD;
      the difference within the groups at different study timepoints will be assessed with Friedman&#xD;
      test with post-hoc comparisons. The same non-parametric tests will be used for the analyses&#xD;
      of categorical and ordinal variables. Fisher's exact test will be used to access the&#xD;
      frequencies of categorical variables in the groups. Correlation between Salivation rate,&#xD;
      salivary sIgA concentration, TQHPI, DMFT, Decay, and PMA will be assessed using Spearman&#xD;
      correlation coefficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All summary tables will be structured with a column for each timepoint and rows for each&#xD;
      assessed outcome and will be annotated with the total population size relevant to that&#xD;
      table/treatment, including any missing observations.&#xD;
