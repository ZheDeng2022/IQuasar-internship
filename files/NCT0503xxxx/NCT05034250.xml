    <textblock>
      Multiple studies suggest a link between the iron status and the development of the&#xD;
      endometrium. Therefore, a sufficient iron supply seems to relevant for female fertility and&#xD;
      reproduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To gain further insight on the effects of iron status on female fertility, a prospective&#xD;
      study on infertile women und women with recurrent miscarriage will be conducted. In these,&#xD;
      the iron status will be evaluated in detail. In addition, a control group of healthy women&#xD;
      without infertility will be enrolled.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The high importance of sufficient iron supply for the human body is without doubt. Notably,&#xD;
      it has also been suggested that iron was a central resource in female reproduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women are more prone to iron deficiency than men. It has been stated frequently that blood&#xD;
      loss during menstruation was the major cause of lower iron levels in women. On average, women&#xD;
      lose about 16 mg of iron for the average menstrual period. This is in line with several&#xD;
      studies which demonstrated that women who had menorrhagia were at a higher risk of anemia and&#xD;
      iron deficiency anemia. However, the link between menstruation-caused blood loss and iron&#xD;
      status is less clear. In previous studies, it was found that higher hemoglobin was associated&#xD;
      with a thicker endometrium. An improved body condition, as measured by iron status, might&#xD;
      allow women to grow a thicker endometrium despite the fact that a thicker endometrium was&#xD;
      associated with greater blood loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, reproductive hormones are also implicated in iron status and are also&#xD;
      responsible for the sexual dimorphism in iron levels in humans. For example, androgens&#xD;
      stimulate the formation of red blood cells and are responsible for their higher hemoglobin&#xD;
      levels. The role of estrogens is less clear, since studies have been contradicting. However,&#xD;
      studies on the relationship between contraceptive pills and iron status may have provided the&#xD;
      biggest clue to the effects of estrogen on iron physiology. Hormonal contraceptive use seems&#xD;
      to raise iron stores. Notably, recent evidence suggests that estrogen itself, which also&#xD;
      includes the estrogen in contraceptive pills, helps increase absorption of iron.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been mentioned that the iron status could be linked with fertility. As part of a&#xD;
      larger study on iron supplementation and hair loss, the circumstances of seven women who&#xD;
      became pregnant during the supplement intervention has been investigated. Despite the small&#xD;
      number of women, this study suggests an intriguing link between iron status and ability to&#xD;
      conceive. In addition, a larger, 8-year prospective study of 18,555 premenopausal women in&#xD;
      the United States found that women who consumed iron supplements had a significantly lower&#xD;
      risk of infertility than women who did not consume iron supplements. Together with the above&#xD;
      mentioned observation that women with an improved iron status were able to grow a bigger&#xD;
      endometrium, it seems reasonable to assume an influence of iron status on female fertility.&#xD;
      Hypothetically, this could lead either to infertility/sterility or to recurrent miscarriage.&#xD;
      Notably, one recent small study demonstrated no difference in iron levels between women with&#xD;
      recurrent miscarriage and controls. Notably, other parameters of the iron status were not&#xD;
      assessed. However, epidemiologic data on iron status and female fertility are scarce. Thus, a&#xD;
      prospective study on infertile women und women with recurrent miscarriage will be conducted.&#xD;
      In these women, the iron status will be evaluated in detail. In addition, a control group of&#xD;
      healthy women without infertility will be enrolled.&#xD;
