  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposal is to determine the feasibility of implementing Ecological&#xD;
      Momentary Assessment (EMA) and Motivational Interviewing (MI) methods to enhance adherence&#xD;
      for a 4-week self-initiated arm training protocol. A non-randomized feasibility study using a&#xD;
      4-week UE training protocol will be conducted in 15 individuals within the first 12 months&#xD;
      post-stroke living in the community. EMA data will be collected using a mobile app to&#xD;
      automate real-time collection of adherence data on a daily basis. MI will be used to produce&#xD;
      self-generated training plans (training goals, training schedule), guided by the therapist&#xD;
      before the start of training.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using a mixed methods design, the study will collect quantitative data before, during, and&#xD;
      after training. Qualitative data will be collected after the training period and analyzed to&#xD;
      explain the quantitative findings in depth, within the context of everyday life. Study aim 1&#xD;
      is to evaluate the feasibility of using EMA to measure adherence and of applying the MI&#xD;
      approach. Quantitative data will include four indicators of adherence and accuracy. Interview&#xD;
      responses will be used as qualitative data to elucidate participants' acceptance of the MI&#xD;
      approach and feedback on using the EMA app. Study aim 2 is to explore to what extent UE&#xD;
      outcomes change after the 4-week self-initiated home-based rehabilitation program. Outcomes&#xD;
      will include UE use in real-world environments and self-perceived changes in UE use.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Day 4 visit, Day 37-39 visit, Day 65-67 visit</time_frame>
    <description>FMA is a valid and reliable UE assessment to measure motor impairment in stroke. It consists of 33 items reflecting typical shoulder and hand motions in and out of synergy patterns characteristic of motor recovery after stroke. It is the gold standard performance-based assessment in UE stroke rehabilitation with an established minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 4.25-7.25 points for chronic stroke patients.</description>

    <measure>Change scores in Motor Activity Log from baseline to discharge and baseline to follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 4 visit, Day 37-39 visit, Day 65-67 visit</time_frame>
    <description>Motor Activity Log (MAL) is a valid and reliable self-report questionnaire for individuals in the subacute and chronic phase after stroke. Originally created as the primary outcome for Constraint Induced Movement Therapy, the MAL captures spontaneous use of the affected UE in daily life. It consists of 28 items reflecting basic and instrumental activities of daily living items. Scoring is based on an ordinal scale ranging from 1-5, and final scores are determined by calculating the mean of all item scores. This study will use the amount of use subscale for this study.</description>

    <measure>Change scores in Canadian Occupational Performance Measure from baseline to discharge and baseline to follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 4 visit, Day 37-39 visit, Day 65-67 visit</time_frame>
    <description>The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) is a valid and reliable individualized self-report measure that quantifies a participants' perception of everyday performance. Participants rate their change in their performance and satisfaction on a scale of 1 (unable to perform/not satisfied) to 10 (able to perform, extremely satisfied). A change of two or more points is considered clinically significant.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 4 visit, Day 37-39 visit, Day 65-67 visit</time_frame>
    <description>Wrist worn accelerometers can be used to provide objective, valid, and reliable data on general UE motion in home settings. As a secondary outcome for adherence, we will collect bilateral UE accelerometry data continuously for 24 hours at all timepoints to determine if there are any changes in UE motion of the affected side in relation to the unaffected side before and after the intervention. Commercially available Actigraph GT9X Link wrist sensors will be used to collect bilateral UE motion at baseline, discharge, and follow up.</description>

Participants will receive daily communication through the Expiwell app to answer survey questions related to adherence, and safety/adverse events. Participants will also complete weekly check-ins with their research therapist over Zoom to answer questions about difficulties related to UE training activities, refinement of training goals, and to receive feedback on their training performance. Each weekly check-in will be approximately 45 minutes.</description>
