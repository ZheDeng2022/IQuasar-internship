  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the improvement in signs of photoaging and subject&#xD;
      satisfaction after combination, global facial and/or neck treatment with IncobotulinumA&#xD;
      (Xeomin), HA (Belotero) and/or calcium hydroxyapatite (Radiesse+, Radiesse Classic). All&#xD;
      products will be used on-label FDA-cleared indications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Facial and neck aging is multifactorial, resulting from changes in anatomical aspects&#xD;
      combined with changes in the skin integrity. The 5 key signs of photoaging will be evaluated&#xD;
      both objectively and subjectively including: fine lines and wrinkles, enlarged pores, sagging&#xD;
      skin, pigmentation and redness/flushing. These aspects of the aging face are often bothersome&#xD;
      to patients who seek aesthetic treatments for correction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injectables, including IncobutolinumtoxinA, hyaluronic acid (HA), and calcium hydroxyapatite,&#xD;
      have grown in popularity over the past decade due to their safety profiles, favorable&#xD;
      results, and longevity. IncobutolinumtoxinA allows for correction of rhytides, while HA and&#xD;
      calcium hydroxyapatite allow for lifting, contouring, and overall re-volumization. Further,&#xD;
      calcium hydroxyapatite effectively restores volume and can improve skin texture through its&#xD;
      biostimulatory effects, which have been well studied in the literature. Through inducing&#xD;
      collagen formation in the skin, calcium hydroxyapatite can also improve skin quality and&#xD;
      thickness. In contrast to volumization effects, the overall improvement in skin quality has&#xD;
      not been as well studied. Further, it has been observed by patients and physicians that&#xD;
      global treatment with toxins and fillers can produce a better result in skin texture than&#xD;
      each agent on its own.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist of one treatment visit for global facial treatment using toxin and&#xD;
      fillers (Xeomin, Radiesse+, Radiesse Classic, Belotero Balance) to enhance signs of facial&#xD;
      photoaging and appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical investigation is a prospective study consisting of a screening/treatment visit&#xD;
      and 3 follow-up visits. A total of 20 patients will be recruited. Following informed consent&#xD;
      and screening, each eligible subject will be photographed with the Canfield Visia system.&#xD;
      They will be treated at Baseline Visit (Day 0) with Xeomin, Belotero Balance, Radiesse+,&#xD;
      and/or Radiesse Classic. Determination of which facial and/or neck areas to be treated will&#xD;
      be made after assessment by the investigator and discussion with the patient. All products&#xD;
      will be used on-label in their FDA-cleared manner. Post-treatment, patients will be&#xD;
      instructed to apply ice to all areas for 3-5 minutes immediately afterwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will return at post-treatment months 1 and 3 for GAIS and FACE-Q Subject&#xD;
      Satisfaction and photography with the Canfield Visia system. A blinded independent evaluator&#xD;
      will evaluate the baseline and post-treatment photographs on a 5-point scale for fine lines&#xD;
      and wrinkles, enlarged pores, redness, flushing, pigmentation, and sagging skin.&#xD;
