  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if photos taken from home can accurately let physicians&#xD;
      know the height, abdominal circumference, and wrist circumference of children, and how these&#xD;
      measurements relate to in-person measurements.&#xD;

      This study will occur in two distinct parts. Children age 2-18 who present to Mayo 16 for an&#xD;
      outpatient clinic appointment will be considered for participation in the study. Patients&#xD;
      eligible for the study will receive a portal message the day prior to their appointment&#xD;
      informing them of the option to take place in the study as well as instructions on how to&#xD;
      measure height, abdominal circumference, and wrist circumference, and how to obtain and&#xD;
      submit digital photographs. Participants can submit photographs and home measurements either&#xD;
      before or after the in clinic measurements and photographs have been obtained. Those willing&#xD;
      to participate will sign a parental consent form and a child assent form. Consent and assent&#xD;
      forms can be seen in the supplemental documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Home Participants will be given written instructions asking for 2 photographs to be&#xD;
      submitted via the patient portal and for measurements of height, abdominal circumference, and&#xD;
      wrist circumference to be obtained using a home tape measure. Detailed patient instructions&#xD;
      will be shared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional Anthropometric Measurements Participant will have a height measurement using a&#xD;
      calibrated stadiometer, a weight measurement taken on a scale, a waist circumference taken at&#xD;
      the umbilicus, and a wrist circumference will be taken while seated on the dominant wrist&#xD;
      over the Lister tubercle of the radius and over the distal ulna as described by Luordi et&#xD;
      al.[5] Participants 5 years of age and older who are 90cm and greater will have body&#xD;
      composition assessed by impedance. Bioelectrical impedance is not in any way uncomfortable&#xD;
      and does not expose the participant to any radiation. Participant measurements will be&#xD;
      recorded in the patient record and a secure excel document or in RedCap. Recruited patient&#xD;
      MRNs will be documented in a secure excel document or in RedCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital Photography Measurements The participant will be instructed to take off any thick&#xD;
      outer layers and leave on shirt and pants. Tops will be gathered to make cloth tight to body.&#xD;
      The participant will stand next to an 8 ½&quot; x 11&quot; piece of paper taped to a wall, to use as a&#xD;
      reference for linear regression calculations. The participant will have a photograph taken in&#xD;
      the &quot;Frankfurt plane&quot; with lower border of the eyes in line with the external ear canal,&#xD;
      palms facing forward and arms to the side, while taking a deep breath at the time of the&#xD;
      photograph to have optimal stretching [7]. A photograph will be taken from the side in the&#xD;
      sagittal plane with palms facing down and arms outstretched in front of the patient while&#xD;
      taking a deep breath at the time of the photograph for optimal stretching. These photos will&#xD;
      be taken by a trained member of the research team.&#xD;
