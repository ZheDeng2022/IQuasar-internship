  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rural areas have fewer, and less well trained, health care providers than non-rural areas.&#xD;
      Schools have become more involved in the delivery of mental health services and hold great&#xD;
      potential for increasing access to children and adolescents. Innovations in training and&#xD;
      service delivery are needed to improve mental health care quality and availability in rural&#xD;
      schools. Evidence-based practices (EBPs) can be incorporated into school-wide multi-tiered&#xD;
      systems that are currently used to improve school climate and safety. School-wide Positive&#xD;
      Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS), a service-delivery strategy based on the public&#xD;
      health model is one example. Investigators will use an iterative process (Rapid Prototyping)&#xD;
      to develop and evaluate the appropriateness, feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of a remote training strategy that provides resources to support use of Tier 2 EBPs&#xD;
      and effective support for care coordination practices in rural schools.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in student mental health symptoms from Baseline to Post Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 14 weeks (post intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Student Mental Health Symptoms will be measured by comparing parental scores pre-intervention and post-intervention. The Behavior Assessment System for Children-3rd edition (BASC-3) is a 138-item, 4-point, Likert-type rating scale (N=Never, S=Sometimes, O=Often, A=Almost Always) for assessing parental report of child mental health functioning, standardized for ages 2.5 to 18 years.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 14 weeks (post intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Student Academic Engagement will be measured by comparing teacher scores pre-intervention and post-intervention. This is a 20-item, four-point instrument (1 = Not At All True, 2 = Not Very True, 3 = Sort Of True, 4 = Very True) with four sub-scales. Investigators will use the average score for each of the four scales at pre- and post-participation in group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or Check-in/Check-out (CICO).</description>

    <description>The RTS will be developed during Phase 1 of this 5-year project using an iterative process (Rapid Prototyping) to develop an online training platform. Investigators will train school staff from both conditions remotely on providing a brief in-service training to teachers on recognizing warning signs of excessive anxiety, depression, and disruptive behavior problems in children. Teachers will nominate students who might need Tier 2 services. Investigators will offer protected access to asynchronous training materials to school behavioral health staff (BHS). The materials will include didactic content, audio and visual examples, as well as treatment materials and resources. The RTS will also allow synchronous training and consultation for the implementation of EBPs by BHS supported by expert consultants and school personnel to coordinate services in a child-centered approach for students already receiving other services at school.</description>

    <description>School behavioral health staff (BHS) in the CC will be trained remotely on providing a brief in-service training to teachers tasked with nominating students on recognizing warning signs of excessive anxiety, depression, and disruptive behavior problems in children. Investigators will offer protected access to asynchronous training materials such as training modules that include didactic content, audio and visual examples, as well as treatment materials and resources, all of which can be viewed at the trainee's individual pace and convenience.</description>

    <intervention_name>Coping Power Program (CPP)</intervention_name>
    <description>CPP is an evidence-based intervention designed for students with externalizing behavior disorder. CPP consists of twelve 45-minute sessions. This EBP has been found to be effective at reducing aggressive behavior, covert delinquent behavior and substance abuse among aggressive boys, with gains maintained at one-year follow-up. Growth curve analyses showed that CPP had linear effects for three years after intervention on reductions in aggressive behavior and academic behavior problems.</description>

    <description>CATS is an adaptation of Friends for Life (FRIENDS). The adapted protocol retains the core elements of evidence-based CBT for anxiety and the FRIENDS group format. Investigators implemented planned adaptations to the protocol based on collective experience. Changes were made to the language, cultural methods, number of sessions, and activities while maintaining the 5 essential components of the treatment. This resulted in a briefer (8-session) and more feasible, engaging and culturally appropriate protocol for urban under-resourced schools than the original FRIENDS.</description>

    <intervention_name>Check-in/Check-out (CI/CO)</intervention_name>
    <description>CI/CO is a targeted, Tier 2 intervention for students at risk of developing externalizing and internalizing mental health disorders. CI/CO is designed to provide immediate feedback (i.e., at the end of each class period) to students, based on the use of a daily report card. This feedback is developmentally sensitive. CI/CO implementers meet individually with students for a brief 'check-in' in the morning and a brief 'check-out' in the afternoon. Research on the use of CI/CO has shown it to be effective in reducing externalizing and internalizing problems with elementary school students. CI/CO will be offered to individual students for a three-month period of time, which is the same time-frame needed for the implementation of CPP.</description>
