  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether eye-tracking technology can be used to&#xD;
      differentiate the visual gaze patterns of experienced and novice laryngoscopists while&#xD;
      reviewing prerecorded laryngeal videos with both normal and abnormal findings and to&#xD;
      characterize any differences arising between level of training groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Novice and experienced participants will be recruited to take part in this study. Novices&#xD;
      include medical students without practical experience in otorhinolaryngology and resident&#xD;
      physicians at different stages in training. Trainees, residents and experts from fields of&#xD;
      gastroenterology and pulmonology will also be included. The experienced group will be defined&#xD;
      as consultants and speech pathologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will look at multiple areas within otolaryngology including laryngology,&#xD;
      rhinology, facial plastic surgery, head and neck oncology, and otology. Participants will&#xD;
      view prerecorded videos and/or still pictures absent of patient identifiers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two tasks each taking approximately 10 minutes. Task order will be alternated&#xD;
      between subjects with one task asking participants to view 7 still images from video&#xD;
      laryngoscopy examinations. After each image participants will rate how likely the image is to&#xD;
      represent glottic cancer and what portion of the image they deemed most important to their&#xD;
      decision. For the second task, participants will be asked to view a 5 second video of a&#xD;
      flexible laryngoscope exam, after which, they will be asked to identify the presence and side&#xD;
      of vocal fold paralysis as well as note the location they deemed most important to their&#xD;
      decision.&#xD;

    <description>Eye tracking will be performed using Tobii Pro eye tracking technology sensor (Tobii Pro Fusion, Stockholm, Sweden), providing binocular eye tracking up to 250 Hz. The sensor, positioned on the inferior aspect of the computer monitor, reflects infrared (IR) light beams off of each cornea and are subsequently captured.</description>
