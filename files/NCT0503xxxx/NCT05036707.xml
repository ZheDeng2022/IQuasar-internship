    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each year, the number of cases of tick-borne diseases increases. The deer tick (Ixodes&#xD;
      scapularis) is the vector of at least 7 pathogens that cause human diseases, including Lyme&#xD;
      disease. Researchers want to learn more to help them develop vaccines against ticks in the&#xD;
      future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn how people s bodies, particularly the skin, respond to tick bites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults aged 18 years and older who have no known history of a tick-borne disease or&#xD;
      tick bite exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 2 skin punch biopsies of healthy skin. For this, a sharp instrument&#xD;
      will be used to remove a round plug of skin about the size of a pencil eraser. Participants&#xD;
      will then have 10 clean laboratory-bred ticks placed at 2 different sites on their skin (20&#xD;
      ticks total). The ticks will be removed from the first site 1 day after placement and from&#xD;
      the second site 4 days after placement. Participants will complete symptom diary cards. They&#xD;
      will answer questions about itching at the tick feeding sites. They will give blood samples.&#xD;
      Photos will be taken of the tick feeding sites. Skin punch biopsies will be collected at the&#xD;
      sites of the tick bites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will repeat the tick feeding procedures 2 times, each 4-6 weeks apart. They will&#xD;
      have telephone follow-up visits after each procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the final tick removal, participants will have follow-up visits in 4-6 weeks and again&#xD;
      in 3 months. They will give blood samples and discuss how they are feeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last about 7 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tick-borne diseases (TBDs) are a serious public health problem in the US. Immune responses to&#xD;
      multiple tick bites or multiple tick exposures can induce tick-resistance (manifested by&#xD;
      reduced numbers and body weights of engorged ticks or tick death in subsequent infestations)&#xD;
      in animal models and consequently protection against Borrelia burgdorferi transmission.&#xD;
      Similar findings are seen in humans, but little is known about the nature of the protective&#xD;
      immune response. Here we propose to combine our expertise to study the response to tick bites&#xD;
      in a well standardized clinical setting to identify critical aspects of the human innate and&#xD;
      adaptive immune responses in skin and blood following exposure to uninfected Ixodes&#xD;
      scapularis ticks; and monitor the acquisition of a tick-associated skin immunity, including&#xD;
      itch. This research could lead to the identification of tick salivary proteins that are&#xD;
      targets of host immunity and might serve as targets for an anti-tick vaccine. With the&#xD;
      current rise of tick-borne diseases in the United States and around the world, we hope the&#xD;
      results of this study will contribute to future vaccine design and clinical development&#xD;
      strategies for tick-borne diseases.&#xD;
