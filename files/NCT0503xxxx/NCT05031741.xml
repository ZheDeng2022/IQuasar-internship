  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will attend a series of community outreach events that provide/demonstrate&#xD;
      telemedicine and the Children's Mercy Mobile Unit which is equipped to provide direct patient&#xD;
      care. Investigators will engage up to 12 teen peer leaders to encourage healthcare-seeking&#xD;
      behaviors and mobilize their social networks to attend outreach events. At all events, the&#xD;
      mobile unit will be available for teens to (a) demonstrate the mobile unit and telehealth&#xD;
      experience; (b) learn about Sexual and Reproductive Health/Mental Health (SRH/MH) and local&#xD;
      care resources; (c) register for future telemedicine care; (d) acquire free over-the-counter&#xD;
      emergency contraception, condoms, and pregnancy tests.&#xD;

      AccessKCTeen is a pilot clinical outreach program that uses Children Mercy's Mobile Unit and&#xD;
      Telemedicine to demonstrate and increase access to SRH and MH. AccessKCTeen intends to focus&#xD;
      on these central activities:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Education based on a peer-leader model: In collaboration with community-based partners,&#xD;
           investigators will identify and train approximately 12 peer leaders in disseminating&#xD;
           information and resources for MH/SRH to their social networks. Peer leaders may&#xD;
           disseminate information in the form of sharing curated online resources or mobilizing&#xD;
           friends to attend live educational events. Peer leaders will also help connect their&#xD;
           friends to resources by spreading information and encouraging friends to attend CM&#xD;
           mobile unit demonstrations. Investigators will use text messaging to engage peers in&#xD;
           these educational events and share general health resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mobile Unit and Telemedicine Demonstration Events: The mobile unit will be present at&#xD;
           community events to demonstrate how in-person care could work on the unit as well as how&#xD;
           telemedicine works. Investigators will answer questions and help adolescents get&#xD;
           registered for telemedicine.&#xD;

Teens with a telemedicine card will get education exposure to telemedicine with a video and an ipad that demonstrates a pretend telehealth visit. Teens with an In-person mobile unit card will have the opportunity to learn how a health visit can be done on the unit with a health care provider.</intervention_model_description>
