    <textblock>
      the aim of the study is to approve the hypothesis that dexmedetomidine can protect against&#xD;
      glycocalyx degradation induced by hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury and hence can reduce&#xD;
      the subsequent complications as early allograft dysfunction, other organ dysfunction and&#xD;
      hemodynamic instability&#xD;

      The endothelial glycocalyx (EGCX) is a carbohydrate conjugate. It forms the vascular&#xD;
      endothelial surface layer and is an important mediator of vascular permeability, coagulation,&#xD;
      and inflammation. Inflammation, ischemia reperfusion, diabetes, and hypervolemia can cause&#xD;
      EGCX damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the EGCX is damaged by different mechanisms, glycocalyx-shedding products can be&#xD;
      measured in the plasma. Syndecan-1 and heparan sulfate are two of components of the&#xD;
      endothelial glycocalyx that have increased plasma concentrations after glycocalyx injury. The&#xD;
      amount of glycocalyx-shedding correlates with the severity of the underlying pathological&#xD;
      condition as different studies have shown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EGCX is an important target in the pathophysiological process of ischemia-reperfusin&#xD;
      injury (IRI). Its destruction appears to play a central pathophysiological role in the&#xD;
      development of IRI in conditions like shock, myocardial infarction, stroke, traumatic blood&#xD;
      loss and during solid organ transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      That damage to the endothelial glycocalyx significantly contributes to the development of IRI&#xD;
      as recent studies have suggested. Schiefer et al. reported significantly higher plasma levels&#xD;
      of syndecan-1 in liver graft recipients after transplantation than before transplantation,&#xD;
      indicating destruction of the endothelial glycocalyx.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In animal studies, various drugs that may protect and/or restore the endothelial glycocalyx&#xD;
      have been tested, while human trials are still lacking. Glycocalyx-protective strategies have&#xD;
      been investigated during major surgery and the results indicated that preventive measures may&#xD;
      be effective against glycocalyx destruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine is a potent and highly selective α2 adrenoreceptor agonist. It is widely used&#xD;
      for sedation in ICU and also offers a good perioperative hemodynamic stability and an&#xD;
      intraoperative anesthetic- sparing effect. So, it is used as an anesthetic adjuvant during&#xD;
      surgery. Some studies have applied it for postoperative sedation in the setting of liver&#xD;
      transplantation. Experimentally, it has a favorable effect on liver tissues in case of&#xD;
      sepsis. It is also reported to have protective effects against IRI of the heart, kidney,&#xD;
      brain, testis and recently against IRI of the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protective effects of dexmedetomidine against liver injury induced by ischemia and&#xD;
      reperfusion during adult Liver transplantation, are indicated by suppression of the serum&#xD;
      Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) levels, better scores of histopathological&#xD;
      assessment, and augmented postoperative liver function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The activation of α2 adrenoreceptors might be attributable to anti-inflammatory,&#xD;
      anti-oxidant, and other cellular protective properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protection might be also attributable to the enhancement of Nuclear factor, erythroid 2&#xD;
      like 2 (Nrf2) pathway and the suppression of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),&#xD;
      Caspase-3/Poly (ADP-Ribose) polymerase (PARP), and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/NF-κB&#xD;
      pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the clinical setting, a randomized controlled trial by Wang et al. of 44 patients&#xD;
      undergoing hepatectomy found that intraoperative treatment with dexmedetomidine resulted in&#xD;
      lower serum ALT and AST levels in the first 72 hours postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another study conducted in rats found that dexmedetomidine inhibited the decrease of EGCX&#xD;
      thickness and the increase of the blood level of syndecan-1 which induced by heat stroke,&#xD;
      which suggests that dexmedetomidine may have a protective action for EGCX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the investigators knowledge and till 2021, no previous human studies had discussed the&#xD;
      protective effect of dexmedetomidine against glycocalyx degradation induced by hepatic&#xD;
      ischemia-reperfusion injury and its impact on early allograft dysfunction in the sitting of&#xD;
      adult living donor liver transplantation.&#xD;
