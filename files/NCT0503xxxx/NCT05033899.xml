    <textblock>
      enhanced recovery after spinal surgery protocol (ERAS) versus conventional care in non&#xD;
      insulin diabetic patients. Our hypothesis is that non-insulin dependent diabetic patients who&#xD;
      will undergo lumbar decompression surgery following ERAS care may have higher quality of&#xD;
      recovery after surgery, lower postoperative pain scores, decreased opioid consumption,&#xD;
      reduced Length of stay and reduce perioperative stress compared to conventional general&#xD;
      anaesthesia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      72 patients of American Society of Anaesthesiology (ASA) physical status II or III, of both&#xD;
      sexes, aged (30-65) years admitted to department of neurosurgery, Alexandria Main University&#xD;
      Hospital and scheduled for elective lumbar decompression surgeries under the effect of&#xD;
      general anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be randomized 1:1 using a sealed envelope method to receive their&#xD;
      perioperative care under our ERAS protocol versus conventional care. The envelope will be&#xD;
      opened by an observer not involved in the study. Patients will be divided into two equal&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group (E): ERAS group: 36 non-insulin dependent diabetic patients will undergo lumbar&#xD;
      decompression surgery following ERAS protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group (C): Conventional group: 36 non-insulin dependent diabetic patients will undergo lumbar&#xD;
      decompression surgery under conventional perioperative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During preoperative visit, evaluation of patients will be carried out through proper history&#xD;
      taking, clinical examination and routine laboratory investigations including complete blood&#xD;
      picture, coagulation profile, blood urea, serum creatinine, serum electrolytes, fasting blood&#xD;
      glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin (HBA1C), liver function tests and any other investigation&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-anaesthetic preparation and premedication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every patient will be informed about the ERAS protocol and the procedure of US guided erector&#xD;
      spinae plane block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed written consent, from all individual participants who will be included in this study&#xD;
      or their legal representatives will be taken during preoperative visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient should be trained during preoperative visit on a visual analogue scale (VAS),&#xD;
      with 0 corresponding to no pain and 10 to the worst pain imaginable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thrombotic prophylaxis (enoxaparin 40 mg) will be started 12 hours before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral hypoglycemic control drugs will be discontinued after the last meal. In ERAS group,&#xD;
      patients will receive solid foods until 6 hours before surgery and clear fluids until 4 hours&#xD;
      prior. A 400 ml of clear carbohydrate-rich beverage (12.5g/100ml) will be supplied before the&#xD;
      day of surgery, to be consumed 4 hours before the scheduled time of surgery, while in non-&#xD;
      ERAS group, patients will fast for 8 hours.(25) In both groups, Antibiotic prophylaxis&#xD;
      (ceftriaxone 2 g intravenously) will be given 1 hour before surgical incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In ERAS group, Oral pre-emptive analgesia will be provided in the holding area on the day of&#xD;
      surgery, and will include acetaminophen (1000 mg), gabapentin (300 mg), provided there is no&#xD;
      contraindications, while in non- ERAS group, no analgesia will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finger stick glucose monitoring will be applied every 2 hours and rapid acting subcutaneous&#xD;
      insulin will be given if blood glucose is &gt; 180 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On arrival to operative theatre, before the induction of anaesthesia, standard monitoring&#xD;
      will be established using multichannel monitor (Carescape Monitor B650, General electric (GE)&#xD;
      Healthcare Finland) to monitor the following in both groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrocardiogram (ECG) for heart rate and rhythm. (Beats/min). Non-invasive measurement of&#xD;
      arterial blood pressure. (Mean blood pressure in mmHg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulse oxygen saturation. (SpO2%). End tidal carbon dioxide ( CO2) tension (in mmHg). Entropy&#xD;
      Neuromuscular transmission (TOF; transmission with four stimuli) Nasopharyngeal core&#xD;
      temperature In ERAS group, the non-invasive cardiac output monitoring device (ICON, Osypka&#xD;
      Medical, Berlin, Germany) will be attached to the patient by four electrodes. Two electrodes&#xD;
      will be on the right side of the neck, the two other electrodes on the left side of the chest&#xD;
      opposite to the xiphoid process at the mid axillary line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After preoxygenation for 3 minutes, anaesthesia will be induced in both groups with propofol&#xD;
      0.5-2mg/kg until loss of verbal response, fentanyl 2µg/kg and atracurium 0.5 mg/kg&#xD;
      intravenously. Anaesthesia will be maintained by isoflurane with 50% oxygen in air (1.2-1.5&#xD;
      %) to maintain entropy between 40-60. Mechanical ventilation will be performed with a&#xD;
      constant tidal volume of 8 ml/ kg and a respiratory rate of 10 to 12 cycles/min to maintain&#xD;
      the end-tidal carbon dioxide tension between 35 and 40 mmHg and an oxygen saturation of ≥ 98&#xD;
      per cent with 50 percent oxygen in air. Incremental doses of atracurium will be given&#xD;
      according to nerve stimulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, signs of insufficient analgesia (eg, tachycardia over 20% of the preoperative&#xD;
      value occur during anaesthesia) or somatic response (eg, movement ,tearing ,or sweating),&#xD;
      will be treated with additional boluses of fentanyl 0.5 mcg/kg intraoperatively as needed.&#xD;
      Strategies to prevent hypothermia include the use of warmed infusion liquids, and forced&#xD;
      air-warming blankets will be done to avoid intraoperative hypothermia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In ERAS group, dual antiemetic prophylactic therapy (metoclopramide 10 mg iv. and&#xD;
      dexamethasone 8mg iv) will be administered intravenously immediately after induction. Also,&#xD;
      intravenous infusion of tranexamic acid 10 mg/kg(27) will be given in this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In ERAS group, after turning the patient into prone position, US guided erector spinae plane&#xD;
      (ESP) block will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups: Intraoperative blood glucose level will be maintained intraoperatively&#xD;
      between 140 and 180 mg/dl. If a patient has a blood glucose level greater than or equal to&#xD;
      180, an IV insulin drip will be initiated. Starting dose of insulin drip (units/hour) can be&#xD;
      calculated with blood glucose/100 and titrated according to the following regimen by checking&#xD;
      the blood glucose level every hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the surgery, patient will be turned to supine position then anaesthesia will be&#xD;
      discontinued and 100% oxygen will be administered then the oral secretions will be aspirated.&#xD;
      The residual neuromuscular relaxation will be reversed using neostigmine 40 ug/kg and&#xD;
      atropine 20 ug/kg slowly by the intravenous route. Extubation will be performed awake after&#xD;
      the return of protective airway reflexes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon admission to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), all patients will be observed&#xD;
      continuously for at least 30 min by observers blinded to study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the procedures will be performed by the same three surgeons, all with a clinical&#xD;
      experience of more than 5 years using the same surgical technique for each type of surgery.&#xD;
      Due to the requirement for active patient participation, it will not possible to perform the&#xD;
      study with blinded participants and care providers. Only those who will collect and assess&#xD;
      the postoperative outcomes in PACU and the ward will be blinded to the patient group&#xD;
      assignment and to the nature of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In ERAS group, immediate postoperative management will include cessation of intravenous fluid&#xD;
      administration, oral intake, and mobilization within 2 hours of PACU arrival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In ERAS group, target postoperative glycemic range will be between 140 and 180mg/dl. The&#xD;
      insulin infusion will be continued postoperatively until oral intake will be established,&#xD;
      after which the preoperative diabetes treatment will be resumed. The first dose of the oral&#xD;
      hypoglycemic drugs will be given 30-60 min before disconnecting the infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, intravenous paracetamol 1 g/6 hours (Perfalgan® 100 ml vial The Union of&#xD;
      applied scientific pharmacology (UPSA) France) and intravenous ketorolac loading 30 mg then&#xD;
      15mg/8 hours regularly will be given for postoperative pain relief. Nalbuphine 0.15 mg/kg IV&#xD;
      will be given as postoperative rescue analgesia if VAS was ≥ 4. The incidence of&#xD;
      postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) will be assessed by a nurse for the first 24 hrs and&#xD;
      only 2 possible answers will be accepted (yes or no).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volume status will be assessed by the blood pressure, heart rate, urine output and mental&#xD;
      status of patients. Patients will be discharged from the PACU according to modified Aldrete&#xD;
      score (if the score is ≥ 9, the patient can be discharged).&#xD;
