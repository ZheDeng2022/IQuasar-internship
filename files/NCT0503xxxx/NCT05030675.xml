  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is to find out the best dose, possible benefits and/or side effects of&#xD;
      fostamatinib in treating patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes or chronic&#xD;
      myelomonocytic leukemia who have failed therapy with hypomethylating agents. Fostamatinib may&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of different doses of fostamatinib in patients with&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) as the measure of&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), and laboratory abnormalities on fostamatinib&#xD;
      treatment and frequency of discontinuation or interruptions of fostamatinib due to&#xD;
      fostamatinib related AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess overall survival (OS), duration of response, relapse-free survival (RFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess overall response (OR) rate to different dose schedules of fostamatinib in&#xD;
      patients with MDS and CMML following International Working Group (IWG) 2006 response&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Hematological response at the end of 2 cycles for each dose level. IV. Frequency of dose&#xD;
      escalation of fostamatinib to a dose greater than 100 mg twice daily (BID).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Frequency of platelet transfusion independence. VI. Frequency of red blood cell (RBC)&#xD;
      transfusion independence for &gt; 8 weeks. VII. Endpoints related to correlative studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive fostamatinib orally (PO) BID on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days&#xD;
      for up to 6 cycles (week 24) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 6 months&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
