  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label single-arm, exploratory, two-stage design trial, aiming to&#xD;
      investigate safety and efficacy of AK105 with anlotinib and radiotherapy adjuvant therapy in&#xD;
      MGMT unmethylated newly diagnosed glioblastoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. Treatment&#xD;
      usually involves surgery, after which chemotherapy and radiation therapy are used. The&#xD;
      Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States (CBTRUS) Statistical Report primary brain&#xD;
      and other central nervous system tumors diagnosed in the United States in 2012-2016,&#xD;
      glioblastoma accounted for 48.3% of primary malignant brain tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Stupp protocol has become standard of care for the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM,&#xD;
      however, some MGMT unmethylated glioblastomas are still resistant to temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunotherapy is being studied as treatment for the cancer, AK105 is a humanized monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody that specially binds to PD-1. Anlotinib hydrochloride is a multi-target receptor&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Based on the mechanism study, tumor vascular abnormalities promote&#xD;
      tissue hypoxia and increase lactic acid, thereby activating immunosuppression and inhibiting&#xD;
      T cell function. Anti-angiogenic drugs enhance the infiltration of effector immune cells by&#xD;
      inducing normalization of blood vessels and reducing immunosuppression.&#xD;
