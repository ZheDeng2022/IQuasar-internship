      Objective:The comparison between total laparoscopic colectomy with intracorporeal anastomosis&#xD;
      by overlap method and laparoscopic-assisted colectomy with extracorporeal anastomosis for&#xD;
      colon cancer surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Condition or disease：Left colon cancer Intervention/treatment： Procedure:Intracorporeal left&#xD;
      colectomy Overlap anastomosis Procedure: Extracorporeal left colectomy convention anastomosis&#xD;

      This a simple randomized, single-center, single-blind, randomized controlled trial study.The&#xD;
      patients were randomly divided into experimental groups and control groups by computer.The&#xD;
      perioperative recovery data, complications and oncology index of total laparoscopic colectomy&#xD;
      with intracorporeal anastomosis and laparoscopic-assisted colectomy with extracorporeal&#xD;
      anastomosis would be compared.&#xD;

    <description>After the corresponding colon and blood vessels were dissociated and treated, the carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum was removed. The appropriate length of the incision was cut at the corresponding position of the abdomen, and the incision protector was placed. The tumor was lifted together with the free intestinal canal to the outside of the abdomen. The intestinal canals at the quasi-dismembered sites on both sides of the tumor were nuded, and the colon-colon functional end-to-end anastomosis was performed.</description>
