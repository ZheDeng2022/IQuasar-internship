      The Managing Hypertension Among People Living with HIV: An InTegrated Model (MAP-IT) a&#xD;
      stepped wedge, cluster-randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of practice&#xD;
      facilitation (PF) on the integration of a Task-Shifting Strategy for hypertension (HTN)&#xD;
      control (TASSH) into HIV care for management of HTN in people living with HIV (PLWH). The&#xD;
      study will recruit 960 PLWH across 30 primary health centers (PHCs) in Akwa Ibom State (32&#xD;
      patients/PHC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People Living with HIV (PLWH) are at increased risk for non-communicable diseases (NCDs)&#xD;
      including cardiovascular diseases (CVD) with hypertension (HTN) the most common. Integrating&#xD;
      NCD management into HIV chronic care services may be a cost-effective strategy to mitigate&#xD;
      the rising burden of NCDs in PLWH. The goal of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      practice facilitation in the integration of a task-shifting strategy for hypertension control&#xD;
      into HIV care service delivered in primary health centers in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will occur in two phases: 1) The first phase is a UG3 Planning Phase during which&#xD;
      investigators will use the iPARiHS implementation science framework to explore factors and&#xD;
      support systems required for successful implementation and integration of TASSH into existing&#xD;
      HIV chronic care platform and development of a context-specific practice facilitation&#xD;
      strategy. 2) The second phase, which is the focus of this record, is a UH3 Implementation&#xD;
      Phase during which we will use a stepped-wedge, cluster RCT, guided by the RE-AIM&#xD;
      implementation science framework, to evaluate the effect of practice facilitation strategy on&#xD;
      the level of adoption of TASSH, hypertension control, and level of sustainment of TASSH in&#xD;
      management of hypertension among 960 patients enrolled in HIV treatment services across 30&#xD;
      PHCs.&#xD;

    <description>Components of the PF strategy include: (a) establishment of a steering committee of key stakeholders (ministry of health, state primary care agency, AIDS control agency, patient advocates) to provide leadership and guide integration of TASSH into HIV care platform; (b) training of the HIV nurses on TASSH protocol; and (c) training of practice facilitators, who will serve as coaches, provide support, and performance feedback to the PHC nurses on TASSH implementation.</description>

    <description>HIV nurses based at Group B facilities will be trained on the 5As counseling approach strategy (Ask, Assess, Advise, Assist, and Arrange) and referral for the participants to the health center. However, they will not receive practice facilitation from the POFs. Participants attending PHC randomized to Group B will receive standard care offered by the facility.</description>
