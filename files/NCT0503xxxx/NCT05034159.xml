  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with Crohn's disease often suffer from sleep problems. Long term, sleep problems may&#xD;
      lead to more flares of Crohn's disease or other complications. In general, people with&#xD;
      Crohn's disease also report that sleep problems can worsen symptoms of Crohn's disease the&#xD;
      next day. In people with other medical problems, research has also shown that having sleep&#xD;
      problems can make other things worse, such as pain and inflammation. In this study, the&#xD;
      researchers want to understand the treatment of sleep problems in people with Crohn's&#xD;
      disease, and what else might improve if sleep gets better. This study will use Cognitive&#xD;
      Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) to treat insomnia symptoms. CBT-I is the recommended&#xD;
      treatment for insomnia and has been shown to improve sleep problems, pain, and inflammation&#xD;
      in other groups of people. If this study is successful, it will contribute to understanding&#xD;
      how to treat insomnia in people with Crohn's disease and how sleep impacts pain and&#xD;
      inflammation. Long term, this information will be helpful in understanding how best to take&#xD;
      care of people with Crohn's disease.&#xD;

    <description>The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) is a self-report questionnaire designed to measure severity of insomnia. The ISI is made up of 7 items on insomnia symptoms and related impairments and total scores range from 0-28. Higher scores are indicative of greater insomnia symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>From baseline assessment to 1-month post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory will be used to assess pain location, severity, and interference. Pain severity is rated from 0-10 and pain interference is rated from 0-10; higher scores indicate more severe pain and more pain interference.</description>

    <description>CBT-I has a specific protocol with behavioral targets that differ significantly from standard CBT. This approach focuses on implementing sleep restriction and stimulus control interventions which are fully deployed during the first session. Five CBT-I sessions will be delivered over the course of 8 weeks. Key recommendations include: 1) reduce time in bed; 2) get up at the same time every day; 3) do not go to bed unless sleepy; 4) do not stay in bed awake for more than 15 minutes; and 5) avoid napping. Participants are also taught relaxation strategies and cognitive therapy addresses arousal and catastrophizing.</description>
