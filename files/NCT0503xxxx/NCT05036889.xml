  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol describes randomized, multicenter, blinded (subjects), 16-week, controlled&#xD;
      study in parallel balanced groups of psoriasis (Ps) patients to evaluate the impact of&#xD;
      Mind.Px on response to biologic treatments. Patients enrolled in this study will be required&#xD;
      to have diagnosis of Ps and a total score ≥10 on the PASI and the identified study-lesion&#xD;
      must have a PGA severity ≥3 on a 5-point scale of 0 to 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients suffering from Ps will be enrolled in the study and randomized on a 1:1 basis to&#xD;
      treatment as usual (TAU) or to treatment decision utilizing Mind.Px (MND). Both groups will&#xD;
      have a dermal patch applied and analyzed. The TAU group will not be provided the results of&#xD;
      the dermal patch until the end of the last study visit. The MND group will be provided the&#xD;
      results of the dermal patch upon the completion of the analysis.&#xD;
