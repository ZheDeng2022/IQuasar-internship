      Objective: The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between kinesiophobia, pain,&#xD;
      functional status and self efficacy in patients with knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Material and Methods: The study was performed on 72 individuals diagnosed with Stage 2 and&#xD;
      Stage 3 knee osteoarthritis according to the Kellgren Lawrence classification. The Tampa&#xD;
      Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK) was used to evaluate kinesiophobia, and the Visual Analogue&#xD;
      Scale (VAS) was used to assess pain. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis&#xD;
      Index (WOMAC) was used to asses the functional status. Self efficacy was assessed using the&#xD;
      Arthritis Self Efficacy Scale (ASES).&#xD;
