  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among patients with ischemic heart disease who are referred for coronary angiography, a&#xD;
      substantial proportion have non-obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (MI) with non-obstructive coronary artery disease (MINOCA) accounts for 5-20% of&#xD;
      patients with MI and preferentially affects women. MINOCA pathogenesis is varied and may&#xD;
      include atherosclerotic plaque rupture, plaque erosion with thrombosis, vasospasm,&#xD;
      embolization, dissection or a combination of mechanisms. Other patients may have clinically&#xD;
      unrecognized myocarditis, or takotsubo syndrome masquerading as MI. Among patients referred&#xD;
      for coronary angiography for the evaluation of stable ischemic heart disease, non-obstructive&#xD;
      CAD is present in up to ~30% of men and ~60% of women. Stable ischemia with non-obstructive&#xD;
      coronary arteries (INOCA) may be due to coronary microvascular dysfunction in up to 40% of&#xD;
      these patients. Our understanding of mechanisms of MINOCA and INOCA remain incomplete.&#xD;
      Coronary inflammation has been hypothesized as a potential mechanism contributing to coronary&#xD;
      spasm in MINOCA and microvascular disease in INOCA.&#xD;

      The PericOronary INflammaTion in Non-Obstructive Coronary Artery Disease (POINT-NOCAD) study&#xD;
      is a single-center diagnostic, observational study enrolling men and women with MINOCA or&#xD;
      INOCA who are planned to undergo (or underwent) clinically indicated coronary angiography.&#xD;
      The research plan is to evaluate coronary inflammation, as measured by the perivascular&#xD;
      coronary fat attenuation index from non-invasive coronary computed tomography angiography&#xD;
      (CCTA), in patients with MINOCA and INOCA.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will undergo CCTA. CCTA performed in this study will be technically identical to CCTA that is commonly performed in clinical practice, for which safety profiles are well defined. Guidelines implemented by the National Institutes of Health Radiation Exposure Committee will be followed. Major risks of CCTA include exposure to ionizing radiation, the requirement for intravenous catheter placement and contrast media administration, and side effects of beta-blockers and nitrates that may be used for vasodilation and heart rate control to optimize CCTA image quality.</description>
