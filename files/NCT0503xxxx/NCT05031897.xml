  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II clinical trial evaluates whether a modified modality of conditioning reduces&#xD;
      treatment-related mortality (TRM) in patients who undergo a hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplant (HSCT) for a hematological malignancy. HSCT is a curative therapy for many&#xD;
      hematopoietic malignancies, however this regimen results in higher rates of TRM than other&#xD;
      forms of treatment. In recent years, less intense conditioning regimens with radiation and&#xD;
      chemotherapy prior to HSCT have been developed. Radiation therapy uses high energy sources to&#xD;
      kill cancer cells and shrink tumors while chemotherapy drugs like fludarabine and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing&#xD;
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. This study&#xD;
      evaluates whether a two-step approach with lower-intensity regimens of these treatments prior&#xD;
      to HSCT reduces the rate of TRM.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the 2 year cumulative incidence of TRM in patients undergoing reduced intensity&#xD;
      conditioning (RIC) haploidentical (HI) HSCT in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the 2 year cumulative incidence of relapse in patients undergoing RIC HI HSCT in&#xD;
      this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the consistency and pace of engraftment. III. To assess the pace of T cell and&#xD;
      B cell immune recovery. IV. To assess the incidence and severity of graft versus host disease&#xD;
      (GVHD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RADIATION-BASED COHORT: Patients receive fludarabine intravenously (IV) on days -11, -10, -9,&#xD;
      and -8, undergo total-body irradiation (TBI) twice a day (BID) on days -10 and -9, undergo&#xD;
      donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) on day -6, and receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -3 and -2.&#xD;
      Patients begin tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil IV on day -1. Patients then undergo HSCT&#xD;
      on day 0. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHEMOTHERAPY-BASED COHORT: Patients receive fludarabine IV on days -11, -10, -9, and -8 and&#xD;
      melphalan IV on days -10 and -9. Patients undergo TBI and DLI once on day -6. Patients&#xD;
      receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -3 and -2 and begin tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil&#xD;
      on day -1. Patients undergo HSCT on day 0. Treatment continues in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 2 years.&#xD;

             * Patients in this group will be treated in parallel to the radiation-based cohort or&#xD;
             the chemotherapy-based group based on what category their diagnosis falls into.&#xD;
             However, these patients will have HLA identical related donors (one-antigen cross-over&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Patients &lt; age 60 years must have a KPS of &gt;= 80% and an HCT-CI score of 5 or&#xD;

                  co-investigator not on the primary care team of the patient). This is an&#xD;
                  adjustment to account for healthy patients who meet the spirit of this protocol&#xD;
                  but have histories that result in higher than guideline HCT-CI points. An example&#xD;
                  is a patient with a solid tumor malignancy in their remote history (adds 3 points&#xD;
                  to HCT-CI total) where the treatment for the malignancy occurred years to decades&#xD;
                  before and there has been complete recovery of toxicities&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with evidence of another malignancy, exclusive of a skin cancer that requires&#xD;
