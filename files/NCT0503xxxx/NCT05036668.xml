  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase I controlled human infection model (CHIM) study is to determine if&#xD;
      oral administration of a good manufacturing practice (GMP) supply of Cryptosporidium parvum&#xD;
      oocysts (ABO809) to healthy volunteers results in a Cryptosporidium infection and diarrheal&#xD;
      illness. The study will measure fecal oocysts (parasitological endpoint) as well as diarrhea&#xD;
      and associated signs and symptoms (clinical endpoint).&#xD;

      This study is funded by the Wellcome Trust. This Phase 1 Cryptosporidium controlled human&#xD;
      infection model (CHIM) study employs a single-center, open-label design to characterize the&#xD;
      incidence of infection and associated symptoms following the administration of single doses&#xD;
      of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts (CE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers will be enrolled in cohorts of approximately 10 participants who will&#xD;
      receive ABO809 on the same day (Day 1). The study will consist of three (to a maximum of six)&#xD;
      sequential cohorts which will be dosed one after the other for a total of 30 (to a maximum of&#xD;
      approximately 60) participants. A dose level group will receive the same ABO809 dose and can&#xD;
      be comprised of multiple cohorts. The first dose level group will start with a cohort of 10&#xD;
      participants who will receive ABO809 at a dose of 1x10^4 oocysts. The study will continue to&#xD;
      enroll participants in the same dose level group if the desired incidences of infection and&#xD;
      diarrheal illness are observed, up to a total of approximately 30 participants. If the&#xD;
      desired incidences of infection and diarrheal illness are not observed, a new dose level&#xD;
      group, receiving ABO809 at a dose of 1x10^6 oocysts, may be initiated. If needed to optimize&#xD;
      the model, intermediate ABO809 doses may be evaluated.&#xD;
