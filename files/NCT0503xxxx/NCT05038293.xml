  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare how a novel, automated mouthpiece-based&#xD;
      toothbrushing device removes dental plaque compared to a manual toothbrush.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plaque is one of the main etiological factors in dental decay and the principal etiological&#xD;
      factor for periodontal diseases. Although toothbrushes have greatly evolved, dexterity is&#xD;
      still the key component to an efficient cleaning routine. The primary goal is to examine 60&#xD;
      participants to determine the efficacy of a new powered teeth cleaning device designed to&#xD;
      bypass the variability of individual dexterity compared with manual toothbrushing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-blind, randomized controlled trial. Sixty pediatric patients will be&#xD;
      recruited for the study and randomized into treatment and control groups, subdivided into&#xD;
      primary (20), mixed (20), and permanent dentition (20). Participants will be asked to abstain&#xD;
      from brushing, flossing, gum or mouthwash use for 24 hours prior to the study visit. Plaque&#xD;
      will be assessed using the Turesky Modification of the Quigley-Hein Plaque Index before and&#xD;
      after a one-time brushing with the assigned study device. A soft tissue assessment will be&#xD;
      conducted and intraoral photos taken pre- and post-brushing.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dental plaque removal efficacy using Turesky Modification of the Quigley-Hein Plaque Index</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minute after brushing</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline plaque index after brushing with the automated mouthpiece-based brushing device versus a manual toothbrush. The Turesky Modification of the Quigley-Hein Plaque Index evaluates 6 areas per tooth and gives a score from 0-5 with 0 being no plaque and 5 being the highest amount of plaque.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Soft tissue abrasion of automated mouthpiece-based brushing versus manual toothbrush</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minute after brushing</time_frame>
    <description>Determine if soft tissue abrasion differs between the automated mouthpiece-based.brushing device versus a manual toothbrush. An examination will be done and a binary scale will be used to note any areas of abrasion (yes or no)</description>
