  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, repeat-dose, multicenter trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of HZN-825 in subjects with IPF. Subjects will&#xD;
      be screened within 8 weeks prior to the Baseline (Day 1) Visit. Approximately 360 subjects&#xD;
      who meet the trial eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio on Day 1&#xD;
      to receive HZN-825 300 mg QD, HZN-825 300 mg BID or placebo for 52 weeks using the following&#xD;
      2 stratification factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prior use of approved IPF therapy (i.e., nintedanib or pirfenidone): yes or no&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. FVC % predicted at Baseline: ≥70% or &lt;70%&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The 6-minute walk test measures the distance that a participant can quickly walk on a flat, hard surface in 6 minutes. This test evaluates the global and integrated responses of all the systems involved during exercise, including the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems, systemic circulation, peripheral circulation, blood, neuromuscular units and muscle metabolism. The 6MWT will be performed according to ATS guidelines for the 6MWT.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in K-BILD (King's Brief Interstitial Lung Disease) scores to Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The King's Brief Interstitial Lung Disease Questionnaire is a self-completed health status questionnaire comprising 15 items and a 7-point Likert response scale that was developed and validated specifically for patients with IPF. The questionnaire has 3 domains: psychological, breathlessness, and activities and chest symptoms. The K-BILD domains and total score range from 0 to 100; 100 represents best health status. The minimal clinically important difference for the K-BILD total score as determined by both anchor and distribution methods is a change of 5 units.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in L-IPF (Living with IPF[Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis]) scores to Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire evaluates how living with IPF has impacted the quality of life of the participant with IPF. There are two modules, a 15-item symptom module with 3 domains (dyspnea, cough, and energy) all with a 24-hour recall and a 20-item impacts module with 1-week recall. All items in both modules have response options in a 5-point (0-4) numerical rating scale, where 0 = not at all and 4 = all the time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in LCQ (Leicester Cough Questionnaire) scores to Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The LCQ is a participant-reported questionnaire evaluating the impact of cough on quality of life. The LCQ comprises 19 items and takes 5-10 minutes to complete. Each item assesses symptoms or the impact of symptoms over the last 2 weeks on a 7-point Likert scale. Scores in 3 domains (physical, psychological, and social) are calculated as a mean for each domain (range: 1-7). A total score (range: 3 to 21) is also calculated. Higher scores indicate better quality of life.</description>
