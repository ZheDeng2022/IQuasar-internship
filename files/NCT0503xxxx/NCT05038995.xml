    <textblock>
      This study aimed to survey the growth of children who were on elimination diet due to cow&#xD;
      milk allergy in Turkey. 0-5 year aged children diagnosed with cow's milk allergy (CMA) and&#xD;
      healthy age-sex-matched children as the control group was planned for inclusion. Participants&#xD;
      will be included in the study by consecutive sampling. The anthropometry measurements&#xD;
      (height-for-age [HFA], weight-for-age [WFA], and weight-for-height [WtHt]) will be evaluated&#xD;
      according to the Z-score using the WHO ANTHRO [Z-score = Patient's value - Average value /&#xD;
      Standard Deviation (SD)]. The Z-score (SDS) in the average child by age was &quot;0&quot;.&#xD;

      0-5 year aged children diagnosed with cow's milk allergy (CMA) and healthy age-sex-matched&#xD;
      children as the control group was planned for inclusion. The study will constitute of two&#xD;
      groups; group 1; the children who received cow's milk elimination (CME) diet and group 2; the&#xD;
      healthy controls. Group 1 will constitute of children aged 0-5 years who received a CME diet&#xD;
      due to CMA (Ig E-mediated and/or non-Ig E-mediated and/or mixed type)], confirmed by an oral&#xD;
      food challenge test (OFC) and had reintroduced cow's milk for at least â‰¥ three months ago.&#xD;
      Participants will be included in the study by consecutive sampling. The anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements (height-for-age [HFA], weight-for-age [WFA], and weight-for-height [WtHt]) will&#xD;
      be evaluated according to the Z-score using the WHO ANTHRO [Z-score = Patient's value -&#xD;
      Average value / Standard Deviation (SD)]. The Z-score (SDS) in the average child by age was&#xD;
