      This study will examine the combination of pembrolizumab and olaparib in three populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: aBC patients with a germline mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cohort 2: aBC patients with a germline mutation in one of the moderate penetrance&#xD;
           homologous repair genes (ATM, BARD1, CHEK2, FANCC, PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D, SLX4, XRCC2),&#xD;
           and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cohort 3: aBC patients with a HRD as assessed by whole genome sequencing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, phase II, one-arm, three-cohort, open-label study of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in combination with olaparib in patients with advanced HER2 negative breast&#xD;
      cancer who have either&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a deleterious germline mutation in BRCA1/2 irrespective of tumor HRD status (Cohort 1),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  or a deleterious germline mutation in ATM, BARD1, CHEK2, FANCC, PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D,&#xD;
           SLX4, XRCC2 irrespective of tumor HRD status (Cohort 2),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  or a centrally confirmed high tumor HRD status, but no deleterious germline mutation in&#xD;
           BRCA1/2, ATM, BARD1, CHEK2, FANCC, PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D, SLX4, XRCC2 (Cohort 3). HRD&#xD;
           assessment needs to be performed on a tumor biopsy not more than 12 months before study&#xD;
           entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible participants according to the definition of cohorts 1-3 will receive&#xD;
      pembrolizumab i.v. 200 mg q3w in combination with olaparib tablets 300 mg twice daily (total&#xD;
      dose 600 mg per day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study medication will be withdrawn/ended in case of onset of unacceptable toxicities,&#xD;
      progression, withdrawal of consent, death, or end of study, whichever occurs first. Safety&#xD;
      follow-up is planned for 90 days after the last application of study medication. Participants&#xD;
      will be followed for survival for a maximum of 18 months after therapy start.&#xD;
