  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: Research on intuitive eating is growing, but there are few interventions&#xD;
      demonstrating the effect of learning to eat intuitively for people with disordered eating.&#xD;
      Young women in particular are at high-risk for developing disordered eating. This study aimed&#xD;
      to test the outcomes of a novel intuitive eating intervention for young women with disordered&#xD;
      eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study is the first randomized controlled trial introducing intuitive eating to&#xD;
      a sample of participants with disordered eating. Participants with current eating disorders&#xD;
      were excluded from this study. Women (n=123) ages 18-30 with high levels of disordered eating&#xD;
      participated in this study and were randomized to either a treatment (10-week web-based&#xD;
      intervention) or control group (10-week waitlist).&#xD;

    <measure>Food Intake</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Time 1) through study completion, 10 weeks (Time 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Food intake was measured by the NHANES Food Frequency Questionnaire (NHANES-FFQ), which collects data on respondents' food intake. Participants are asked to recall the frequency in which they consumed various food items over the past 3 days. Frequencies are grouped by food type (i.e., vegetables, fruits, dairy, etc.) and summed.</description>

    <description>The intervention was a novel 10-week program aimed at promoting IE through pre-recorded videos, reading material, and bi-weekly discussion sessions. The intervention introduced the following modules sequentially: Unconditional Permission to Eat, Reliance to Hunger and Fullness Cues, Body-Food Choice Congruence, Gentle Nutrition, and Joyful Movement.&#xD;
Every other week, a new module was introduced. Participants were taught the concept of this module through video and reading, then prompted to practice it over the week. On opposite weeks, the module last introduced was discussed in greater detail through video, and participants were given the opportunity to discuss amongst one another and have all questions answered by the researchers.</description>

    <description>Waitlist control group participants completed a series of questionnaires at the beginning and end of a 10-week interval, to compare changes in those who completed the intervention versus those who did not. This group was subsequently invited to participate in the intervention after their time on the wait-list.</description>
