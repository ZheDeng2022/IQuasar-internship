  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a pressing need to develop a personalized, value-based decisional tool for bladder&#xD;
      cancer patients undergoing radical cystectomy (bladder removal) and urinary diversion to help&#xD;
      them with communication with the physicians, shared decision making, and preparation for&#xD;
      disease-management and follow-up care. The proposed intervention, the Personal Patient&#xD;
      Profile - Bladder Cancer (P3-BC), will be the first intervention to address these issues.&#xD;
      Results of this pilot randomized feasibility study will provide evidence of the feasibility&#xD;
      and acceptability of the P3-BC and will guide further refinement of the tool for a larger&#xD;
      experimental trial, with potential dissemination of the program via the Internet and&#xD;
      hand-held computing devices.&#xD;

    <description>Acceptability will be assessed with the six-item Acceptability E-scale. The acceptability is defined as 80% acceptable ratings (using mean score of more than 18 on the scale). Using well-established feasibility criteria to assess: 1) monthly screening rate, 2) monthly enrollment rate, 3) proportion of eligible patients screened who are actually recruited, 4) proportion and demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who decline to participate and reasons for refusal, 5) retention/drop-out rates, and 6) duration and completion rate of study assessments. The AES uses a 5-point response scale for each item (1=not acceptable, 5=highly acceptable). Full score from 0 - 30, with higher score indicating higher overall acceptability</description>

    <measure>Control Preferences Scale (CPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Control Preferences Scale (CPS) consists of 5 statements designed to elicit patients' preferences for control over decision making. The CPS involves subjects in making a series of paired comparisons to provide their total preference order over the five statements. Six scores are possible based on the subject's two most preferred roles: active-active, active-collaborative, collaborative-active, collaborative-passive, passive-collaborative, and passive-passive. These scores are grouped as: active (active-active or active-collaborative), collaborative (collaborative-active or collaborative-passive), or passive (passive-collaborative or passive-passive).</description>

    <description>The decisional aid will be developed to enhance patients' communication about cystectomy and urinary diversions with the clinicians, patients' decisions and preparation for self-care. Program users will be able to choose from a menu to view and print: a) summaries of their responses to inquiry questionnaire about information needed, b) selected statistics about specific side effects and self-care, and c) streamed video vignettes with patient actors of mixed cancer stages, age, sex, and race talking with a clinician about their treatment outcomes and self-care. An automatically printed 2-page output to facilitate discussion will list: 1) decision role preference; 2) the 4 highest ranked information preference sheets; and 3) a summary of personal factors plus suggested discussion topics to address with the clinician. The 2-pages will be provided to the treating physician by the research coordinator before the patient's next consultation appointment.</description>
