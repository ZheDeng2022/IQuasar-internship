  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia worldwide. It carries a significant&#xD;
      health burden, conferring on sufferers a reduction in quality of life, risk of significant&#xD;
      morbidities such as stroke and heart failure, and significant mortality. At present,&#xD;
      diagnosis of AF involves referral for conventional 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recording,&#xD;
      ambulatory ECG for fixed time period recording, or insertion of implantable loop recorders&#xD;
      (ILR). These investigations are limited both by recording only at specific time points and&#xD;
      failing to explore the interaction between heart rate and day-to-day physical activity. In&#xD;
      recent years, the use of mobile health (mHealth) devices has emerged as a direct-to-consumer&#xD;
      option for monitoring parameters such as heart rate and activity levels. From a clinical&#xD;
      perspective they potentially offer a less invasive and cost-effective investigative approach,&#xD;
      with remote monitoring solution to identify and possibly predict AF. In this study, we&#xD;
      propose to recruit participants who have undergone an ablative procedure as part of a&#xD;
      randomised clinical trial (LoTO in CASA LSPAF: NCT04280042) and monitor for recurrence of AF&#xD;
      using mHealth technology by correlating with ILR data.&#xD;
