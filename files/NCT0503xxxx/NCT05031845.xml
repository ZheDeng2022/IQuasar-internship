  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of our proposed pilot study is to collect low dose CT (LDCT) findings from chest&#xD;
      evaluations of a representative sample of 120 symptomatic Caucasian and African American, and&#xD;
      Hispanic adults (45 each), stratified by presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome&#xD;
      (ARDS) and COVID-19 positivity or negative PCR screening results. These data will provide us&#xD;
      with preliminary data on the type and extent of alveolar remodeling by race and by severity&#xD;
      of recent infectious respiratory disease. Findings from our study would will help us to&#xD;
      determine if a larger multi-site research application to NHLBI or a similar funding agency&#xD;
      might be possible and provide critical preliminary data on variation in LDCT findings by&#xD;
      COVID-19 attributable respiratory health, race, and other risk factors (e.g., smoking&#xD;
      history, comorbidities, and socioeconomic status).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective data collection study of random samples of Caucasian and African&#xD;
      American, and Hispanic adults, who are symptomatic and recently tested with a nasal or&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal swab test (PCR test) and by test positivity and/or evidence of recent acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study has 2 objectives: 1) demonstrate the feasibility of using KP electronic health&#xD;
      records (EHR) and associated computerized data resources to identify and recruit&#xD;
      representative samples of Caucasian and African American, and Hispanic adults with varying&#xD;
      likelihoods of lung remodeling, and 2) identify the implementation opportunities and&#xD;
      challenges associated with recruitment for and collection of primary LDCT findings in a&#xD;
      representative sample of adults from a diverse urban population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of our study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Implement a sampling and recruitment protocol to collect representative samples of&#xD;
      Caucasian and African American, and Hispanic adults by clinical history attributable to ARDS&#xD;
      (e.g., hospitalization for ARDS, not hospitalized by positive/negative for COVID-19) and&#xD;
      presenting with symptoms typical of COVID-19 (i.e. fever, cough, shortness of breath,&#xD;
      nausea/vomiting) Aim 2: Collect LDCT findings and self-reported respiratory health at the&#xD;
      time of LDCT from this sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Link the LDCT findings to other electronic health record (EHR) data to assess face&#xD;
      validity of findings through associations with race, other patient demographics, and clinical&#xD;
      risk factors associated with self-reported respiratory health.&#xD;

    <description>The SGRQ is a disease specific quality of life assessment tool validated in both COPD and asthma 12-14. The questionnaire consists of 50 items divided into three parts measuring symptoms, activity limitation and social and emotional impact of disease.
