  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mycocardial systolic function (contractility) is an essential element of cardio-circulatory&#xD;
      physiology during major visceral surgery, in particular during liver transplantation during&#xD;
      which several factors are likely to be at the origin of a ventricular dysfunction: acute&#xD;
      hemorrhage, major volume changes, acute pulmonary arterial hypertension and&#xD;
      ischemia-reperfusion syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ventricular dysfunction is an underestimated intraoperative liver transplantation phenomenon&#xD;
      while it constitutes a risk factor for peroperative and postoperative morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      established that graft function can be compromised through the phenomena of low cardiac&#xD;
      output and hepatic congestion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, better analyzing myocardial systolic function during liver transplantation could guide&#xD;
      practitioners in the treatments to be undertaken, evaluate their effects and diagnose various&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the usual cardiac output measurement systems (transpulmonary thermodilution&#xD;
      techniques and pulse wave contour analysis) are poorly suited to liver transplantation.&#xD;
      Frequent variations in blood volume, vasomotor tone and temperature require regular&#xD;
      recalibrations and prevent a continuous and reliable estimate of cardiac output.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the choice of hemodynamic monitoring during liver transplantation performed in our&#xD;
      center is transesophageal ultrasound, a semi-invasive method with a favorable benefit-risk&#xD;
      ratio in this category of the population. However, analysis of right ventricular systolic&#xD;
      function by classical indices is difficult in transesophageal ultrasound for reasons of&#xD;
      alignment of the ultrasound shot on the right ventricular. The analysis of left ventricular&#xD;
      systolic function is complex due to the sudden variations in volume and the difficulty in&#xD;
      carrying out planimetry measurements in real time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial strain imaging has been developed in recent years and is widely validated for the&#xD;
      assessment of left ventricular contractile function. It was subsequently applied to the&#xD;
      exploration of the right ventricular. Its measurement can be performed from recordings on&#xD;
      dedicated software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the strain could make it possible to better assess myocardial systolic dysfunction in&#xD;
      liver per-transplantation from the transesophageal echographic loops recorded in current&#xD;
      practice at the different operating times. Strain measurements will be carried out a&#xD;
      posteriori from the images which are acquired in a standard way during the operation.&#xD;
