  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I trial to assess the safety and feasibility of administering&#xD;
      pre-manufactured allogeneic T cells from healthy donors expressing CD19-targeting chimeric&#xD;
      antigen receptors lacking expression of HLA class I, HLA class II molecules and endogenous&#xD;
      TCR through CRISPR-mediated genome-editing of beta-2 microglobulin, CIITA and T cell receptor&#xD;
      alpha chain, respectively. These cells are called PACE CART19 cells.&#xD;

    <description>PACE CART19 cells are allogeneic T cells transduced with a lentiviral vector to express an anti-CD19 scFv TCRz:41BB and electroporated to temporarily express the CRISPR/Cas9 RNA system resulting in beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), Class II Major Histocompatibility Complex Transactivator (CIITA) and TCR-α chain (TRAC) targeted disruption. PACE CART19 cells will be administered by IV infusion.</description>
