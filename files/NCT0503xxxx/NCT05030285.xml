      This project will pilot a tailored Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) intervention delivered&#xD;
      via telehealth videoconferencing (Tele-CBT) to reduce anxiety in people living with cognitive&#xD;
      impairment. A process evaluation will inform its feasibility and implementation in the&#xD;
      community nation-wide.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety is a pre-existing mental health issue in older persons with cognitive impairment&#xD;
      (includes people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia), with considerably high&#xD;
      prevalence (14%) as compared to older persons in the general population (3%) (Kuring et al.,&#xD;
      2018). Anxiety results in accelerated cognitive decline (Banks et al., 2014), increased&#xD;
      aggressive behaviours (Feretti et al., 2001), and even an increased risk of suicide (Seyfried&#xD;
      et al., 2011). Anxiety also negatively influences quality of life (QoL) of the individual&#xD;
      with cognitive impairment and their care partner (Poon et al., 2019), increases early&#xD;
      institutionalisation (Schnaider et al. 2002), and amplifies economic burden (Konnopka et al.,&#xD;
      2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Tele-CBT package used in this study is a modification of existing manualised&#xD;
      psychotherapeutic interventions for treatment of anxiety in people with Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      (Dissanayaka et al., 2019) and older adults with cognitive impairment (Havas et al., 2013).&#xD;
      This new package incorporates techniques tailored to reduce anxiety in people with cognitive&#xD;
      impairment, including symptom monitoring. The interventions will include various&#xD;
      psychological techniques aimed at reducing anxiety and stress. The intervention consists of 6&#xD;
      weekly psychotherapy sessions. Each therapy session lasts between 30-60 minutes, depending on&#xD;
      the participants' capacity to actively participate in session and on their cognitive&#xD;
      functioning (e.g. complex attention, executive function). Support persons will be invited and&#xD;
      instructed to actively engage in the therapy sessions as well as in between-session home&#xD;
      tasks to support the person with cognitive impairment. These techniques will be facilitated&#xD;
      via the use of non-immersive videos in telehealth videoconferencing.&#xD;
