      Researchers want to learn more about the treatments doctors choose to treat heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart failure means the heart isn't pumping as well as it should be. Heart failure can lead&#xD;
      to other serious medical conditions, and it can lead to hospitalization or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are different types of treatments available for people who have heart failure, and&#xD;
      these work in different ways. In this study, the researchers will collect information about&#xD;
      Colombian patients who have heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to identify patterns in the treatments that doctors first&#xD;
      prescribe to heart failure patients in Columbia. To do this, the researchers will review&#xD;
      information from the patients' medical records and from a drug-dispensing database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include adult patients who have been diagnosed with heart failure in Columbia&#xD;
      from June 1st, 2019 to May 31st, 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no required visits, treatments, or procedures in this study. The researchers&#xD;
      will collect information about the treatments the patients have been prescribed by their own&#xD;
      doctors.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Availability of this study's data will later be determined according to Bayer's commitment to the EFPIA/PhRMA &quot;Principles for responsible clinical trial data sharing&quot;. This pertains to scope, timepoint and process of data access. As such, Bayer commits to sharing upon request from qualified researchers patient-level clinical trial data, study-level clinical trial data, and protocols from clinical trials in patients for medicines and indications approved in the US and EU as necessary for conducting legitimate research. This applies to data on new medicines and indications that have been approved by the EU and US regulatory agencies on or after January 01, 2014. Interested researchers can use www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com to request access to anonymized patient-level data and supporting documents from clinical studies to conduct research.
