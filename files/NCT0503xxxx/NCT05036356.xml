    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to develop a mobile app-based intervention to reduce burnout&#xD;
      and improve well-being using human-centered design principles and stakeholder feedback.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies of professional burnout among physicians have highlighted urology as a&#xD;
      worrisome outlier: 39% of practicing urologists and 64% of urology residents reported high&#xD;
      levels of depersonalization and emotional exhaustion. Despite the known association of&#xD;
      burnout with adverse clinical outcomes, psychological distress, and career dissatisfaction,&#xD;
      rigorous studies of physician-focused interventions remain limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot studies of well-being mobile applications (e.g. headspace Â®) have demonstrated better&#xD;
      outcomes compared to traditionally delivered mindfulness interventions (e.g. in-person guided&#xD;
      meditation). Nevertheless, a rigorous assessment of the impact of an app-based intervention&#xD;
      on burnout is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the present study will assess the effectivity of a mobile app-based intervention&#xD;
      to reduce burnout among healthcare professionals.&#xD;

    <description>Burnout levels among study population will be screened using the single-item burnout assessment tool for health care workers (West, Dyrbye, et.al. 2012) and the Professional Fulfillment Index (Trockel, et.al. 2018) . The single-item burnout tool has 2 questions with a 7-point Likert-type, frequency response scale (0 = never, 1 = a few times a year or less, 2 = once a month or less, 3 = a few times a month, 4 = once a week, 5 = a few times a week, 6 = every day) and cutoff values of 27 and 10 points, respectively. The Professional Fulfillment Index scales the answers of the items 7 to 16 from 0 to 4 (0 = not at all, 1 = very little, 2 = moderately, 3 = a lot, 4 = extremely) with a cutoff value of 1.33 points.</description>
