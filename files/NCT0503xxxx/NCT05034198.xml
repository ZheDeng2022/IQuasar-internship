  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rural areas have fewer, and less well trained, health care providers than non-rural areas.&#xD;
      Schools have become more involved in the delivery of mental health services and hold great&#xD;
      potential for increasing access to children and adolescents. Innovations in training and&#xD;
      service delivery are needed to improve mental health care quality and availability in rural&#xD;
      schools. Evidence-based practices (EBPs) can be incorporated into school-wide multi-tiered&#xD;
      systems that are currently used to improve school climate and safety. School-wide Positive&#xD;
      Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS), a service-delivery strategy based on the public&#xD;
      health model is one example. Investigators will use an iterative process (Rapid Prototyping)&#xD;
      to develop and evaluate the appropriateness, feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of a remote training strategy that provides resources to support use of Tier 2 EBPs&#xD;
      and effective support for care coordination practices in rural schools.&#xD;

    <description>Behavioral health staff (BHS) will be asked to complete two semi-structured qualitative interviews and a set of surveys. The first interview will be about perceived barriers and facilitators on utilizing a remote training platform. The second interview will cover perceived feasibility and acceptability of the proposed training, consultation, and the implementation of evidence-based practices. The surveys will ask about the perceived acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of the remote training platform.</description>

    <description>Mental health trainers with expertise in the treatment of externalizing and internalizing behavior disorders will video-record the training modules and produce them using lecture capture technology (i.e., showing speaker and Power Point slides on a split screen). Each training module will be approximately 45 minutes long. BHS will be given a procedures manual with instructions on how to access the video-recorded training modules on-demand.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>After completing the first mini-trial, Investigators will develop manuals and procedures for the synchronous (interactive) portion of the training. The specific components of the synchronous remote training, as well as session length and frequency, will be determined by the results of preliminary studies and Aim 1 of the proposed study. Research team consultants will provide remote consultation to BHS. The synchronous consultation will be conducted using a video-conferencing platform, and will have two main components: didactics and coaching.</description>

    <intervention_name>Coping Power Program (CPP)</intervention_name>
    <description>CPP is an evidence-based intervention designed for students with externalizing behavior disorder. CPP consists of twelve 45-minute sessions. This EBP has been found to be effective at reducing aggressive behavior, covert delinquent behavior and substance abuse among aggressive boys, with gains maintained at one-year follow-up. Growth curve analyses showed that CPP had linear effects for three years after intervention on reductions in aggressive behavior and academic behavior problems.</description>

    <intervention_name>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for Anxiety Treatment in Schools (CATS)</intervention_name>
    <description>CATS is an adaptation of Friends for Life (FRIENDS). The adapted protocol retains the core elements of evidence-based CBT for anxiety and the FRIENDS group format. Investigators implemented planned adaptations to the protocol based on collective experience. Changes were made to the language, cultural methods, number of sessions, and activities while maintaining the 5 essential components of the treatment. This resulted in a briefer (8-session) and more feasible, engaging and culturally appropriate protocol for urban under-resourced schools than the original FRIENDS.</description>

    <intervention_name>Check-in/Check-out (CI/CO)</intervention_name>
    <description>CI/CO is a targeted, Tier 2 intervention for students at risk of developing externalizing and internalizing mental health disorders. CI/CO is designed to provide immediate feedback (i.e., at the end of each class period) to students, based on the use of a daily report card. This feedback is developmentally sensitive. CI/CO implementers meet individually with students for a brief 'check-in' in the morning and a brief 'check-out' in the afternoon. Research on the use of CI/CO has shown it to be effective in reducing externalizing and internalizing problems with elementary school students. CI/CO will be offered to individual students for a three-month period of time, which is the same time-frame needed for the implementation of CPP.</description>
