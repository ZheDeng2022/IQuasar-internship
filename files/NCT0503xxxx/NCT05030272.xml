    <textblock>
      The study team will conduct a Multisite Randomized Controlled Trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      advantages and disadvantages of two approaches for quitting smoking among people with serious&#xD;
      mental illness (SMI). The study will compare a novel app tailored to people with SMI, Quit on&#xD;
      the Go, to a standard of care smoking cessation intervention. We will test the effectiveness&#xD;
      of the Quit on the Go app, an intervention that has demonstrated feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability in the target population, as a tool for smoking cessation in people with SMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with SMI will be recruited across 2 sites (Duke University and Univ. at&#xD;
      Buffalo).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smoking tobacco shortens the lifespan of adults with serious mental illness by 25 years and&#xD;
      contributes to 317 billion dollar expenditures in healthcare, indirect loss of earnings and&#xD;
      disability benefits. Determining whether it is possible to deliver more effective and wider&#xD;
      reaching smoking cessation interventions to individuals with serious mental illness is a high&#xD;
      priority. Smartphone apps are a wide-reaching technology that could provide individuals with&#xD;
      serious mental illness the necessary skills for quitting. However, our research has shown&#xD;
      that apps developed for the general public have inadequate levels usability and engagement in&#xD;
      people with serious mental illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous pilot trial of a tailored smoking cessation app for people with serious mental&#xD;
      illness, Learn to Quit (NCT03069482), we identified successful recruitment and retention&#xD;
      methods for smokers with SMI, demonstrated a 4-fold increase in objectively measured&#xD;
      interactions of the novel app, obtained promising cessation rates for the experimental app&#xD;
      (12% for Learn to Quit versus 3% for NCI QuitGuide), and identified a reliable methodological&#xD;
      approach to conduct a fully-powered randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this pilot work, we plan to conduct a clinical trial to test this new model in a&#xD;
      diverse and representative sample of the SMI population. Specifically, the proposed trial&#xD;
      will test whether a tailored smoking cessation app for people with serious mental illness,&#xD;
      Learn to Quit, results in higher levels of smoking abstinence compared to a standard of care&#xD;
      intervention for this psychiatric population, Brief Advice. Both interventions will receive&#xD;
      combined nicotine replacement therapy. The second aim of this trial is to test a mechanistic&#xD;
      model of app efficacy by examining mediators of app engagement and treatment outcomes.&#xD;
      Finally, the trial will evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these interventions to inform&#xD;
      public health policy regard the use of mHealth in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a multi-site, two-arm randomized controlled trial, 450 individuals with serious mental&#xD;
      illness will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions. In the experimental condition,&#xD;
      participants will use the Learn to Quit app. In the comparator condition, participants will&#xD;
      receive Brief Advice for smoking cessation. Participants in both conditions will receive&#xD;
      combined Nicotine Replacement Therapy (standard dosing of nicotine patch plus 5 week course&#xD;
      of nicotine gums). Study duration will be 6 months, with 3 follow-up appointments at 1-month,&#xD;
      3-month, and 6-months. Our proposed methods are appropriate given our established procedures&#xD;
      during our pilot trial regard to participant assignment, delivery of interventions, data&#xD;
      collection and analysis (NCT03069482).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study meets NIDA's major programmatic priorities of using innovative&#xD;
      technologies (e.g., smartphones) and integrating behavioral and pharmacological interventions&#xD;
      to improve substance use treatment and outcomes (NOT-DA-10-019). The proposal addresses a&#xD;
      serious problem -- high smoking rates in people with SMI -- in a high priority, high cost&#xD;
      population, by delivering a novel behavioral intervention for smoking cessation in&#xD;
      &quot;real-world&quot; settings. If shown to be effective, the proposed intervention will provide a new&#xD;
      model for delivering inexpensive, widely accessible smoking cessation interventions in adults&#xD;
      with SMI.&#xD;

    <measure>CO-verified 7-day point-prevalence abstinence at 6-month follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Abstinence is determined by a self-report of not smoking any tobacco product for greater than or equal to 7 days prior to Week 24 and biochemically verified by an expired carbon monoxide breath test reading of &lt; 5 ppm at Week 24. If the participant does not meet both criteria, they are not considered abstinent.&#xD;
As per convention, participants are assumed to be smoking if they report smoking at the time-point, cannot be reached to provide data at the time-point, fail to provide a breath sample at the time-point, or provide a breath sample at the time-point that is greater than or equal to 5 ppm.</description>
