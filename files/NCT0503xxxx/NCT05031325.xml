  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The problem of delayed bleeding after endoscopic resection is becoming important due to the&#xD;
      growing number of indications for anti-aggregation or anticoagulant treatment for&#xD;
      cardiovascular reasons in the aging populations. Previous studies have shown that in patients&#xD;
      at high risk of bleeding, the use of (PuraStat®), a simple and easily applicable solution,&#xD;
      decreases the rate of delayed bleeding by promoting wound healing. Various preventive&#xD;
      treatments, such as the prophylactic use of clips, have been tried to prevent the occurrence&#xD;
      of delayed bleeding, but to date, no treatment has clearly shown its effectiveness. In&#xD;
      addition, preventive hemostasis with clips is difficult and costly. The main objective is to&#xD;
      compare the efficacy of PuraStat® to the standard treatment in reducing delayed bleeding&#xD;
      after colorectal ESD in patients at high risk of delayed bleeding. The secondary objectives&#xD;
      are to compare the same two strategies in terms of effectiveness and side effects. The&#xD;
      primary outcome measure is the percentage of delayed bleeding at 30 days after surgery (ESD).&#xD;
