  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Fujifilm SILVAMP TB LAM (FujiLAM; Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) is a novel (not commercialized)&#xD;
      urine based point-of-care assay to diagnose TB in HIV-positive patients. A first study using&#xD;
      urine frozen samples has reported a higher sensitivity of this test over the currently&#xD;
      commercialised Alere Determine TB LAM Ag assay (AlereLAM).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to assess the performance of a new test called the Fujifilm SILVAMP TB LAM or&#xD;
      simply the Fuji-LAM test. The Fuji-LAM test is a test that can be done on urine to look for&#xD;
      specific proteins that are produced by the bacteria that causes tuberculosis. This test&#xD;
      offers an advantage over the tests that are based on phlegm because most patients can produce&#xD;
      urine for testing even when they are very sick. Additionally, this test does not require a&#xD;
      complex laboratory set up and it can therefore be used by health workers as they interact&#xD;
      with the patient. This study will also look at how the new test compares with an existing&#xD;
      test AlereLAM - that is based on similar technology. Initial laboratory-based studies&#xD;
      conducted on frozen urine samples show that the new test has better performance than the&#xD;
      existing test. This study is different from the first studies because it is being conducted&#xD;
      in real life settings rather than in a laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at the Homa Bay County Hospital in Kenya. Individuals living with&#xD;
      HIV with and without signs and symptoms of TB will be invited to take part. Individuals who&#xD;
      agree to participate will be seen by the health workers in the study and will provide samples&#xD;
      for testing using the FujiLAM test and other standard tests used to investigate individuals&#xD;
      for suspected tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators are also conducting similar studies in other African countries including&#xD;
      Uganda, Mozambique and South Africa. This will enable investigators to assess the performance&#xD;
      of the test in diverse settings.&#xD;
