  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine causes severe impairment in quality of life (QOL) both during and between attacks.&#xD;
      Migraine also increases absenteeism, reduces productivity at work as well as at home,&#xD;
      disrupts social and family relationships, also is associated with increased healthcare costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study aiming to evaluate the effectiveness of an integrated therapeutic patient&#xD;
      education and relaxation training intervention in order to decrease the burden of migraine&#xD;
      headache among adult patients attending the headache clinic in Ain Shams University&#xD;
      Hospitals.&#xD;

      - The participants will be assessed for their eligibility based on inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. After obtaining the written informed consent, the eligible participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to either an intervention or a control group. Psychiatric and personality&#xD;
      disorders will be excluded before participation using the translated form of (Structured&#xD;
      Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders) I and II&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in the intervention group will receive the education and training program in&#xD;
      addition to the routine pharmacological treatment whereas the participants in the control&#xD;
      group will receive only the routine pharmacological treatment (preventive treatment with&#xD;
      stable dose for at least 3 months and not to change the dose through the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For proper conduction of the study, three phases will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each migraine patient in the intervention and control group will be interviewed individually&#xD;
      before applying the planned program to collect socio-demographic data and clinical migraine&#xD;
      evaluation using the clinical sheet of the clinic. Then base line measures of&#xD;
      headache-related disability and migraine specific quality of life using migraine specific&#xD;
      quality of life questionnaire before any intervention. Retrospective recording of 1 month&#xD;
      past migraine attacks frequency will be recorded. This interview will take about 25-30&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  intervention group An intervention program will be implemented to the intervention group&#xD;
           only after dividing them into small homogeneous groups. The program will be conducted in&#xD;
           the clinic, it includes two parts educational and training part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The educational part will be done once in the first visit in about 30 minutes aiming to&#xD;
      increase patient knowledge about migraine reduce the impact of migraine in daily life, the&#xD;
      session will include concise messages about:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Basic migraine education.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identify Common triggers to reduce and avoid migraine attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Role of non-pharmaceutical therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Steps for getting support from family, friends and at work.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Encourage use of the headache dairy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. How to prepare migraine emergency tool kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Explanation and demonstration of progressive muscle relaxation and deep breathing&#xD;
           training (20-30min).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information and skills will be demonstrated and applied in the session through power point&#xD;
      presentation, educational brochures, video lessons and guided home-based practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information will be in a simple language, relevant to the disease process and management&#xD;
      as well as evidence-based (guidelines for controlled trial in migraine, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The practical part:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriate relaxation training Program&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relaxation training comprises deep breathing exercises and progressive muscle&#xD;
           relaxation, to perform them daily and to keep a record of them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group meeting sessions for training will be held every week for the 1st 4 weeks .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Video programs will be used as relaxation facilitators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient will try these exercises for the first time in front of the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be advised to perform them daily for 8 weeks to achieve 60 sessions and to&#xD;
           keep a record of them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up of the intervention group adherence to instructions will regularly be done weekly&#xD;
      by Telephone for the remainder of the study between educational, reinforcement and final&#xD;
      evaluation sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who will return for reinforcement sessions will receive mild compensation for&#xD;
      study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group The control group will be advised to be adherent to the prescribed&#xD;
      medications only and try not to change the treatment plan during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of both groups will be done using headache diary and migraine specific quality of&#xD;
      life questionnaires. After another 4 weeks, the two groups' participants will be reevaluated.&#xD;
      Final evaluation will be done after 3 month from base line by the researcher using the same&#xD;
      tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢Statistical Analysis /Statistical Package:-&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The data will be collected, revised, coded and entered to personal computer, Statistical&#xD;
      analysis by the appropriate statistical tests will be done using (statistical package for&#xD;
      social science) program version 20.&#xD;

    <description>By using the &quot;Migraine specific quality of life questionnaire (MSQ)&quot;: The MSQ is a 14-items measure designed to assess the effects of migraine on an individual's quality of life. There are three MSQ subscales, Emotional (MSQ-E), restrictive (MSQ-R), and preventive (MSQ-P). The MSQ is a reliable and valid questionnaire in migraine patients that can determine the functional impact of migraine.&#xD;
Evaluation of both groups will be done using &quot;MSQ questionnaire&quot; at base line and after another 4 weeks, Final evaluation will be done after 3 month from base line by the researcher using the same tool.</description>
