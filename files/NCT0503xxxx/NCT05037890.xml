  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blinded pilot study to assess the&#xD;
      effect of consuming plant sterol or plant stanol esters (3 grams/day) for 6 months on ALT&#xD;
      concentrations in subjects with elevated ALT concentrations, i.e. who are at risk to develop&#xD;
      NASH.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: As the prevalence of obesity is reaching epidemic proportions, the prevalence of&#xD;
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH),&#xD;
      increases concomitantly and becomes a major global health hazard. Successful pharmacological&#xD;
      interventions to treat or prevent NASH are not available and so far only weight loss has&#xD;
      clear benefits, but sustained weight-loss is difficult to achieve on the longer-term. We&#xD;
      recently demonstrated in mice that plant sterol and stanol ester consumption inhibited the&#xD;
      development of liver inflammation. Moreover, Javanmardi and co-workers recently observed&#xD;
      reduced plasma concentrations of Alanine Transaminase (ALT) and Aspartate Transaminase (AST)&#xD;
      after daily plant sterol consumption (1.6 g/d) for 6 weeks in a population of adult NAFLD&#xD;
      patients. In the current study, we propose to evaluate the effect of long-term consuming&#xD;
      plant sterol or plant stanol esters on ALT concentrations in subjects who are at risk to&#xD;
      develop NASH. Furthermore, we want to demonstrate the effect of plant sterol and plant stanol&#xD;
      consumption on other parameters reflecting liver health, such as cathepsin-D, liver fat and&#xD;
      liver insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To assess the effect of consuming plant sterol or plant stanol esters (3&#xD;
      grams/day) for 6 months on ALT concentrations in subjects with elevated ALT concentrations,&#xD;
      i.e. who are at risk to develop NASH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blinded pilot study with&#xD;
      a run-period of 2 weeks, an intervention period of 6 months and a wash-out period of 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 90 subjects with elevated ALT concentrations (&gt;ULN), aged 18-75 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: All subjects will start a run-in period of two weeks during which they consume&#xD;
      daily 20 grams of control margarine after which they will be randomly allocated to consume 20&#xD;
      grams control margarine or plant sterol or plant stanol enriched margarine on a daily basis&#xD;
      for a period of 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome parameter in this study is the change in&#xD;
      plasma ALT concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: During a screening visit, body weight, body height and blood pressure are&#xD;
      determined and a blood sample (5.5 mL) will be drawn. During the run-in period of two weeks,&#xD;
      subjects will receive 20g control margarine and during the intervention period of 6 months&#xD;
      they will be randomized to receive control, plant sterol ester or plant stanol ester&#xD;
      margarine. On 7 occasions a fasting blood sample will be drawn (with a total of 195 mL) and&#xD;
      at baseline and in week 26, samples for VOCs analysis will be taken, a FibroScan will be&#xD;
      performed to measure liver fat and liver stiffness, body composition will be determined and&#xD;
      retinal images will be taken. In a subgroup of 30 subjects, a two-step&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (278 mL blood sample) including a ventilated hood&#xD;
      measurement for indirect calorimetry will be performed and liver fat and liver inflammation&#xD;
      will be measured with MRS imaging at baseline and at the of intervention in week 26. All&#xD;
      subjects will be asked to fill out a food frequency questionnaire, a physical activity&#xD;
      questionnaire and a quality of life questionnaire two times and to keep a diary throughout&#xD;
      the study and body weight and blood pressure will be assessed on five occasions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venipuncture and insertion of a cannula can cause discomfort and possibly a local haematoma&#xD;
      or bruise. Indirect calorimetry might evoke claustrophobic reactions, but there are no&#xD;
      physical risks involved. MRS and MRI are modern diagnostic tools that do not imply&#xD;
      significant risks (no ionizing radiation). In principle, all measurements are routine in our&#xD;
      metabolic research unit (MRUM) and are not expected to lead to physical side effects. Total&#xD;
      time investment spread-out over the study participation will be approximately 7 hours or 34&#xD;
      hours (depending on the subgroup), excluding travel time. Plant sterol and plant stanol&#xD;
      enriched products are commercially available and we therefore do not foresee any risks&#xD;
      related to the consumption of these food products&#xD;
