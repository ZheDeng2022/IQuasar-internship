  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Limited data exist about the use of insulin degludec and insulin glargine U300 in the&#xD;
      hospitalized patients. A previous study compared the safety and efficacy of insulin degludec&#xD;
      versus insulin glargine U100 for the management of hospitalized patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. However, there is no data comparing the efficacy and safety of insulin degludec&#xD;
      versus insulin glargine U300 for the management of hospitalized patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. Accordingly, the proposed study will provide a clinically useful information on the&#xD;
      efficacy (blood glucose control) and safety (hypoglycemia) of insulin degludec versus insulin&#xD;
      glargine U300 for the management of hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if treatment with insulin degludec when compared to&#xD;
      insulin glargine U300 will result in similar blood sugar control in hospitalized patients&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Change in mean daily blood glucose concentration in hospitalized patients [ Time Frame:&#xD;
      The first 7 days of therapy ] Blood glucose will be measured before each meal, bedtime and at&#xD;
      3:00 am. Mean daily blood glucose concentration will be calculated to determine differences&#xD;
      in inpatient glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with basal bolus&#xD;
      regimen or basal plus regimen with insulin degludec or glargine U300 once daily plus insulin&#xD;
      glulisine before meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Number of basic glucose readings between 70 mg/dl and 180 mg/dl before meals in&#xD;
           hospitalized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blood glucose will be measured before each meal, bedtime and at 3:00 am, and proportion&#xD;
           of basic glucose readings between 70 mg/dl and 180 mg/dl will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Number of hypoglycemic episodes (BG &lt; 70 mg/dl and 54 mg/dl) in hospitalized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blood glucose will be measured before each meal, bedtime and 3:00 am, and number of&#xD;
           hypoglycemic episodes (&lt; 70 mg/dl and 54 mg/dl) will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Number of severe hypoglycemia (&lt; 54 mg/dl) episodes in hospitalized patients Blood&#xD;
           glucose will be measured before each meal, bedtime and at 3:00 am, and number of&#xD;
           hypoglycemia (&lt; 54 mg/dl) episodes will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Number of episodes of severe hyperglycemia (BG &gt; 240 mg/dl) in hospitalized patients&#xD;
           Blood glucose will be measured before each meal, bedtime and at 3:00 am, and number of&#xD;
           severe hyperglycemia (&gt; 240 mg/dl) episodes will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Daily dose of basal insulin, daily dose of prandial insulin, and total daily dose in&#xD;
           hospitalized patients The study team will document day and time of insulin&#xD;
           administration of study drug given once daily and prandial- rapid-acting insulin&#xD;
           (aspart) given before meals. The study team will also record dose and number of units&#xD;
           given as supplement (correction) to correct hyperglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Average blood glucose (mg/dl), percentage time in target, percentage time below target,&#xD;
           and percentage time above target in a subgroup of study participants A subgroup of&#xD;
           participants (n = 100) will be monitored using continuous glucose monitoring system&#xD;
           (CGMS) (FreeStyle Libre).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Males or females &gt;30 years admitted to the hospital for elective CABG surgery.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

           (stress hyperglycemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects treated with diet alone (no antidiabetic agents) and admission HbA1c &lt;7%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Subjects with a history of diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state,&#xD;
           or ketonuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients treated with degludec or glargine U300, or with long-acting weekly GLP1-RA&#xD;
           (weekly exenatide, dulaglutide or albiglutide).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients with history of clinically relevant hepatic disease (diagnosed liver cirrhosis&#xD;
           and portal hypertension), ongoing corticosteroid therapy (equal to a prednisone dose â‰¥5&#xD;
           mg/day), or impaired renal function (eGFR&lt; 30 ml/min), or congestive heart failure&#xD;
           (NYHA- IV).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patients with medical and surgical pancreatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Mental condition rendering the subject unable to understand the nature, scope, and&#xD;

&#xD;
      Sample size calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Noninferiority for the primary end point of glycemic control was defined as a mean blood&#xD;
      glucose difference of &lt;18 mg/dL between degludec and glargine U300. A blood glucose&#xD;
      difference of such a magnitude has been reported in other superiority trials as nonclinically&#xD;
      significant and is smaller than significant treatment effects. Assuming the true blood&#xD;
      glucose difference between the treatment groups is zero, and using one-sided, two-sample t&#xD;
      tests, we required 90 subjects for each treatment group to achieve 90% power. Accounting for&#xD;
      a 10% attrition rate, we aimed to enrol 220 subjects in total to achieve &gt;90% power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions Experimental: Degludec Study participants with type 2 diabetes undergoing&#xD;
      coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery will receive 100% of the total daily dose (TDD)&#xD;
      given as a basal bolus regimen with degludec once daily plus rapid-acting insulin glulisine&#xD;
      before meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Degludec insulin 100 Units/mL, average dose: 30-40 U/day. Insulin Glulisine, 100 Units/mL,&#xD;
      average dose: 20-40 U/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug: Degludec Degludec is a long-acting human insulin analog indicated to improve glycemic&#xD;
      control in adults with diabetes mellitus. Patients will be treated with bolus regimen given&#xD;
      half of total daily dose (TDD) as basal once daily and half as glulisine divided in three&#xD;
      equal doses before meals. Patients with poor oral intake or with medical instruction to&#xD;
      withhold oral intake (NPO) will receive the basal dose, but prandial dose will be held.&#xD;
      Insulin dose will be adjusted daily to maintain a fasting and pre-dinner BG between 100 mg/dl&#xD;
      and 180 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug: Rapid-acting insulin Rapid-acting insulin will be given in three equally divided doses&#xD;
      before each meal. To prevent hypoglycemia, if a subject is not able to eat, aspart insulin&#xD;
      dose will be held.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active Comparator: Glargine U300&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants with type 2 diabetes undergoing CABG surgery will receive 100% of the&#xD;
      total daily dose (TDD) given as basal bolus regimen with glargine U300 once daily plus&#xD;
      rapid-acting insulin glulisine before meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin glargine (U300), 300 Units/mL, average dose: 30-40 U/day. Rapid-acting insulin&#xD;
      glulisine, 100 Units/mL, average dose: 20-40 U/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug: Glargine (U300)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glargine U300 is a long-acting human insulin analog indicated to improve glycemic control in&#xD;
      adults with diabetes mellitus. Patients will be treated with bolus regimen given half of&#xD;
      total daily dose (TDD) as basal once daily and half as insulin glulisine divided in three&#xD;
      equal doses before meals. Patients with poor oral intake or with medical instruction to&#xD;
      withhold oral intake (NPO) will receive the basal dose, but prandial dose will be held.&#xD;
      Insulin dose will be adjusted daily to maintain a fasting and pre-dinner BG between 100 mg/dl&#xD;
      and 180 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug: Rapid-acting insulin glulisine Glulisine insulin will be given in three equally divided&#xD;
      doses before each meal. To prevent hypoglycemia, if a subject is not able to eat, glulisine&#xD;
      insulin dose will be held.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucose monitoring Glucose levels will be assessed by capillary point-of-care (POC) testing&#xD;
      before meals, bedtime and at 3:00 am.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subgroup of participants (n = 100) will be monitored with a professional (blinded) Abbott&#xD;
      FreeStyle Libre continuous glucose monitoring (CGM).&#xD;
