  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial targeting primary care providers will be&#xD;
      conducted to evaluate the impact of a multicomponent electronic health record (EHR)&#xD;
      intervention on hypertension management. Given the cluster trial design, randomization will&#xD;
      be conducted at the site level, and in the intervention sites, all eligible providers will&#xD;
      receive the intervention. The intervention consists of enhancing tools already available to&#xD;
      primary care providers in the EHR system, including developing and implementing provider&#xD;
      disparities dashboards, enhancing electronic decision support, and simplifying&#xD;
      self-monitoring orders and communication materials. The intervention aims to improve blood&#xD;
      pressure control and reduce health disparities in racial and ethnic minorities. Findings from&#xD;
      this trial will provide important insight into whether a multicomponent intervention&#xD;
      targeting providers and leveraging health information technology can reduce health&#xD;
      disparities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to improve existing decision support for hypertension control and&#xD;
      to reduce disparities in treatment, consistent with Advocate-specific professional guidelines&#xD;
      and quality metrics. To achieve this, a cluster randomized trial will be conducted and&#xD;
      evaluated to determine whether health IT tools targeted to providers improve blood pressure&#xD;
      control for patients with uncontrolled hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that a health IT intervention will improve systolic blood pressure&#xD;
      (primary outcome), concordance with hypertension guidelines (secondary outcome), diastolic&#xD;
      blood pressure (secondary outcome), treatment intensification (secondary outcome), and&#xD;
      post-visit patient-provider follow-up (tertiary outcome) compared with usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating clinics will be randomly assigned to one of 2 arms: (a) Arm 1: multicomponent,&#xD;
      intervention and (b) Arm 2: usual care (i.e. no intervention). Providers and in each arm will&#xD;
      receive the same intervention for up to 24 months after randomization, which will demonstrate&#xD;
      the relative effectiveness of each approach as well as its long-term impact on clinical&#xD;
      outcomes. Primary care providers in the intervention clinics will receive electronic decision&#xD;
      support tools to guide their care of eligible patients. Providers in usual care clinics will&#xD;
      receive usual care at Advocate Aurora Health (AAH). Patients will not receive any&#xD;
      intervention or outreach independent of their provider or care team. EHR data will be used to&#xD;
      implement the EHR tools, identify study subjects, track study progress, and evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of the interventions. Patients will only be included in the analysis and will not be&#xD;
      directly enrolled or contacted by investigators; we expect at least 2000 patients to be&#xD;
      included in the analysis.&#xD;

    <description>Pre-visit:&#xD;
Providers in the intervention arm will receive dashboards which will highlight racial/ethnic differences in rates of achieving blood pressure control within their patient panel. The dashboard will also provide individual-level information for patients with poorly controlled blood pressure.&#xD;
During visit:&#xD;
Providers will receive clinical decision support within relevant patients' charts that highlight the patient's under-treated blood pressure and potential impacts of social needs.&#xD;
Providers will have the opportunity to provide enhanced patient education materials, which can be automatically ordered within the clinical decision support.&#xD;
Post-visit:&#xD;
Patient-subjects' access to the online patient portal will be streamlined by the inclusion of information about the patient portal in the patients' after-visit summary. Providers will also be able to referral patients automatically to nurse BP visits.</description>
