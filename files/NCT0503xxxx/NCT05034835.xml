  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to study another alternative for the treatment of pain in people with CRPS.&#xD;
      Indeed, the TRAB / Medullary occupational therapy department of the CMRRF in Kerpape used&#xD;
      compression garments to reduce edema when it was present.In the case of CRPS of the upper&#xD;
      limbs, gloves or compression sleeves are used to decrease the edema which is sometimes&#xD;
      associated, although they are not supported for this indication. In this context, our&#xD;
      clinical experience leads us to believe that there would also be some efficacy in neuropathic&#xD;
      pain, this improvement being regularly described by patients.This study is expected to show a&#xD;
      notable reduction in neuropathic pain thanks to the wearing of a compression garment.&#xD;

    <measure>The evolution of pain through Visual Analog Scale (VAS), measured every week for 3 months in the last 24 hours and in the last 7 days</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS is a self-rated scale. It comes in the form of a 10 cm plastic ruler graduated in mm. On the face presented to the patient is a cursor which he moves along a straight line, one end of which corresponds to &quot;No pain&quot; and the other to &quot;Maximum pain imaginable&quot;. The patient should, along this line, position the cursor where the pain is best located. On the other side, there are millimeter graduations seen only by the caregiver. The position of the cursor mobilized by the patient makes it possible to read the intensity of the pain, which is measured in mm.</description>

    <description>Illustrating the different components of pain, the QDSA (French version of the Mac Gill Pain Questionnary-MPQ) essentially allows a qualitative assessment of chronic pain, in particular neuropathic pain. It is a questionnaire of 58 qualifying words divided into subclasses: sensory pain on the one hand, affective and emotional pain on the other. The patient is asked to select the adjectives corresponding to his pain and then to note them from 0 (absent) to 4 (very strong). This self-assessment scale makes it possible in clinical practice to specify the involvement of the sensory and the emotional in pain intensity.</description>
