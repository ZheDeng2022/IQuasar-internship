  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood flow restriction (BFR) exercise involves the application of a constriction device to&#xD;
      the limbs to restrict muscle blood flow during exercise. In recent years, BFR has become&#xD;
      increasingly popular due to its additive effects on low-load resistance training, often&#xD;
      promoting greater increases in muscle strength and size compared to similar resistance&#xD;
      training without BFR. However, like other exercise, it is possible that BFR exercise can&#xD;
      cause exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) that results in short-term reductions in muscle&#xD;
      function and increased muscle soreness and swelling. One major variable that may influence&#xD;
      the onset of EIMD is the restriction pressure used to restrict blood flow; however, the&#xD;
      influence of restriction pressure on resistance EIMD is unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate effects of two different restriction pressures&#xD;
      (low and high) on EIMD responses to a bout of low-load BFR resistance exercise in a sample of&#xD;
      healthy, active adults. It is hypothesised that a higher restriction pressure will result in&#xD;
      increased EIMD compared to a lower restriction pressure. To test this hypothesis,&#xD;
      participants will perform a lower-body exercise protocol with and without BFR, and several&#xD;
      markers of EIMD will be assessed before and immediately, 24, 48, and 72 hours after the&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;

      Following screening for the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study, eligible&#xD;
      participants will be fully informed of the study purposes and procedures and written consent&#xD;
      will be acquired. During this study, participants will be randomly allocated into one of two&#xD;
      experimental groups, with each group performing blood flow-restricted knee extension exercise&#xD;
      with one leg and the same exercise protocol without BFR with the contralateral leg.&#xD;
      Experimental groups will be differentiated by the tourniquet pressure used during the BFR&#xD;
      condition. Several indirect markers of EIMD will be assessed at baseline and 24, 48, and 72&#xD;
      hours after the exercise bout. Additional neuromuscular assessments will be performed&#xD;
      immediately post-exercise to provide insight into the fatiguability of the exercise protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be required to attend the laboratory on five separate occasions: one visit&#xD;
      for screening, assessment of limb occlusion pressure (i.e., the lowest pressure required to&#xD;
      occlude blood flow to the limb), and familiarisation of the exercise protocol and&#xD;
      neuromuscular assessments, one visit for completion of the exercise protocol and&#xD;
      baseline/post-exercise tests, and three follow-up visits. All participants will be asked to&#xD;
      refrain from alcohol and exercise from 24 hours prior to the exercise trial up to their final&#xD;
      visit. The consumption of any pain-relieving medications (e.g., anti-inflammatory drugs) and&#xD;
      undergoing of any muscle damage treatments (e.g., massage) will be prohibited throughout the&#xD;
      study. To minimise the effects of pre-exercise feeding on the outcome measures, visits will&#xD;
      be scheduled for the morning and participants will attend the lab following an overnight fast&#xD;
      of a minimum of 10 hours, although water may be consumed ad libitum. All post-exercise&#xD;
      measures will be collected at the same time of day Â± 1 hours.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study uses a within-between, unilateral design, in which participants will be randomly allocated into one of two experimental groups using a stratified random allocation technique. Each group will perform blood flow-restricted exercise with one leg and the same exercise protocol without BFR with the contralateral leg. Experimental groups will be differentiated by the tourniquet pressure used during the BFR condition: i) tourniquet pressure set to 40% of limb occlusion pressure or ii) tourniquet pressure set to 80% of limb occlusion pressure. Legs will be counterbalanced such that the BFR and control conditions in each study group contain an equal number of dominant and non-dominant legs. This study design allows comparison between the two experimental conditions (i.e., 40% vs. 80% limb occlusion pressure), while allowing participants to serve as their own control condition.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Given the perceptual response that occurs under different occlusion pressures, it is difficult to mask the participant to the experimental conditions. Efforts will be made to minimise detection bias by blinding the outcome assessor to the study conditions and the timepoints from which the data has been collected.</masking_description>
