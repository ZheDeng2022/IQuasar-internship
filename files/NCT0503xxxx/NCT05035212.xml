             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Adults who are ambulatory and live in the community, or in assisted living or&#xD;

             participant is primarily responsible for self-care and activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Capable of giving signed informed consent as described in the protocol, which includes&#xD;
             compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the ICD and in this&#xD;

             active suicidal ideation/behavior or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk&#xD;

             inappropriate for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participation in other studies involving study intervention within 28 days prior to&#xD;
