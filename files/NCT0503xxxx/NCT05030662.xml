      The purpose of this study is to examine whether &quot;walking stick exercises&quot; can improve lower&#xD;
      limb strength, knee range of motion, and quality of life compared with conventional care one&#xD;
      year after total knee arthroplasty&#xD;

      This is a longitudinal-experimental study. The data collection and analysis are in a&#xD;
      single-blind manner. The study will be undertaken in the Department Orthopaedics of En Chu&#xD;
      Kong hospital (approximate 500-bed regional teaching hospital). All patients who meet the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria are admitted for primary total knee arthroplasty and assigned to control&#xD;
      group or intervention group randomly. The 43 patients in the control group received routine&#xD;
      guidance of &quot; Rehabilitation and precautions for artificial knee replacement &quot;. In addition&#xD;
      to the routine guidance, the 43 patients in the intervention group received two educations of&#xD;
      &quot; Walking stick exercise &quot; on the day before surgery and before discharge, as well as a&#xD;
      follow-up call at least once a week after discharge.&#xD;

    <time_frame>for three months</time_frame>
    <description>I hope the Walking stick exercise can to improving the total knee arthroplasty quality of life of patients. I use Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). There are 5 territories analyzed in the knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS) calculator and a knee-related QOL, Scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale, with zero representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems as common in orthopedic scales and generic measures. Scores between 0 and 100 represent the percentage of the total possible score achieved. Furthermore, I will follow up to study on the day before surgery at 1, 6, and 12 weeks post-surgery.</description>
