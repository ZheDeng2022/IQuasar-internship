  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective non-randomized open-label interventional study aimed to evaluate feasibility&#xD;
      in regard to potential efficacy and safety of triamcinolone acetonide (TA) injected in the&#xD;
      suprachoroidal space (SCS) as a promising therapeutic route that provides a better&#xD;
      bioavailability, longer sustained duration of action, and thus improved patients' compliance&#xD;
      for the treatment of macular edema due to retinal vein occlusion (RVO).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Management of Macular Edema (ME) associated with Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) still poses a&#xD;
      therapeutic challenge taking into account its complicated etiopathogenesis. Despite improved&#xD;
      visual and anatomical outcomes achieved by intravitreal injections of antiangiogenics and&#xD;
      steroids, these treatments are still associated with non-responders, tachyphylaxis, rebound&#xD;
      phenomenon, high re-injection, and adverse events rates, which underscore the importance of&#xD;
      addressing new approaches to formulate treatment strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivery of therapeutic agents into the suprachoroidal space (SCS) provides a novel&#xD;
      alternative approach that has theoretical appeal, as it dominantly targets chorioretinal&#xD;
      tissues with the posterior and circumferential spread of the drug administered while&#xD;
      relatively sparing the unaffected anterior segment of the eye and the vitreous chamber, thus&#xD;
      minimizing risks associated with off-target effects, which potentiates safety. This was well&#xD;
      translated in preclinical and clinical studies through microinjector, which has been shown to&#xD;
      provide a safe, minimally invasive, and reliable method of targeting SCS. In addition,&#xD;
      sustained duration and favorable pharmacokinetics have been observed for small molecule&#xD;
      suspensions including Triamcinolone Acetonide (TA), with the potential to reduce treatment&#xD;
      burden.&#xD;
