    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, two-stage, open-label, parallel-group study designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of XmAb20717 in patients with selected advanced gynecologic&#xD;
      and genitourinary malignancies and to identify tumor types for further evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Stage 1, subjects will be enrolled into 1 of 5 tumor-specific, parallel cohorts (n = 10&#xD;
      each):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chemotherapy relapsed or refractory clear cell ovarian, endometrial, or peritoneal&#xD;
           cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immune-checkpoint-inhibitor-refractory microsatellite stable (MSS) endometrial cancer&#xD;
           (EC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previously treated recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High-risk metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within each tumor-specific cohort in Stage 1, a primary endpoint of ORR at 12 weeks, based on&#xD;
      investigator review, will be used to determine cohort expansion into Stage 2. Each Stage 1&#xD;
      cohort that achieves an ORR of ≥ 20% (at least 2 out of 10 subjects with an objective&#xD;
      response) will enroll up to an additional 20 subjects in Stage 2. Cohorts with an ORR of less&#xD;
      than 20% will discontinue enrollment. However, additional factors will be considered in&#xD;
      determining an expansion into Stage 2 (eg, enrollment rate, complete versus partial response,&#xD;
      and DOR).&#xD;
