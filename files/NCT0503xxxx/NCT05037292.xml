    <textblock>
      The PAUSE Trial is a pragmatic, randomized clinical trial for Veterans scheduled for elective&#xD;
      surgery at 3 large VA facilities (Palo Alto, Houston, and Nashville). The PAUSE Trial focuses&#xD;
      on cooperation between providers of various disciplines in order to provide better care.&#xD;
      Veterans identified as frail upon standardized will be referred to a multidisciplinary &quot;PAUSE&#xD;
      Board&quot; comprised of members from surgery, anesthesia, geriatrics, palliative care, case&#xD;
      management, rehabilitation, and nutrition. Diverse specialists will come together in a team&#xD;
      environment to discuss care options, scientific evidence, and patient goals and expectations,&#xD;
      creating individual patient recommendations. The investigators hypothesize that the PAUSE&#xD;
      Board model will improve quality and outcomes by promoting guidelines and evidence-based care&#xD;
      recommendations as well as constructive team-based discussions to align care with patient&#xD;
      goals and expectations.&#xD;

      Background: Frailty is a syndrome of reduced physiologic reserve associated with higher&#xD;
      postoperative mortality and adverse outcomes. The investigators' preliminary work shows that&#xD;
      institution-wide frailty screening and introducing a &quot;pre-surgical pause&quot; reduces 6-month&#xD;
      mortality threefold. However, a knowledge gap exists in the nature of the intervention and&#xD;
      which stakeholders should be involved in the &quot;pre-surgical pause&quot;. Multidisciplinary care&#xD;
      models for complex patients are highly effective in oncology, wound care and primary care.&#xD;
      The investigators propose a new care delivery model, i.e. PAtient-centered mUltidiSciplinary&#xD;
      care for vEterans undergoing surgery (PAUSE), where experts from diverse fields contribute to&#xD;
      surgical decision-making and optimize outcomes for high-risk Veterans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact: Veterans above 65 years-of-age are a fast-growing population with significant need&#xD;
      for high-quality surgical care. This study builds a structured multidisciplinary workflow to&#xD;
      improve clinical and quality outcomes and provides high-value care for frail and high-risk&#xD;
      Veterans that aligns with VA priorities and patient goals and expectations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation: This is the first study in the VA to implement a multidisciplinary care model for&#xD;
      surgical care. The intervention employs an innovative hybrid-1 clinical&#xD;
      effectiveness-implementation design to evaluate novel Veteran-centric outcomes of 30- and&#xD;
      180-day mortality, non-home discharge, rehospitalizations and home-time. A detailed formative&#xD;
      evaluation (FE) evaluates provider and system factors that impact PAUSE intervention uptake.&#xD;
      Further, the study has support from three national operational partners: National Surgery&#xD;
      Office, Office of Geriatrics and Extended Care, and Palliative Care and Hospice Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: The goals for this project are to: (1) test the effectiveness of the PAUSE&#xD;
      trial intervention vs usual care in improving 30- and 180-day mortality, non-home discharge,&#xD;
      rehospitalizations and home-time for patients undergoing surgical evaluation; (2) test&#xD;
      moderators of the PAUSE intervention effectiveness (treatment effect heterogeneity),&#xD;
      especially specialty, frailty severity and risk status; and (3) use a mixed-method FE to&#xD;
      understand the factors that influence fidelity, adaptation, and implementation of the PAUSE&#xD;
      intervention. The investigators hypothesize that the PAUSE intervention will decrease 30- and&#xD;
      180-day mortality, rehospitalizations, and non-home discharge and increase home-time for all&#xD;
      Veterans (Aim 1). The effect size for the outcomes will be greater for frail patients in&#xD;
      certain specialties (Aim 2). The concurrent FE will highlight key barriers/facilitators for&#xD;
      future implementation (Aim 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: The PAUSE trial is a pragmatic, stepped-wedge randomized clinical trial designed&#xD;
      to capture a cohort of 25,000 Veterans scheduled for elective surgery at 3 large tertiary&#xD;
      care VAMCs (Palo Alto, Houston and Nashville) and 7 specialty groups in each center: general,&#xD;
      vascular, orthopedics, cardio-thoracic, urology, neurosurgery and others (e.g., plastics and&#xD;
      ENT). The intervention includes standardized frailty screening and referral to a&#xD;
      &quot;multidisciplinary PAUSE Board&quot; (surgery, anesthesia, geriatrics, palliative care, case&#xD;
      management, rehabilitation and nutrition) for recommendations. Each 'step' is a randomly&#xD;
      chosen specialty transitioning from usual care to the PAUSE intervention. Outcomes include&#xD;
      30- and 180-day mortality, non-home discharge, rehospitalizations and home-time. The&#xD;
      Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research is used to guide FE and analysis of&#xD;
      factors that influence implementation. The study spans across 4-years for pre-intervention FE&#xD;
      (Y1), PAUSE intervention (Y1-3), post-intervention FE (Y3) and analysis (Y4).&#xD;
