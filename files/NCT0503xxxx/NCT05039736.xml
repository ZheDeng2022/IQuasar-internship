  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      cabozantinib and nivolumab in people with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective is to evaluate overall response rate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to evaluate progression-free survival and overall survival&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the association between c-MET, PD-1/PD-L1 (and PD-L2) expression by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry, RNA seq genomic profiling and antitumor efficacy of nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      + cabozantinib based on RECIST 1.1 To evaluate correlation between fibrosis stage by&#xD;
      histology, by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) imaging and by IGF1 scores To evaluate&#xD;
      baseline and longitudinal changes of blood and tumor markers such as TNFα, pSTAT3, and EGFR,&#xD;
      immune cell density including frequency of PD-1 + 4-1BB + CD8+ T cells, pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines, and hepatic fibrosis markers (APRI, FIB-4, hyaluronic acid, FibroTest [FibroSure],&#xD;
      nonalcoholic fatty-liver disease fibrosis score, enhanced liver fibrosis [ELF]) test as&#xD;
      biomarkers of response to therapy To evaluate candidate serum and tissue biomarkers to&#xD;
      predict response to cabozantinib (e.g. Kallikrein 5, KLK-7, MCP-1, LAP/TGF-β1, Galectin-3)&#xD;
      and nivolumab (e.g. angiogenin, Endostatin, PGI, PAI-1, Cystatin-B, CD8 T cell frequency and&#xD;
      Ki67) To evaluate the predictive value of dynamic changes in fibrosis stage (defined by a&#xD;
      minimum 2-point improvement in fibrosis grade 0-4 per MRE) and in IGF-1 blood scores&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has a corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula (QTcF) &gt; 500 ms per&#xD;
             electrocardiogram (ECG) within 28 days before first dose of study treatment&#xD;
             (https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.116.003264). Note: If a single ECG shows&#xD;
             a QTcF with an absolute value &gt; 500 ms, two additional ECGs at intervals of&#xD;
             approximately 3 minutes must be performed within 30 minutes after the initial ECG, and&#xD;
             the average of these three consecutive results for QTcF will be used to determine&#xD;
             eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is unable to swallow tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a previously identified allergy or hypersensitivity to components of the study&#xD;
