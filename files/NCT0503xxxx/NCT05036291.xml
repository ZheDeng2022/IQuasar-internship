  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter study of NB004 administered orally in&#xD;
      patients with histologically and/or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors that are metastatic for which all standard treatment options have been given and are&#xD;
      ineffective, or is no longer eligible for additional standard treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is comprised of a dose escalation phase to determine the maximum tolerated dose and&#xD;
      the RP2D and an expansion phase to further explore the safety and preliminary antitumor&#xD;
      activity of NB004.&#xD;
