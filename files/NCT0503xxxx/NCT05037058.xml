      As a collaborative project between American Heart Association, Chinese Society of Cardiology,&#xD;
      American Diabetes Association and Chinese Diabetes Society, the China Diabetes Cardiovascular&#xD;
      Initiative aims to enhance the attention and awareness of cardiovascular health care&#xD;
      professionals (HCPs) in the managements of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, to reduce&#xD;
      diabetes-related complication and minimize adverse events in patients with cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, and to reduce the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in diabetic&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
