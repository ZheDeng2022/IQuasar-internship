      Title:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-operative ultrasound guided laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy (UGLOC) as a method of&#xD;
      fertility preservation in the management of benign ovarian cysts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 10% of women in the United Kingdom (UK) will undergo surgery for the presence&#xD;
      of an ovarian mass during their lifetime. Ovarian surgery, however, is not without risks and&#xD;
      can potentially harm healthy ovarian tissue surrounding the cyst, resulting in reduced&#xD;
      reproductive potential (the ability of the ovary to produce eggs for fertilisation). Surgical&#xD;
      methods to preserve healthy ovarian tissue and improve the chances of successful pregnancy&#xD;
      post-operatively are known as Fertility Preserving Surgery (FPS). Evidence suggests that a&#xD;
      novel approach of FPS involving the removal of an ovarian cyst performed under ultrasound&#xD;
      guidance improves the differentiation between the healthy ovarian tissue and the ovarian&#xD;
      cyst. As such, the surgeon can remove the cyst alone, whilst limiting disruption to the&#xD;
      healthy surrounding ovarian tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess if surgical removal of an ovarian cyst performed under&#xD;
      ultrasound guidance improves the reproductive potential of the ovaries, when compared to&#xD;
      surgery performed without ultrasound guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients of reproductive age (18-45 years old) with ultrasound features suggestive of a&#xD;
      benign ovarian cyst requiring surgical treatment (removal of the cyst). Patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with benign ovarian cysts, deemed to be non -harmful to the patient if left untreated, of the&#xD;
      following classifications can be included in the study: dermoid, simple cyst, serous&#xD;
      cystadenoma, mucinous cystadenoma or endometrioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multicentre randomised controlled trial. Women across Imperial College London Healthcare&#xD;
      and University College London Trusts will be allocated to a surgical treatment group at&#xD;
      random: 1) laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy performed without ultrasound guidance (control&#xD;
      group) or 2) ultrasound guided laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy performed with ultrasound&#xD;
      guidance (fertility preservation surgery: intervention group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 years&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of intra-operative ultrasound has been widely implemented amongst other specialties.&#xD;
      However, within gynaecological surgery, it is not as commonly recognized, despite evidence&#xD;
      that it can be used as an adjunct to improving minimally invasive surgical techniques. This&#xD;
      is primarily due to the improved visualization of the operative field, which can assist more&#xD;
      technically difficult surgical procedures, thus minimizing intra-operative complications. The&#xD;
      application of ultrasound guidance within gynaecological procedures have included&#xD;
      predominantly ovarian cyst aspiration, in vitro fertilization and removal or insertion of&#xD;
      intra-uterine devices. Although pre-operative imaging provides procedural planning, it cannot&#xD;
      compare to the information gained from real time imaging. For example, in previous studies,&#xD;
      intra-operative ultrasound detected more myomas during myomectomy than pre-operative&#xD;
      transvaginal imaging. Furthermore, it provides the potential to assess lesion margins,&#xD;
      ensuring resection of pathology is complete with negligible damage to surrounding healthy&#xD;
      tissues. This is consistent with a recent systematic review, which also demonstrated that&#xD;
      albeit a novel technique, amongst various case series, pathology can be safely resected&#xD;
      without incurring injury to healthy reproductive tissue. Therefore, intra-operative&#xD;
      ultrasound has the potential to improve surgical accuracy, reduce complications and improve&#xD;
      patient safety. The application of intra-operative ultrasound as an adjunct to fertility&#xD;
      sparing surgery has not been widely researched, with only a few case series reporting&#xD;
      surgical outcomes on patients undergoing treatment for pre-malignant or malignant pathology.&#xD;
      The aim of this study therefore, is to determine the efficacy of this surgical technique in&#xD;
      the management of benign pathology, including the surgical resection of ovarian cysts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-operative ultrasound will prove a significant method of fertility preservation surgery,&#xD;
      as measured by a significantly reduced decrease in Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) and antral&#xD;
      follicle count (AFC) at 3 and 6 months post-operatively, when compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a multi-centre prospective cohort study carried out as a non-blinded randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial. Women will be allocated to either a control group of laparoscopic ovarian&#xD;
      cystectomy performed without ultrasound guidance, or to the experimental ultrasound guided&#xD;
      laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy (UGLOC) group. All surgeons operating and women recruited to&#xD;
      the study will be aware of which group they have been allocated to from the beginning of&#xD;
      their participation to the study. The research team aims for equal sample sizes in both&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women referred to the outpatient gynaecology clinic with a suspected ovarian cyst will be&#xD;
      asked about their clinical history and undergo a pelvic transvaginal ultrasound scan (2D and&#xD;
      3D ultrasonography) as part of routine clinical care. If an ovarian cyst is seen on&#xD;
      ultrasound, it will be assessed according to local protocols based on simple descriptors and&#xD;
      International Ovarian Tumour Analysis (IOTA) simple rules. Depending on the severity of&#xD;
      symptoms, nature of the cyst and fulfilment of the inclusion criteria and if the woman is&#xD;
      suitable for surgical management, she will then be invited to participate in the study.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from various general gynaecology clinics, as well as&#xD;
      specialist clinics including: ovarian cyst clinic, the IOTA and Rapid access clinics across&#xD;
      Imperial and University College London Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following consent of participation, the woman will be assigned to either a control or&#xD;
      experimental group. A separate research group, not directly affiliated with the project will&#xD;
      perform the randomisation process. The research group will print x &quot;control group&quot; labels and&#xD;
      x &quot;experimental group,&quot; in which each label is then sealed into an individual envelope. All&#xD;
      envelopes will be numbered and issued in sequence. During the recruitment process, once the&#xD;
      participant has given consent to participate in the trial, a member of the research team will&#xD;
      select the envelope in sequence, which will then assign the participant to a group. This will&#xD;
      prevent the person performing the randomisation from selecting another envelope if they are&#xD;
      not happy with the group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, it will not be necessary to postpone diagnostic procedures or treatment, and&#xD;
      participation will not influence normal treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same surgeons will operate on women in both the control and experimental group. This will&#xD;
      aim to exclude bias which may otherwise attribute findings to the surgeon operating. Surgery&#xD;
      will be performed at Imperial Healthcare NHS Trusts and at the University College London&#xD;
      Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust by an experienced clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will collect the following data: Participant demographics including age,&#xD;
      BMI, gravida, parity and gynaecological surgical history. Pre-operative data will include&#xD;
      findings from the diagnostic transvaginal scan and measure of ovarian reserve: AMH and AFC.&#xD;
      Intra-operative data will include transvaginal findings during surgery (in the experimental&#xD;
      group only), such as cyst location and size or any new lesions noted. Residual ovarian volume&#xD;
      post cystectomy will also be measured intraoperatively. Histology data will include the&#xD;
      histological diagnosis of the ovarian cyst and volume of normal ovarian tissue excised during&#xD;
      the cystectomy measured as per margins in mm. Outcomes following surgery including duration&#xD;
      of surgery (mins), length of hospital stay (days) and post operative complications will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operatively, participants will return to their respective hospital gynaecology clinic&#xD;
      responsible for the care and management of the ovarian cyst for follow up at 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
      During the appointment a blood test will be taken to assess ovarian reserve by measuring the&#xD;
      AMH level. The outpatient gynaecology nurse in clinic or research staff will be responsible&#xD;
      for taking the blood sample and will only require one EDTA bottle (yellow top) to be filled&#xD;
      (20-40mls). The blood samples will be processed by Imperial College Healthcare Trust&#xD;
      laboratories or University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, depending on the&#xD;
      site taken, and will be discarded as per local protocol once the AMH has been determined.&#xD;
      There are no specific storage or transfer requirements outside of normal practice. Therefore,&#xD;
      samples will be 'podded' to the labs once taken in the usual way. In addition, an ultrasound&#xD;
      will be performed during the follow up appointment by an experienced gynaecology specialist&#xD;
      trainee or Consultant to assess the AFC and preserved ovarian volume of tissue remaining. Any&#xD;
      incidental findings identified on ultrasound scan of gynaecological pathology, will be&#xD;
      managed by the responsible clinician and the participants GP will be informed by letter.&#xD;
      Follow up appointments should take approximately 20 minutes. The two blood tests and two&#xD;
      ultrasound scans carried out during the follow up process are considered standard clinical&#xD;
      practice, and therefore not considered additional investigations for the purpose of this&#xD;
      research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of participants are likely to be discharged following their 2nd clinic&#xD;
      appointment 6 months post- surgery, whereby no further involvement in the study is required.&#xD;
      If a participant becomes pregnant during the follow up period, clinic appointments will be&#xD;
      deferred to 3 and 6 months post-partum.&#xD;
