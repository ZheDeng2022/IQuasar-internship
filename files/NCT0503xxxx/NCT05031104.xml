  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study endeavored to evaluate the auxiliary effect of low-energy laser therapy (LLT) on&#xD;
      pain, muscle performance, fatigue, and functional ability in children with juvenile&#xD;
      idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Sixty patients with JIA were randomly allocated to the LLT group&#xD;
      (n = 30, received LLT in addition to the standard exercise program) or the control group (n =&#xD;
      30, received standard exercise program only). Both groups were assessed for pain intensity,&#xD;
      muscle performance, fatigue perception, and functional status.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty patients with JIA were recruited from the Physical Therapy Outpatient Clinic of College&#xD;
      of Applied Medical Sciences, Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University, and the Pediatric&#xD;
      Rheumatology Clinic, King Khalid Hospital, Al-Kharj, Saudi Arabia. The study included&#xD;
      patients who had a confirmed diagnosis of Polyarticular JIA (according to the criteria set&#xD;
      forth by the International League of Associations for Rheumatology), aged 8-16 years,&#xD;
      identified being stable cases, and did not participate in a regular exercise program (in the&#xD;
      past six months). Patients who had fixed deformities, a history of joint surgery, or whose&#xD;
      radiological investigations revealed erosive changes of bone, ankylosing, or fractures were&#xD;
      excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pain intensity: measures through the Visual Analogue Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Muscle performance: represented by the peak concentric torque of the right and left&#xD;
           quadriceps muscle and measured through an Isokinetic Dynamometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fatigue perception: tested by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Multidimensional&#xD;
           Fatigue Scale (PedsQL-MFS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Functional status: the functional status was quantified using the cross-cultural&#xD;
           validated version of the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the control and LLT group received a 40-minute exercise program, three times a&#xD;
      week, for three months in succession. Patients in the LLT group additionally underwent an&#xD;
      articular application of LLT on the knee joint, each session before exercises (eight points&#xD;
      on each knee, 30 seconds irradiation for each point, with a total irradiation dose of eight&#xD;
      minutes per session. The treatment was conducted by two experienced pediatric physical&#xD;
      therapists.&#xD;

    <description>Pain intensity was measured through the Pain Visual Analogue Scale. Each child was asked to indicate his/her perceived pain intensity (most commonly) along a horizontal line (0-10 cm), where 0 represents &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 represents &quot;worst pain&quot;.</description>

    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The extent of fatigue that patients generally perceive was assessed using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Multidimensional Fatigue Scale. Eighteen items across 3 subscales were rated on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = NEVER a problem and 4 = ALWAYS a problem). Item scores were linearly transformed on a 0-100 scale. The total score is calculated as the sum of all item scores divided by the number of rated items. Lower scores represent higher levels of fatigue perception.</description>
