  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is associated with glomerular hyperfiltration leading to renal impairment and is a&#xD;
      risk factor for the progression of kidney disease.Weight loss can reduce proteinuria and&#xD;
      improve eGFR.Intermittent fasting is safe and effective, and in addition to improving body&#xD;
      shape and weight in obese patients, it can also improve glucolipid metabolism, reduce&#xD;
      proteinuria, improve kidney function and delay the progression of kidney disease.&#xD;

      KDOQI clinical practice guideline for nutrition in chronic kidney disease (CKD) uses a&#xD;
      low-protein diet to reduce renal impairment and delay progression. The current research&#xD;
      hotspot is dietary intervention. Time-restricted feeding was used to intervene in the&#xD;
      progression of CKD. It restrict the time of eating but not the eaten calories, which have a&#xD;
      higher compliance and safety. Studies have shown that intermittent fasting in obese patients&#xD;
      with CKD is not only reduce body weight, but also improves glycolipid metabolism, reduces&#xD;
      proteinuria and delays the progression of kidney disease. Intermittent fasting is currently a&#xD;
      scientific research hotspot, and there are few international studies on the implementation of&#xD;
      intermittent fasting to delay the deterioration of renal function in obese CKD patients, and&#xD;
      lack of data on Chinese patients, which has great research potential. Based on the above&#xD;
      background, this study was conducted as an pilot clinical trial to explore the effects of&#xD;
      intermittent fasting on obese patients with CKD and to observe its effectiveness, safety and&#xD;
      compliance.&#xD;
