  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to complement Study CBYL719C2301 (SOLAR-1) and obtain more&#xD;
      comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety of alpelisib (BYL719) in combination with&#xD;
      fulvestrant compared with placebo plus fulvestrant in men or postmenopausal women with&#xD;
      HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer with a PIK3CA mutation who progressed or&#xD;
      relapsed on or after treatment with an AI plus a CDK4/6 inhibitor.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international,&#xD;
      multi-center trial. Approximately 234 men and postmenopausal women will be randomized to&#xD;
      either alpelisib plus fulvestrant or alpelisib-matching placebo plus fulvestrant.&#xD;
      Randomization will follow a 1:1 randomization ratio and be stratified by presence of lung&#xD;
      and/or liver metastases (yes vs. no) and setting at last prior CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy&#xD;
      (adjuvant vs metastatic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment with alpelisib plus fulvestrant or alpelisib-matching placebo plus&#xD;
      fulvestrant will be initiated on Cycle 1 Day 1, and will continue until disease progression&#xD;
      per RECIST v1.1 as per BIRC assessment, start of new antineoplastic therapy, death, lost to&#xD;
      follow-up, or withdrawal of consent. A cycle is defined as 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to the alpelisib-matching placebo plus fulvestrant arm who have&#xD;
      disease progression per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by BIRC will have the option to crossover to&#xD;
      be treated with alpelisib plus fulvestrant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unblinding a single participant at a site will be permitted after disease progression&#xD;
      confirmed by BIRC after discussion with the Novartis team to determine eligibility for&#xD;
      cross-over to treatment with alpelisib plus fulvestrant.&#xD;
