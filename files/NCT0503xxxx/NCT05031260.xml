    <textblock>
      This is a clinical study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of COMORAL®, the intraoral&#xD;
      water-spraying cleaning device that is developed to remove plaque around teeth in the oral&#xD;
      cavity. To do so, 42 healthy subjects, 21 control and 21 experimental, will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish the baseline, all subjects will receive dental hygiene service. After 2 weeks,&#xD;
      patients will be randomly assigned to either control or intervention group (21 individuals&#xD;
      each). Both groups will be asked to brush their teeth once a day but without dental floss,&#xD;
      mouth rinse, and gum chewing, throughout the 4 weeks of study period. During the study&#xD;
      period, the experimental group will receive COMORAL® treatment three times a day every day&#xD;
      for 4 weeks except Saturday and Sunday.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will get evaluated for the oral status(PI, BOP, GI, PD, GR, CAL) and the status of&#xD;
      periopathogens on visit 1, visit 2 and visit 3.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This is a randomized, open-labeled, single-centered clinical study to evaluate COMORAL® the&#xD;
      intraoral water-spraying cleaning device that is developed to remove plaque around teeth in&#xD;
      the oral cavity. The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of COMORAL® the oral irrigation unit in preventing gingivitis and plaque&#xD;
      formation in adult patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      42 patients between 18 to 25 years old who have a periodontal probing depth of 3 mm or less&#xD;
      will be recruited. To establish the baseline, all the patients will receive dental hygiene&#xD;
      service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 2 weeks (Visit 1), patients will be randomly assigned to either control or intervention&#xD;
      group (21 individuals each). They will be asked to do the following instruction; Control&#xD;
      group (21 total) - The individuals in the control group will be asked to brush their teeth&#xD;
      once a day at home throughout the 4 weeks of study period. They will be asked not to use the&#xD;
      supplementary oral hygiene products including mouth rinse, dental floss and chewing gum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental/Intervention group (21 total) - The individuals in this group will be asked to&#xD;
      brush their teeth once a day at home throughout the 4 weeks of study period. They will be&#xD;
      asked not to use the supplementary oral hygiene products including mouth rinse, dental floss&#xD;
      and chewing gum. Instead, they will be asked to come to the clinic to use COMORAL® three&#xD;
      times a day, every day except Saturday and Sunday.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in both groups will be evaluated for clinical indices (PI, BOP, GI, PD, GR, CAL) and&#xD;
      the status of periopathogens on visit 1(baseline, visit 2(after 2 weeks), and visit 3(after 4&#xD;
      weeks). To measure the status of periopathogens, 3ml of saliva will be collected from each&#xD;
      subject.&#xD;
