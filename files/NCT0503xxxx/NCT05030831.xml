  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess safety and tolerability of INZ-701, an ectonucleotide&#xD;
      pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) recombinant fusion protein, for the treatment of&#xD;
      ABCC6 Deficiency (including Generalized Arterial Calcification of Infancy Type 2 [GACI-2] and&#xD;
      Pseudoxanthoma elasticum [PXE]).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      INZ-701 is an ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) recombinant fusion&#xD;
      protein in development for the treatment of ABCC6 Deficiency (including Generalized Arterial&#xD;
      Calcification of Infancy Type 2 [GACI-2] and Pseudoxanthoma elasticum [PXE]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a Phase 1/2, multi-center, open-label, first-in-human (FIH), first-in-patient&#xD;
      (FIP), and multiple ascending dose (MAD) study followed by a long-term open-label extension&#xD;
      period conducted in adults with ABCC6 Deficiency manifesting as pseudoxanthoma elasticum&#xD;
      (PXE). It is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of multiple ascending doses of INZ-701. The goal of the study is to&#xD;
      identify a safe, tolerable dose that restores inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) to&#xD;
      therapeutically effective levels in ABCC6 Deficiency to be used in further clinical&#xD;
      development. Exploratory endpoints for the Extension Period of the study will include&#xD;
      evaluations of cardiac, vascular, ophthalmologic, skeletal, and physical function as well as&#xD;
      patient reported outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject participation consists of a Screening Period, a 32-day Dose Evaluation Period, and a&#xD;
      48-week Extension Period following completion of the Dose Evaluation Period.&#xD;
