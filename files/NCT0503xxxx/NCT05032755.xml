    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of switching to very low nicotine&#xD;
      content (VLNC) cigarettes versus normal nicotine content (NNC) cigarettes on experiences with&#xD;
      craving, withdrawal, and pain among individuals with chronic back pain who smoke cigarettes&#xD;
      daily.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the effects of very low nicotine content (VLNC)&#xD;
      cigarettes on the dynamic associations between smoking, pain, and withdrawal among daily&#xD;
      smokers with chronic (&gt; 3 months) non-cancer back pain (n=48). Participants will complete an&#xD;
      initial screening session to determine eligibility, followed by a baseline abstinence session&#xD;
      in which measures of pain and withdrawal will be assessed following 24 hrs abstinence from&#xD;
      smoking. At the conclusion of this session participants will receive training in ecological&#xD;
      momentary assessment (EMA) procedures and software will be installed on their smartphone.&#xD;
      Participants will then complete a 1-week baseline period, in which they will complete EMA&#xD;
      while continuing to smoke usual brand cigarettes. During EMA, participants will receive 6&#xD;
      randomly spaced daily prompts, with 15 questions to complete about smoking behavior, mood,&#xD;
      and current pain. In addition, participants will be asked to use their smartphone to indicate&#xD;
      whenever they are about to smoke a cigarette. Three of these cigarettes each day will be&#xD;
      randomly selected for assessment: in these cases participants will be asked to respond to the&#xD;
      same 15 question before and after smoking the cigarette. Participants will also complete end&#xD;
      of day questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 1 week baseline period, participants will be randomly assigned to four weeks of&#xD;
      either VLNCs (n=24) or normal nicotine content (NNC) cigarettes (n=24). During this period,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to smoke only study cigarettes. Participants will attend weekly&#xD;
      laboratory visits to provide biochemical verification of cigarette adherence (urine samples)&#xD;
      and complete questionnaires. Study cigarettes will also be provided and collected at these&#xD;
      visits. Two of the four weekly urine samples will be selected for analysis. Participants will&#xD;
      also complete EMA during weeks 1 and 4 of study cigarette use. End of day questionnaires will&#xD;
      continue throughout the 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the study, participants will attend a final laboratory visit after&#xD;
      abstaining from smoking for 24 hours. During this session, self-report measures of pain,&#xD;
      craving, and withdrawal will be assessed, along with biochemical verification (breath sample)&#xD;
      of abstinence.&#xD;
