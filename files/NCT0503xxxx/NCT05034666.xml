    <textblock>
      Cuff pressure is essential in endotracheal tube management. Guidelines recommend a cuff&#xD;
      pressure of 20 to 30 cm H2O. One study, for instance, found that cuff pressure exceeded 40 cm&#xD;
      H2O in 40-to-90% of tested patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the endotracheal ETT cuff inflation pressure applied by the&#xD;
      participating anaesthetists, and their response after being informed about the pressure the&#xD;
      participants will apply.&#xD;

      Although the increasing uses of different supraglottic devices as an alternative, the&#xD;
      traditional endotracheal intubation is still considered the commonly used method for managing&#xD;
      the airway of a generally anaesthetized patient. After passing the endotracheal tube through&#xD;
      the larynx, the anaesthetist inflates the cuff or asks the anaesthesia technician to inflate&#xD;
      it. How much air is injected into the cuff is not a major concern for almost all&#xD;
      anaesthetists and they usually depend on palpating the external cuff tense to judge is it too&#xD;
      much, accurate or not enough? Cuff pressure is essential in endotracheal tube management.&#xD;
      Guidelines recommend a cuff pressure of 20 to 30 cm H2O. Inflation of the cuff of pressure&#xD;
      more than 30 cm H2O can damage the tracheal mucosa by compromising capillary perfusion. When&#xD;
      pressures are greater than 50 cm H2O, total obstruction of tracheal blood flow occurs. For&#xD;
      long times, without any evidence-based data, it has been believed that well-trained&#xD;
      anaesthetists are capable of determining proper ETT cuff pressures. It is presumed that&#xD;
      anaesthetists can detect appropriate inflation pressure and overinflated ETT cuff by&#xD;
      palpating the ETT pilot balloon. Adequacy of cuff inflation is conventionally determined by&#xD;
      palpation of the external balloon. Previous studies suggest that this approach is unreliable.&#xD;
      One study, for instance, found that cuff pressure exceeded 40 cm H2O in 40-to-90% of tested&#xD;
      patients. However, increased awareness of over-inflation risks may have improved recent&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the work: This study will investigate the endotracheal cuff inflation pressure&#xD;
      applied by the participating anaesthetists, and their response after being informed about the&#xD;
      pressure the participants will apply. Material and Methods: Type of the study: Prospective&#xD;
      controlled single-blind study. Settings: After obtaining approval by the Ethics Committee of&#xD;
      the Suez Canal University Hospital, and written informed consent with an explanation&#xD;
      regarding the purpose, effects, technique, and complications, all anaesthetists, working&#xD;
      currently in the facility, are included.&#xD;
