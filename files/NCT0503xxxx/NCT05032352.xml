      Prospective Registrational Trial to Define Real World Outcomes of Patients with Completely&#xD;
      Resected Stage I or IIA (tumor &lt; or = 5cm, node negative) Non-squamous Non-Small Lung Cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC) Identified as High, Intermediate, or Low Risk by a 14-Gene Prognostic Assay DetermaRx&#xD;

      Observation&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, 2 arm, multi-center study in patients with&#xD;
      histologically documented non-squamous NSCLC who have undergone complete resection (R0) of&#xD;
      the primary tumor with pathologically stage I or IIA disease. Routine paraffin-embedded tumor&#xD;
      specimens from completely resected (R0) stage I or IIA patients with non-squamous NSCLC will&#xD;
      undergo testing with the DetermaRxTM 14-Gene Prognostic Assay and will be designated as HIGH,&#xD;
      INTERMEDIATE or LOW risk by the assay. The physician and patient will determine the best&#xD;
      treatment course and will be assigned to treatment arm based on decision of adjuvant therapy&#xD;
      or observation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adjuvant treatment with a standard NSCLC platin-based doublet, 4 cycle (21-day) regimen&#xD;
           of the investigator's choice (Arm 1) or other adjuvant therapy (Arm 1a) which can&#xD;
           include combination of chemotherapy and targeted therapy, immunotherapy or other.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Observation (Arm 2) All patients will be observed for progression free survival and&#xD;
           overall survival to the end of study or death, whichever occurs first.&#xD;

        Patients with non-squamous NSCLC who have undergone complete resection (R0) of the primary&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Written informed consent using the appropriate approved Institutional Review Board&#xD;
             (IRB) approved consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age â‰¥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Able to comply with the protocol, including acceptable candidacy for adjuvant&#xD;
             chemotherapy and likely compliance with follow-up for anticipated length of study (18&#xD;
             months from randomization).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Adequate tissue sample, paraffin block with tumor occupying at least 25% of the tissue&#xD;
             surface area, for the 14 -gene prognostic assay, DetermaRxTM&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Histologically documented completely resected (R0) Stage I or IIA non-squamous NSCLC&#xD;
             per 8th edition, TNM staging system. Mixed histology cases that include a squamous&#xD;
             cell or small cell or neuroendocrine component are eligible for the study, as long as&#xD;
             they contain at least some component that is neither squamous cell, nor small cell nor&#xD;
             neuroendocrine and can include adenocarcinomas, not otherwise specified. Eligible&#xD;
             resections include lobectomy, bi-lobectomy, sleeve lobectomy and pneumonectomy.&#xD;
             Resections via segmentectomy or wedge resection will not be eligible. Complete&#xD;
             resection must also be accompanied, at a minimum, by intra-operative systematic&#xD;
             mediastinal lymph node sampling. Systematic sampling is defined as removal of at least&#xD;
             one representative lymph node each from levels 4 and 7 for a right-sided cancer and&#xD;
             from levels 5 and/or 6 and 7 for left-sided cancers. Complete mediastinal lymph node&#xD;
             dissection (MLND), however, is preferred, and is defined as resection of all lymph&#xD;
             nodes at those same levels for right- and left-sided cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. ECOG performance status 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. No prior anti-neoplastic (NSCLC ) treatment in the pre-operative or post-operative&#xD;
             setting (including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, radiation, ablative&#xD;
             procedures, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Final pathologic diagnosis of pure squamous cell, pure small cell, or pure&#xD;
             neuroendocrine histology, or any combination of only these three histological&#xD;
             subtypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Evidence of greater than stage IIA pathologic staging&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Evidence of incomplete resection (R1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prior systemic chemotherapy or anti-cancer agent for NSCLC&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any pre- or post-operative radiotherapy for the index tumor being considered for&#xD;
             enrollment&#xD;
