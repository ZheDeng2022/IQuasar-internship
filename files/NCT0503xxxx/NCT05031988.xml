  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Covid-19 pandemic has affected the entire globe for the past 2 years on a major scale,&#xD;
      causing never before seen major effects on the way we live probably for the near future.&#xD;
      SARS-Cov-2, previously known as coronavirus, is the causative virus for this disease and it&#xD;
      originates from Wuhan, China with its first reported case of human infection back in December&#xD;
      2019. From there, it quickly resulted in an outbreak which was first unsuccessfully contained&#xD;
      by the China government and has spread across the globe causing more than 187 million&#xD;
      positive cases and 4.05 million deaths at the time of writing this proposal. For this reason,&#xD;
      various measures have been implemented to control the spread of the virus with the main one&#xD;
      to be discussed for reasons of this research, the movement restriction order (MCO). MCO was&#xD;
      implemented to limit and control the local outbreak by restraining the movements of the&#xD;
      people only to the absolute necessary. Social and religious gatherings, outdoor recreational&#xD;
      activities, operation of learning institution of all levels are among those prohibited, only&#xD;
      allowing essential goods store and health care facility centres to operate for the period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, this study is done to assess the impact Covid-19 movement restriction has had on&#xD;
      university students from a physical and psychological standpoint during the MCO period. The&#xD;
      implementation of the various restriction order has caused the students to go through&#xD;
      numerous cycles of distress and it is of importance to determine the impact it has done to be&#xD;
      able to provide the appropriate support if needed.&#xD;
