      Malocclusions in adolescents may affect oral health related quality of life. The study aims&#xD;
      at;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluating two instruments measuring oral health related quality of life; &quot;Child&#xD;
           Perceptions Questionnaire 11-14&quot; (CPQ 11-14) short form and &quot;Psychosocial Impact of&#xD;
           Dental Aesthetics Questionnaire&quot; (PIDAQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Comparing differences in oral health related quality of life in;&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. adolescents with different types of malocclusion and without malocclusions&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. individuals of different genders and socioeconomic status&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Longitudinally evaluating differences in oral health related quality of life;&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. before, during and after orthodontic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. in untreated individuals (without malocclusion) over time&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The individuals that are to be recruited to the study are;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malocclusion group; 500 12-19 year olds with malocclusion, examined at their specialist&#xD;
      orthodontic clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No malocclusion group; 175 12-19 year olds without malocclusion, examined at their general&#xD;
      dentistry clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will also answers two questionnaires (in Swedish) measuring oral health related&#xD;
      quality of life; CPQ 11-14 short form (Jokovic 2006, Dimberg 2019) and PIDAQ (Klages 2006,&#xD;
      Göranson 2020). Randomization will ensure that half of the study participants will begin with&#xD;
      CPQ 11-14 short form and then PIDAQ, while half of the participants will answer the&#xD;
      questionnaires in the reverse order. The questionnaires will be answered in a calm&#xD;
      environment in the dental clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have five standardized intraoral photographs taken. These photographs are&#xD;
      already routinely taken at the specialist orthodontic clinics, but is taken in addition to&#xD;
      routine procedure at the general dentistry clinic. To determine presence of malocclusion and&#xD;
      orthodontic treatment need, two orthodontic indices will be used; ICON (Daniels 2000) and&#xD;
      IOTN (Brook 1989). Assessments will be based on intraoral photographs, clinical measurements&#xD;
      and pre-existing dental x-rays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, patients will be grouped based on their type of malocclusion using the following&#xD;
      diagnoses;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enlarged overjet (≥ 6 mm) with or without incomplete lip closure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anterior cross bite (One or more incisors)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Deep bite (≥ 2/3 lower incisor coverage)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frontal open bite (≤0 mm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lateral cross bite (two or more teeth, with our without lateral guidance)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Upper or lower arch anterior spacing (largest gap between two neighbouring teeth between&#xD;
           canine and canine ≥ 2 mm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Upper or lower arch anterior crowding (≥ 3 mm lack of space canine to canine)&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the study is of longitudinal design, the questionnaires will be answered and the&#xD;
      photographs will be taken on several occasions. For the malocclusion group, the time points&#xD;
      will be as following;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T0- at the initial examination at the specialist orthodontic clinic, before orthodontic&#xD;
           treatment is begun&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T2- One year into the orthodontic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T3- Two months after the orthodontic treatment has been completed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T4- One year after the orthodontic treatment has been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The no malocclusion group will be examined the same number of times and at the same time&#xD;
      intervals as the malocclusion group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information about DMFT/S (decayed, missing, filled, teeth/surfaces will be gathered from the&#xD;
      dental records. Orthodontic extractions will be noted. To be able to determine socioeconomic&#xD;
      differences, information about socioeconomic status of the individual study participants will&#xD;
      be gathered from the Statistics Sweden.&#xD;
