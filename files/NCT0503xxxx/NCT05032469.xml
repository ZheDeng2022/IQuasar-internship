  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In open heart surgeries, patients experience severe pain due to tissue trauma, damage to&#xD;
      intercostal nerves, and muscle spasm due to pulling tubes from the mediastinal space and&#xD;
      between the pleural leaves pull during chet tube removal (CTR). When acute pain is not&#xD;
      relieved, the patient develops emotional, psychological (eg post-traumatic stress disorder)&#xD;
      and physical problems (eg chronic pain) after surgery. Since this situation negatively&#xD;
      affects the healing process, it increases the anxiety level of the patients and decreases the&#xD;
      comfort level. Reflexology is one of the non-pharmacological methods used in the management&#xD;
      of pain and anxiety after open heart surgery The aim of this randomized controlled study was&#xD;
      to identify the effect of foot reflexology applied before chest tube removal process on pain&#xD;
      and anxiety level. This study will be done a randomized-controlled trial to test the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

      Background: Patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery suffer from anxiety and pain due to&#xD;
      the chest tube removal (CTR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective/Hypothesis: The aim of this randomized controlled study was to identify the effect&#xD;
      of foot reflexology applied before chest tube removal process on pain and anxiety level.The&#xD;
      following hypotheses (H) were tested in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1a : There was a difference between the reflexology group and the control group in terms of&#xD;
      pain level during CTR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1b : There was a difference between the reflexology group and the control group in terms of&#xD;
      anxiety level during CTR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1c : There was a difference between the reflexology group and the control group in terms of&#xD;
      the difference between the pain level before CTR and during CTR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1d : There was a difference between the reflexology group and the control group in terms of&#xD;
      the difference between the anxiety level before CTR and during CTR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A randomized controlled trial. Method: The study sample who has gone through&#xD;
      coronary artery bypass graft surgery was randomly assigned to reflexology or the control&#xD;
      group (twenty- eight each in). The primary outcomes were pain, evaluated using a numeric&#xD;
      pain-rating scale, and anxiety evaluated by the profile of mood states scale tension-anxiety&#xD;
      subscale, both measured first (before and after reflexology) and second postoperative days&#xD;
      (before the reflexology and immediately after chest tube removal, 15th minutes and 1 h).&#xD;

    <description>The first foot reflexology was applied to the intervention group for 30 min (20 min on the right foot, 10 min on the left foot) on the first postoperative day (24 h after the surgery). On the second postoperative day, 30 min of foot reflexology was applied to the patients who decided to chest tube removal (CTR). After the foot reflexology applied by the researcher, CTR was performed by the doctor within 10 min. Immediately after CTR, the patient's pain and anxiety level during CTR was measured. At the 15th minute after CTR, the pain and anxiety level of the patients was measured, their satisfaction with the reflexology application was measured. Then, the patients were asked to describe the pain and feelings and thoughts during CTR, 1 hr after CTR, pain level was measured, and they were asked to express their feelings and thoughts about the reflexology application.</description>
