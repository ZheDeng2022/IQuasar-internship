  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, several vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, Astrazeneca,&#xD;
      Janssen) have been developed and are being administered to millions of people in France and&#xD;
      billions around the world through massive vaccination programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Janssen vaccine is the fourth COVID-19 vaccine to be licensed in Europe. It received a&#xD;
      European marketing authorization for all adults, without age limit, on March 11, 2021.&#xD;
      Janssen's vaccine is a viral non replicating vector (adenovirus) vaccine targeting the Spike&#xD;
      protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It differs from currently available vaccines in that it is a&#xD;
      single-dose regimen with significant protection at 28 days post-injection. Monitoring of the&#xD;
      durability of the immune response is essential to assess the need for a booster vaccination.&#xD;
      Insufficient data are available in the adult population regarding the evolution of the immune&#xD;
      response. This point seems to be even more important in the elderly. Indeed, their immune&#xD;
      system declines with age, leading to a greater susceptibility to infectious diseases and a&#xD;
      weaker response to vaccination. This is called immunosenescence. Vaccination in this&#xD;
      population is essential to avoid severe COVID-19 cases, since older people are particularly&#xD;
      at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two CoviCompare studies with two licensed vaccines messenger RNA vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna)&#xD;
      are underway to evaluate the immune response to each vaccine according to age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to conduct a study to evaluate the immunogenicity of the Janssen vaccine in&#xD;
      different age groups with long-term follow-up. This will allow determining the need of a&#xD;
      booster.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A common battery of in vitro and ex vivo immuno-monitoring tests has been set up to&#xD;
      systematically assess the acquisition of humoral and cellular immunity over time over a&#xD;
      period of 24 months following vaccination in the CoviCompare project. This trial, part of the&#xD;
      CoviCompare project will use the same immunomonitoring set. This will also allow comparison&#xD;
      of the immune response to different vaccines in subjects of different age in order to&#xD;
      determine in this at risk population the better vaccination schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only difference between this trial and the other 2 trials of the CoviCompare project is&#xD;
      that adults aged 18-45 will not be concerned here, because the adenovirus vaccine is not&#xD;
      recommended for this age group in France&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this trial of the Covicompare project, we will therefore evaluate the immune response&#xD;
      after Janssen vaccine in subjects aged more than 65 years and 55 to 65 years without a prior&#xD;
      COVID-19, following the same immunomonitoring analyses as for the other CoviCompare project&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
