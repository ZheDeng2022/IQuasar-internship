  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity disproportionately impacts sexual minority women. Behavioral weight loss programs are&#xD;
      the gold standard treatment for mild to moderate obesity. The investigators have developed an&#xD;
      online behavioral weight loss program that is effective, low-cost, and highly scalable.&#xD;
      However, existing research suggests that tailoring treatment to address 3 well-established&#xD;
      weight loss barriers in sexual minority women will be critical for maximizing the relevance&#xD;
      and efficacy of behavioral weight loss for this group. The goal of the first phase of this&#xD;
      K23 is to develop 3 novel treatment components targeting sexual minority women's weight loss&#xD;
      barriers (i.e., minority stress, low social support, and negative body image), to pilot the&#xD;
      program in sexual minority women with overweight/obesity, and to conduct individual&#xD;
      qualitative interviews to elicit feedback on the intervention's acceptability, cultural&#xD;
      relevance, usability, and feasibility that will be used to refine the program. After a&#xD;
      pre-piloting phase (consisting of initial content piloting, interviews, and intervention&#xD;
      refinement), 8 participants will pilot the full 3-month weight loss program and will be&#xD;
      randomized to pilot 0-3 novel tailored components (targeting minority stress, negative body&#xD;
      image, and social support) over the 3-month period. Participants will complete quantitative&#xD;
      and qualitative assessments of intervention acceptability and appropriateness post-treatment&#xD;
      and the intervention will be refined.&#xD;
