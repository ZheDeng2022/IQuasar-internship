      The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with IBI110 single agent and in&#xD;
      combination with sintilimab demonstrates sufficient efficacy/safety in r/r DLBCL.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib, open-label, randomized study to determine the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      treatment with IBI110 single agent and in combination with sintilimab in DLBCL that are&#xD;
      relapsed and/or refractory to available standard of care therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in each cohort are randomly assigned to one of the two arms: IBI110 single agent&#xD;
      arm and IBI110 in combination with sintilimab arm. Participants received study treatment for&#xD;
      a maximum of 2 years, or until disease progression (assessed by investigator per Lugano 2014&#xD;
      Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson et al 2014)), unacceptable toxicity, death or&#xD;
      discontinuation from study treatment for any other reason.&#xD;
