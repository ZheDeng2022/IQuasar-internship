  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep at altitude is often poor. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a&#xD;
      single dose of the opioid antagonist, naltrexone, on sleep quality and periodic breathing&#xD;
      after rapid ascent to ~3800m altitude.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep at high altitude is notoriously poor due to a combination of the unusual sleep&#xD;
      environment and hypoxia during sleep. Many people develop what is called periodic breathing&#xD;
      (PB) during sleep. PB may improve overall mean nocturnal oxygen saturation (SpO2) although&#xD;
      this is not entirely clear. Simultaneously, PB may further disturb sleep at altitude and has&#xD;
      been associated with nighttime arousals from sleep. Medications that may decrease the amount&#xD;
      of PB might improve sleep quality. The FDA approved drug, naltrexone, is a specific&#xD;
      antagonist to the brain opioid receptors. It is a non-addicting drug which has never been&#xD;
      studied at altitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Relationships: Sleep disordered breathing is a very common disorder throughout the&#xD;
      population, but it worsens with increasing age and BMI. At the same time, many in our Veteran&#xD;
      population live in the local mountains and undoubtedly develop PB during sleep in addition to&#xD;
      having obstructive sleep apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The purpose to this study is to evaluate the effects of a single dose of&#xD;
      naltrexone on PB and oxygen saturation during sleep at altitude in healthy young&#xD;
      participants. The additional purpose will be to assess the subject-perceived sleep quality&#xD;
      after the use of naltrexone vs. placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, crossover study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: We plan recruit up to 30 healthy study subjects with no history of sleep&#xD;
      disordered breathing. Potential participants will be screened to ensure inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria are met. A baseline low altitude sleep study will be preformed at home. No&#xD;
      medication will be given before this baseline sleep study. The sleep study will be similar to&#xD;
      the home sleep studies routinely used by the VA Loma Linda Healthcare System's Sleep Center.&#xD;
      Participants will be transported for High Altitude Trip 1 to the Barcroft Laboratory at the&#xD;
      White Mountain Research Center (WMRC) at 3810 m altitude. At WMRC they will have a sleep&#xD;
      study performed, similar to the baseline sleep study, after taking either a single dose of&#xD;
      naltrexone or matching placebo. After an appropriate washout period (at least 5 half-lives)&#xD;
      subjects will again be studied (High Altitude Trip 2) taking the alternate medication&#xD;
      (naltrexone/placebo) to the one used in the first study. Order of placebo vs. naltrexone will&#xD;
      be randomized. Prior to sleep the subject will fill out questionnaires detailing how sleepy&#xD;
      they are. On the morning following each sleep study, subjects will fill out a short&#xD;
      questionnaire assessing the quality of their sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact/Significance: Improved knowledge of the mechanisms of PB in hypoxic environments will&#xD;
      provide important insights into diagnostic and therapeutic decisions for Veterans who suffer&#xD;
      from sleep disordered breathing.&#xD;
