    <textblock>
      Due to organ shortage in kidney transplantation (KT) several strategies have been implemented&#xD;
      in an attempt to increase donor pool utilization, including transplantation of extended&#xD;
      criteria donor (ECD) allografts. While the transplantation of ECD organs saves patients from&#xD;
      waiting-list dropout, these pre-damaged organs exhibit an increased susceptibility to further&#xD;
      injury during organ storage and transplantation. Static cold storage (SCS) involves the&#xD;
      transportation of procured donor kidneys on ice and has remained the gold standard for organ&#xD;
      preservation for decades. SCS relies on hypothermia to reduce cellular metabolism and oxygen&#xD;
      demand while achieving a prolonged preservation time of organs. Upon reperfusion, the&#xD;
      reintroduction of oxygen to the ischemic kidney leads to a respiratory burst with massive&#xD;
      production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and subsequent sterile inflammation of&#xD;
      the entire organ. This ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a central predictor of graft and&#xD;
      patient survival. Current clinical preservation strategies are unable to meet the challenges&#xD;
      of ECD allograft transplantation and there is a great demand to optimize preservation&#xD;
      techniques for such high risk ECD allografts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, two main paradigms prevail in the clinical approach to kidney allograft machine&#xD;
      perfusion (MP) in regard to optimized preservation techniques: while end-ischemic hypothermic&#xD;
      (HMP) and hypothermic oxygenated MP (HOPE) may be seen as dynamic alternatives of the&#xD;
      traditional organ preservation based on hypothermia-induced deceleration of metabolism could&#xD;
      not proof a beneficial effect on delayed graft function or primary graft failure, the impact&#xD;
      of normothermic perfusion (NMP) on ECD kidney allografts is still missing. NMP aims at&#xD;
      re-equilibration of cellular metabolism by preserving the organ at physiological temperatures&#xD;
      whilst ensuring sufficient oxygen and nutrient supply. The present trial was therefore&#xD;
      designed to provide first level-II evidence for NMP in human KT after donation after brain&#xD;
      death (DBD). In total, 194 human kidney grafts will be randomized to either 4 hours of NMP&#xD;
      directly before implantation (intervention group; n = 97) or to SCS (control group; n = 97)&#xD;
      prior to transplantation. The primary endpoint will be kidney function after 6 months&#xD;
      (6-months eGFR). Secondary endpoints include kidney function after 3 and 12 months, incidence&#xD;
      of delayed graft function (DGF), primary non-function (PNF) and surgical complications&#xD;
      assessed by the comprehensive complication index (CCI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first human kidney transplantation (KT) was performed by Murray et al. in 1954 and has&#xD;
      evolved as the standard treatment for kidney failure (previously referred to as end-stage&#xD;
      renal disease (ESRD). In 2020, approximately 7067 patients were listed for KT in Germany,&#xD;
      however only 1342 transplantations could be performed due to organ shortage. The number of&#xD;
      patients on the waiting list substantially exceeds the number of donors. Around 390 patients&#xD;
      died while waiting for a suitable organ on the waiting list, and another 492 patients dropped&#xD;
      out due to morbidity and advancing disease. For increasing donor pool utilization several&#xD;
      strategies have been aimed, including living donation, old-for-old KT and transplantation of&#xD;
      extended criteria donor (ECD) allografts. While, ECD allografts are associated with a higher&#xD;
      incidence of graft related complications and impaired postoperative outcome, novel&#xD;
      preservation techniques such as ex-vivo machine perfusion (MP) of the donor allograft have&#xD;
      been developed aiming at optimizing the function of marginal organs after transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The common practice of static cold storage (SCS) organ preservation has changed little since&#xD;
      the initial introduction of the original University of Wisconsin (UW) organ preservation&#xD;
      solution in the late 1980s. Static organ preservation relies on hypothermia to decelerate&#xD;
      metabolism and reduce oxygen demand to prolong ischemia tolerance and avoid rapid functional&#xD;
      graft impairment, thereby delaying graft damage. While a significant amount of anaerobic&#xD;
      metabolism continues at a low rate, the metabolism of the allograft does not cease completely&#xD;
      during SCS. In addition, the lack of blood flow-derived shear stress causes a disruption of&#xD;
      endogenous nitric-oxide (NO) production and a functional impairment of endothelial cells.&#xD;
      Upon reperfusion, the reintroduction of oxygen-rich blood to the ischemic allograft leads to&#xD;
      a respiratory-burst with massive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial&#xD;
      oxidative stress and a sterile inflammatory reaction that is pivotal to kidney injury. This&#xD;
      cascade of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) ultimately leads to an impaired outcome,&#xD;
      especially in the ECD-KT setting. While high-quality grafts are usually less prone to IRI,&#xD;
      ECD allografts exhibit an impaired microcirculation and an increased susceptibility to&#xD;
      inflammatory and oxidative stress and, as such, poorly tolerate extended periods of cold&#xD;
      storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, MP has been recognized as a promising strategy in the context of ECD kidney&#xD;
      transplantation. While SCS only prolongs storage time and limits the damage sustained during&#xD;
      the period of cold ischemia, MP can reverse some of these effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothermic (HMP) and hypothermic oxygenated MP (HOPE) may be seen as dynamic cold organ&#xD;
      preservation based on hypothermia-induced deceleration of metabolism, which aims to combine&#xD;
      the positive effects of hypothermia observed in classical cold storage with the positive&#xD;
      effects of dynamic preservation. In contrast normothermic perfusion (NMP) mimics&#xD;
      physiological circumstances and provides sufficient oxygen and nutrient supply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-ischemic HMP with oxygen (HOPE) presents is marked by active oxygenation of the perfusate&#xD;
      during MP. Even though beneficials effects of HOPE were reported in preclinical studies, no&#xD;
      significant impact on DGF, PNF or graft survival after one year in human KT could be&#xD;
      demonstrated. In contrast to hypothermic preservation methods, data on NMP in human KT is&#xD;
      limited. In fact, there are no registered randomized controlled clinical trials (RCT),&#xD;
      comparing end-ischemic NMP versus SCS in donation after brain death (DBD), the only legal&#xD;
      donation circumstance in Germany.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of end-ischemic NMP compared to SCS in a&#xD;
      multicenter prospective randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) using ECD kidney&#xD;
      allografts from DBD donors.&#xD;
