    <textblock>
      The first multicenter prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial of the pentavalent live vaccine for RVI prevention was conducted in Russia among&#xD;
      healthy infants aged 2 months at the time of the first vaccination.&#xD;

      The study is a double-blind placebo-controlled prospective randomized, of efficiency and&#xD;
      safety of Vaccine to prevent a rotavirus infection pentavalent live with the participation of&#xD;
      healthy children&quot; is carried out in the Russian Federation according to the Protocol of&#xD;
      clinical trial No. RTB 003/18, requirements of the national legal system and the&#xD;
      international rules of conduct of clinical trials (ICH GCP). The study was randomized of 100&#xD;
      children corresponding to inclusion criteria and not having criteria of non-inclusion, which&#xD;
      in the ratio 1:1 were randomized in one of two groups. Children from Group 1 received a&#xD;
      vaccine to prevent a rotavirus infection pentavalent live, is triple orally with interval not&#xD;
      less than four weeks of 2.5 ml (1 dose). Children from Group 2 received a placebo not less&#xD;
      than four weeks of 2.5 ml (1 dose) are triple orally with an interval. Three children (2&#xD;
      persons from Groups 1 and 1 person of Group 2) who were ahead of schedule finished&#xD;
      participation in the research were immunized once.&#xD;
