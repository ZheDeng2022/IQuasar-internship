  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stent treatment of thoracic aortic pathologies, including aneurysms, pseudo-aneurysms,&#xD;
      dissections, intramural hematomas, penetrating ulcers and ruptures of the isthmus, seems to&#xD;
      provide a likely benefit compared to surgery in terms of surgical mortality and severe&#xD;
      morbidity. However, the data concerning the long-term fate of these stents are insufficient.&#xD;
      For this reason, the French National Health Authority (HAS) requests a 5-year follow-up in&#xD;
      relation to the renewal of insurance reimbursement for these stent-grafts. Therefore, this&#xD;
      long-term observational study has been set up.&#xD;

      Study outline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      French observational, prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, single arm and open-label&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study device:&#xD;
&#xD;
      RELAY PLUS and RELAY NBS PLUS thoracic aortic stent or future range extension models,&#xD;
      excluding custom-made devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 160 patients will be included in France consecutively from all participating&#xD;
      centers and among users of the studied stent-graft (all of the centers) or any new center&#xD;
      during the inclusion period. The patient will be considered as included in the study when the&#xD;
      RELAY PLUS or RELAY NBS PLUS stent-graft is introduced via the surgical or percutaneous&#xD;
      approach and provided that the patient meets all of the study eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this study is the 5-year mortality rate (all causes). The objective&#xD;
      will be to assess the interest of the technique in terms of the long-term efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of the use of the RELAY PLUS or RELAY NBS PLUS stent-graft (i.e. at 5 years) on a cohort of&#xD;
      patients representative of the population treated under actual conditions of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implantation of the RELAY PLUS or RELAY NBS PLUS thoracic aortic stent-graft must be&#xD;
      carried out in accordance with recommendations issued by the Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS)&#xD;
      including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Carrying out the implantation in centers with expertise in both endovascular and&#xD;
           surgical treatments, and with an adequate technical platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The implementation of a multidisciplinary discussion, in particular on the risk of&#xD;
           surgical conversion and the possible use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Verification of the presence of a proximal neck of at least 2 cm in length, allowing for&#xD;
           the stent to be placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The need to educate patients about the advantages and disadvantages of the repair&#xD;
           techniques available, such as open surgery and endo-aortic stent (EAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Annual monitoring by CT-scan with contrast, or MRI + x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this study is observational, no specific examination or procedure outside the framework of&#xD;
      the current practice of each center is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A summary report will be submitted annually to the Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS).&#xD;

             stent-graft in the descending and/or thoraco-abdominal aorta with several extensions)&#xD;
