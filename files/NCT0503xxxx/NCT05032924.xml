  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through the investigators previous study of the effect of transient increased cellular&#xD;
      permeability after ESWT, combined ESWT and PRP may have better effect on the treatment of&#xD;
      rotator cuff lesions. The investigators intend to conduct a prospective double blind&#xD;
      randomized control study on the treatment effect of combined ESWT and PRP therapy for rotator&#xD;
      cuff lesions without complete tearing. Constant Score, VAS and data from peripheral blood&#xD;
      will be measured for the effectiveness evaluation. Shoulder MRI will be followed-up one year&#xD;
      after ESWT. The investigators hypothesize that combined ESWT and PRP will be more effective&#xD;
      for rotator cuff lesions.&#xD;

      Overall Design [Prospective randomized double-blind study for the clinical effect of combined&#xD;
      ESWT and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) or PRP or ESWT alone or sham treatment on patients with&#xD;
      shoulder rotator cuff lesions and without complete tear.]&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be separated into 4 groups according to computer statistical&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators shall use STORZ MEDICAL Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy 3000 impulse 24KV&#xD;
      (0.32mJ/mm2) Focus at two points (3000 impulse each point) near the insertion of&#xD;
      supraspinatus and rotation interval of the involved shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRPï¼š The PRP form Regen Kit BCT 1 Platelet Rich Plasma PRP will be used and will be injected&#xD;
      into the Subacromial bursa (Hyajoint injection as a control)&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYAJOINT Synovial Fluid Supplement, active ingredient: Sodium Hyaluronate 25 mg, package: 2.5&#xD;
      mL per syringe&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study will involve 30-50 patients&#xD;
      who have rotator cuff lesions without complete tear. The inclusion criteria are (1) patients&#xD;
      who have pain around the shoulder, a positive impingement sign, and a positive imaging&#xD;
      diagnosis of rotator cuff pathology without complete tear; (2) patients who do not respond to&#xD;
      conservative therapy or rehabilitation for at least 3 months; and (3) patients age between 35&#xD;
      and 80 years, who sign the informed consent form. The investigators will exclude patients who&#xD;
      have rheumatic diseases, glenohumeral osteoarthritis, full-thickness cuff tears, fractures,&#xD;
      infections, or tumors; those who have received a subacromial injection within 3 weeks; and&#xD;
      those who are pregnant or want to become pregnant; and those who have arrhythmia, pacemaker,&#xD;
      coagulopathy, or malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intent-to-treat population is a fully randomized group of patients who have a baseline&#xD;
      value (Constant score and VAS before treatment). The imaging diagnosis of a rotator cuff&#xD;
      lesion is made by a musculoskeletal radiologist who has considerable experience in&#xD;
      interpreting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results for shoulders. On MRI, rotator cuff&#xD;
      tendinosis is characterized by increased in tratendinous signal intensity onT2-weighted&#xD;
      images without tendon disruption. The tendinosis of the MRI imaging was further diverted into&#xD;
      three grades. Grade 1 indicates less than 1/3 of the supraspinatus tendon is involved, Grade&#xD;
      2 indicates 1/3 to 2/3 and Grade 3 indicates more than 2/3 of the supraspinatus tendon is&#xD;
      involved. Partial-thickness tearing is characterized by the presence of focal hyperintense&#xD;
      fluid or a fluid-like signal intensity that extended into the tendon on the T2-weighted&#xD;
      images. A full thickness tear is diagnosed by the extension of hyperintense fluid or&#xD;
      fluid-like signal intensity through the entire thickness of the interrupted rotator cuff&#xD;
      tendon on T2-weighted images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every participant will have Subacromial injection of 2.5 ml PRP or HA (control) one week&#xD;
      before ESWT or sham therapy. In Group I, patients receive 3000 impulses of shockwaves at 24kV&#xD;
      (energy flux density, 0.32mJ/mm2) to the affected shoulder as a 1-time treatment. Treatments&#xD;
      are performed on an outpatient basis. The area of treatment (2 points near the supraspinatus&#xD;
      insertion and rotator interval) is focused with a control guide on the machine, and surgical&#xD;
      lubricant is placed on the skin in contact with the shockwave tube with the patient in a&#xD;
      supine position. The sham treatment entail use of the device in which the silicone pad was&#xD;
      removed from the stand-off device, but the participants can still hear the sound of the shock&#xD;
      wave and have tingling sensation over the skin but without energy transduced. The&#xD;
      participants' vital signs and local discomfort are monitored throughout the course of&#xD;
      treatment. The treated area is inspected for local swelling, ecchymosis, or hematoma&#xD;
      immediately after the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will have a pain medication-free interval 3 days prior to each evaluation.&#xD;
      After treatment and during follow-up, participants will be restricted to the use of a 750mg&#xD;
      of acetaminophen per day for pain, in order to facilitate usage and comparison of the&#xD;
      medications among the patients. Follow-up examinations are performed independently by one of&#xD;
      the coauthors, who is blinded to patient treatment status at 1week, 2week, 1month, 3 months,&#xD;
      6 months, and 12 months after treatment. Peripheral blood (10cc) will be collected one week&#xD;
      and 1 month after treatment and shoulder MRI will be checked 12 months after treatment. The&#xD;
      participants who have persistent shoulder discomfort may be advised to undergo surgical&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
