  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to Coronavirus-19, we are exploring the plausibility of delivering the Me &amp; My Wishes&#xD;
      intervention via telehealth.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Me &amp; My Wishes are videos of nursing home residents talking about their preferences for care,&#xD;
      including four sections: About Me, Preferences for Today, Preferences for Medical&#xD;
      Intervention and End of Life, and Afterthoughts. Knowing what residents want is essential to&#xD;
      staff's ability to provide quality care and can inform family caregivers decision making&#xD;
      especially in later stages of life as the resident's cognition declines-a time when family&#xD;
      caregivers often feel unprepared. Persons with mild to moderate dementia can accurately&#xD;
      express their everyday and end of life preferences, however, stereotypes persist about the&#xD;
      decision making abilities of people with dementia that often prevent their involvement in&#xD;
      conversations about care. The investigators propose to explore the feasibility of delivering&#xD;
      Me &amp; My Wishes via a telehealth platform.&#xD;
