  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating auto immune disease of the central nervous system,&#xD;
      affecting 2500000 people worldwide. Risk factors for MS severity are not yet well-known , but&#xD;
      previous studies highlighted that relapse rate increased during influenzae epidemics, and air&#xD;
      pollution could be a risk factor for MS relapses. MS is a neurological chronic disease that&#xD;
      requires constant medical treatment and regular rehabilitation care. COVID-19 pandemic and&#xD;
      restrictive measures taken to limit contaminations have drastically decreased air pollution&#xD;
      and seasonal viral infections exposure, but sanitary crisis also limited care access for MS&#xD;
      patients (medical treatment, rehabilitation). Therefore, this particular period offers a&#xD;
      unique opportunity to evaluate the impact of air pollution, viral infections, and health care&#xD;
      access on the severity of MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to evaluate the impact of air pollution and seasonal viral infections&#xD;
      on the risk of MS relapse, using the year 2020 as a quasi-experimental model. The secondary&#xD;
      objective will be to evaluate the impact of health care access limitations on the risk of&#xD;
      neurological disability accumulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include 1500 MS patients, living in Ile de France, followed in the&#xD;
      neurological department of &quot;Pitié-Salpêtrière&quot; Hospital. This is a retrospective&#xD;
      observational study nested in OFSEP registry (French Multiple Sclerosis Observatory), which&#xD;
      is a prospective cohort of MS patients in France. Air pollution data will come from AIRPARIF,&#xD;
      and viral infections data will come from &quot;Santé Publique France&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A better knowledge of the impact of air pollution, viral infections, and health care access&#xD;
      on the course of MS will enable to better guide information to patients and public health&#xD;
      care decisions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. The&#xD;
      repetition of relapses and their severity will lead in the long term to the accumulation of&#xD;
      disability. The risk factors for relapses are still poorly understood, but it is suspected&#xD;
      that air pollution and seasonal viral infections may increase the risk of relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sars-Cov-2 virus pandemic has abruptly disrupted the daily environment, to date three&#xD;
      lock-down periods have been implemented, in France, to limit the spread of COVID 19, the&#xD;
      first was from March 17 to May 11, 2020, the second was less strict from October 30 to&#xD;
      December 15, 2020, and the third began April 3, 2021. The reduction in road traffic during&#xD;
      the first containment was accompanied in Ile de France by a 30 to 50% decrease in fine&#xD;
      particulate matter and nitrogen oxide air pollution compared to the previous year. The&#xD;
      confinements and the generalized application of barrier measures have also been associated&#xD;
      with a clear decrease in the circulation of seasonal viruses, in particular influenza and&#xD;
      viral gastroenteritis viruses, compared to the previous year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the impact of measures to prevent the spread of the Sars-CoV-2 epidemic on the risk&#xD;
      of MS relapse has not been studied. However, these periods offer a unique opportunity to&#xD;
      assess, in a quasi-experimental model, the impact of air pollution and viral infections on&#xD;
      the risk of MS relapse, in a context where these factors have shown large variations compared&#xD;
      to the usual seasonal values observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pandemic has also had a profound impact on the health care system, with the corollary&#xD;
      that patients with chronic pathologies have had difficulty accessing care, as hospital&#xD;
      structures have had to deal with an unprecedented crisis, resulting in the de-scheduling of&#xD;
      non-urgent procedures and great difficulty in accessing in-person consultations. Numerous&#xD;
      uncertainties concerning the risk of severe COVID-19 in patients treated with&#xD;
      immune-modulators or immune-suppressors have led to the suspension or delay of the initiation&#xD;
      of immuno-active treatments to prevent the aggravation of the disease. To date, no study has&#xD;
      evaluated the impact of changes in the management of MS patients during this particular&#xD;
      period and to assess the impact on the progression of neurological disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study will be to determine the impact of environmental risk&#xD;
      factors (air pollution, exposure to seasonal viruses) and health care access on the risk of&#xD;
      clinical MS relapse, in the context of the lockdown periods, compared to periods prior to the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective will be to assess the impact of environmental risk factors (air&#xD;
      pollution, exposure to seasonal viruses), on the risk of accumulation of MS disability, in&#xD;
      the context of the lockdown periods, compared to periods prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include patients followed in the neurology department of the Pitié&#xD;
      Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris for relapsing-remitting MS, and will be conducted as bellow:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conducted during the patient's usual follow-up (consultation / day hospital).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Information and collection of non-opposition by the investigating neurologist&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical examination to evaluate the disability (EDSS scale), as part of the care&#xD;
           (systematic for all MS consultations)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A paper questionnaire is given to the patient during the consultation. The patient will&#xD;
           be contacted by telephone within 15 days after the consultation by a health care staff&#xD;
           to collect the answers to the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different sources of data will be used together:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical data from the OFSEP registry (French Multiple Sclerosis Observatory). OFSEP is&#xD;
           a national registry in which neurological clinical data of MS patients are prospectively&#xD;
           collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (i) Date of first symptoms of the disease (ii) Date of diagnosis (iii) Date of disease&#xD;
           relapses, date of first symptoms of the relapse (iv) Neurological disability score at&#xD;
           each neurological assessment as assessed by the EDSS score (v) Nature, date of&#xD;
           initiation and discontinuation of treatment and reasons for discontinuation (vi)&#xD;
           Comorbidities, infectious and neoplastic complications (vii) Education level&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data from the telephone questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
           (i) Zip code of patient's iterative residences since 2018, as well as zip code of&#xD;
           residence at the time of the two confinements (ii) Occupational status (iii) Occurrence&#xD;
           of COVID infection/date needed for hospitalization (iv) During the COVID-19 outbreak,&#xD;
           did the patient: avoid seeing a doctor, avoid going to health care facilities, stop&#xD;
           background treatment for MS. If yes to any of the questions, the change(s) was: decided&#xD;
           by the patient, recommended by the treating physician, recommended by the neurologist,&#xD;
           other (specify) (v) During the COVID-19 outbreak, did the patient stop his or her&#xD;
           rehabilitation care (physical therapy, speech therapy)? If yes, date of cessation,&#xD;
           duration, reason for cessation (planned, decided by the patient, recommended by the&#xD;
           rehabilitation specialist, recommended by the attending physician, recommended by the&#xD;
           neurologist)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pollution data from approved air quality monitoring associations (AASQA): for the Ile de&#xD;
           France region, this is AIR PARIF, which collects the daily average exposure to fine&#xD;
           particles (PM10, PM2.5), ozone (O3), and nitrogen oxides (NO2) at 37 stations in the&#xD;
           different departments of Ile de France. The data from the station closest to each&#xD;
           patient's home will be analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Data on the circulation of influenza and gastroenteritis, produced by Santé Publique&#xD;
           France (&quot;Sentinelles&quot; network, OSCOUR network, National Reference Center for Respiratory&#xD;
           Infections Viruses).&#xD;
