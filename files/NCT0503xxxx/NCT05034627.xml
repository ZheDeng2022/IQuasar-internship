  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of calaspargase pegol-mknl&#xD;
      in combination with cobimetinib in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that has spread&#xD;
      to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) or has spread to other places in the body&#xD;
      (metastatic). Cobimetinib attacks a protein called MEK that has been known to stimulate cells&#xD;
      that promote the growth of cancer cells in the body. Calaspargase pegol-mknl is an enzyme&#xD;
      that converts the amino acid L-asparagine into aspartic acid and ammonia. Many types of&#xD;
      cancer cell rely on the amino acid L-asparagine, and depleting this amino acid with&#xD;
      calaspargase pegol-mknl starves cancer cells of this nutrient. Attacking the MEK protein with&#xD;
      cobimetinib is thought to further prevent cancer cells from using this amino acid, causing&#xD;
      them to die. Giving calaspargase pegol-mknl in combination with cobimetinib may help control&#xD;
      the disease in patients with pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of calaspargase pegol-mknl in combination&#xD;
      with cobimetinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety of calaspargase pegol-mknl in combination with cobimetinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess preliminary response to treatment with calaspargase pegol-mknl and cobimetinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To monitor levels of plasma asparaginase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate therapy induced changes in the tumor and tumor ecosystem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive calaspargase pegol-mknl intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1 and&#xD;
      cobimetinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up&#xD;
      to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
