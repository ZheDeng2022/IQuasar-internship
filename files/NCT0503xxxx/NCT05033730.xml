  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventilation through the small endotracheal tube is not an uncommon situation. The indications&#xD;
      for it differ from elective upper airway surgery to emergency ventilation through needle&#xD;
      cricothyrotomy. Conventionally, ventilation through small endotracheal tubes has been&#xD;
      challenging by jet ventilation with subsequent risk of barotrauma and inadequate gas&#xD;
      exchange. Expiration during jet ventilation occurs passively.&#xD;

      Upper airway endoscopy (micro laryngoscopy (MLS), pan endoscopy) is a minor upper airway&#xD;
      procedure needing short duration general anesthesia, small calibrate endotracheal tube and&#xD;
      manipulation of the airway. Because of airway manipulation and the surgery involves the&#xD;
      airway, which is being shared with the anesthesiologist, there is a risk of interruption of&#xD;
      ventilation, oxygenation and loss of airway in addition to inherent complications of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the patients will receive information about the study and informed consent will be&#xD;
      taken. The patients will be randomized. In the control group, (group A) ventilation will be&#xD;
      performed according to the routine big endotracheal tube. In the treatment group (group B),&#xD;
      the ultra-thin ventilation tube will be placed using laryngoscopy. All other treatment will&#xD;
      be unchanged. Data collection will be started 5 min after the initiation of the study.&#xD;
      Demographic data, Past medical history, and examinations data will be collected after&#xD;
      acceptance of the patient to be enrolled into the study and other ventilation parameters will&#xD;
      be collected 5 min after the start of the the study which is Skin incision Primary endpoint&#xD;
      is; to evaluate whether the Flow Controlled Ventilation (FCV) can also achieve adequate&#xD;
      oxygenation and ventilation through small tube or not.&#xD;

    <description>Patients who are scheduled for elective surgical upper airway surgery will be given General Anesthesia by an anesthesiologist who is the principal investigator and the surgical procedures will be done by the same ENT surgeon. IV Induction of Anesthesia with Propofol Target controlled infusion (TCI), Remifentanil Target controlled infusion (TCI) and Rocuronium (0.5mg/Kg) for muscle relaxation. The airway will be secured with cuffed endotracheal tube after direct laryngoscopy. After intubation by a Suitable size Endotracheal tube, they will be mechanically ventilated using Volume Controlled Ventilation (VCV) with 40% Oxygen and minute ventilation adjusted to keep ETCO2 of 40 mmHg or less, and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O.</description>
