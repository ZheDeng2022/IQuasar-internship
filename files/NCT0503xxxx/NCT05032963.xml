  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with schizophrenia display a wide range of neurocognitive difficulties resulting&#xD;
      in functional impairment and disability. Extensive evidence indicates insomnia and sleep&#xD;
      disturbances play a substantial role in degrading cognitive functioning. However, the&#xD;
      putative impact of insomnia and sleep disturbances on neurocognition and daily functioning&#xD;
      has not been investigated in people with schizophrenia. The goal of this study is to&#xD;
      characterize sleep in individuals with schizophrenia and quantify its impact on&#xD;
      neurocognition and daily functioning.&#xD;

      Individuals with SZ display a broad range of neurocognitive difficulties that have been&#xD;
      identified as major determinants of poor functioning and disability, thus representing an&#xD;
      important public health concern and a focal target for interventions. Extensive research&#xD;
      literatures converge in highlighting the critical role insomnia and sleep disturbances play&#xD;
      in degrading neurocognitive functioning. Such sleep disturbances result in clinical&#xD;
      presentations similar to neurocognitive difficulties commonly observed in people with SZ.&#xD;
      While insomnia and sleep disturbances are highly prevalent in people with SZ, there are scant&#xD;
      data on the impact of sleep disturbances on neurocognition in SZ, and no data quantifying&#xD;
      their influence on daily functioning. Thus, sleep disturbances remain poorly understood and&#xD;
      modeled in SZ, their impact is rarely considered in clinical trials, and they remain largely&#xD;
      unaddressed by clinicians. To address this gap in knowledge, the primary aim of this study is&#xD;
      to characterize sleep in individuals with SZ and quantify its impact on neurocognition and&#xD;
      daily functioning. Employing an experimental, within-person, repeated assessment design, the&#xD;
      study team will characterize sleep architecture, duration, and quality along with cognitive,&#xD;
      electrophysiological, biomarkers and daily functioning sequelae in 40 individuals with SZ.&#xD;
      Participants will first complete a week-long, in-home characterization of sleep duration and&#xD;
      quality using actigraphy and a sleep diary. Next, they will complete two overnight&#xD;
      polysomnography examinations employing two sleep schedules:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) undisturbed sleep; and 2) restricted sleep (4 hours). As part of these assessments,&#xD;
      participants will provide blood samples for biomarkers analyses and complete EEG-indexed&#xD;
      memory tasks pre- and post-sleep, along with a post-sleep battery of neurocognitive&#xD;
      functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, participants will complete a 3-day ambulatory assessment using actigraphy and&#xD;
      smartphones to explore the impact of each sleep schedule on &quot;real-world&quot; daily functioning&#xD;
      including symptoms, emotion regulation, and mood.&#xD;

    <description>The composite score of the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) will serve as a primary neurocognitive outcome. Neurocognitive functioning is indexed on the MCCB via T scores, with a mean of 50 and a SD of 10. Thus, higher scores indicate better neurocognitive performance, with T-scores of 70+ (i.e., 2 SD's over the mean) suggestive of exceptionally strong neurocognitive abilities.</description>
