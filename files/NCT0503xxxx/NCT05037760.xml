    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      KER-050 as monotherapy or in combination with ruxolitinib in participants with Myelofibrosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      KER-050 is an investigational therapeutic protein designed to increase red blood cell and&#xD;
      platelet production by inhibiting the signaling of a subset of the transforming growth factor&#xD;
      beta (TGF-ß) family of proteins to promote hematopoiesis. It is being developed for the&#xD;
      treatment of low blood cell counts, or cytopenias including anemia and thrombocytopenia in&#xD;
      patients with Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Myelofibrosis (MF)&#xD;
