      Re-evaluation of patients treated with intralymphatic immunotherapy (ILIT) in terms of&#xD;
      quality of life and therapeutic efficacy and comparison with subcutaneous immunotherapy&#xD;
      (SCIT) 15 years post immunotherapy&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In Switzerland, around 20% of the population suffers from hay fever. The allergy usually&#xD;
      begins in childhood and can worsen or improve as the child grows. The quality of life of&#xD;
      those affected suffers greatly. Since the allergens are seasonally found in the air, patients&#xD;
      cannot really avoid the source of the allergy. On the one hand, allergic rhinitis can be&#xD;
      treated pharmacologically. On the other hand allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT)&#xD;
      (=desensitization), can be considered. AIT can greatly reduce the symptoms and restore the&#xD;
      patient's quality of life. It is the only treatment method that can offer long-term&#xD;
      therapeutic success without the need for regular medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) is the traditional method in which the allergen is&#xD;
      administered subcutaneously over a period of three to four years with alternating treatment&#xD;
      intervals. The chances of success are good, but the drop-out rate is comparatively high due&#xD;
      to the long treatment period (at least 3 and up to 5 years). In contrast, intralymphatic&#xD;
      immunotherapy (ILIT) requires only three sessions over a period of three to four months. The&#xD;
      allergen is administered by ultrasound directly into a lymph node. The results are equally&#xD;
      good (compared to SCIT), but the treatment time is much shorter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the following project, the quality of life of the people who participated in the first&#xD;
      ever ILIT study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00470457) will be evaluated. The aim is to&#xD;
      have a meaningful result on the duration of the therapeutic effect, as judged by the patients&#xD;
      themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop a meaningful result, a questionnaire was designed for patients to fill out at&#xD;
      baseline (prior to pollen season). This shold allow assessmen of how each individual's&#xD;
      quality of life has evolved since treatment. The study subjects will also receive a&#xD;
      standardised (European) questionnaire. This questionnaire refers to the quality of life and&#xD;
      symptoms of the last seven days and is filled out at baseline (prior to season) and in season&#xD;
      (Mai-June). The data will be analysed and presented to the scientific and clinical audience&#xD;
      as soon as possible.&#xD;
