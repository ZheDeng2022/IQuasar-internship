  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus&#xD;
      2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first identified in Wuhan, China. It rapidly spread, resulting a global&#xD;
      pandemic in March 2020. Globally, till 27 August 2021, there have been 214,468,601 confirmed&#xD;
      cases of COVID-19, including 4,470,969 deaths, reported to WHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the absence of curative treatment for COVID-19 infection the development of safe and&#xD;
      effective vaccines is critical to ending the COVID-19 pandemic. The Pfizer/BioNtech Comirnaty&#xD;
      vaccine was listed for WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) on 31 December 2020. The&#xD;
      SII/Covishield and AstraZeneca/AZD1222 vaccines (developed by AstraZeneca/Oxford and&#xD;
      manufactured by the State Institute of India and SK Bio respectively) were given EUL on 16&#xD;
      February. The Janssen/Ad26.COV 2.S developed by Johnson &amp; Johnson, was listed for EUL on 12&#xD;
      March 2021. The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA 1273) was listed for EUL on 30 April 2021 and&#xD;
      the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine was listed for EUL on 7 May 2021. The Sinopharm vaccine is&#xD;
      produced by Beijing Bio-Institute of Biological Products Co Ltd, subsidiary of China National&#xD;
      Biotec Group (CNBG). The Sinovac-CoronaVac was listed for EUL on 1 June 2021. As of 25 August&#xD;
      2021, a total of 4,953,887,422 vaccine doses have been administered. In large,&#xD;
      randomized-controlled trials, vaccines were found to be safe and efficacious in preventing&#xD;
      symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, a small percentage of fully vaccinated persons will develop symptomatic or&#xD;
      asymptomatic infections with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. A vaccine&#xD;
      breakthrough infection is defined as the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen in a&#xD;
      respiratory specimen collected from a person ≥14 days after receipt of all recommended doses&#xD;
      of an FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccine. A total of 10,262 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine breakthrough&#xD;
      infections had been reported from 46 U.S. states and territories as of April 30, 2021. Among&#xD;
      these cases, 6,446 (63%) occurred in females, and the median patient age was 58 years&#xD;
      (interquartile range = 40-74 years). Based on preliminary data, 2,725 (27%) vaccine&#xD;
      breakthrough infections were asymptomatic, 995 (10%) patients were known to be hospitalized,&#xD;
      and 160 (2%) patients died.&#xD;
