  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many premature infants require respiratory support in the newborn period. Mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation although life-saving is linked to complications for the lungs and other organs&#xD;
      and its duration should be kept to a minimum. The use of supplemental oxygen may also&#xD;
      increase the risk of comorbidities such as retinopathy of prematurity. Therefore, oxygen&#xD;
      saturation levels and the amount of inspired oxygen concentration provided should be&#xD;
      continuously monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxygen control can be performed manually or with the use of a computer software incorporated&#xD;
      into the ventilator that is called 'closed loop automated oxygen control'(CLAC). The software&#xD;
      uses an algorithm that automatically adjusts the amount of inspired oxygen to maintain oxygen&#xD;
      saturation levels in a target range. Evidence suggests that CLAC increases the time spent in&#xD;
      the desired oxygen target range but there are no data to determine the effect on important&#xD;
      clinical outcomes. A previous study has also demonstrated that CLAC reduces the inspired&#xD;
      oxygen concentration more rapidly when compared to manual control. That could help infants&#xD;
      come off the ventilator sooner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this study we want to compare the time preterm infants spend on the ventilator when we&#xD;
      use the software to automatically monitor their oxygen levels with those infants whose oxygen&#xD;
      is adjusted manually by the clinical team. That could help us understand if the use of&#xD;
      automated oxygen control reduces the duration of mechanical ventilation and subsequently the&#xD;
      complications related to it.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomised controlled trial. The investigators aim to recruit a minimum of&#xD;
      seventy premature ventilated infants born at less than 31 weeks gestation. Participants will&#xD;
      be randomised to either closed-loop automated oxygen control or manually controlled oxygen&#xD;
      from recruitment to successful extubation. The investigators will also record basic&#xD;
      epidemiologic parameters and associated comorbidities that may impact on the duration of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation. Infants with known congenital anomalies will be excluded from the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed written consent will be requested from the parents or legal guardians of the infants&#xD;
      and the attending Neonatal Consultant will be requested to assent to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible infants whose parents consent to the study will be enrolled within 48 hours of&#xD;
      initiation of mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will be performed using an online randomisation generator. Patients will be&#xD;
      ventilated using SLE6000 ventilators. Ventilation settings will be manually adjusted by the&#xD;
      clinical team as per unit's protocol. The intervention group, in addition to standard care&#xD;
      will be also connected to the OxyGenie closed-loop oxygen saturation monitoring software&#xD;
      (SLE). This software uses oxygen saturations from the SpO2 probe attached to the neonate, fed&#xD;
      into an algorithm, to automatically adjust the percentage of inspired oxygen to maintain&#xD;
      oxygen saturations within the target range. Manual adjustments including the percentage of&#xD;
      FiO2 will be allowed at any point during the study if deemed appropriate by the clinical&#xD;
      team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nurse-to-patient ratio will be according to the unit's protocol that is determined on the&#xD;
      patient's acuity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be studied from enrolment until successful extubation. If an infant fails&#xD;
      extubation and requires reintubation within 48 hours, he will be studied in his initial arm&#xD;
      if less than 28 days old. Therefore, for those infants randomised at the intervention group&#xD;
      CLAC will resume. Preterm infants that remain ventilated beyond day 28 of life will continue&#xD;
      at their study arm (closed-loop automated oxygen control or manual oxygen control) till their&#xD;
      first extubation attempt.&#xD;
