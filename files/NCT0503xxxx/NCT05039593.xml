  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many problems may develop in patients due to mechanical ventilation in intensive care units.&#xD;
      These include ventilator-associated pneumonia, decreased cerebral perfusion, venous air&#xD;
      embolism, sinus and eye infections, neuromuscular dysfunctions and skin sores may be seen in&#xD;
      intensive care patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. If adequate oral hygiene is not&#xD;
      provided in patients on mechanical ventilation support, dry mouth, halitosis, disruption of&#xD;
      tissue integrity in and around the mouth, intraoral infections and periodontal diseases may&#xD;
      occur. Most importantly, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VIP) may develop in patients&#xD;
      dependent on mechanical ventilation due to deficient oral care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chlorhexidine solution is widely used in oral care. However, there is a need for evidence&#xD;
      about the frequency of oral care with which chlorhexidine solution on oral mucous membrane&#xD;
      integrity in patients under mechanical ventilation support. Oral care frequency was not&#xD;
      examined in these existing studies. Therefore, this study was planned to determine the effect&#xD;
      of three different oral care frequencies on the integrity of the oral mucous membrane in&#xD;
      patients connected to mechanical ventilators.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral hygiene is one of the applications where the individual needs the most hygienic care.&#xD;
      Providing oral care and maintaining oral hygiene improves the comfort and quality of life by&#xD;
      ensuring that the individual eats healthy and feels well.Inadequate oral care can negatively&#xD;
      affect all these, as well as cause problems such as dry mouth, dental caries, periodontal&#xD;
      diseases, bad breath and stomatitis.Therefore, in order to maintain oral health, individuals&#xD;
      must perform oral care effectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nurses need to have adequate oral intake to maintain the integrity of the oral mucosa,&#xD;
      especially in patients who cannot be fed orally, with fluid restriction, administered&#xD;
      nasogastric tube, mouth breathing, receiving oxygen therapy, undergoing oral and&#xD;
      maxillofacial surgery, undergoing radiation therapy, chemotherapy, in the terminal period, in&#xD;
      coma, and in patients dependent on mechanical ventilator. care must be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Defense mechanisms in intensive care patients are affected by their disease and multiple&#xD;
      interventions that circumvent natural host defenses. Treatments applied in intensive care&#xD;
      units, lack of fluid intake of the patient, and some materials used for treatment and care&#xD;
      cause changes in the oral mucous membrane. Inadequate protective mechanisms in patients can&#xD;
      lead to both local and systemic complications such as caries, periodontal disease, oral&#xD;
      mucosal infections, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacterial oropharyngeal colonization progressively changes to tracheal colonization leading&#xD;
      to ventilator-associated pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Especially in patients connected to mechanical ventilators, the entry of bacteria into the&#xD;
      respiratory tract is facilitated and increased due to the endotracheal tube, causing the&#xD;
      coughing reflex and mucociliar activity to be impaired and secretion to increase. In this&#xD;
      case, gram-positive bacteria that make up the normal flora in the oral mucosa are replaced by&#xD;
      gram-negative bacteria, causing changes in the oral flora and plaque formation on the teeth.&#xD;
      Therefore, oral care becomes much more important.The solution and frequency to be used gain&#xD;
      importance for oral care to be effective on the integrity of the oral mucous membrane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, it is recommended to use chlorhexidine gluconate solution in oral care to&#xD;
      prevent the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia in mechanically ventilated&#xD;
      patients.However, there is no evidence on how often oral care should be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the literature is reviewed, further studies with conclusive evidence to show how often&#xD;
      chlorhexidine gluconate is effective are needed. For this reason, this study was planned to&#xD;
      determine the effect of three different oral care frequencies on the integrity of the oral&#xD;
      mucous membrane in patients dependent on mechanical ventilators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research is planned to be carried out between 01.06.2021 and 01.06.2022 in the internal&#xD;
      medicine intensive care unit of Aydın Adnan Menderes University Practice and Research&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population of the research is the patients hospitalized in the Internal Medicine&#xD;
      intensive care unit of Aydın Adnan Menderes University Practice and Research Hospital between&#xD;
      01.06.2021 and 01.06.2022, and the sample is; Patients who are older than 18 years of age,&#xD;
      who are in the first 24 hours of mechanical ventilation, who are 18 years of age and older,&#xD;
      and whose relatives have consented. The sample of the research; Patients with&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and oral aphthae, stomatitis, candiasis, gingivitis who have had&#xD;
      an oral surgical procedure will not be accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting the practice in this study, the purpose of the research will be explained to&#xD;
      all nurses working in the unit by the researchers and an information meeting about oral care&#xD;
      will be held. After the operability of the guide in the intensive care unit is ensured, the&#xD;
      data collection phase will begin. Randomization of patients will be done by the nurse in&#xD;
      charge of the service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frequency of oral care of the patients will be in three groups. Oral care will be done&#xD;
      twice a day for the patients in the first group, 3 times a day for the patients in the second&#xD;
      group, and 4 times a day for the patients in the third group. Oral care of the patients will&#xD;
      be applied according to the guide used in the training given to the nurses. In oral care,&#xD;
      0.12% chlorhexidine solution will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concentration of 0.12% of the chlorhexidine gluconate solution planned to be used in the&#xD;
      research is the most frequently used form compared to the other concentrations of the&#xD;
      solution. And no side effects were noted in the studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason, 0.12% chlorhexidine solution was preferred. When the literature is examined,&#xD;
      this density was preferred because it is the most frequently used solution in the oral care&#xD;
      of patients under mechanical ventilation support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oral mucosa of the patients will be evaluated with the Oral Evaluation Scale by the&#xD;
      researcher before the first oral care application every morning for four days. According to&#xD;
      the score obtained from the scale, the researcher will evaluate the patients as normal oral&#xD;
      mucosa, mild dysfunction, moderate dysfunction and severe dysfunction.&#xD;
