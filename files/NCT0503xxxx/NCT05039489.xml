      This study is dedicated to exploring the brain mechanism of medication-resistant auditory&#xD;
      hallucinations and developing effective treatment methods for them by using both&#xD;
      cross-sectional and longitudinal designs. The continuous theta burst stimulation(cTBS)&#xD;
      treatment mode, with the left cerebellum Crus II as the stimulation target, is applied to&#xD;
      treat the schizophrenia patients with the medication-resistant auditory hallucinations. At&#xD;
      the same time, the first-episode schizophrenia patients with auditory hallucinations were&#xD;
      recruited as a test cohort to examine that brain mechanism of general auditory hallucinations&#xD;
      in schizophrenia may be the structural and functional abnormalities in the temporoparietal&#xD;
      circuit.&#xD;

      Previous studies have shown that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targeted&#xD;
      at the temporal-parietal junction can effectively treat genenal auditory hallucinations in&#xD;
      schizophrenia, but it is not the case for medication-resistant auditory hallucinations.&#xD;
      Studies suggested that rTMS targeted at the left Crus II might be effective for&#xD;
      medication-resistant auditory hallucinations. This study is dedicated to exploring the brain&#xD;
      mechanism of medication-resistant auditory hallucinations and developing effective treatment&#xD;
      methods for them by using both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs. The continuous theta&#xD;
      burst stimulation(cTBS) treatment mode, with the left cerebellum Crus II as the stimulation&#xD;
      target, is applied to treat the schizophrenia patients with the medication-resistant auditory&#xD;
      hallucinations. Assessment with symptomatology, neuropsychology, neuroimaging, and machine&#xD;
      learning methods is utilized to examine the investigators hypothesis that structural and&#xD;
      functional abnormalities of the cerebral cortico-cerebellar-thalamic-cortical circuit (CCTCC)&#xD;
      may contribute to brain mechanism of medication-resistant auditory hallucinations in&#xD;
      schizophrenia. At the same time, the first-episode schizophrenia patients with auditory&#xD;
      hallucinations were recruited as a test cohort to examine that brain mechanism of general&#xD;
      auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia may be the structural and functional abnormalities&#xD;
      in the temporoparietal circuit, whereas structural and functional abnormalities of the CCTCC&#xD;
      may contribute to brain mechanism of medication-resistant auditory hallucinations in&#xD;
      schizophrenia.&#xD;
