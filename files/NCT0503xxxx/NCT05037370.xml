    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized contralateral double-masked study. Each patient will be&#xD;
      randomized as to which eye undergoes wave-front optimized (WFO) vs. wave-front guided (WFG)&#xD;
      during Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) or Laser-assisted in situ Keratomileusis (LASIK)&#xD;
      surgery to determine which ablation profile provides the best visual outcome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2015, the FDA approved a new laser ablation profile for performing laser corneal&#xD;
      refractive surgery. Multiple sophisticated profiles have been developed in an attempt to&#xD;
      optimize visual outcomes and reduce post-operative lower and higher-order optical&#xD;
      aberrations. Among these include wave-front optimized (WFO) and wave-front guided (WFG)&#xD;
      ablation profiles. The former compensated for corneal curvature to reduce spherical&#xD;
      aberration and the latter, a more complicated ablation profile, was designed to minimize&#xD;
      specific aberrations in an individual eye. Topographic profiles have also been used for over&#xD;
      17 years. These profiles consider the shape of the anterior corneal surface. The newest such&#xD;
      topographic ablation profile, Contoura Vision, is a topography guided (TG) profile that,&#xD;
      based on over 22,000 curvature data points captured using the VARIO Topolyzer, individualizes&#xD;
      the ablation pattern. For comparison, WFO uses a patient's estimated average corneal&#xD;
      curvature alone to create an ablation pattern. The addition of the VARIO Topolyzer adds a&#xD;
      significant increase of pre-operative patient preparation. Anecdotally, between 1-3hrs of&#xD;
      additional technician hours are required to prepare a patient for the Contoura Vision TG&#xD;
      ablation profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective randomized contralateral double-masked study. Patients will&#xD;
      undergo the same standard of care preoperative evaluation and education as any other patient&#xD;
      not enrolled in the study. The physician performing surgery will choose either LASIK or PRK,&#xD;
      taking into account patient preference, preoperative data and overall clinical picture,&#xD;
      ultimately choosing which is best for the patient. If a patient qualifies for both, the&#xD;
      patient may choose either LASIK or PRK. Each patient will be randomized as to which eye&#xD;
      undergoes a WFO treatment vs Contoura. At the time of surgery the patient will be blinded as&#xD;
      to which eye receives which treatment, but the surgical team will not be blinded as to which&#xD;
      procedure is performed. Post-operatively, the ophthalmic technicians and optometrists&#xD;
      responsible for postoperative examinations (measurement of visual acuity, refractions,&#xD;
      transcription of PRO's) will be blinded as to which eye underwent Contoura vs WFO. While&#xD;
      treatments will vary, both have the same safety profile. Both involve sophisticated lasers to&#xD;
      change the shape of the cornea to achieve the desired outcome. The variance comes in the type&#xD;
      of pattern the laser uses to treat each individual. All post-operative care will be standard&#xD;
      of care with medications being the same as if the patient were not enrolled in the study.&#xD;
      Post-operative evaluations will take place at postoperative day 1, week 1, month 1, month 3,&#xD;
      and month 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data collected will be standard pre- and post-operative ophthalmic refractive surgery&#xD;
      measurements. This includes a standard medical history, especially to include prior eye&#xD;
      surgeries or diseases. Pre-operative measurements include vision assessments, contrast&#xD;
      sensitivity, pre- and post-dilation as well as keratometry and axial length measurements. The&#xD;
      Contoura requires a separate set of data collection via the VARIO topolyzer. Intraoperative&#xD;
      data collected will include variables such as actual treatment outcomes and laser settings.&#xD;
      Post-operative measurements will consist of many of the same measurements as those obtained&#xD;
      preoperatively including uncorrected and corrected visual acuity, and refractive&#xD;
      measurements. A symptoms-based questionnaire specific to corrective eye surgery (PROWL) will&#xD;
      be given to patients before and after surgery during routine follow-ups. Each PROWL is&#xD;
      specific to an individual eye, not specific to the surgery performed in each eye (i.e. the&#xD;
      same PROWL questionnaire will be used regardless of whether the patient underwent PRK or&#xD;
      LASIK). All PROWL data will be compared pre- and post-operatively and will be stratified&#xD;
      based on surgery.&#xD;
