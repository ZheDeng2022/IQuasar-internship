  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main symptom of patients with advanced esophageal cancer is eating obstruction. In&#xD;
      clinical practice, patients need to wait for a long time before anti-tumor treatment, which&#xD;
      will lead to a rapid decline in the quality of life and nutritional status of patients, and&#xD;
      severe patients sometimes need to place nasointestinal feeding tubes or endoscopic stents.&#xD;
      EGCG has been shown to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor effects . The&#xD;
      complex effects of EGCG may improve esophageal obstruction during the waiting period before&#xD;
      antineoplastic therapy. The purpose of this phase I study was to explore the safety,&#xD;
      recommended dose and preliminary efficacy of EGCG solution in the treatment of esophageal&#xD;
      obstruction.&#xD;

    <description>We have chosen a dose of 880 umol/L as the lower limit for this phase I study by referring to previous studies. Six dose levels for EGCG were defined as following: 880, 1760, 2640, 3430, and 4400 umol/L per dose. Dose escalation proceeded according to a standard phase I design with three patients initially treated on each tier. If, on any dose tier of EGCG, two of three patients or two of six patients experienced a grade III or IV toxicity due to EGCG, dose escalation of EGCG would cease. The maximally tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as the highest dose with fewer than one-third of patients experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) due to EGCG. EGCG solution was given continuously for 8 days before anti-tumor treatment.</description>

    <description>EGCG use various concentrations dissolved in 0.9% saline solution three times a day. A new batch is made up each time. For esophageal application, repeated swallowing of 10 ml of the EGCG solution is indispensable to assure the prolonged presence of drug the esophageal walls.</description>
