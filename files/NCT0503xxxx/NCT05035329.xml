      This study was conducted in order to analyze the validity and reliability, and psychometric&#xD;
      properties of the Turkish version of the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS-T) in elder&#xD;
      adults. The LEFS was translated and cross-culturally adapted to Turkish. Totally 214 elders&#xD;
      were included in the study. The LEFS-T, Five-Times-Sit-to-Stand Test (FTSTS), and Falls&#xD;
      Efficacy Scale International (FES-I) were applied to all older adults. Item-total&#xD;
      correlations of factors and Cronbach alpha internal consistency coefficients were determined&#xD;
      to examine the reliability. The relationship between the LEFS-T, FTSTS, and FES-I was&#xD;
      analyzed. Exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used for construct&#xD;
      validity. Spearman Correlation Analysis was used for concurrent validity. Davis technique was&#xD;
      used to calculate the content validity index. Floor and ceiling effect were calculated. It&#xD;
      has been concluded that the LEFS-T has good psychometric qualities and can be recommended as&#xD;
      a choice of measurement tool to assess self-reported physical functioning in elder adults.&#xD;

      Purpose: This study was conducted in order to analyze the validity and reliability, and&#xD;

      (LEFS-T) in elder adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The LEFS was translated and cross-culturally adapted to Turkish. Totally 214 elders&#xD;
      were included in the study. The LEFS-T, Five-Times-Sit-to-Stand Test (FTSTS), and Falls&#xD;
      Efficacy Scale International (FES-I) were applied to all older adults. Item-total&#xD;

    <description>The Lower Extremity Functional Scale was translated and cross-culturally adapted to Turkish. Items are scored as a 5-point Likert Scale (0 = extreme difficulty/ unable to perform an activity, 4 = no difficulty). The highest total score of 80 indicates that the person has a high functional level.</description>

    <description>The elders were instructed to stand from a standard chair five consecutive times as fast as possible.The duration of the test was recorded in terms of seconds. Less duration means better performance.</description>
