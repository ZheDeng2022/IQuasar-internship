    <textblock>
      Healsea® Children is a seawater-based nasal spray supplemented with a natural Symbiofilm®&#xD;
      extract (0.02%) isolated from marine bacteria. Symbiofilm® is an exopolymeric composition&#xD;
      with emulsifying properties, in vitro antibiofilm activity and detachment properties against&#xD;
      various bacterial pathogens involved in respiratory tract infections. Symbiofilm® has no&#xD;
      bacteriostatic nor bactericidal activities. Healsea® Children is indicated in the cleaning&#xD;
      and moistening of nasal mucosa during common cold and rhinitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The common cold is an acute viral infection of the upper respiratory tract, involving, to&#xD;
      variable degrees, sneezing, nasal congestion and discharge (rhinorrhea), sore throat, cough,&#xD;
      low-grade fever, headache, and malaise (1). It can be caused by members of several families&#xD;
      of viruses; the most common are rhinoviruses. Acute viral rhinitis is generally&#xD;
      self-limiting. In children where the illness is not self-limiting and extends beyond 7-10&#xD;
      days, many agree that a bacterial infection is likely (1). Bacterial over infections and&#xD;
      progression to a chronic state are favoured by the formation of biofilms, which facilitate&#xD;
      bacterial growth and persistence as well as reducing antibiotic efficacy (2-3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allergic diseases may play a particular role in promoting the respiratory infection&#xD;
      recurrences (4). The physiological immune response is impaired in allergic subjects and&#xD;
      allergic inflammation favours predisposition to respiratory infections. Subjects with&#xD;
      allergic disorders may have functional defect of type 1 immune response that is relevant in&#xD;
      fighting infections (5-6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allergic rhinitis (AR) may affect up to 40% of the paediatric population. Nasal symptoms are&#xD;
      caused by exposure to an allergen to which a patient is sensitized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AR is characterized by typical nasal symptoms and immunoglobulin E (IgE) -mediated&#xD;
      inflammation. The allergic inflammatory process releases many cytokines and other&#xD;
      proinflammatory proteins. Inflammation caused by nasal allergy leads to obstruction, fluid&#xD;
      accumulation and acute disease. If these diseases are unsuccessfully treated, a chronic state&#xD;
      of inflammation, obstruction, and infection develops that can cause mucosal damage and,&#xD;
      ultimately, chronic disease (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these reasons, the paediatric IgE-dependent allergic population that is more prone to&#xD;
      common cold represents a suitable target for Healsea® Children (8-9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this prospective post-market clinical investigation, IgE-dependent allergic children&#xD;
      with early symptoms of infectious rhinitis will be followed, children being treated with&#xD;
      Healsea® Children on top of common cold conventional therapies or with conventional therapies&#xD;
      only (excluded nasal irrigation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional therapies for non-complicated infectious rhinitis are symptomatic but are not&#xD;
      without side effects. For example, decongestant use can increase blood pressure,&#xD;
      antihistamine intake is associated with drowsiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healsea® Children represents an interesting alternative that can not only improve acute&#xD;
      infectious rhinitis symptomatology but could also limit the complication and progression to&#xD;
      chronic state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This non interventional post-market clinical investigation aimed to confirm the benefit of&#xD;
      Healsea® Children in a real life setting in children with perennial allergy.&#xD;
