  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a descriptive, observational, longitudinal, prospective study consecutively enrolling&#xD;
      patients with non-specific neck pain and age-matched asymptomatic participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will register sensorimotor control variables, including active range of&#xD;
      motion, movement speed, acceleration, smoothness of motion, head repositioning accuracy and&#xD;
      motion coupling patterns. These variables will be recorded by means of Inertial Measurement&#xD;
      Unit (IMU) sensors during the following tests consecutively performed in two measuring&#xD;
      sessions separated by 12 months: (a) kinematics of planar movements, (b) kinematics of the&#xD;
      craniocervical flexion movement, (c) kinematics during functional tasks and (d) kinematics of&#xD;
      task-oriented neck movements in response to visual targets.&#xD;

    <measure>Active range of motion</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Expressed as an angular displacement (°) in 3 full-movements (flexion-extension, lateral flexion and rotation)</description>

    <measure>Movement speed</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>

  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Head repositioning accuracy</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Calculated as the repositioning error considering the difference between the neutral starting position and the following positions reached after the performance of any of the movements</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Motion coupling patterns</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Calculated as the angular displacement occurring in a different anatomical plane to the one that is being tested for each of the planar movements</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical activity level</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). The score of the scale is expressed in MET level x minutes of activity/day x days per week. Levels of 3.3 METs are considered light, 4.0 METs are moderate and 8.0 METs are vigorous.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fear of movement and injury</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK-11). It consists of 11 questions scored from 1 to 4. Therefore, a score of 11 is the lowest possible level of kinesiphobia, while 44 is the highest.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain-related fear-avoidance</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the Fear Avoidance Components Scale (FACS). It has 20 itemsmeasured on a 6-point Likert scale for total possible score of 100 and the lowest possible score of 0. Higher scores indicate higher levels of fear avoidance.</description>
