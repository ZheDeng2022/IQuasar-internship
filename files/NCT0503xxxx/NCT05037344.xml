      and an age of 6 to 18 years. Sessions are verified with teleconferencing with an&#xD;
      psychotherapist, children and their parents. The psychotherapy is supported by an App and a&#xD;
      wristband to obtain psychophysiological data. The investigators have already successfully&#xD;
      performed a feasibility study.The goal of the current proposal is to develop an internet and&#xD;
      smart phone delivered CBT (iCBT) for the treatment of pediatric OCD on the bases of the&#xD;
      feasibility study. Internal testing on iCBT therapy package and developmental workchanges has&#xD;
      been done. The investigators are now evaluating effectiveness in an RCT.&#xD;

      In this study the investigators test effectiveness of an internet-based therapy approach for&#xD;
      children with obsessive-compulsive disorders in an RCT design with a waiting control group.&#xD;
      The investigators are planninng the investigation of 20 patients in each group.Therapy is&#xD;
      verified by experts via teleconferences and a therapy app. Outcomes for the treatment group&#xD;
      are evaluated before randomization (baseline, t0), 16 weeks (end of treatment, t1), 32 weeks&#xD;
      (follow-up 1, t2), and 48 weeks after randomization (follow-up 2, t3). For the waiting&#xD;
      list-group, outcomes are measured before the first randomization (baseline), at 16 weeks&#xD;
      (waiting list period), 32 weeks (end of treatment), 48 weeks after the first randomization&#xD;
      (follow-up I) and 64 weeks after the first randomization (follow-up II).&#xD;
