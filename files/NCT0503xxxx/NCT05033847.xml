  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is randomized, blinded and controlled design. Among the randomly selected subjects who&#xD;
      have been vaccinated with two doses of Inactivated COVID-19 vaccine (Vero cell), based on a&#xD;
      step-wise approach, the subjects will receive one dose of recombinant COVID-19 vaccine&#xD;
      sequentially at different shedules of 1-3 months, 3-6 months and ≥ 6 months after two doses&#xD;
      of vaccination, and the subjects vaccinated at different schedules will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to different sequential immunization groups. At the same time, each sequential immunization&#xD;
      group will be matched with a control group with the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine (vero cells)&#xD;
      as the booster dose.&#xD;
