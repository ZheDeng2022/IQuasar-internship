  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Choledocholithiasis is a common and frequently occurring disease in China, accounting for&#xD;
      15.3% ~ 31.7% of the total cholelithiasis.According to its source, can be divided into&#xD;
      primary and secondary choledocholithiasis.For large choledocholithiasis, it is difficult to&#xD;
      remove all calculi after dilatation of large diameter balloon or mechanical stone following&#xD;
      alone.Therefore, we used the method of balloon dilation combined with mechanical lithotripsy&#xD;
      after EST.There are few researches on the sequence of balloon dilation and mechanical&#xD;
      lithotripsy at home and abroad, and there is no unified standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through the ERCP balloon expansion of duodenal papilla sphincter and mechanical lithotripsy&#xD;
      in the treatment of common bile duct calculi in patients with clinical observation, the&#xD;
      balloon expansion and mechanical lithotripsy time order of take stone, stone residues rate&#xD;
      and the influence of recent complications such as postoperative pancreatitis, ERCP in the&#xD;
      treatment of huge stones optimization procedure was formulated.&#xD;
