  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The concept of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) is utilizing in multiple specialties&#xD;
      widely. Early tracheal extubation is one of the components of ERAS that enhances&#xD;
      postoperative recovery and reduces the length of stay in intensive care unit&#xD;
      (ICU).Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective, shorter-acting Î±2-adrenergic receptor agonist&#xD;
      that has both analgesic and sedativeeffects.It was associated with decreased mortality, time&#xD;
      to extubation, and hospital length of stay in cardiac surgical patients according to previous&#xD;
      studies.The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of perioperative&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine on patients undergoing minimally invasive cardiac surgery(MICS) who were&#xD;
      early extubated after surgery.&#xD;

        Patients were eligible for inclusion if they had undergone minimal invasive off-pump&#xD;
        coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), valvular surgery or combined procedures at Far Eastern&#xD;
        Memorial Hospital, New Taipei City, Taiwan between January 1, 2020 and August 31, 2020.&#xD;
        Additionally patients were included if they were aged 20 years or older and were excluded&#xD;
        if it was emergency surgery, if they had postoperative mechanical ventilation more than 6&#xD;
        hours or if they were extubated in the operating room.&#xD;
