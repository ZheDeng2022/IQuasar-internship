  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parenting stress is a well-documented barrier to youth engagement in community-based&#xD;
      substance use treatment. The current project aims to develop and evaluate a mobile health&#xD;
      parenting stress intervention for caregivers of justice-involved youth, a population with&#xD;
      high rates of substance use and low rates of treatment engagement.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Justice-involved youth exhibit high rates of substance use and mental health symptoms, yet&#xD;
      few receive treatment during detention or community re-entry. Once released into the&#xD;
      community, caregivers must facilitate youth's treatment engagement, mobilizing significant&#xD;
      resources and facing many barriers (e.g., transportation, mistrust) to do so. Parenting&#xD;
      stress, which is heightened during youth detention and community reentry, is associated with&#xD;
      greater perceived barriers to treatment, less youth therapeutic change throughout treatment,&#xD;
      and premature treatment dropout. Addressing parenting stress improves youth treatment&#xD;
      engagement and outcomes among youth exhibiting antisocial behavior, yet given the many&#xD;
      barriers to treatment, novel approaches to intervention are needed; mobile health (mHealth)&#xD;
      technology is one promising approach. Caregivers of justice-involved youth and system&#xD;
      stakeholders are interested in mHealth treatment and mHealth addresses instrumental barriers&#xD;
      (e.g., transportation) to treatment. Advances in technology and community engaged research&#xD;
      allow for active stakeholder collaboration in mHealth application development, with no&#xD;
      technological expertise required, through participatory informatics; caregiver involvement&#xD;
      increases the likelihood the intervention will be relevant and efficacious. The purpose of&#xD;
      this mixed-methods K23 study is to 1) develop a mHealth parenting stress intervention using&#xD;
      participatory informatics; 2) assess the feasibility and acceptability of the participatory&#xD;
      informatics approach and the intervention; 3) evaluate the intervention's preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy in reducing parenting stress and increasing youth engagement in substance use or&#xD;
      dual diagnosis treatment post-detention through a pilot RCT; and 4) understand systems-level&#xD;
      factors that could influence eventual system adoption and sustainability.&#xD;

    <measure>Interpersonal Mindfulness in Parenting Scale (Mindful Parenting)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Interpersonal Mindfulness in Parenting Scale is an 8-item self-report of mindful parenting, including four sub-scales reflecting present-centered emotional awareness in parenting, present-centered attention in parenting, non-reactivity/low reactivity in parenting, and non-judgmental acceptance in parenting that will be used to measure mindful parenting as a construct. Each item is rated on a 1 to 5 scale and items are summed to create sub-scale scores (possible range=8 to 40); higher scores indicate greater mindful parenting.</description>

    <measure>Child and Adolescent Services Assessment (Barriers to Youth Treatment)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Child and Adolescent Services Assessment (CASA) is a parent-report instrument designed to assess the use of behavioral health services by children ages 8 years to 17 years. The CASA includes 31 settings covering inpatient, outpatient, and informal services provided by a variety of child-serving providers and sectors. This instrument collects information on whether a service was ever used, as well as more detailed information (length of stay/number of visits, focus of treatment) on services used in the recent past. Select items from the CASA will assess 16 barriers to youths' services use (e.g., language, transportation, cost, stigma). Caregivers will report whether each barrier was a concern during the 3 months prior to the youths' detention or for follow-ups, in the 3 months since the last assessment (6 months post baseline).</description>

    <description>Motivation for Youth's Treatment Scale (MYTS) is an 8-item measure of intrinsic motivation for youth treatment and assesses a youth and caregiver's problem recognition and treatment readiness. Responses are rated on a 1 to 5 scale and are summed to yield two sub-scale scores (problem recognition: possible range=3 to 15; treatment readiness: possible range=5 to 25). Higher scores reflect higher motivation.</description>
