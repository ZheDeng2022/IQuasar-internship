  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to test the accuracy and comfort of self-directed ultrasound imaging of&#xD;
      cervical dilation and effacement in pregnant women undergoing induction of labor. The study&#xD;
      will assess correlation of cervical measurements between self-directed imaging and&#xD;
      experienced provider digital cervical examinations.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective will assess correlation of cervical measurements with gold standard of&#xD;
      provider digital cervical examinations and self-obtained transperineal and transvaginal&#xD;
      images. Experienced providers performing digital cervical examinations will be blinded to&#xD;
      ultrasound images and measurements. The maternal-fetal medicine subspecialist interpreting&#xD;
      the ultrasound images will be blinded to patient details and will document ultrasound&#xD;
      measurement of cervical dilation of the internal cervical os as the mean of&#xD;
      anterior-posterior and transverse measurements and cervical length. 2-D ultrasound images and&#xD;
      cine clips will be obtained at up to five different time points during the induction of&#xD;
      labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As as secondary objective, participant discomfort and anxiety will be measured following the&#xD;
      initial set of cervical measurements using the Visual Analog Scale and Six-Item State-Trait&#xD;
      Anxiety Inventory.&#xD;

    <measure>Correlation of cervical examination between self-obtained ultrasound measurements and provider digital exam.</measure>
    <time_frame>Data collection during induction of labor with image interpretation through end of study, assessed up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Data collection will occur at up to five time points along a participant's labor course. Providers will be blinded to ultrasound images. Data includes provider digital exam, transperineal ultrasound cine clip with mean (anterior-posterior and transverse) measurement of internal os and total cervical length and transvaginal ultrasound cine clips with mean (anterior-posterior and transverse) measurement of internal os and total cervical length. Ultrasound images will be read by maternal-fetal medicine subspecialist blinded to patient information, labor stage and provider cervical examination.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant-perceived discomfort after cervical examination using a 10 point Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>On day of induction after first cervical examination during first assessment, through study completion up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analog Scale values range from 0 to 10 where higher values indicate more pain and will be assessed once after the first cervical examination.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant anxiety levels will be measured via the Six-Item Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6)</measure>
    <time_frame>On day of induction after first cervical examination during first assessment, through study completion up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 6 items which are on a 4 point likert scale will be administered to participants post first cervical exam. The 6 items are summed, divided by 6 and hen multiplied by 20 to give a range of 20 to 80. Higher scores indicate more anxiety.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Digital Cervical Assessment performed first</arm_group_label>
    <description>A digital cervical exam will be performed by an experienced senior obstetrics and gynecology resident, using index finger and middle finger to measure the dilation and thickness of the cervix. This is the gold standard measurement utilized to assess the labor course. In this group, the digital cervical exam is done first, followed by a participant-performed ultrasound imaging assessment of the cervix.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Ultrasound Assessment performed first</arm_group_label>
    <description>Ultrasound imaging will be first taught by an experienced RN, then self-performed by the participant in the presence of junior obstetrics and gynecology resident and the RN. The junior resident will ensure the ultrasound device is functioning properly and the images are saved. In this group, the participant-performed imaging assessment is done first, followed by a digital cervical exam performed by an experienced senior obstetrics and gynecology resident.</description>
