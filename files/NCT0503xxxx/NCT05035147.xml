  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to further observe and evaluate whether the three-week administration of&#xD;
      albumin-bound paclitaxel combined with gemcitabine is equivalent to the four-week&#xD;
      administration in the treatment of inoperable locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is a common clinical malignant tumor of the digestive system, and its&#xD;
      incidence is gradually increasing worldwide.The prognosis is poor and the mortality rate is&#xD;
      high, accounting for about 7% of cancer deaths.Albumin-bound paclitaxel is a good first-line&#xD;
      treatment for pancreatic cancer. It has the advantages of high dose, high tumor tissue&#xD;
      distribution, high efficacy, and low toxicity.It is hoped that the low-dose intensity can&#xD;
      achieve the same clinical efficacy as the high-dose intensity, which provides strong evidence&#xD;
      for the clinical choice of low-dose intensity.&#xD;
