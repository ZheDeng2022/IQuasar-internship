  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study will examine the relationship between aircraft noise exposure in the&#xD;
      bedroom and objectively assessed sleep disturbance. Surveys will be mailed to randomly&#xD;
      selected households around selected airports to recruit individuals for a 5 night in-home&#xD;
      sleep study. Eligible survey respondents interested in participating in the sleep study will&#xD;
      record nighttime indoor sounds using a portable audio recorder and wear a small device that&#xD;
      collects heart rate and movement data for 5 consecutive nights. They will also complete brief&#xD;
      morning questionnaires about their previous night's sleep and their sleep quality and a&#xD;
      participant characteristics questionnaire. Collected data will be used to create an&#xD;
      exposure-response model between aircraft noise exposure and sleep disturbance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals who complete the recruitment survey, indicate their interest in participating in&#xD;
      the study, and meet the eligibility criteria, will be enrolled in the 5-night in-home sleep&#xD;
      study to collect noise and physiological (heart rate, body movements) measurements, and&#xD;
      answer questionnaires about experiences during the previous night and a characteristics&#xD;
      questionnaire that collects additional information relevant for sleep. After confirmation of&#xD;
      eligibility and informed consent, subjects will be sent equipment by mail to measure body&#xD;
      movements and ECG signals as well as sounds in the bedroom. Awakenings will be inferred from&#xD;
      ECG and movement data using a previously validated algorithm, and analyzed relative to&#xD;
      measured noise levels in the bedroom. The study nights will take place during the week,&#xD;
      Monday night/Tuesday morning through Friday night/Saturday morning. Upon completion of the 5&#xD;
      nights, the questionnaires and equipment will be returned to the study team by mail. Survey&#xD;
      mailing distribution, subject recruitment, and data collection for the in-home sleep study is&#xD;
      expected to last 2 years, but may last up to 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population is adult residents of U.S. households who are exposed to relevant levels&#xD;
      of nighttime air traffic (both in terms of number and sound pressure level of events) in&#xD;
      communities in proximity to 77 airports that met the eligibility criteria for this study.&#xD;
      Only areas with expected aircraft noise exposure levels of ≥40 decibels (dB) Lnight (average&#xD;
      aircraft noise level during the nighttime period) outside were considered for the sample&#xD;
      frame. To maximize the likelihood that there will be a range of indoor noise levels in the&#xD;
      sample frame, we will use probability sampling stratified on outdoor aircraft noise contour&#xD;
      levels. For each of the selected 77 airports, noise exposure contour strata, were determined&#xD;
      using the FAA's Aviation Environmental Design Tool and 2018 traffic data. These noise&#xD;
      contours are based on Lnight and include the 40, 45, 50, and 55 dB contour to allow for&#xD;
      stratified sampling from the following areas: 40&lt;45, 45&lt;50, 50&lt;55, ≥55 dB. From each noise&#xD;
      stratum, 100 subjects will be recruited into the in-home field study. Mailing addresses for&#xD;
      the recruitment survey will be selected randomly from all households across the 77 airports&#xD;
      within each of the 4 noise strata.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study outcome is aircraft noise-induced awakening probability depending on the&#xD;
      maximum sound pressure level of single aircraft events. Analyses will be weighted to better&#xD;
      reflect the sampling universe, but unweighted analyses will also be performed. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include, but are not limited to, self-reported sleep disturbance depending on noise&#xD;
      metrics referring to longer time periods (i.e., last night or past year).&#xD;

    <description>The recruitment survey contains a question: &quot;Thinking about the last 12 months or so, when you are here at home, how much does noise from aircraft disturb your sleep?&quot; Subjects choosing &quot;very&quot; or &quot;extremely&quot; on the 5-point answer scale will be considered highly sleep disturbed. The investigators will investigate how long-term aircraft noise exposure metrics are associated with being highly sleep disturbed.</description>
