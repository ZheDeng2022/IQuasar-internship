    <textblock>
      A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled comparative study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and efficacy of XC221 used at 100 mg daily and at 200 mg daily in&#xD;
      patients with uncomplicated influenza or other acute viral upper respiratory infections&#xD;
      (URIs) for 5 days of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of ХС221 at 100 mg and at 200&#xD;
      mg in comparison with placebo regarding its effect on the severity and duration of influenza&#xD;
      symptoms and symptoms of other viral URIs (fever and other major signs and symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of ХС221 at 100 mg and at 200&#xD;
      mg in comparison with placebo in the treatment of influenza ad other viral URIs.&#xD;

      Russian centers will participate in this study. This is a double-blind, placebo-control&#xD;
      study, and therefore, in order to maintain the study design, subjects will be administered&#xD;
      with placebo or the study drug depending on the treatment group they have been randomized&#xD;
      into.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening visit and all other visits of the study will be on an outpatient basis&#xD;
      (including home visits). The study will consist of three periods: screening, randomization&#xD;
      and initiation of treatment ( Day 1); treatment period (Day 1-5) and follow-up period (Day&#xD;
      6-20± 1 after completion of treatment with XC221 / Placebo). The duration of participation in&#xD;
      the study for each patient will be no more than 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      255 eligible patients will be randomized into three treatment groups (in a 1:1:1 ratio) and&#xD;
      receive: study drug (ХС221) at 100 mg daily or at 200 mg daily, or placebo. Regardless other&#xD;
      group, all study subjects should receive the standard symptomatic therapy for influenza and&#xD;
      other viral URIs, taking into account the latest clinical guidelines (the necessity of&#xD;
      symptomatic therapy will be decided by the Investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: subjects will receive 1 tablet of XC221, 100 mg tablets orally in the morning&#xD;
      (between 7:00 and 11:00) and 1 tablet of placebo in the evening (between 19:00 and 23:00)&#xD;
      regardless of food intake for 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: subjects will receive 1 tablet of XC221, 100 mg tablets orally twice daily in the&#xD;
      morning (between 7:00 and 11:00) and in the evening (between 19:00 and 23:00) regardless of&#xD;
      food intake for 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3: subjects will receive 1 tablet of placebo orally twice daily, in the morning&#xD;
      (between 7:00 and 11:00) and in the evening (between 19:00 and 23:00) regardless of food&#xD;
      intake for 5 days.&#xD;
