  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inclusion Body Myositis is a slowly but disabling myopathy, the most frequent in patients&#xD;
      over 50 years old. No treatments (in particular immunosuppressive) are known to be efficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autologous uncultured adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction (ADSVF) is recognized as an&#xD;
      easily accessible (by a standard liposuction to obtain adipose tissue, from which ADSVF are&#xD;
      isolated by centrifugation), safe and well tolerated source of cells with angiogenic,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and regenerative properties. The purpose of our ADSVF in&#xD;
      IBM phase I trial is to evaluate, for the first time in human diseased muscle, first the&#xD;
      tolerance of autologous ADSVF cells locally injected in affected forearm muscles and second&#xD;
      their capability to repair those muscles. With always the goals of tolerance first and second&#xD;
      muscle repair, we will recruit in parallel two groups of IBM patients: the first treated by&#xD;
      sirolimus since at least 6 months (but still disabled) and the second currently (for at least&#xD;
      3 months) without specific treatment for inclusion myositis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the tolerance of escalating doses of ADSVF,&#xD;
      one month after intramuscular injection in the finger flexors, in the non-dominant forearm.&#xD;
      The second objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy in term of muscle repair&#xD;
      (regenerative properties of ADSVF) and in term of muscle inflammation control, during 6&#xD;
      months, by functional strength tests, quantitative MRI and PBMC monitoring. This research is&#xD;
      a phase I trial evaluating first the tolerance and second the efficacy of 3 escalating doses&#xD;
      of ADSVF intramuscularly injected in the non-dominant forearm. The volume of injection will&#xD;
      be of 1 ml in each of the 5 sites of the finger flexoses, in line at 1 cm apart, for a total&#xD;
      dose of 5 millions (low dose) or 10 millions (intermediate dose) or 20 millions (high dose)&#xD;
      of viable nucleated cells.These doses are chosen because of the perfect tolerance of&#xD;
      intra-muscle injection of (in average) one million ADSVF per millilitre, with a total dose of&#xD;
      viable nucleated cells injected between 2.5 and 8.6 millions.The cell treatment will be&#xD;
      prepared from autologous uncultured Adipose-Derived Stromal Vascular Fraction (ADSVF)&#xD;
      isolated by centrifugation of adipose tissue obtain by liposuction. The study population will&#xD;
      be adult patients suffering of an Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) fulfilling the Lloyd criteria&#xD;
      treated by sirolimus since at least 6 months (but still disabled) - who are part of group 1&#xD;
      or currently (for at least 3 months) without specific treatment for inclusion myositis - who&#xD;
      are part of group 2. The main inclusion criteria are : Patients: with an age ≥ 45 and ≤ 80&#xD;
      years old, with IBM defined by the Lloyd criteria: muscle weakness of finger flexors or&#xD;
      quadriceps, and endomysial inflammatory infiltrates on muscle biopsy, and presence of invaded&#xD;
      fibers or rimmed vacuoles on muscle biopsy, who gave their written informed consent,&#xD;
      affiliated to a social security regime (expected AME) ; and for: group 1: treated by&#xD;
      sirolimus since at least 6 months (but still disabled ) - group 2: currently (for at least 3&#xD;
      months) without specific treatment for inclusion myositis - group 2. The duration of&#xD;
      participation of the patients will be 7 months, included one month between maximum the&#xD;
      inclusion visit and the injection visit, and 6 month of follow-up periof after ADSVF&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;
