    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to estimate the overall survival (OS) rates in the&#xD;
      overall study population treated with nivolumab in the second and third line setting in real&#xD;
      world clinical practice in Greece and Cyprus. The study is descriptive in nature and is not&#xD;
      planned to reject or affirm any formal statistical hypothesis.&#xD;
