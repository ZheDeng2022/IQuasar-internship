  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this quasi-experimental study design was to examine effects of the&#xD;
      coordinated-bilateral ball skills (CBBS) intervention on cognitive functions and aerobic&#xD;
      fitness in elementary school students. The hypotheses of the study were: students in the&#xD;
      intervention group will show a significant higher level of cognitive functions and aerobic&#xD;
      fitness compared to the control students.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fourth-grade students at 5 elementary schools were recruited to participate. At each&#xD;
      participating school, two fourth-grade classes were assigned to the CBBS intervention group&#xD;
      and other two fourth-grade classes were assigned to the control group. The students in the&#xD;
      intervention group received two, 30-min CBBS physical education (PE) lessons taught by the&#xD;
      physical education teacher who were trained in implementation of the two CBBS lessons per&#xD;
      week for 16 weeks. In contrast, the students in the control group received regular two PE&#xD;
      lessons per week for 16 weeks taught by the other physical education teacher who were not be&#xD;
      involved in the CBBS intervention training. All participating students who returned their&#xD;
      parent/guardian' signed consent form were pre-tested and post-tested (immediately after the&#xD;
      16-week intervention) in cognitive functions and aerobic fitness. Descriptive statistics and&#xD;
      linear mixed models were performed to analyze the data. All data analysis were conducted in&#xD;
      Physical Activity and Health Lab of the School of Kinesiology at University of Michigan&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study used 2 arms, quasi experimental study design with one intervention group and one control group. The intervention group included fourth-grade students of two fourth-grade classes taught by the physical education teacher who received the coordinated-bilateral ball skills (CBBS) intervention training at each of the five elementary schools. The control group included fourth-grade students of other two fourth-grade classes taught by the physical education teacher who did not receive the CBBS intervention training at each of the five elementary schools.</intervention_model_description>
