  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistent musculoskeletal (MSK) pain in adolescence is associated with disability, absence&#xD;
      from school and reduced quality of life. We know little about risk factors and underlying&#xD;
      mechanisms of persistent MSK pain in this age group. For example, the effect of other health&#xD;
      complaints on the development of persistent MSK pain is scarcely investigated. In this&#xD;
      prospective cohort study, data from the Fit Futures study on Norwegian adolescents (15-19&#xD;
      years old) will be used to investigate whether health complaints and an accumulation of&#xD;
      health complaints in adolescence are associated with the incidence of persistent MSK pain two&#xD;
      years later.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a need of knowledge on risk factors and underlying mechanisms of persistent MSK pain&#xD;
      in adolescence to increase our understanding and facilitate preventative strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this prospective cohort study are to investigate whether health complaints and an&#xD;
      accumulation of health complaints in adolescence, are associated with the incidence of&#xD;
      persistent MSK pain two years later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective study using data from the Fit Futures study conducted in the&#xD;
      northern Norway. Adolescents (15-19 years) were recruited to the first survey (Fit Futures 1,&#xD;
      FF1) in 2010/2011, and followed up to years later (Fit Futures 2, FF2). Data was collected&#xD;
      through a comprehensive questionnaire and physical tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exposures will be common health complaints in adolescence measured in FF1, including&#xD;
      self-reported asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic eczema, abdominal pain, headache and&#xD;
      psychological distress (Hopkins Symptom Checklist).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential confounders will include age, sex and parents' socioeconomic status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histograms and QQ-plots will be used to investigate the distribution of data. Normally&#xD;
      distributed data will be presented with means and standard deviations (SD), while median and&#xD;
      range will be used to present skewed data. Categorical data will be presented as counts and&#xD;
      percentages. Missing data in exposures and confounders will be considered handled with&#xD;
      multiple imputation. Participants with missing data on outcome will be excluded from the&#xD;
      analyses. Baseline characteristics of adolescents lost to follow-up or with incomplete&#xD;
      outcome data in FF2 will be compared to baseline characteristics of respondents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-year incidence rate of persistent MSK pain will be presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Logistic regression analyses, providing odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI),&#xD;
      will be used to investigate the association between health complaints (measured in FF1) and&#xD;
      later persistent MSK pain (measured in FF2). The association between health complaints and&#xD;
      persistent MSK pain will first be investigated separately for each complaint (asthma,&#xD;
      allergic rhinitis, atopic eczema, psychological distress, headache and abdominal pain),&#xD;
      secondly as the number of health complaints regardless of type (using an ordinal count&#xD;
      variable). All logistic regression analyses will be conducted as crude and adjusted analyses.&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be conducted with STATA statistical software system.&#xD;

    <description>Persistent musculoskeletal pain was measured at the 2-year follow-up by the questions: &quot;Do you have persistent or constantly recurring pain that has lasted for three months or more?&quot;, &quot;if you have persistent and constantly recurring pain that has lasted for 3 months or more, how often do you have this pain?&quot; and &quot;if you have persistent or constantly recurring pain that has lasted for 3 months or more, where does it hurt?&quot;. Persistent musculoskeletal pain will in this study be defined as pain that persist or constantly recur on a weekly basis or more often, for minimum three months, in one or more of the following pain sites; neck, jaw/temporormandibular joint, upper back, lower back, chest, shoulder, arm/elbow, hand, hip, thigh/knee/shin, ankle/foot.</description>
