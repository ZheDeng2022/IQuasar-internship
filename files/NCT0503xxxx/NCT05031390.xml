  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of a 12-weeks (progressive) exercise&#xD;
      program in patients with FAIS. Feasibility is evaluated on the recruitment strategy, patient&#xD;
      adherence to the exercises and their experiences with and motivation for performing&#xD;
      exercises. Furthermore, the investigators wish to investigate the variation of data before&#xD;
      and after the exercise program to help estimate a suitable sample size for a future&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
