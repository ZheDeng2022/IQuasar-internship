  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the ability of acute exercise to regulate fat&#xD;
      metabolism in muscle of overweight and obese people compared to lean people.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study details and possible risks and benefits, 15&#xD;
      overweight/obese and 15 lean participants gave written informed consent and were then&#xD;
      screened and enrolled in the study. All participants then gave a muscle sample and ate a&#xD;
      calorically controlled breakfast. Participants completed ~1 hour of cycling exercise on a&#xD;
      stationary bike and gave a second muscle sample 4 hours after eating breakfast.&#xD;
