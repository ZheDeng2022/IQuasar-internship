      Objectives Primary study objective: To determine whether orally-administered ladarixin versus&#xD;
      placebo adjunctive therapy improves insulin sensitivity in overweight, insulin-resistant (IR)&#xD;
      type 1 Diabetic (T1D) adult subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study objectives: To determine whether orally-administered ladarixin versus placebo&#xD;
      adjunctive therapy is safe and well-tolerated in overweight, IR T1D adult subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, 2-arm, 2-period crossover&#xD;
      phase II trial using the CXCR1/CXCR2 chemokine receptor antagonist ladarixin versus placebo&#xD;
      as adjunctive therapy to insulin to improve insulin sensitivity as well as glucometabolic&#xD;
      outcomes in adult, insulin-requiring, overweight, IR T1D patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will randomize 38 male and female patients 21-65 years of age, inclusive, with&#xD;
      established insulinrequiring T1D and IR. After a 2:1 randomization into a treatment sequence&#xD;
      (either ladarixin followed by placebo, or placebo followed by ladarixin, respectively),&#xD;
      patients will be followed up for a maximum of 53 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study database will be locked when the last patient randomized has completed visit 9&#xD;
      (week 52/53) and data have been cleaned.&#xD;
