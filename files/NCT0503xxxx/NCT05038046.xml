      Diabetic nephropathy is not only an important issue of national health, but also a disease&#xD;
      that TCM can play an important role. The aim of this project is to build up a TCM clinical&#xD;
      daycare model for diabetic nephropathy patients, and to establish a teaching platform for TCM&#xD;
      trainees. The TCM daycare model will be provided by a team organized by doctors, nurses,&#xD;
      pharmacists, nutritionist and case managers. This model will provide a comprehensive TCM care&#xD;
      system to improve the clinical symptoms and quality of life of diabetic nephropathy patients.&#xD;
      The teaching platform of the TCM daycare clinics for diabetic nephropathy patients will&#xD;
      provide a good clinical training environment for the trainees. They can learn how to take&#xD;
      care ofdiabetic nephropathy patients by the lectures and the clinical practice experiences in&#xD;
      the daycare clinics. They can also learn a holistic approach, a patient-centered healthcare&#xD;
      service. This teaching model will strengthen the clinical training of TCM and enhance the&#xD;
      international competitiveness of TCM doctors&#xD;

      The teaching platform of the TCM daycare clinics for diabetic nephropathy patients will&#xD;
      provide a good clinical training environment for the trainees. They can learn how to take&#xD;
      care ofdiabetic nephropathy patients by the lectures and the clinical practice experiences in&#xD;

      international competitiveness of TCM doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 30 volunteers of patients with Diabetic nephropathy will be recruited from the&#xD;
      Chinese medicine or Western medicine clinics. After diagnosis by nephrology physician, 15&#xD;
      patients will be distributed to combinational Western and TCM daycare model, one time a week,&#xD;
      for 12 weeks (12 treatment in total). Another 15 patients will enter Western daycare model.&#xD;
      The assignment depends on the patients' own will. The TCM day care model will be provided by&#xD;
      a team work clinical care system organized by doctors, nurses, pharmacists and case managers.&#xD;
      This model will provide a comprehensive TCM care system for every visit. Laboratory&#xD;
      biochemistries analysis and other questionnaires including SF36 health survey, Pittsburgh&#xD;
      Sleep Quality Index, Beck Depression Inventory-II, FACIT-fatigue Scale, the Galer Jensen&#xD;
      Neuropathic Pain Scale, SF-BPI, TC-AE, and constitution in Chinese medicine questionnaire&#xD;
      will be completed at 1 weeks, and 12 weeks after join this study. Instrumental examinations&#xD;
      including heart rate variability will be given before and after intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predict results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that the efficacy of this combined western medicine and traditional&#xD;
      Chinese medicine day care model will be improving neuropathy symptoms, edema, fatigue,&#xD;
      physical function and quality of life in diabetic nephropathy patients. The effectiveness of&#xD;
      combined therapy can be measured by questionnaires. Moreover, the investigators will further&#xD;
      speculate the mechanism by analyzing laboratory data.&#xD;
