  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cytotoxic treatment for malignant hematologic disorders often casue thrombocytopenia that can&#xD;
      result in life threatening bleedings. This is prevented by platelet transfusions but these&#xD;
      can cause serious transfusion reactions and thus the number of transused platelet&#xD;
      concentrates should be limited. It is therefore important that the platelet concentrates&#xD;
      contain functional platelets with long circulation time in the bloodstream.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have developed a method with flow cytometry to measure platelet function markers. It&#xD;
      allows us to determine which pathways that are initiated upon activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to assess to what degree spontaneous activation of platelets as&#xD;
      well as their activation capacity affects the transfusion response (i.e. uptake in the&#xD;
      circulation and circulation time) in the recipient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that transfusion of platelets with low spontaneous activation and high&#xD;
      activation capacity will lead to a higher transfusion response in the recipient.&#xD;

      Cytotoxic treatment for malignant hematologic disorders often casue thrombocytopenia that can&#xD;
      result in life threatening bleedings. This is prevented by platelet transfusions but these&#xD;
      can cause serious transfusion reactions and thus the number of transused platelet&#xD;
      concentrates should be limited. It is therefore important that the platelet concentrates&#xD;
      contain functional platelets with long circulation time in the bloodstream.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of platelets in hemostasis is complex. Upon vascular injury, platelets adhere at the&#xD;
      injured site where they become activated, release their granule content and aggregate.&#xD;
      Activation include changes in receptors, expression of activation markers and become&#xD;
      procaoagulant. We have developed a method with flow cytometry to measures these platelet&#xD;
      function markers. It allows us to determine which pathways that are initiated upon&#xD;
      activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelets can be stored a maximum of 5-7 days before transfusion. However, the preparation&#xD;
      process and subsequent storage can result in platelet lesions, affecting their ability to&#xD;
      promote hemostasis and circulate after transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to assess to what degree spontaneous activation of platelets as&#xD;
      well as their activation capacity affects the transfusion response (i.e. uptake in the&#xD;
      circulation and circulation time) in the recipient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that transfusion of platelets with low spontaneous activation and high&#xD;
      activation capacity will lead to a higher transfusion response in the recipient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will be able to examine how this relates to platelet processing methods and storage&#xD;
      duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelets will be transfused on normal indications to participants at the hematology ward.&#xD;
      The platelet concentrates choosen to be transfused will be done according to regular routines&#xD;
      at the blood center. We will thus not control what concentrates are transfused (i.e.&#xD;
      preparation method and storage time) and hence included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small sample will be taken from the platelet concentrate shortly before transfusion and&#xD;
      platelet function analysed with the flow cytometry method. Transfusion response will be&#xD;
      assessed in the participant by calculation of corrected count increment (CCI) which relates&#xD;
      the increase in platelet concentration after transfusion to the number of platelets&#xD;
      transfused and the blood volume. CCI is calculated at 1 and 24-hours after transfusion.&#xD;
      Clincial variables that might affect the transfusion response such as infection and fever&#xD;
      will be registered as well as bleeding. The number of days to next platelet transfusion will&#xD;
      be followed up.&#xD;
