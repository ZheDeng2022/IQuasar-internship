  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects, best dose, and effect of tagraxofusp and&#xD;
      decitabine in treating patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Tagraxofusp consists of&#xD;
      human interleukin 3 (IL3) linked to a toxic agent called DT388. IL3 attaches to IL3 receptor&#xD;
      positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers DT388 to kill them. Chemotherapy drugs,&#xD;
      such as decitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by&#xD;
      killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving&#xD;
      tagraxofusp and decitabine may help to control the disease in patients with chronic&#xD;
      myelomonocytic leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of tagraxofusp-erzs&#xD;
      (tagraxofusp) in combination with decitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess overall response (OR) rate to tagraxofusp in combination with decitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess overall survival (OS), duration of response, relapse-free survival (RFS) and&#xD;
      safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Correlative studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of tagraxofusp-erzs followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive decitabine intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1-5, and&#xD;
      tagraxofusp-erzs IV over 15 minutes on days 1-3. Cycles of decitabine repeat every 28 days in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment with tagraxofusp-erzs&#xD;
      repeats every 28 days for up to 7 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.&#xD;
