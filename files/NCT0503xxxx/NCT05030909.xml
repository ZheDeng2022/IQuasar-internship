  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychological distress, anxiety and depression are common in adolescence, and even more so&#xD;
      following traumatic events. On Friday 15 March 2019, two mosques in Christchurch were&#xD;
      targeted in an act of terrorism, resulting in 71 people being injured and 51 people being&#xD;
      shot dead. This has had widespread repercussions in the Muslim and wider community in&#xD;
      Christchurch and New Zealand. Uptake of a response pathway set up by community and district&#xD;
      health board groups has been low despite reports of high levels of distress in the adolescent&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study offers a transdiagnostic group treatment approach (ie. Targeting broad&#xD;
      range of emotional difficulties) for teenagers affected by the March 15th shootings,&#xD;
      incorporating a faith-based element based on Islamic psychology to address the local&#xD;
      population's need. Investigators will assess the feasibility of this approach and offer the&#xD;
      opportunity to screen and identify individuals in need of more intensive intervention.&#xD;
      Investigators will run two gender-specific treatment groups (8 participants each) recruited&#xD;
      from the community, with one individual session (for information and consent) and 5 group&#xD;
      sessions. Self-report questionnaires will measure symptoms of emotional difficulties, trauma&#xD;
      symptoms and functioning at baseline, end of treatment and at 3 months follow-up. In&#xD;
      addition, participants will answer weekly brief measures to monitor for any increased&#xD;
      distress.&#xD;
