  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed phase 2a trial will determine whether MIB-626 treatment in adults with COVID-19&#xD;
      infection and stage 1 acute kidney injury is more efficacious than placebo in preventing&#xD;
      worsening of kidney function, as assessed by longitudinal changes in serum creatinine&#xD;
      concentration, and in attenuating the inflammatory response to the infection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 2a&#xD;
      study that will determine the efficacy and safety of MIB-626 treatment relative to placebo in&#xD;
      adult patients with COVID-19 infection and stage 1 acute kidney injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospitalized adult patients with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 infection&#xD;
      will be screened for conformity to inclusion and exclusion criteria and those meeting&#xD;
      eligibility criteria on screening will be offered participation in the study. Fifty&#xD;
      participants, who meet all the eligibility criteria, and are able and willing to provide&#xD;
      informed consent, will be randomized, stratified by sex, remdesivir use, and trial site, in a&#xD;
      3:2 ratio to receive either MIB-626 1.0 g orally or matching placebo twice daily for 14 days.&#xD;
      The participants, who are discharged from the hospital before the completion of the 14-day&#xD;
      intervention period, will be provided sufficient study medication to take home with them so&#xD;
      they can continue to take the medication twice daily for the remaining duration of the 14-day&#xD;
      intervention period.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This will be a two center, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel group, efficacy trial to determine the efficacy of MIB-626 treatment relative to placebo in adult patients with COVID-19 infection and stage 1 acute kidney injury. Participants will be screened for eligibility and those meeting eligibility criteria will be offered participation in the study. The subjects will be randomized by minimization to receive MIB-626 or placebo twice daily for up to 14 days. The participants will be followed for 28 days after the administration of the last dose of the investigational product. Kidney function will be ascertained by daily measurements of serum creatinine, which is the standard of care in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.</intervention_model_description>
