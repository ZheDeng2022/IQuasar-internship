  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) with inadequate growth and development of retinal blood&#xD;
      vessels in premature infants is one of the foremost reasons for childhood blindness. Recently&#xD;
      there is a shift of treatment to VEGF inhibitors which can regress ROP without destroying the&#xD;
      peripheral retina. Yet, the best drug has not been identified.Bevacizumab is a larger,&#xD;
      full-length immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecule with slower retinal clearance and therefore&#xD;
      prolonged diffusion into the systemic circulation, up to 3 weeks. In contrast, the systemic&#xD;
      half-life of a Fab molecule, such as ranibizumab, is a few hours. The objective is to compare&#xD;
      the efficacy and reliability of intravitreal bevacizumab with standard 0.625 mg dose and&#xD;
      intravitreal ranibizumab treatments for type 1 ROP, namely pattern of disease regression,&#xD;
      recurrence of ROP, necessity of subsequent ablative procedures.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the efficacy and reliability of intravitreal bevacizumab with standard 0.625 mg&#xD;
      dose and intravitreal ranibizumab treatments for type 1 ROP, namely pattern of disease&#xD;
      regression, recurrence of ROP, necessity of subsequent ablative procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population &amp; Sample size Infants with Type 1 ROP (affecting both eyes) screened at&#xD;
      neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of Cairo University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size is calculated to be 36 eyes of 18 infants using open Epi confidence total&#xD;
      95%, power of the study 80% according to the following : the mean SD of axial length of&#xD;
      patients with stage 3 ROP using bevacizumab versus ranibizumab (20.3 1.16 versus 19.4 ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, comparative, interventional non inferiority study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infants with type 1 ROP affecting both eyes will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before intravitreal injection, the parents or legal guardian of the infants will be&#xD;
           informed about the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After written consent is obtained, the pupil will be dilated with 2.5% phenylephrine and&#xD;
           0.5% tropicamide injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The injections will be performed in the operating theatre under general (light&#xD;
           inhalational anesthesia) or topical anesthesia with Benoxinate hydrochloride 0.4%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Povidone iodine10% swab will be applied on the eyelids and eyelashes. A sterile eyelid&#xD;
           speculum will be inserted. Each eye will be meticulously bathed with 5% povidone iodine&#xD;
           solution for 3 min before intravitreal injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A dose of 0.25 mg/0.025 mL ranibizumab (Lucentis) is injected in the right eye of the&#xD;
           infant and 0.625 mg/0.025 mL bevacizumab is injected into the vitreous cavity of the&#xD;
           left eye 1 mm posterior to the superior/inferior temporal limbus via 30 G needle. The&#xD;
           two injections are done sequentially on two consecutive days starting with the eye of&#xD;
           more advanced disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fundus examination will be conducted with an indirect ophthalmoscope and a 28-D lens.&#xD;
           The central retinal artery and the lens will be evaluated in addition to whether a&#xD;
           retinal tear is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative moxifloxacin 0.4% drops will be prescribed 4 times daily for one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be seen 24 hours after first injection, to monitor for any signs of&#xD;
           infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infants will then be seen weekly for 4 weeks and dilated fundus examination and and&#xD;
           digital coloured fundus images by RetCam will be performed to document response of the&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Success criteria to the IVB injection will be defined as, during the follow up period of&#xD;
           60 weeks' postmenstrual age:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  recovery of the plus disease&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  regression of any stage of ROP&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  progression of peripheral retinal vascularization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If any progression occurs in the disease course, in terms of: increase in plus disease&#xD;
           or progression to higher stage of ROP, immediate second IVB dose 0.625mg will be given&#xD;
           to either groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up will be continued for a minimum of one year corrected age or until we ensure&#xD;
           complete peripheral retinal vascularization.&#xD;
