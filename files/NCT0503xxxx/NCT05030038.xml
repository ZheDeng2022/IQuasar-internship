  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to study the bacteria in participants' gut before receiving a&#xD;
      medicine called an aromatase inhibitor for breast cancer and after participants receive&#xD;
      medicine for breast cancer.&#xD;

      Primary Objective: To describe the microbiome shift of gut microbiome from baseline after&#xD;
      4-weeks and 12-weeks of oral aromatase inhibitor treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate gut microbiome populations with circulating sex hormone metabolite&#xD;
           concentrations at baseline and 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the correlation of change in the microbiome populations with change in&#xD;
           circulating sex hormone metabolite concentrations from baseline to 12 weeks.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Gut Microbial Levels - Fecal Swab</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 4 weeks and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For fecal swab 12M read depth metagenomics sequencing, investigators will exclude operational taxonomic units (OTUs) occurring in fewer than three samples with a count of less than three and calculate alpha (Shannon) and beta diversity (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) indices with the phyloseq R package. The change in gut microbial levels will be calculated using paired t-tests.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Gut Microbial Levels - Blood Samples</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will calculate Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients between diversity and gut microbial levels and circulating sex hormone metabolite concentrations at baseline and at 12 weeks. Bacterial derived bioactive compounds, bile acids, and glucuronidated sex hormones will be compared by metabolomics conducted on plasma.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sex Hormone Concentrations - Blood Samples</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will fit a model with independent variables of the value (baseline or 12 weeks), and a second variable that represents the change from baseline (will be 0 or the change at 12 weeks).&#xD;
Estrone, estrone-3-glucuronide, and estrone-3-sulfate concentrations will be measured using an ELISA assay conducted on plasma.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive their standard of care for breast cancer treatment which includes an aromatase inhibitor. Pre-study assessments will be done at baseline as well as stool and blood samples at baseline, then again at 4 weeks and at 12 weeks during the course of the trial.</description>

      -  cPlasma will be divided into 250 mL aliquots and stored at -80 freezer in Cook Lab at&#xD;
           BioTech Place. Blood metabolomics will be performed to identify microbial mediated&#xD;
           metabolites using a non-targeted LC-MS/MS approach. Plasma will also be used to measure&#xD;
           estradiol, estrone, and estrone-3-glucuronide by ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fecal Samples will be mailed directly to CosmosID for DNA isolation and 12M read depth&#xD;
           metagenomics sequencing.&#xD;
