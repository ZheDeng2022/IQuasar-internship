  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall incidence of good outcome for AIS following endovascular treatment is only&#xD;
      proximately 50%. Whether NBO was safe and effective to improve acute ischemic stroke&#xD;
      prognosis is still unclear. The investigators' hypothesis is thatNBO is a safe and effective&#xD;
      strategy to improve longterm outcome in AIS patients undergoing endovascular treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NBO therapy is to deliver high flow oxygen (10L/min) through an oxygen storage mask. This&#xD;
      treatment should be started in the emergency room immediately after the patient is randomized&#xD;
      into the group, and oxygen should be continued for 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous clinical studies of NBO, patients who have not receive revascularization often&#xD;
      choose NBO for 8 hours, and studies have concluded that oxygen inhalation for more than 10&#xD;
      hours may bring about the risk of oxygen poisoning. However, a too short treatment time may&#xD;
      not bring benefits. Secondly, ideally, we want to ensure that stroke patients receive NBO&#xD;
      treatment before achieving reperfusion to protect the ischemic brain tissue, and add 1-2&#xD;
      hours after reperfusion. In the clinical environment after the patient arrives in the&#xD;
      emergency department, it takes 2-3 hours to complete the revascularization process.&#xD;
      Therefore, we believe that 4 hours of oxygen inhalation is reasonable. And our single-center&#xD;
      study also supports that NBO treatment for 4 hours is beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific content is as follows: In the emergency room, patients who are assessed for&#xD;
      suspected large blood vessels of acute anterior circulation will be randomized after signing&#xD;
      the informed consent. If the subject is randomly divided into NBO+ET group, by putting the&#xD;
      patient on Oxygen mask, and then immediately give oxygen (10L/min). NBO treatment is no later&#xD;
      than half an hour after randomization. Oxygen comes from the hospital's oxygen center and is&#xD;
      transported through wall pipes (oxygen concentration: 100%). The oxygen mask and the wall&#xD;
      oxygen are connected by a 1.5 meter long oxygen pipe. When the patient is transferred to the&#xD;
      operating room, we provide oxygen through a portable oxygen cylinder (capacity: 4L). In&#xD;
      addition, in the operating room and intensive care unit, patients continue to be given wall&#xD;
      oxygen therapy until the oxygen inhalation lasts for 4 hours. The arterial blood gas was&#xD;
      drawn after 4 hours of oxygen inhalation. The control group directly inhales room air through&#xD;
      the patient's nasal cavity without using any equipment. At the same time, patients in the&#xD;
      control group were also drawn blood gas analysis at corresponding time points (approximately&#xD;
      4 hours after randomization).&#xD;
