  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the effects of remote interventions based on the exposure to one or&#xD;
      more zeitgebers (i.e. adapted physical activity alone or combined with bright light exposure,&#xD;
      or galvanic vestibular stimulation) performed several times a week during three months on&#xD;
      older adults' sleep and quality of life.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More precisely, the main objective is to investigate the effects of interventions on&#xD;
      objective sleep measures of older adults with a sleep complaint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis is that the quantity and quality of sleep will be improved after the&#xD;
      interventions in comparison to the active control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second objective is to study the effects of these interventions on quality of life,&#xD;
      physical condition, anxiety, depression and cognition.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Before the intervention (= baseline) and after the intervention (from 12 to 14 weeks after baseline, depending on the intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The French version of the SF-36 health survey (Leplège, 2001) includes 11 questions with 5-point rating scales.&#xD;
This survey measures eight scales: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional, and mental health. For each scale, a score from 0 to 100 is calculated : a higher score means a better quality of live.&#xD;
Moreover, from these eight scales, two distinct concepts are measured by the SF-36:&#xD;
a physical dimension, represented by the Physical Component Summary (PCS), and&#xD;
a mental dimension, represented by the Mental Component Summary (MCS)</description>

It consists in 20 statements for which volunteers have to evaluate how they feel at a particular moment in time.&#xD;
Each answer is scored from 1 to 4, with 1 = low degree of anxiety, and 4 = high degree of anxiety.&#xD;
Global score varies from 20 to 80, and means :&#xD;

    <description>Assessment of working memory. First: determination of memory span. Single task 1: memory span for 2 minutes Single task 2: visuo spatial tracking task for 2 minutes Dual-task: both tasks are completed simultaneously for 2 minutes&#xD;
Dependant variables recorded:&#xD;
Single task 1: number of correctly recalled series of items&#xD;
Single task 2: number of ticked boxes&#xD;
Scoring procedure:&#xD;
Recall performance = (number of correctly recalled series of items during single task - number of correctly recalled series of items during dual-task) / number of correctly recalled series of items during single task.&#xD;
Tracking performance = (number of ticked boxes during single task - number of ticked boxes during dual task) / number of ticked boxes during single task.&#xD;
Mu index (index reflecting the performance decrement due to the dual-task) = (1-((Recall performance + Tracking performance)/2))*100. A high Mu index means high dual-task performance.</description>

    <time_frame>Before the intervention (= baseline) and after the intervention (from 12 to 14 weeks after baseline, depending on the intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The hand grip strength is measured with a dynamometer. Volunteers complete three trials per hand, during 3 to 5 secondes, with 1-minute break between each trial to minimize fatigue effects.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Before the intervention (= baseline) and after the intervention (from 12 to 14 weeks after baseline, depending on the intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Leg extension power is assessed with the Nottingham power rig. Seated volunteers have to extend their tested leg (right leg) as fast and hard as possible by pushing unilaterally the footplate. There are eight trials, with 30-second break in between.&#xD;

    <description>Postural balance is assessed through the Synapsys posturography system (Synapsys Inc.).&#xD;
Volunteers stand on the Synapsys posturography system, feet apart, with their arms alongside their body, looking straight ahead.&#xD;
Postural balance is measured in two conditions, with eyes open and eyes closed. There are two 30-second trials per condition.&#xD;
For each trial, the position of the center of pressure (CoP) is recorded. Limit of stability test is recorded without time limitation. The maximum amplitude of oscillations of the CoP in mediolateral and anterioposterior directions are recorded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in maximum incremental cardiopulmonary test</measure>
    <time_frame>Before the intervention (= baseline) and after the intervention (from 12 to 14 weeks after baseline, depending on the intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum incremental cardiopulmonary test is performed on an ergometric bicycle, based on an individualized protocol.&#xD;
Prior to the test, a resting ECG is performed and verified by a cardiologist. Following a 3 min warm-up (30 watts), the power is incremented by 20 watts every 2 minutes until exhaustion. The test is followed by a 3-minute recovery period.&#xD;
Maximum effort is determined by the occurrence of the following two criteria:&#xD;
1) Presence of a VO2 plateau despite an increase of power (Åstrand et al., 1994);&#xD;
2) Increase in oxygen consumption of the last increment should not exceed 100 ml/min despite the increase in power (Di Prampero et al., 1993).&#xD;
Dependant variables recorded:&#xD;
Maximum oxygen consumption (VO2 max)&#xD;
Maximum aerobic power&#xD;
Maximum heart rate&#xD;
Respiratory quotient (RQ) at the end of test (RQ = Volume of CO2 / Volume of O2)</description>

    <measure>Change in the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before the intervention (= baseline) and after the intervention (from 12 to 14 weeks after baseline, depending on the intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire developed by the World Health Organization, which consists in 19 questions grouped to capture physical activity undertaken in different behavioural domains, as work, transport and discretionary (also known as leisure or recreation) (Cleland and al., 2014).&#xD;
Within the work and discretionary domains, questions assess the frequency and duration of two different categories of activity defined by the energy requirement or intensity (vigorous or moderate intensity).&#xD;
In the transport domain, the frequency and duration of all walking and cycling for transport is captured but no attempt is made to differentiate between these activities.&#xD;
One additional item collects time spent in sedentary activities.&#xD;
Calculation of a global MET score (Metabolic Equivalent of Task, 1 MET = 1 kcal/kg/hour).&#xD;
Higher MET score means high physical activity.</description>

    <measure>Change in Timed up and go test</measure>
    <time_frame>Before the intervention (= baseline) and after the intervention (from 12 to 14 weeks after baseline, depending on the intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of dynamic balance in the older adults (Mathias et al., 1986; Podsiadlo &amp; Richardson, 1991).&#xD;
Volunteers are asked to sit down on a chair with their feet on the floor and their hands on their legs. At the &quot;go&quot; signal, they have to stand up, walk 3 meters, turn around a cone, walk back, and sit down again.&#xD;
The performance time starts when volunteers start moving to stand up and ends when they sit down again properly.&#xD;
The test is performed in two conditions:&#xD;
Two trials at a self-paced velocity, and&#xD;
Two trials as fast as possible&#xD;
Duration of the two best trials of the two conditions are retained (Podsiadlo &amp; Richardson, 1991).</description>
