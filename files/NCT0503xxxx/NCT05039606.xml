    <textblock>
      This study was designed as a prospective, multicenter and randomized clinical study of&#xD;
      radiotherapy combined with Nedaplatin contrast and cisplatin for local advanced head and neck&#xD;
      squamous SCC, aiming to explore the efficacy, safety and long-term efficacy of this trial and&#xD;
      control groups and provide some evidence for the selection of clinical treatment options.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a common malignancy accounting for more than&#xD;
      90% of head and neck tumors and over 60% of patients with mid-to late stage (-b) stage at&#xD;
      diagnosis.For patients with moderate and advanced head and neck squamous carcinoma,&#xD;
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy and chemotherapy is recommended for category 1 and the preferred&#xD;
      drug is cisplatin.The application of simultaneous chemoradiotherapy can significantly improve&#xD;
      the overall survival rate of patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous carcinoma,&#xD;
      and effectively reduce their local recurrence rate and distant metastasis rate.However, the&#xD;
      application of cisplatin aggravates the toxic and side reactions, such as nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting, radioactive oral mucosal response, nephrotoxicity and ear toxicity.Although the&#xD;
      clinical benefit of synchronous chemochemotherapy of locally advanced head and neck squamous&#xD;
      carcinoma with cisplatin as chemotherapy is considerable, due to its obvious toxic and side&#xD;
      reaction, some patients can not tolerate, cannot complete the whole course of treatment and&#xD;
      quality of life, resulting in a substantial reduction in the treatment effect.Therefore, in&#xD;
      synchronous chemoradiotherapy of locally advanced head and NSCC, there is an urgent need to&#xD;
      find an efficient, hypotoxic, novel chemotherapeutic agent to address this problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nedaplatin is the second generation platinum derivative, for cell cycle nonspecific drugs,&#xD;
      mechanism and efficacy similar to cisplatin, anticancer spectrum, and cisplatin without drug&#xD;
      resistance, cisplatin resistance still has a good effect, its gastrointestinal reaction and&#xD;
      nephrotoxicity is significantly reduced, main dose-limiting toxicity, grade marrow&#xD;
      suppression, clinical application without hydration, patients good tolerance and convenient&#xD;
      to use, can significantly improve the quality of life of patients.A number of foreign studies&#xD;
      have found that nedaplatin combination chemotherapy is effective in esophageal cancer,&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer and cervical cancer, patients are tolerated, and the digestive&#xD;
      tract response is significantly reduced, which helps to ensure the integrity of the course of&#xD;
      treatment.Wang Zhennan and other studies reported that nedaplatin can improve the&#xD;
      radiosensitivity of NPC CNE-2 cells and show dose-dependent inhibition of tumor cells.Koizumi&#xD;
      et al also found that nedaplatin with radiotherapy could effective sensitization.In addition,&#xD;
      the results of a phase III randomized controlled trial from the Cancer Center of Sun Yat-sen&#xD;
      University, which showed that the overall efficiency of nedaplatin combined radiotherapy for&#xD;
      local advanced NPC and 2-year progression-free survival rate were no less than cisplatin&#xD;
      (88.7%vs89.7%), and compared with the cisplatin group, gastrointestinal loss, nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting and weight loss quality score were significantly improved.&#xD;
