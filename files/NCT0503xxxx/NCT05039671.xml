  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine the implementation outcomes (i.e., feasibility,&#xD;
      appropriateness, acceptability, and fidelity) of MBC in school-based mental health treatment&#xD;
      services. The investigators plan to observe the effectiveness of MBC on student engagement&#xD;
      and treatment outcomes as a secondary goal. This pilot implementation-effectiveness trial is&#xD;
      designed to inform a future, large-scale trial with more participants.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A clustered, multiple-baseline design will be used to examine the impact of implementation&#xD;
      support on clinicians' fidelity, use and ratings of MBC appropriateness, acceptability and&#xD;
      fidelity. Approximately 50 school-based mental health (SMH) clinicians will be recruited to&#xD;
      participate from up to three school districts. All clinicians will receive the same&#xD;
      implementation supports; there is no random assignment to condition. Following an initial&#xD;
      control period of at least 1 month, school districts will start receiving implementation&#xD;
      supports. During the initial control period, baseline MBC use, attitudes, acceptability,&#xD;
      feasibility and appropriateness (per clinician self-report) will be collected, as well as&#xD;
      needs assessment data from clinician surveys to inform necessary adjustments to the&#xD;
      implementation supports. Baseline engagement and student outcomes will be collected after&#xD;
      initial clinician training session. MBC implementation outcomes (i.e., MBC use, attitudes,&#xD;
      acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility), engagement and student outcomes will be&#xD;
      collected at 3-month and 6-month follow-up during intervention supports, plus a 9-month&#xD;
      follow-up interval. This allows clinicians in the two school districts to be compared to each&#xD;
      other and to their own baseline. The primary comparison is pre-post ratings of implementation&#xD;
      outcomes for all N=50 clinicians. The secondary comparisons are pre-post ratings of&#xD;
      engagement and student outcomes, and between-agency differences.&#xD;

        This study plans to enroll up to 50 SMH clinicians and 150 caregivers (i.e., parent or&#xD;
        legal guardian) of children or adolescents receiving SMH treatment from one of the 50&#xD;
        participating clinicians. We anticipate SMH clinicians to be primarily licensed,&#xD;
        Masters-level (~95%), in fields of social work (~70%) and counseling (~30%), female (~80%),&#xD;
        Caucasian (~70%), median age of 30 years old and 1 to 20 years practicing in SMH. Parents&#xD;
        will be enrolled if their child or adolescent is enrolled in mental health services in a&#xD;
        participating district and served by a participating SMH clinician. We anticipate parents&#xD;
        to school mental health clinicians in the districts serving as study sites.&#xD;
