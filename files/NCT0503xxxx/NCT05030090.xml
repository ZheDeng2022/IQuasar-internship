  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, the families of cancer patients are lack knowledge and experience of nutritional&#xD;
      care after discharge. As a result, cancer patients often suffer from low nutritional status&#xD;
      after being discharged from the hospital.&#xD;

      This study intends to design a home nutrition care plan to explore the effect of a home&#xD;
      nutrition care plan on the nutritional status of patients with liver cancer and colorectal&#xD;
      cancer at risk of malnutrition. Malnutrition or side effects often lead to natural food&#xD;
      intake for patients. It is not enough to meet the nutritional requirements, so it is matched&#xD;
      with dietary products to help patients more easily meet their nutritional requirements.&#xD;
      Supplements are used to alleviate patients' side effects. It is hoped that they can help&#xD;
      patients improve their nutritional status.&#xD;
