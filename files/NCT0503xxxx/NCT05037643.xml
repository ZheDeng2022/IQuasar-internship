  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Portal hypertension (PHT) and its sequelae are the most clinically important manifestation in&#xD;
      cystic fibrosis related liver disease (CFLD), with end-stage liver failure as a late and rare&#xD;
      manifestation. The aim is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a pre-emptive Transjugular&#xD;
      Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) for the prophylaxis of variceal bleeding in pediatric&#xD;
      CFLD patients with subclinical non-cirrhotic portal hypertension (NCPH)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most frequent autosomal recessive disorder in Caucasians caused&#xD;
      by a mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene. Cystic&#xD;
      Fibrosis associated Liver Disease (CFLD) is a well-known complication and includes a wide&#xD;
      range of hepatobiliary diseases. The clinical outcome in CFLD is largely determined by PHT&#xD;
      and its sequelae. Variceal bleeding is the most feared complication. Currently, there is no&#xD;
      medical therapy to delay or reverse clinically established CFLD.Treatment focuses on&#xD;
      screening for and managing the complications of portal hypertension and optimizing&#xD;
      nutritional status. Eventually, liver transplantation (LT) is an effective therapeutic option&#xD;
      for CF patients with end-stage liver failure, treatment resistant, and complicated portal&#xD;
      hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TIPS placement is a well-established procedure for portal vein decompression in adults. In&#xD;
      retrospective case studies of severe CFLD cirrhosis in pediatric populations, TIPS has been&#xD;
      proven a feasible option in acute or refractory variceal bleeding and as a bridge to LT. In&#xD;
      CFLD patients, little data are available on the long-term outcome of treatments to mitigate&#xD;
      PHT. In this trial, the primary aim was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a pre-emptive&#xD;
      TIPS for the prophylaxis of variceal bleeding in non-cirrhotic CFLD with early PHT. The&#xD;
      secondary aim was to investigate the long-term clinical outcome of a pre-emptive TIPS and in&#xD;
      more particular, whether TIPS might effectively postpone LT.&#xD;

    <description>Patients with CFLD without cirrhosis were eligible for a pre-emptive TIPS, when early (asymptomatic) signs of portal hypertension. All procedures were performed under general anaesthesia by an experienced interventional radiologist. Depending on the patient's age and physiognomy, TIPS was created following a conventional transjugular technique as for adults or by a dedicated combined percutaneous transhepatic-transjugular (PIPS) approach for small children. Routinely, an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene-covered endoprosthesis was used for shunt creation. If the sheath could not be negotiated into the main portal vein, a self-expandable, non-covered stent was placed. We did not pursue a minimum gradient reduction.&#xD;
Percutaneous liver biopsy was performed during TIPS procedure to confirm the diagnosis of fibrosis or cirrhosis.</description>
