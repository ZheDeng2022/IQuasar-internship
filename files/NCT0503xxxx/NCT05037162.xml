      240 adult patients who suffer from moderate COVID-19 infection. Safety will be assessed&#xD;
      through collection and analysis of adverse events, blood and urine laboratory assessments and&#xD;

&#xD;
      After Screening visit, the study drug will be administrated twice a day morning and evening&#xD;
      (every 12 hours) during (day 1 and day 2) The patients will be randomized in 1:1:1 ratio to&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A preparation of CimertA (Botanical Drug), comprising Curcumin, Boswellia, and Vitamin C in a&#xD;
      nanoparticular formulation, is proposed as a treatment for the disease associated with the&#xD;
      novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2. This initiative is presented under the urgent circumstances of&#xD;
      the fulminant pandemic caused by this lethal disease, which is known as COVID-19 and has&#xD;
      spread across the globe causing death and disrupting the normal function of modern society.&#xD;
      The grounds for the proposal are rooted in existing knowledge on the components and&#xD;
      pharmacological features of this formulation and their relevance to the current understanding&#xD;
      of the disease process being addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The breakout of a lethal pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, China, towards the end of 2019, has&#xD;
      led to the characterization of the new coronavirus related disease COVID-19. Its prominent&#xD;
      features include a high rate of person-to-person transmission, a substantial risk of&#xD;
      developing a lethal respiratory syndrome and potential failure of additional organs. Risk&#xD;
      factors for a life-threatening clinical course have been identified, including advanced age&#xD;
      and assorted comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension,&#xD;
      cancer. However, individuals devoid of any of the recognized risk factors are not immune to&#xD;
      the severe manifestation of the disease and once infected carry a certain risk of mortality&#xD;
      which has been calculated in Italy at circa 2%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CoV is an enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ss-RNA) virus belonging to the&#xD;
      Coronaviridae family. The severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus disease&#xD;
      2019 (COVID-19) illness is a syndrome of viral replication in concert with a host&#xD;
      inflammatory response. The cytokine storm and viral evasion of cellular immune responses may&#xD;
      play an equally important role in the pathogenesis, clinical manifestation, and outcomes of&#xD;
      COVID-19. Systemic proinflammatory cytokines and biomarkers are elevated as the disease&#xD;
      progresses towards its advanced stages, and correlate with worse chances of survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 activates the innate immune system and results in a release of a large number of&#xD;
      cytokines, including IL-6, which can increase vascular permeability and cause a migration of&#xD;
      fluid and blood cells into the alveoli as well as the consequent symptoms such as dyspnea and&#xD;
      respiratory failure. The higher mortality is being linked to the result of ARDS (acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome) aggravation and the tissue damage that can result in&#xD;
      organ-failure and/or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum cytokine levels that are elevated in patients with Covid-19-associated cytokine storm&#xD;
      include interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, IP-10, TNF, interferon-γ, macrophage inflammatory&#xD;
      protein (MIP) 1α and 1β, and VEGF. Higher interleukin-6 levels are strongly associated with&#xD;
      shorter survival. The relative frequencies of circulating activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and&#xD;
      plasma blasts are increased in Covid-19. In addition to the elevated systemic cytokine levels&#xD;
      and activated immune cells, several clinical and laboratory abnormalities, such as elevated&#xD;
      CRP and d-dimer levels, hypoalbuminemia, renal dysfunction, and effusions, are also observed&#xD;
      in Covid-19, as they are in cytokine storm disorders. Laboratory test results reflecting&#xD;
      hyperinflammation and tissue damage were found to predict worsening outcomes in Covid-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CimetrA, comprising Curcumin, Boswellia, and Vitamin C in a nanoparticular formulation, was&#xD;
      studied on patients with the novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2 in randomized double blind control&#xD;
      Phase II study (MGC-006 - under a previous product name - ArtemiC). The study product&#xD;
      demonstrated excellent safety and efficacy profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the in vitro clinical trial CimetrA demonstrated the ability to reduce cytokines elevation&#xD;
      in PBMC induced cell tissue.&#xD;
