    <textblock>
      Adolescent pregnancy leads to increase risks and complications for the adolescent mother and&#xD;
      her newborn. This study aims to examine the effects of empowerment program integrated with&#xD;
      family support on maternal self-esteem and quality of life among Palestinian pregnant&#xD;
      adolescents. A randomized controlled single-blind trial, pretest-posttest controlled group&#xD;
      design will be conducted with 62 participants ( control group =31, experimental group = 31).&#xD;
      Research instruments will include the instruments for data collection, instruments for&#xD;
      research intervention, and control instruments for intervention evaluation. The instruments&#xD;
      for data collection will be consists of a demographic data form, Maternal Self-Report&#xD;
      Inventory (MSRI), and WHO quality of life-BREF (WHOQoL-BREF, 1997). The empowerment program&#xD;
      integrated with family support will be the research intervention instruments and included&#xD;
      five steps; step 1: building relationships and creating collaboration, step 2: discovering&#xD;
      reality, step 3: critical reflection, step 4: taking charge, and step 5: holding on. Control&#xD;
      instruments through Family Support Questionnaire (FSQ) will be used to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the intervention program. Data will be analyzed using mean and standard&#xD;
      deviations, frequency distribution, percentage, and chi-square test, and t-test. This program&#xD;
      is expected to guide nurses to empower pregnant adolescents in enhancing maternal self-esteem&#xD;
      and improve their quality of life.&#xD;
