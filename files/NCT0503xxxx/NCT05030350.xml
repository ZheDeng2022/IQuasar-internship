  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety and tolerability of PH94B with repeated dosing over a period&#xD;
      of up to 12 months. Participating subjects will use PH94B up to 4 times a day when they&#xD;
      encounter anxiety-provoking situations in daily life. Safety and tolerability of PH94B (â‰¤ 4&#xD;
      doses per day up to 12 months) will be assessed and summarized during monthly visits from&#xD;
      baseline (Visit 2) to end of treatment (Visit 14) in AEs, laboratory values, 12-lead ECGs,&#xD;
      physical examinations, and vital sign assessments following exposure to PH94B.&#xD;

        Most but not all patients will enter the study following completion of Palisade-1&#xD;
        (NCT047548020) and Palisade-2 (NCT05011396).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male and female adults, 18 through 65 years of age, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Women of childbearing potential must be able to commit to the consistent and correct&#xD;
             use of an effective method of birth control throughout the study, and must also have a&#xD;
             negative urine pregnancy test result at both Screening (Visit 1) (for subjects who&#xD;
             attend Visit 1) and Baseline (Visit 2), prior to IP administration. Effective methods&#xD;
             of contraception include: condoms with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptive agents (oral, transdermal, or injectable), or implantable contraceptive&#xD;
             devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Current diagnosis of social anxiety disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Clinician-rated HAM-D17 total score &lt; 18 at study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. LSAS score 50 or greater&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any history of bipolar disorder (I or II), schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder,&#xD;
             psychosis, anorexia or bulimia, autism-spectrum disorder, or obsessive-compulsive&#xD;
             disorder. Any other current Axis I disorder, other than SAD, which is the primary&#xD;
             focus of treatment. Note that subjects with concurrent Generalized Anxiety Disorder&#xD;
             are eligible for the study provided that Generalized Anxiety Disorder is not the&#xD;
             primary diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects who meet criteria for moderate or severe alcohol or substance use disorder&#xD;
             within the 1 year prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. In the opinion of the Investigator, the subject has a significant risk for suicidal&#xD;
             behavior during the course of their participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Clinically significant nasal pathology or history of significant nasal trauma, nasal&#xD;
             surgery, total anosmia, or nasal septum perforation that may have damaged the nasal&#xD;
             chemosensory epithelium.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. An acute or chronic condition, including an infectious illness, uncontrolled seasonal&#xD;
             allergies at the time of the study, or significant nasal congestion that potentially&#xD;
             could affect drug delivery to the nasal chemosensory epithelium.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects using the following psychotropic medications: anticonvulsants, mood&#xD;
             stabilizers, antipsychotic medications, gabapentin, pregabalin, opioids, naltrexone,&#xD;
             esketamine, and ketamine at enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Subjects using lower doses of atypical antipsychotics at Screening may be eligible&#xD;
             after discussion with the Medical Monitor (e.g., quetiapine &lt; 100 mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
             In general, subjects using antidepressants or buspirone can continue to receive these&#xD;
             provided that they have been taking them for a minimum of 2 months, and have been on a&#xD;
             stable dose for a minimum of 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Use of anxiolytics, such as benzodiazepines or unapproved treatments such as beta&#xD;
             blockers, within 30 days before study entry; concomitant use is prohibited during the&#xD;
             study. Subjects who have been taking benzodiazepines daily for 1 month or longer at&#xD;
             the time of Visit 1 are not eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Use of any over-the-counter product, prescription product, or herbal preparation for&#xD;
             treatment of the symptoms of anxiety or social anxiety within 30 days before study&#xD;
             entry; concomitant use is prohibited during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects with clinically significant abnormalities in hematology, blood chemistry,&#xD;
             urinalysis, 12-lead ECG, or physical examination identified at the Screening visit or&#xD;
             Baseline visit that in the clinical judgment of the Investigator, could place the&#xD;
             subject at undue risk, interfere with study participation, or confound the results of&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
