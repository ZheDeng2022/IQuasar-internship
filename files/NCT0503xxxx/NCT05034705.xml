  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study compares the use of a dental aerosol box in preventing microbial transmission&#xD;
      during dental procedure. Subjects requiring scaling treatment (BPE 2) will be recruited.&#xD;
      Subjects will be allocated either into the control group (conventional suction method) or&#xD;
      interventional group (dental aerosol box) Treatment will involve scaling of two quadrants,&#xD;
      where data collection of the microbes will be taken. Secondary outcome will involve a&#xD;
      self-administered questionnaire on patients acceptance over the scaling procedure either with&#xD;
      conventional suction or using the dental aerosol box to contain the aerosol generated during&#xD;
      the scaling procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A closed operation room, with the facility to fumigate the room is chosen for all treatment&#xD;
      procedures. Patients would be treated with time separations that would be reasonable to&#xD;
      prevent microbial detection of the previous patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculated based on Sadun et al (2020) to compare two groups would require 15&#xD;
      subjects per group for a 90% power and 0.05 significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: BPE 2 on at least 2 quadrants. Exclusion criteria: Smoker and systemic&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised using randomiser.org. The list will be placed in a sealed envelop&#xD;
      by an individual not involved in subject recruitment. Patient grouping will be determined&#xD;
      after recruitment and consent. The envelop will be opened and patient allocated to the group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conventional suction (control)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dental aerosol box with modified high-volume evacuation system (interventional)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure will involve scaling of two quadrants, where data collection of the microbes&#xD;
      will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before each appointment, at the start of study all operatory surfaces were cleaned and&#xD;
      disinfected with Ethyl alcohol (70%). Between each treatment and at start of treatment,&#xD;
      ultrasonic scaler units will be flushed with water for 2 minutes. Use of 0.5% Sodium&#xD;
      Hypochlorite will be done for flushing the tubing of dental chair waterline and the same&#xD;
      solution would be allowed to stay in tubing for 10 minutes followed by water flushing to&#xD;
      remove the unwanted biofilm from the tubing surfaces. This procedure would be done at the end&#xD;
      of each treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then operatory will fumigated at the end of all procedures to allow the room to be free of&#xD;
      aerosol before it is allowed for use for the subsequent subject. Dental unit would use&#xD;
      distilled water in self-contained system, for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Primary outcome: microbial colony forming unit Passive sampling will be conducted to&#xD;
      assess the index of microbial air contamination as described in other studies (Pasquarella C,&#xD;
      et al 2000, Napoli C, et al 2012, Saha R, et al 2017). The method quantifies the microbial&#xD;
      flow directly related to the contamination of surfaces coming from microbes that reach&#xD;
      critical points by falling on to them. The index of microbial air contamination is based on&#xD;
      the count of the microbial fallout on to Petri dishes left open to the air according to the&#xD;
      1/1/1 scheme (for 1h, 1m from the floor, at least 1m away from walls or any obstacle). This&#xD;
      index corresponds to the values of CFU calculated from the culture plates of 9 cm diameter.&#xD;
      Sealed petri dishes will be transported to where the procedures will be done. Gravity settle&#xD;
      plates using tryptic soy agar in 9cm Petri dishes will be used to assess the colony count for&#xD;
      passive sampling. The index of microbial air contamination will be assessed at rest (in the&#xD;
      early morning before the beginning of dental procedures) and in operational of procedures&#xD;
      (during procedures) to determine changes in bacterial count due to dental treatment. Five&#xD;
      resting and five in operational samples will be taken from each room. Plates will be&#xD;
      incubated overnight at 37Â°C and colony counts will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) Secondary outcome: patient acceptance Patient will complete a self-administered&#xD;
      questionnaire to determine their acceptance over the experience to undergo the scaling&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
