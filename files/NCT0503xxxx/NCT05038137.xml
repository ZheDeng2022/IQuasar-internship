    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomly assigned to either the time restricted feeding group with a&#xD;
      daily eating period of 8 hours or the control group with a daily eating period of greater&#xD;
      than or equal to 12 hours. There are 2 in-person study visits to have blood, urine and vital&#xD;
      signs collected and 8 remote or phone visits with a psychologist to assist with the eating&#xD;
      schedule. The study will take last 3 1/2 months.&#xD;
