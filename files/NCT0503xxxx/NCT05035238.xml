    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of two&#xD;
      different strengths (3 µg/0.5 mL and 4,5 µg/0.5 mL) of inactivated COVID 19 Vaccine- TURKOVAC&#xD;
      in healthy subjects following 3rd vaccination to demonstrate clinical evidence in prophylaxis&#xD;
      of COVID 19.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, triple dose, parallel, randomized design study comparing two&#xD;
      different dose levels and immunization regimen of a novel COVID-19 vaccine candidate -&#xD;
      TURKOVAC - against SARS-CoV-2 infection, to assess the efficacy and safety of these vaccine&#xD;
      strengths after 3rd dose vaccination. This study will also provide more data to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of the 3rd dose vaccination (booster dose) for COVID-19 prophylaxis including&#xD;
      comparison to a cohort of standard convalescent serum samples obtained from World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be completed in 12 months.&#xD;
