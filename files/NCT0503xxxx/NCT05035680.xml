&#xD;
          5. All female participants: have a negative pregnancy test or post-menopausal status.&#xD;
             Postmenopausal status is defined as 12 months with no menses without alternative&#xD;
             medical cause. Female participants of childbearing potential (Part 1): have a negative&#xD;

             to randomization, not breastfeeding, and willing to use highly effective methods of&#xD;
             contraception 14 days before study drug administration through last scheduled follow&#xD;
             up visit (End of Study). Male participants with female partners of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential (Part 1): agree to use one of the following contraception methods from the&#xD;
             day of randomization to the last follow-up visit of the partner: vasectomy with&#xD;
             documentation of azoospermia, or male condom use; agree to not donate sperm prior to&#xD;
             the last scheduled follow-up visit (End of Study).&#xD;

             skin in the 1 year preceding the screening visit and/or a history of any other&#xD;
             malignancy in the 5 years preceding the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Have any other condition or situation that in the investigator's opinion might&#xD;
             increase the risk to the participant or jeopardize the participant's compliance with&#xD;
