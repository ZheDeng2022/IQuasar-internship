      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of an early and integral communication&#xD;
      strategy (EICS) versus standard care, on the rate of depressive symptoms at 3 months after&#xD;
      discharge from the ICU, in patients with severe Covid-19, their family members and health&#xD;
      personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluating the rate of depressive symptoms at 3 months after discharge from the ICU, with a)&#xD;
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression, b) Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (S)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      We designed a pre-post intervention study, the groups were non-randomly allocated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is implementation in 10 Chilean hospitals, admitting 350 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-intervention: The practices of each ICU will be maintained, until the moment that&#xD;
      according to randomization corresponds the beginning of the intervention, in each center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-intervention: EICS to facilitate communication between the family, patient and health&#xD;
      team, through written material, via the web (tablet and webmaster) and by telephone.&#xD;
