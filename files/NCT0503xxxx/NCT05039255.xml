  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the acute effects of the self-elongation movement on&#xD;
      the balance of patients (aged 8-16 years) suffering from adolescent idiopathic scoliosis,&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Recruitment will be carried out by the physician during the scheduled follow-up. The&#xD;
      participant and both parents, or the legal guardian, will receive information on the purpose&#xD;
      and methods of this study. The informed consent of both parents, or the legal guardian, and&#xD;
      of the minor will be requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Balance data (oscillations, sway area) will be collected by letting participants get on a&#xD;
      stabilometric platform and placing their feet on the landmarks; position will not change for&#xD;
      the duration of the assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, the modification of the amplitude of the scoliotic curves will be evaluated&#xD;
      with the use of the Spine 3D (medical class system) which uses micro-pulse laser technology&#xD;
      to make a three-dimensional reconstruction of the spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three 10-seconds assessments will be made. In the first the subject will reproduce the&#xD;
      position hold for the scheduled radiography and an acquisition will be performed with the&#xD;
      Spine3D. The obtained image will be compared with the radiographic one to improve the&#xD;
      accuracy of the next evaluations. During the last two acquisitions, the stabilometric&#xD;
      platform and the 3D Spine will be used simultaneously and the data for the study will be&#xD;
      collected. The second acquisition will be performed in a physiological position and the third&#xD;
      in self-lengthening, a position used in most of the rehabilitation methods for scoliosis. The&#xD;
      full evaluation will take approximately 15 minutes.&#xD;
