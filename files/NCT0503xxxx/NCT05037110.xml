  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to identify efficient treatments to help those with&#xD;
      chemosensory losses due to Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). To do so, 75 participants, men and&#xD;
      women, aged 18 years old and above living in Canada will be recruited. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of the following three groups (25 in each group): physical activity,&#xD;
      smell training, and control. Here is a quick summary of what participants in each group will&#xD;
      have to do remotely during 12 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical activity group: Engage in physical activity for 12 weeks and wear a smart watch&#xD;
           daily. Attend a 15-minute virtual meeting with a research professional every two weeks,&#xD;
           that is six times during the 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smell training group: Smell four odors twice a day for 12 weeks and evaluate their&#xD;
           sensory perceptions via an online survey sent for each session specifically. Attend a&#xD;
           15-minute virtual meeting with a research professional every two weeks, that is six&#xD;
           times during the 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group: Not change their usual routine for 12 weeks. Complete an online 15-minute&#xD;
           follow-up questionnaire every two weeks, that is six times over the 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, within each group, 10 individuals from Montreal, Quebec will be randomly&#xD;
      selected to complete additional assessments in the laboratory. To distinguish this subgroup,&#xD;
      it is called the &quot;in-person subgroup.&quot; Participants will be assessed at the beginning of the&#xD;
      intervention period, immediately after the intervention period, and 12 weeks after the end of&#xD;
      the intervention period. The assessments include various questionnaires on sociodemographic&#xD;
      data, physical and mental health, lifestyle habits, sensory dysfunction, nutritional&#xD;
      preferences, as well as self-administered smell and taste tests sent by mail. The in-person&#xD;
      subgroup only will have to do the following additional assessments: smell and taste tests&#xD;
      using special equipment (olfactometer, gustometer, electroencephalogram) and online&#xD;
      questionnaires on food intake for the day.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes from baseline in olfactory score on the 40-item University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) at week 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The UPSIT test is a validated self-administered test that assesses olfactory function. In this test, odorants are released when participants scratch the standardized odor-impregnated test booklet. After smelling the odor, participants identify the smell from a list of odorants. Possible scores range from 0 to 40, where a higher score means a higher olfactory function.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes from Baseline in Brain Responses Following Smell Stimulations at Week 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>Brain responses to smell stimulations an olfactometer will be recorded by an electroencephalogram.&#xD;
The olfactometer is a device that gently blows different odors into the participant's nose at specific time intervals.&#xD;
The electroencephalogram is a non-invasive device that records the electrical activity of the participant's brain. Electrical sensors are placed on helmet-like equipment that the participant wears while he/she smells or tastes samples.&#xD;
The brain activity is measured; smell event-related potentials (latency, duration, and amplitude) using an electroencephalogram are obtained.&#xD;
This procedure is done by participants in the in-person subgroup only.&#xD;

This will be completed on four different days within the week following the laboratory visit. Then, calories and macronutrients are calculated.&#xD;
These questionnaires are filled by participants in the in-person subgroup only.&#xD;
