  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single arm, open-label, single-center study to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of Surufatinib combined with Toripalimab in patients with peritoneal metastatic&#xD;
      carcinoma of gastrointestinal or primary peritoneal cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population is about 72 patients with advanced peritoneal metastatic carcinoma of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal or primary peritoneal cancer, who fails or cannot tolerate standard&#xD;
      therapies. Surufatinib 250 mg once a day (QD) will be orally administrated and Toripalimab&#xD;
      240mg will be intravenously administered every 3 weeks up to documented disease progression,&#xD;
      development of unacceptable toxicity, participant request, or withdrawal of consent. For&#xD;
      Toripalimab, the upper time limit for treatment is 2 years. The primary objective is overall&#xD;
      survival (OS) of Surufatinib combined with Toripalimab in patients with advanced solid&#xD;
      advanced peritoneal metastatic carcinoma of gastrointestinal or primary peritoneal cancer.&#xD;
