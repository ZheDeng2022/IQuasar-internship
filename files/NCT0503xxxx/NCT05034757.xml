  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rotator cuff lesions are common disorders of the shoulder joint and mainly caused by&#xD;
      intrinsic degeneration and outlet impingement. The symptoms include pain, discomfort,&#xD;
      weakness, range of motion limitation, and impingement. The initial treatment of rotator cuff&#xD;
      lesions are non-surgical especially for non-full thickness tearing and include rehabilitation&#xD;
      and medications given orally, topically, or parenterally. Although many patients with rotator&#xD;
      cuff lesions or subacromial pain are treated with, and will respond to non- surgical&#xD;
      treatment alone, surgical intervention with subacromial decompression and rotator cuff repair&#xD;
      is often used as an early treatment choice or in recalcitrant cases. The indications for&#xD;
      surgery are persistent and severe shoulder pain combined with functional restrictions that&#xD;
      are resistant to conservative measures. However, the effectiveness of this procedure is still&#xD;
      elusive. Some studies have compared decompression plus subacromial bursectomy with bursectomy&#xD;
      alone and reported no significant difference in clinical outcome between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, arthroscopic subacromial decompression for shouled impingement was currently&#xD;
      challenged because some high-quality prospective studies including that from Oxford&#xD;
      university showed similar outcomes between surgical and non-surgical treatment. Therefore&#xD;
      more efficient non-surgical treatments were needed for the rotator cuff lesions without&#xD;
      complete tear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have successfully treated non- calcific rotator cuff lesions without&#xD;
      complete tearing with hyaluronate and published our data in J Shoulder Elbow surgery. Jun&#xD;
      19:557-63, 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Phase III study, the investigators will perform three subacromial hyaluronate&#xD;
      injections and zero to two sessions of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) for these&#xD;
      patients. The investigators hypothesize that through the actions of anti-inflammation,&#xD;
      neovascularization and temporary cell permeability increment, a combined therapy of HA and&#xD;
      ESWT may offer better therapeutic effects on the non-calcific rotator cuff lesion without&#xD;
      complete tearing. The investigators will evaluate the treatment effects with Constant score&#xD;
      and VAS scale and also check the changes or expressions of cytokines, growth factors,&#xD;
      functional proteins, from the peripheral blood.&#xD;

&#xD;
      The investigators have successfully treated non-calcific rotator cuff lesions without&#xD;
      complete with hyaluronate and published our data in J Shoulder Elbow Surg. Jun&#xD;
      19:557-63,2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase III study, the investigators will perform three subacromial hyaluronate&#xD;
      injections and zero to two sessions of extracorporeal therapy (ESWT). The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that through the actions of anti-inflammation, neovascularization and temporary&#xD;
      cell permeability increment of ESWT, a combined therapy of HA and ESWT may offer better&#xD;
      therapeutic effects on the non-calcific rotator cuff lesion without complete tearing. The&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate the treatment effects with constant score and VAS, and also check&#xD;
      the changesor expressions of cytokines, growth factors, functional protein, from the&#xD;
      peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Acceptance criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study will involve 69 or more&#xD;
           patients who have non-calcific rotator cuff lesions without complete tear. The inclusion&#xD;
           criteria are (1) patients who have pain around the shoulder, a positive impingement&#xD;
           sign, and a positive imaging diagnosis of rotator non-calcific cuff pathology without&#xD;
           complete tear; (2) patients who do not respond to conservative therapy or rehabilitation&#xD;
           for at least 3 months; and (3) patients age between 35 and 80 years, who sign the&#xD;
           informed consent form. The investigators will exclude patients who have rheumatic&#xD;
           diseases, glenohumeral osteoarthritis, full-thickness cuff tears, fractures, infections,&#xD;
           or tumors; those who have received a subacromial injection within 3 weeks; and those who&#xD;
           are pregnant or want to become pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The sample size is calculated under the expectation of an improvement in the Constant&#xD;
           score of 10 points, with an SD of 12 points in each group, and a power value of 0.8. For&#xD;
           this study design, the minimal number of patients required in each group is 23, by use&#xD;
           of an independent-samples t test. The intent-to-treat population is a fully randomized&#xD;
           group of patients who have a baseline value (Constant score and VAS before treatment).&#xD;
           The imaging diagnosis of a rotator cuff lesion is made by a musculoskeletal radiologist&#xD;
           who has considerable experience in interpreting both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
           and sonographic results for shoulders. On the sonogram, hypoechoic thickening of the&#xD;
           rotator cuff indicates tendinosis. Focal thinning or focal hypoechoic areas of&#xD;
           discontinuity in the rotator cuff are suggestive of partial-thickness tearing. In cases&#xD;
           of the hypoechoic gap extending through the entire rotator cuff, tendon retraction, or&#xD;
           the absence of a visible rotator cuff, a full thickness tear is assumed to be present.&#xD;
           On MRI, rotator cuff tendinosis is characterized by increased intratendinous signal&#xD;
           intensity on T2-weighted images without tendon disruption. Partial-thickness tearing is&#xD;
           characterized by the presence of focal hyperintense fluid or a fluid-like signal&#xD;
           intensity that extended into the tendon on the T2-weighted images. A full thickness tear&#xD;
           is diagnosed by the extension of hyperintense fluid or fluid-like signal intensity&#xD;
           through the entire thickness of the interrupted rotator cuff tendon on T2-weighted&#xD;
           images.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Experiment design and method Patients are then randomly into three groups and every&#xD;
           patient receives three injections of HA along with ESWT treatment based on statistical&#xD;
           randomization. For ESWT of the shoulder the patient will receive Storz Extracorporeal&#xD;
           Shock Wave Therapy 3000 impulses (each point) of shockwaves at 24kV (energy flux&#xD;
           density, 0.32mJ/mm2) to the affected shoulder. Treatments are performed on an outpatient&#xD;
           basis. The areas of treatment (2 points) near the supraspinatus insertion is focused&#xD;
           with a control guide on the machine, and surgical lubricant is placed on the skin in&#xD;
           contact with the shockwave tube. The sham treatment entails use of the same device in&#xD;
           which the shockwave generator is disconnected. The patients' vital signs and local&#xD;
           discomfort are monitored throughout the course of treatment. The treated area is&#xD;
           inspected for local swelling, ecchymosis, or hematoma immediately after the treatment.&#xD;
           Our primary endpoint is the Constant Score improvement by 10 points and the treatment&#xD;
           success is followed up to 1 year. The Constant score pain score and the range of&#xD;
           shoulder motion are measured. Another kind of pain and pain that requires surgery is&#xD;
           classified as a failure case, which is the secondary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Rehabilitation including gentle flexion, abduction, internal rotation and external&#xD;
           rotation exercises, pendulum exercises, and resistant exercises will be instructed and&#xD;
           continued during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have a pain medication-free interval 2 days prior to each evaluation. After&#xD;
      treatment and during follow-up, patients will be restricted to the use of a 750mg of&#xD;
      acetaminophen per day for pain, in order to fascilitate usage and comparison of the&#xD;
      medications among the patients. Follow-up examinations with range of motion, VAS and Constant&#xD;
      score are performed independently by one of the coauthors, who is blinded to patient&#xD;
      treatment status during the treatment course and at 1week, 1month, 3months, 6 months, and 12&#xD;
      months after treatment. Peripheral blood (10cc) will be collected during the treatment course&#xD;
      and 1 week, 1 month and 3 month after treatment and shoulder MRI will be checked 12 months&#xD;
      after treatment. Patients who have persistent shoulder discomfort may be advised to undergo&#xD;
      surgical intervention.&#xD;
