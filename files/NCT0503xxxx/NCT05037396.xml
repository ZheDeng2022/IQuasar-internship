  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a retrospective cohort study to assess the treatment history, demographic&#xD;
      characteristics, clinical characteristics, and early treatment patterns of patients who&#xD;
      received brolucizumab for neovascular age-related macular degeneration using IRIS Registry.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with wet AMD who received brolucizumab.&#xD;
      Evidence was generated from the IRIS registry to describe patient treatment histories,&#xD;
      demographic and clinical characteristics, and early treatment patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting and study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IRIS Registry EHR data from 10/08/2018 to the 03/31/2020 from patients with wet AMD who&#xD;
      initiated brolucizumab were analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification period of the index date: The patients fulfilling the selection criteria&#xD;
      identified during the period from 10/08/2019 to 03/31/2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Index date: Defined as the date of the earliest brolucizumab injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Period: The period from 10/08/2018 to 03/31/2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-index period: The period 12 months prior to the index date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-index period: The period 4 months after the index date (not a required selection&#xD;
      criterion; only for the assessment of select endpoints in a subgroup of patients).&#xD;
