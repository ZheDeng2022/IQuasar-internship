      This pilot study will develop and examine the acceptability of a Community Navigator program&#xD;
      of support for 10-24 older adult Arab Americans participants receiving services at a&#xD;
      refugee-serving organization based in Southern California. This program will provide&#xD;
      participants with social support from a 'Community Navigator,' who will work with clients to&#xD;
      help promote attendance and engagement with the community during social activities and&#xD;
      community events. This program aims to reduce feelings of loneliness or social isolation. In&#xD;
      partnership with the refugee-serving organization, the UCLA investigators will implement this&#xD;
      program in addition to services provided as usual at the community partner site. Researchers&#xD;
      will then conduct interviews to explore participants' experiences and perceptions for&#xD;
      improvement of the program.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Refugee Mental Health and Wellness Pilot Study aims to increase community connections and&#xD;
      reduce loneliness for older adult immigrants and refugees, specifically from MENA countries&#xD;
      of origin through the implementation of a Community Navigator program. This program will be&#xD;
      implemented within an existing aging program for older adults at a refugee-serving&#xD;
      organization that provides social services, English language classes, and computer classes&#xD;
      for this population. The pilot program is an extension of case management services at this&#xD;
      organization. The program provides up to ten weekly virtual (through video or telephone)&#xD;
      home-visiting sessions. During these sessions, an Arabic-speaking program coordinator or an&#xD;
      Arabic-speaking nurse will assess client wellbeing, social service needs, as well as referral&#xD;
      to social activities and other services needed over three months. The coordinator or nurse&#xD;
      will be trained in a trauma-informed approach to working with refugee and immigrant clients.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited at the partner site. This study aims to recruit between 10-24&#xD;
      older adults interested in participating in semi-structured interviews to examine program&#xD;
      acceptability and explore suggestions on improving the program. The baseline and completion&#xD;
      survey will collect data on social demographics, social support, depressive symptoms, and&#xD;
      loneliness score. Interviews will be conducted at least 6-8 weeks upon enrollment in the&#xD;
      program. This pilot study will provide preliminary evidence of the acceptability of Community&#xD;
      Navigator support and trial evaluation procedures for testing this. The results will inform a&#xD;
      future feasibility study and potentially, and potentially, a randomized controlled trial of&#xD;
      this intervention.&#xD;
