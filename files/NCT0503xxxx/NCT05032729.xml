  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the impact of two nutritional interventions vs. placebo on&#xD;
      objective and subjective sleep measures in athletes. Participants receive one beverage on&#xD;
      each of three consecutive nights in a randomized manner. It is hypothesized the two&#xD;
      nutritional interventions will result in significant improvements in sleep onset latency, and&#xD;
      will not result in a negative impact on next-day cycling performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to assess the impact of the nutritional interventions vs. placebo&#xD;
      on next-morning performance (physical, cognitive function, and balance).&#xD;
