  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was determine whether milk or soy milk supplements combined with&#xD;
      resistance exercise improved sarcopenia in the elderly. This study was randomized controlled&#xD;
      trail that recruited elderly people ≧65 years old with sarcopenia in the nursing home of&#xD;
      Taipei Veterans General Hospital Su-Ao and Yuanshan Branch from June 2017 to December, 2017.&#xD;
      The participants were divided into three groups, such as control, milk supplement and soy&#xD;
      milk supplement. The milk and soy milk groups provided 200 mL milk or soy milk two times per&#xD;
      day. Moreover, all participants joined the resistance exercise training program, three times&#xD;
      per week (30 min/time). After 12 weeks, the anthropometry, sarcopenia index, blood&#xD;
      biochemical index, nutrition status index, inflammation index, insulin resistance index, and&#xD;
      dietary intake were measured.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The anthropometry data included body weight and body fat. The sarcopenia index included&#xD;
      appendicular skeletal muscle mass index, calf circumferences, hand grip and gait speed.&#xD;
      Moreover, blood biochemical index (liver function as ALT, kidney function as creatinine),&#xD;
      nutrition status index (prealbumin, 25-hydroxyvitamin D) were also analyzed. The blood hsCRP&#xD;
      level was as inflammation index and insulin resistance index included fasting blood sugar,&#xD;
      insulin, HbA1c and HOMA-IR. The daily dietary intake were also recorded.&#xD;
