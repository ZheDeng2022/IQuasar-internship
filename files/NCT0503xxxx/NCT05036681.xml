             condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study&#xD;
             participation or futibatinib and pembrolizumab administration, or may interfere with&#xD;
             the interpretation of study results, and in the judgment of the Investigator would&#xD;
             make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Having not recovered from a major surgical procedure or significant traumatic injury&#xD;
