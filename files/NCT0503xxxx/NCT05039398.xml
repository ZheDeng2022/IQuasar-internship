  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the aim to inspire and motivate workplaces in their work to prevent and reduce&#xD;
      occupational health and safety hazards, the Danish Working Environment Authority (WEA)&#xD;
      developed the intervention 'Dialogue and Guidance' aimed at workplaces receiving notices&#xD;
      (prohibition notice, immediate improvement notice and notice with time limit) from WEA during&#xD;
      inspections. At present, WEA gives dialogue and guidance as standard practice during WEA&#xD;
      inspections to all workplaces receiving a notice with the purpose to help workplaces resolve&#xD;
      the occupational health and safety problem that led to the notice. In the intervention&#xD;
      'Dialogue and Guidance' the experimental groups are receiving additional dialogue and&#xD;
      guidance at a subsequent meeting (over the telephone or physical presence) that takes place&#xD;
      after the inspection and after the deadline for appealing the notice has expired. The control&#xD;
      group is receiving dialogue and guidance during inspection as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this RCT study is to evaluate the policy-developed intervention with additional&#xD;
      'Dialogue and Guidance' in regards to the effect on motivation and priority of occupational&#xD;
      health and safety work at the workplace after 6 months follow-up and for WEA notices by next&#xD;
      WEA inspection (approx. follow-up by 12-18 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study is risk assessed and approved under Danish Data Protection Agency via the National&#xD;
      Research Centre for the Working Environment's umbrella approval.&#xD;

    <intervention_model>Parallel Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>Parallel Assignment Each workplace assigned for inspection by the WEA is randomized to either of two intervention groups (physical meeting dialogue and guidance, telephone meeting dialogue and guidance) or a control group. If the workplace receives a WEA notice of material violations of work environment regulations, the workplace receives an offer for dialogue and guidance if they are in one of the two intervention groups. The comparison group receives treatment as usual.&#xD;
Randomization as follows:&#xD;
1/3 are randomized to treatment-as-usual comparison status 1/3 are randomized to receive dialogue and guidance over telephone 1/3 are randomized to receive dialogue and guidance at a physical meeting</intervention_model_description>
    <primary_purpose>Prevention</primary_purpose>
    <masking>None (Open Label)</masking>
    <masking_description>None (Open Label) During inspection by the WEA the intervention status is masked for both the inspector and the assessed workplace. After the inspection is complete and all violation notices are sent to the company, the intervention group additionally receives invitation to a dialogue and guidance meeting. From this point the intervention is not masked.</masking_description>
