  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, single-site, single-arm open-label trial of zanidatamab in patients with&#xD;
      early stage, low risk HER2+ BC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of zanidatamab for patients with early&#xD;
      stage HER2/neu positive (HER2+) breast cancer (BC) as determined by pathologic complete&#xD;
      response (pCR) .&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the efficacy of zanidatamab for patients with early stage HER2/neu positive&#xD;
      (HER2+) breast cancer (BC) as determined by pathologic complete response (pCR) 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine pathologic response by residual cancer burden (RCB). 1-3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the radiographic response and volumetric change in tumor size by ultrasound&#xD;
           and MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate tolerability and safety of zanidatamab for treatment-naïve early stage HER2+&#xD;
           breast cancer (BC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the rate of adverse events and treatment-emergent adverse events with&#xD;
           zanidatamab alone (for patients with hormone receptor negative tumors) or with endocrine&#xD;
           therapy tamoxifen or letrozole (in hormone receptor positive tumors) To evaluate the&#xD;
           feasibility of treating patients with early stage HER2+ breast cancer with monotherapy&#xD;
           zanidatamab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine tumor-based predictive biomarkers of response&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objective(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess circulating free DNA levels and dynamics as biomarkers of response&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess effect of zanidatamab on immune environment&#xD;
