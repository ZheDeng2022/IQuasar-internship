  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disability due to neurological diseases is increasing in our country and world. With regular&#xD;
      physiotherapy and rehabilitation, as well as patients' symptoms are brought under control,&#xD;
      their affected functions in daily life are achieved and levels of independence and physical&#xD;
      activity increase. Thus, the patients' quality of life and participation in social life is&#xD;
      improved and patients are supported in physical, social and psychological terms. In recent&#xD;
      years, it has been reported that exercise with telerehabilitation systems increase the&#xD;
      compliance and participation of patients to the treatment, and even this system seems as&#xD;
      effective as standard rehabilitation practices. Delivering the treatment through&#xD;
      telerehabilitation system when that patients cannot receive it in the hospital due to&#xD;
      epidemic, restriction, transfer difficulties, personal and environmental limitations will&#xD;
      enable patients to receive the rehabilitation services.Telerehabilitation system is&#xD;
      frequently encountered in the abroad, but there are limited systems with Turkish version&#xD;
      specific to this patient group in our country. The aim of project is to develop and detect&#xD;
      the efficiency of a telerehabilitation system which is used to assess, follow and design&#xD;
      home-based rehabilitation program among individuals with chronic neurological diseases who&#xD;
      have difficulty in participating in physiotherapy and rehabilitation services because of&#xD;
      personal or environmental reasons.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The coding and design of this telerehabilitation system will enable easy access to all&#xD;
      devices via the website. The expert interface of the system will consist of three interfaces;&#xD;
      exercise videos to be prepared by physiotherapists will be uploaded, patient list and&#xD;
      feedback of patients. Rehabilitation programs can be prepared and updated. There will be a&#xD;
      panel in the patient interface that will allow the patient to access a rehabilitation program&#xD;
      tailored to the problem and to communicate about the ongoing program when needed. In the&#xD;
      manager interface, high-level control of many steps such as adding experts from different&#xD;
      institutions, organizing information, creating an exercise pool will be provided. With the&#xD;
      project, a telerehabilitation system will be put into practice, where patients can easily&#xD;
      access the rehabilitation services from their homes, and patients can contact with clinicians&#xD;
      when they need follow-up and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients and their caregivers will be informed about the system and project. In the&#xD;
      assessment part, the physical performance will be determined. Also, questionnaires such as&#xD;
      fall efficacy or activities of daily living will be requested through the system. Thus, a&#xD;
      detailed assessment of the patient will be completed to reveal the problems. A rehabilitation&#xD;
      program with appropriate exercises will be defined for patients in the telerehabilitation&#xD;
      group and patients will be asked to apply this program three days a week for eight weeks.&#xD;
      Patients in the control group will be placed on the waiting list after the first evaluations&#xD;
      and no additional treatment will be applied by asking them to maintain their routine activity&#xD;
      levels within this period. At the end of eight weeks, initial evaluations will be repeated in&#xD;
      two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This user-friendly telerehabilitation system with turkish language support will be the first&#xD;
      comprehensive system that will let to assess, give exercise programs and follow the&#xD;
      progression in patients with chronic neurologic disorders. With this system, the opportunity&#xD;
      to reach more patients in the home environment will be provided. Rehabilitation programs will&#xD;
      promote the physical capacity, health-related quality of life and it will also cause reducing&#xD;
      in the burden of caregivers. After evaluating the applicability of our program, we will pave&#xD;
      the way for the introduction of telerehabilitation care in health institutions and in areas&#xD;
      with transportation issues, furthermore low-cost, sustainable system will be achieved to our&#xD;
      country.&#xD;
