  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus,&#xD;
      which has developed the global pandemic situation. The promotion of vaccination is an&#xD;
      effective strategy to control the epidemic. A total of 19,5738,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines&#xD;
      have been reported in China until August 24th, 2021. During widespread vaccination, the&#xD;
      education in COVID-19 prevention and vaccination for residents are also crucial. To figure&#xD;
      out the influence of education during waiting time of vaccination, we have designed a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial and planned to distribute leaflets and questionnaires to the&#xD;
      residents of Xidian (a town in Ninghai, Zhejiang). This study is of great significance for&#xD;
      the prevention of COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
