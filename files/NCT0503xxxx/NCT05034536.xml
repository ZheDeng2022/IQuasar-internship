    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to test the safety and effectiveness of the investigational&#xD;
      combination of pembrolizumab and infliximab in treating metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, phase 2 clinical trial that combines the anti-Programmed&#xD;
      Death (PD)-1 antibody pembrolizumab with the anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α antibody&#xD;
      infliximab as first line treatment for the management of patients with metastatic or&#xD;
      recurrent melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved infliximab for metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma but it has been approved for other uses. The FDA has approved pembrolizumab as a&#xD;
      treatment option for metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab is a blocking antibody (a protein used in the immune system to identity and&#xD;
      neutralize bacteria, viruses, and other foreign pathogens) that binds to PD-1 (a protein that&#xD;
      helps regulate the immune system's response in the body) and blocks the interaction with&#xD;
      PD-L1 and PD-L2 (proteins that inhibits the body's immune response). By blocking this&#xD;
      interaction, it might lead to an anti-tumor immune response that may decrease tumor growth.&#xD;
      Infliximab is an anti-TNFα agent (an antibody that blocks certain inflammatory hormones) that&#xD;
      may interact with irEC (immune related (entero)colitis - inflammation that occurs in the&#xD;
      digestive tract) which can develop among people with advanced melanoma. Anti- TNFα agents&#xD;
      have shown to lead to rapid symptomatic improvement. By combining pembrolizumab and&#xD;
      infliximab we believe it may lead to reduced immune related side effects while increasing&#xD;
      effective anti-tumor immune response. The research study procedures include screening for&#xD;
      eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits. Participants will&#xD;
      be randomized to receive either a) pembrolizumab plus infliximab or b) pembrolizumab plus&#xD;
      placebo (an intravenous solution without medication). Participants will receive study&#xD;
      treatment for as long as their disease does not worsen, they do not experience any&#xD;
      unacceptable side effects, or they have completed the two years of pembrolizumab therapy.&#xD;
      Participants will then be followed until the study doctor determines follow-up is no longer&#xD;
      needed or until participant withdrawal. It is expected that about 36 people will take part in&#xD;
      this research study A research grant, The Bridge Project, is supporting this research study&#xD;
      by providing funding for the study.&#xD;
