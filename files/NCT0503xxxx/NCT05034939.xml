      A prospective, multi-center, randomized (1:1) clinical study evaluating the FLEX Vessel Prep&#xD;
      device plus percutaneous angioplasty (PTA) (study arm) vs PTA alone (control arm) for the&#xD;
      treatment of obstructive lesions in the native arteriovenous dialysis fistulae.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi- center, randomized (1:1) clinical study evaluating the FLEX&#xD;
      Vessel Prep System followed with PTA (TEST arm) vs PTA alone (CONTROL arm) for the treatment&#xD;
      of de novo or non-stented restenotic obstructive lesions up to 100 mm in length located in&#xD;
      the arteriovenous dialysis fistulae in an upper extremity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to evaluate and compare the serious adverse event rate at 30 days and&#xD;
      primary patency at 6 months when using FLEX Vessel Prep System prior to PTA vs. PTA alone for&#xD;
      treatment of obstructive lesion of native arteriovenous fistulae in the upper extremity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will continue until complete data sets are collected for up to 75 subjects from up&#xD;
      to 3 sites in the US.&#xD;

    <description>FLEX Vessel Prep System is used to create circumferential, continuous micro-incisions along the length of the stenosis by performing a retrograde pullback through the lesion. Following FLEX, standard balloon angioplasty is performed with an uncoated PTA balloon sized to meet the reference vessel diameter, according to its corresponding instructions for use. Once advanced to the lesion, the balloon should be inflated according to the site's standard of care.</description>

    <description>The FLEX Vessel Prep System™ is an over-the-wire sheathed catheter with a three-strut treatment element near the distal tip. As the device is pulled back in a retrograde fashion through the target lesion, the Treatment Element &quot;flexes&quot; providing continuous engagement along the lesion to create controlled depth micro-incisions.</description>

    <description>The brand and type of PTA balloon(s) used will be at the discretion of the treating physician and used according to its Instructions for Use (IFU). PTA balloons consist of an over-the-wire catheter with a balloon fixed at the distal tip. Within the lesion the balloon is inflated to a pressure that allows full effacement.</description>
