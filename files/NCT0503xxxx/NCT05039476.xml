  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemist Confessions has developed a retinol cream with the aim to improve the appearance of&#xD;
      early signs of aging, such as fine lines, dark spots, hyperpigmentation, and crow's feet. In&#xD;
      this phase, Chemist Confessions plans to collect self-reported outcomes and photographic&#xD;
      images to understand the assessment of the efficacy of treatment from the participant's&#xD;
      perspective, and if participants see an improvement in their fine lines, wrinkles, dark&#xD;
      spots, hyperpigmentation, and crow's feet.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on a review of existing literature and previous studies, retinol has been found to have&#xD;
      positive effects, however, due to study limitations, there are also conflicting results.&#xD;
      Therefore, in this study, participants will receive Chemist Confessions retinol cream to&#xD;
      understand if the Chemist Confessions cream has an impact on the participant's skin, and even&#xD;
      potentially reduces fine lines, wrinkles, dark spots, hyperpigmentation, and crow's feet of&#xD;
      the skin, and also to understand concepts considered essential by individuals taking retinol&#xD;
      products.&#xD;
