  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) is a vegetal, water soluble, non-viscous, non-gelling&#xD;
      dietary fiber that is derived from guar gum, a water-soluble, viscous, gelling polysaccharide&#xD;
      found in the seeds of Cyamopsis tetragonolobus. PHGG is food for special medical purpose and&#xD;
      available over-the-counter. It is as effective as lactulose treatment in relieving&#xD;
      constipation associated abdominal pain in children. Up-to-date, there is no randomized study&#xD;
      regarding the effectiveness of PHGG in reducing constipation in long term care facility&#xD;
      residents, the investigator therefore would like to perform a prospective, randomized study&#xD;
      to assess its effectiveness in long term care facility residents to improve fecal&#xD;
      characteristics and its effect on use of laxative agents.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, single blinded, parallel-group trial for the residents in&#xD;
      long term care facilities covered by Community Geriatric Assessment Team of Queen Mary&#xD;
      Hospital and Fung Yiu King Hospital. The investigator aim to recruit 52 subjects from those&#xD;
      long term care facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be screened from the Community Geriatric&#xD;
      Assessment Team (CGAT) of Fung Yiu King Hospital by the investigators. Study information will&#xD;
      be explained to subject in detail and consent form (in Chinese) will be given to subject.&#xD;
      Before commencing, subjects will be allowed to have one week to consider joining the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent, subjects will be randomly assigned into 2 groups. One group receive&#xD;
      PHGG following study protocol (treatment group). Another group will be control group, no PHGG&#xD;
      will be given. For treatment group, subjects will take 5g PHGG per day (which equals 4.2g&#xD;
      dietary fiber) through mixing with 20ml water during treatment period. Since after mixing&#xD;
      with PHGG, the water remains colorless and odorless, control group will also be given 20ml&#xD;
      water by long term care facility staff as a blinding process to participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consist of two periods: a 2-week run-in period and a 4-week treatment period.&#xD;
      During run-in period, patient's demographic characteristics will be recorded. Eligibility of&#xD;
      patients to proceed to the treatment period will be determined, according to their baseline&#xD;
      symptoms stool log. Stool frequency, stool characteristics (according to Bristol stool scale&#xD;
      ranging from 1: hard stool to 7: liquid stool) and use of laxative medication will be&#xD;
      recorded through a record diary given to subjects. During treatment period, both group of&#xD;
      subjects need to record stool frequency, stool characteristics and use of laxative&#xD;
      medication. Any adverse reaction will be recorded. Satisfaction of subjects towards PHGG will&#xD;
      be assessed by questionnaire with quantification through Likert scale. Subjects will be&#xD;
      instructed to maintain their usual daily activities including exercise, food habits, and&#xD;
      medication consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome Fecal frequency (assessed by recording defecation times/day) Fecal&#xD;
      characteristics (assessed by Bristol Stool Scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome Use of laxative agents per day&#xD;

    <description>Frequency of laxative use will be recorded at baseline and 4 weeks after intervention. The change in frequency of laxative use by participants will be measured.&#xD;
Frequency of laxative use will be quantified as &quot;units per week&quot; Senokot, lactulose and dulcolax are main laxative used by long term care facility residents.&#xD;
One unit of laxative is &quot;7.5mg of senokot&quot;, &quot;10ml lactulose&quot; or &quot;10mg of dulcolax&quot;.</description>
