      A preliminary assessment of the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Ergoloid mesylates (EM)&#xD;
      and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) and the combination (EM + 5-HTP) compared to placebo in males&#xD;
      aged 18-45 years old with Fragile X Syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single-center, Phase 2, single-blind, 4-period sequential study will obtain a&#xD;
      preliminary assessment of the effects of Ergoloid mesylates (EM) 1 mg TID and&#xD;
      5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) 100 mg TID and the combination compared to a placebo period in&#xD;
      males aged 18-45 years old with Fragile X Syndrome. The study will consist of a Screening&#xD;
      period of up to 28 days prior to initial study drug administration, followed by four 4 week&#xD;
      single-blind treatment periods (up to 21 weeks total). The screening and baseline visits may&#xD;
      occur at the same time, provided the results of safety labs can be obtained. A final&#xD;
      follow-up visit or phone contact for safety is planned one week after the conclusion of&#xD;
      Period 4. Safety and tolerability assessments will include adverse event monitoring, vital&#xD;
      signs, blood chemistry and hematology, and urinalysis. Brief cognitive and behavioral&#xD;
      assessments will be performed during each clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will progress through each of 4 periods (arms) on study. The periods&#xD;
      are not listed sequentially here in order to preserve the single blind for participants.&#xD;
      Throughout all 4 periods, participants will take two identical capsules three times a day. If&#xD;
      only taking one over-encapsulated drug, they will take one over-encapsulated placebo pill&#xD;
      with the drug at each dose, and when in period 4 they will take two over-encapsulated placebo&#xD;
      pills at each dose.&#xD;

    <description>5-hydroxytryptophan, also known as 5-HTP has a nutraceutical status and has never been approved as a drug for any indication, but as a dietary supplement has been used extensively for several disorders for many years such as in the therapy of depression, fibromyalgia, obesity, insomnia and chronic headache</description>

    <intervention_name>Ergoloid Mesylate</intervention_name>
    <description>Ergoloid Mesylates, trade name Hydergine, is a mixture of the methanesulfonate salts of three dihydrogenated ergot alkaloids, dihydroergocristine, dihydroergocornine, and alpha- and beta-dihydroergocryptine. Ergot alkaloids are dopamine agonists which activate dopamine receptors (in the basal ganglia and other parts of the brain involved in motor function) and a prolactin inhibitor. Ergot is a strong vasoconstrictor and thus helps to reduce bleeding by narrowing of the blood vessels.</description>

             exclusionary. Changes in therapies provided through a school program, due to school&#xD;
             vacations, are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Participant must be willing to practice barrier methods of contraception while on&#xD;
             study, if sexually active. Abstinence is also considered a reasonable form of birth&#xD;

             to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. If participant is not their own legal guardian, the participant provides assent for&#xD;
             participation in the study, if the participant has the cognitive ability to provide&#xD;
             assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of, or current cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, respiratory, gastrointestinal,&#xD;
             psychiatric, neurologic, cerebrovascular, or other systemic disease that would place&#xD;

             least 4 weeks before randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Clinically significant abnormalities, in the investigator's judgment, in safety&#xD;
             laboratory tests, vital signs, as measured during Screening.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Use of CYP3A4 inhibitors, beta-blockers, MAO inhibitors or triptans at any time during&#xD;

             or Bipolar Disorder) as diagnosed by the investigator. Participants with additional&#xD;
             diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder or Anxiety Disorder will be allowed as these are&#xD;
             characteristics of FXS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participant has active diseases that would interfere with participation, such as&#xD;
             acquired immunodeficiency disorder, hepatitis C, hepatitis B, or tuberculosis.&#xD;
