      This study is designed as a Phase II, multicenter, single arm trial to assess anti-B Cell&#xD;
      Maturation Antigen (BCMA) chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells (bb2121) to improve post&#xD;
      autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) responses among patients with multiple myeloma&#xD;
      (MM).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After meeting the eligibility criteria and enrolling on the trial, patients will undergo&#xD;
      leukapheresis for collection of autologous lymphocytes, which will be sent to BMS/Celgene&#xD;
      manufacturing facilities. Once cells have been manufactured, patients will then proceed to&#xD;
      lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide 300mg/m2 and fludarabine 30mg/m2 for 3&#xD;
      consecutive days followed by the infusion of BCMA CAR T-cells at a target dose of 450 x106&#xD;
      cells. Maintenance lenalidomide, starting at 10mg a day for 21 days of a 28-day cycle will be&#xD;
      initiated at a minimum of at least 30 days, but no later than 180 days after the CAR T-cell&#xD;
      infusion and will continue until the patient reaches 12 months post CAR T-cell infusion and&#xD;
      continue free of progression&#xD;
