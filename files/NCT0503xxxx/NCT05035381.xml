  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MSI-H is a biomarker for solid tumors benefiting from immunotherapy. Recent clinical studies&#xD;
      have confirmed that PD-1 inhibitors have a good effect on MSI-H advanced colorectal cancer&#xD;
      for first- or second-line treatment. The overall effective rate is 30% to 40%. However, about&#xD;
      30% of patients are resistant to PD-1 inhibitors. Whether PD-1 inhibitors and existing&#xD;
      chemotherapeutics and anti-vascular drugs have synergistic effects is worth studying. This&#xD;
      study is a phase II prospective clinical study of PD-1 inhibitor combined with bevacizumab&#xD;
      and FOLFIRI regimen in the second-line treatment of unresectable recurrent or metastatic&#xD;
      MSI-H colorectal cancer.&#xD;
