  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prematurity is still one of the primary causes of death in children under 5. 1-2. According&#xD;
      to the WHO, 60% of all preterm births occur in Asia, with the Philippines accounting for&#xD;
      around 348,900 every year. 3. Necrotizing enterocolitis is one of the fatal complications&#xD;
      (NEC) 3, 4. Preterm newborns weighing 1500 grams or less are considered high risk. 5-6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melatonin is one chemical that may help prevent NEC. Melatonin is an endogenous indolamine&#xD;
      derived from serotonin. It is a ubiquitous molecule that is crucial to the body's physiologic&#xD;
      function. Melatonin, also known as N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine, is an immunomodulator,&#xD;
      antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and free radical scavenger7-10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a naturally occurring chemical that is simply replenished. With this in mind, the&#xD;
      researcher wants to see if providing high dose melatonin to premature babies can prevent NEC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prematurity remains as one of the leading causes of mortality among children less than 5&#xD;
      years old1-2. The World Health Organization that 60 percent of all preterm births around the&#xD;
      world occurs in Asian countries and roughly 348,900 births occur each year in the&#xD;
      Philippines3. One complication that contribute to the high mortality is necrotizing&#xD;
      enterocolitis (NEC)1, 3-4. High risk population include preterm infants weighing 1500 grams&#xD;
      and lower with inverse correlation to the patient's weight5-6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One compound that could be used to prevent NEC is melatonin. Melatonin is an endogenously&#xD;
      produced indolamine principally synthesized in the pineal gland from serotonin. It is&#xD;
      described as a ubiquitous molecule which plays a vital role in the physiologic function of&#xD;
      the body. Melatonin, also known as N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine which has a a)&#xD;
      immunomodulator; b) free radical scavenger; c) prevention of oxidative stress and d)&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory7-10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a naturally occurring substance and it would just be supplemented to increase its&#xD;
      levels. With all this in mind, the researcher would like to determine if giving high dose&#xD;
      melatonin among preterm neonates could prevent NEC among high risk population.&#xD;
