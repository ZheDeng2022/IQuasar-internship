  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an implementation study of the Pittsburgh Infant Brain Injury Score (PIBIS) into the&#xD;
      UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh emergency department. Children less than 1 year of age&#xD;
      presenting to the CHP ED for symptoms which place them at increased risk for AHT as defined&#xD;
      in the PIBIS validation study will be potentially eligible.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abusive head trauma is the leading cause of death due to physical abuse. Missing the&#xD;
      diagnosis of abusive head trauma (AHT), particularly when it less severe is common and&#xD;
      contributes to increased morbidity and mortality. Over the past 10 years, the investigators&#xD;
      have derived and subsequently prospectively validated the Pittsburgh Infant Brain Injury&#xD;
      Score (PIBIS), a point of care clinical decision rule to help physicians determine when it is&#xD;
      appropriate to obtain neuroimaging in infants who present to the ED for evaluation of soft&#xD;
      neurologic signs such as vomiting and fussiness. The results of the NIH multi-center&#xD;
      prospective validation were published in 2016 in Pediatrics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The next step in evaluating PIBIS as a clinical prediction rule is to perform an&#xD;
      implementation study. Children less than 1 year of age presenting to the CHP ED for symptoms&#xD;
      which place them at increased risk for AHT as defined in the PIBIS validation study will be&#xD;
      potentially eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discrete fields in the electronic health record - including patient age, Emergency Severity&#xD;
      Index (ESI), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, temperature and chief complaint - will be used&#xD;
      to identify potentially eligible children in a systematic and efficient manner. Children who&#xD;
      are potentially eligible based on this initial screen will trigger an alert to the nurse who&#xD;
      will then complete a brief powerform to ensure eligibility and assess for inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Due to the nature of the research, the investigators will seek a waiver of informed&#xD;
      consent as has been done in similar studies at our institution and others. At this point,&#xD;
      eligible children will be considered enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For children enrolled during the intervention period, providers will be presented with a&#xD;
      detailed decision support strategy which encourages - but does not require - use of the PIBIS&#xD;
      to make clinical decision re: the need for neuroimaging. For children enrolled during the&#xD;
      control period, no other clinical decision support will occur. The duration of this&#xD;
      evaluation period will be 24 months.&#xD;

    <description>Children identified as eligible by Cerner and confirmed by the nurse powerform as eligible for PIBIS will also be determined to be eligible after chart review and discussion with the clinician (which is how eligibility was determined during the validation study). The primary outcome will be the concordance between these two methods of determining eligibility. A concordance of &gt;90% is the goal.</description>
