  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human centric lighting (HCL) is a technology that supports the body's circadian rhythm, as it&#xD;
      can stimulate the sleep triggering hormone, melatonin, to improve sleep hygiene over standard&#xD;
      lighting (SL), and promote recuperative sleep for a timely return-to-duty. In intensive care&#xD;
      units, exposure to HCL has improved sleep measures. However, the effect in the medical&#xD;
      surgical (MS) environment is unknown. The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility&#xD;
      of study procedures in MS setting and conduct a preliminary evaluation of the effect of light&#xD;
      on inpatient sleep. Recruitment started November 2020 through April 2021. Data analysis is&#xD;
      pending.&#xD;

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>This inpatient room was outfitted with lights that mimic the day/night cycle, thereby supporting circadian rhythm. Day time lights were automatically on during 0600 to 1900 and in use any time the patients would normally utilize their lights, with a goal of three hours of light exposure per day. The lights automatically transitioned to warmer toned evening lighting at 1900.</description>
