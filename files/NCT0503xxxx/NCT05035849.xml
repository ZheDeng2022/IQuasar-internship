      The aim of the study is to compare the FGM glycemic profiles in patients with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus treated with sitagliptin and acarbose.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, 60 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly divided into group A or group B&#xD;
      after stable glucose control. Flash Glucose Mornitoring(FGM) will be used in patients with&#xD;
      two groups. Patients in group A were given sitagliptin and metformin for the first two weeks,&#xD;
      and then were treated with acarbose and metformin for the second two weeks. FGM was used to&#xD;
      monitor glycemic variations during the whole four weeks. The opposite therapy was true for&#xD;
      patients in group B.&#xD;
