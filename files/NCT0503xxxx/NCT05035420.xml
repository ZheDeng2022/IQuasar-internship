      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COVID-19 outbreak has strained the health care system. New tools are needed for&#xD;
      diagnostic testing and monitoring of people who have the virus. Researchers want to test a&#xD;
      device they hope can screen, detect, and monitor symptoms linked to respiratory diseases like&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate and validate a device that measures breathing, body temperature, heart rate, and&#xD;
      tissue oxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults ages 18 and older with no flu-like symptoms and no current signs of infection,&#xD;
      cough, fever, or sneezing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a physical exam. Their vital signs will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will sit in a chair. They will be monitored for 60 to 80 minutes while they do&#xD;
      the following tasks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rest for 10 minutes. They will repeat this after each task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hold their breath for up to 2 minutes and then rest for 2 minutes. They will do this task 3&#xD;
      times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pace-breathe with breathing rates of 10, 20, and 30 breaths per minute. They will do this&#xD;
      task 2 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breathe air that has 5% of carbon dioxide for 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During these tasks, data will be collected and recorded with a pulse oximeter, thermometer,&#xD;
      respiratory belt, and spirometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will fill out questionnaires related to their daily activity (medication intake,&#xD;
      exercise, smoking, and drinking).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last for 2 to 3 hours.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The worldwide outbreak of novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has created a massive&#xD;
      challenge for researchers and health professionals to increase testing capabilities and&#xD;
      alleviate stress on the healthcare system. New tools are needed for diagnostic testing and&#xD;
      monitoring under-treatment/observation patients who are infected by the virus. This challenge&#xD;
      becomes more and more significant when one deals with geographical and economic disparities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many commercial wearable devices including the Apple Watch, Fitbit, and Oura ring are all&#xD;
      currently being studied for potential use in detecting early signs of viral infection. These&#xD;
      devices, which can constantly monitor cardiovascular and respiratory metrics utilizing a PPG&#xD;
      signal, may in the future be an important tool in monitoring disease onset, progression, and&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of these devices currently, however, do not assess oxygenation. Low oxygen saturation is&#xD;
      another important parameter to consider for respiratory illness. Although pulse oximetry is&#xD;
      commonly used to measure arterial tissue oxygenation, NIRS can capture oxygenation from the&#xD;
      arteries, veins, capillaries and blood vessels, and is more sensitive to tissue perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single device capable of real-time, continuous monitoring of tissue oxygenation and&#xD;
      respiratory function along with skin temperature may be able to offer an important assessment&#xD;
      of the health, stability, and recovery of individuals sick with respiratory illness.&#xD;
