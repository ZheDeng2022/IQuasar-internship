    <textblock>
      This prospective, single-arm, multi-center study will collect clinical data in a post-market&#xD;
      setting for the pediatric population (general surgical procedures) and adult population&#xD;
      (general, gynecological, urological, and thoracic surgical procedures). Investigators will&#xD;
      perform each procedure using the device in compliance with their standard surgical approach&#xD;
      and the HARMONIC 1100 Shears and Generator G11 instructions for use.&#xD;

    <measure>The number of vessel transections with an achievement of Grade 3 or lower for each vessel transection based on the scale described below</measure>
    <time_frame>Intraoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Grade 1: no bleeding at transection site;&#xD;
Grade 2: minor bleeding at transection site, no intervention needed;&#xD;
Grade 3: minor bleeding at transection site, mild intervention needed, use of compression, basic energy devices (monopolar and/or bipolar) and/or touchups with HARMONIC 1100 Shears; or&#xD;
Grade 4: significant bleeding (e.g., pulsatile blood flow, venous pooling) requiring intervention such as extensive coagulation or ligation with use of additional hemostatic measures (e.g., hemoclips, staples, sutures, fibrin sealants, other advanced energy products).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Device-related Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 to 6 weeks postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with device-related (possible, probable, or causal) AEs will be reported. An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence, regardless of its relationship to the study device or the study procedure. An untoward medical occurrence includes any new, undesirable medical experience or worsening of a pre-existing condition, which occurs throughout the duration of the clinical study.</description>

&#xD;
        Pediatric population:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Primary laparoscopic non-emergent procedure (general) where at least one vessel is&#xD;
             planned to be transected by the HARMONIC 1100 Shears per the IFU;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Less than 18 years of age at the time of procedure; and&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject's parent/legal guardian must be willing to give permission for the subject&#xD;

             Shears per the IFU;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Willingness to give consent and comply with all study-related evaluations and visit&#xD;
             schedule; and&#xD;

             endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Intraoperative&#xD;
&#xD;
