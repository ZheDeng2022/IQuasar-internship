  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a 12-month, prospective, 2-arm (1 test &amp; 1 control), randomized (1 test:1&#xD;
      control), bilateral, subject/evaluator-masked clinical investigation of the EPV IOL versus&#xD;
      the standard TECNIS monofocal control IOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at a minimum of one to a maximum of five sites in France, with a&#xD;
      total of 40 evaluable subjects for the investigational lens group and 40 evaluable subjects&#xD;
      for the control lens group participating in the sub-study. The peripheral and functional&#xD;
      testing will be conducted on a sub-group of subjects who achieve binocular uncorrected&#xD;
      distance visual acuity (UCDVA) of 0.2 logMAR or better and/or are able to perform the driving&#xD;
      simulator-sickness testing as determined by patient response to the SSQ (Appendix D) at the&#xD;
      first 1-month visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eye implanted first will be considered the primary study eye (first eye). Subjects will&#xD;
      be randomized to either the investigational IOL Model C0001 or the control IOL Model ZCB00 in&#xD;
      both eyes.&#xD;

             glare source present (e.g., Brightness Acuity Tester) or with significant&#xD;
             cataract-related visual symptoms in the opinion of the investigator;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potential postoperative best-corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) of 0.66 decimal&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Predicted postoperative residual refractive cylinder based on a toric IOL&#xD;
                  calculator, taking surgically induced astigmatism (SIA) into account and using&#xD;
                  the posterior corneal astigmatism (PCA) option, must be less than 1.00 D in both&#xD;
                  eyes.&#xD;
