  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a serious adverse reaction of&#xD;
      antiresorptive and antiangiogenic agents; it is also a potentially painful and debilitating&#xD;
      condition. Today, no specific studies have prospectively evaluated the efficacy of its&#xD;
      treatment and no robust standard of care has been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among non-invasive procedures to treat MRONJ, the use of medical ozone (O3) arises for its&#xD;
      properties and has been deployed and evaluated. O3 has generally proven to play a role in the&#xD;
      treatment of chronic, nonhealing, or ischemic wounds, due to its antimicrobial and&#xD;
      anti-oxidant properties and to bio-stimulation; it has been extensively used for different&#xD;
      medical approaches and purposes. In oral cavity, local applications are carried out by&#xD;
      ozonized water (i.e. spray or compress) or gel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this open trial is to assess the efficacy and the safety of O3 by a new method of&#xD;
      application, i.e. infiltrations of oral mucosa, in patients with a diagnosis of MRONJ, which&#xD;
      are non-eligible for the standard of care, regardless staging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All cases included in our study are MRONJ and staged according to the classification of the&#xD;
      Italian Societies of Oral Medicine and Maxillofacial Surgery (the SICMF/SIPMO staging&#xD;
      system); in addition, they arereported to AIFA, the Italian Medicines Agency, for&#xD;
      registration of the adverse event drug related.Patients included in our study are selected&#xD;
      due to their non-eligibility to the standard treatment (conservative/medical for long term or&#xD;
      surgical alone) for unstable systemic conditions or unaccepted consent due to extensive&#xD;
      proposed approach due to the advanced disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first examination (T0), medical, pharmacological, and dental history of patients&#xD;
      are recorded. Data collected are: (1) age; (2) gender; (3) indications for use, type,&#xD;
      cumulative dose and duration of MRONJ-related drugs; (4); history of chemotherapy; (5) other&#xD;
      medications; (6) other diseases; (7) smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For every patient, Cone Beam CT dental scan or maxillofacial CT scan has performed for&#xD;
      staging at T0 and 12 (T4) months after; orthopantomograph has performed during protocol (T3).&#xD;
      The main CT features evaluated and associated to MRONJ presence and healing are as follows:&#xD;
      a) bone sclerosis, b) depth of lesion; c) formation of sequestrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When more than one MRONJ lesion are present, the protocol is applied one by one.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OZOPROMAF protocol consists of: local superficial anesthesia by application of EMLA® cream,&#xD;
      intra-tissue injection of a 15 ml OxigenOzone (O2O3) mixture by 26Gx 1⁄2 - 0.45x13mm needle&#xD;
      into the mucosal margin surrounding the bone exposure or around the situs already evidenced&#xD;
      by CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, pain intensity is assessed at each visit by means of a questionnaire for pain&#xD;
      and/or other symptoms evaluation before and after the protocol, based on numerical rating&#xD;
      scale (NRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OZOPROMAF is applied on 7-15 days, depending on the patient compliance, until the resolution,&#xD;
      identified as formation of sequestrum and clinical healing (T1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day after the procedure, every patient iss supported by phone evaluating pain and/or&#xD;
      adverse events with a questionnaire In case of unavailability of the patient for the weekly&#xD;
      treatment, it is mandatory the phone call for the questionnaire, in order to evaluate&#xD;
      symptoms by simple questions and NAS scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After resolution (T1), follow-up visits are scheduled to confirm the healing of MRONJ at 1&#xD;
      (T2), 3, 6 (T3), 12 (T4), 18- 24 months (T5). Radiographic evaluations of bone healing are&#xD;
      scheduled at T3 and T4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive outcomes for the OZOPROMAF protocol are evaluated at T1 as no clinical signs of&#xD;
      acute phlogosis and no symptoms compatible with MRONJ; at T5 as clinical healing and no&#xD;
      radiological signs of MRONJ.&#xD;
