    <textblock>
      Liberating Technologies, Inc. (LTI) has developed a dexterous prosthetic fingertip that will&#xD;
      be fit onto an i-Digits™ partial hand prosthesis and allow for an additional fine grasp. The&#xD;
      device will interface with research participants' existing prostheses and use the same&#xD;
      control strategy that is used for their everyday use. Each participant's prosthesis will be&#xD;
      restored to their original configuration by the end of their testing period.&#xD;

      Liberating Technologies, Inc. (LTI) has developed a dexterous prosthetic fingertip that will&#xD;
      be fit onto an i-Digits™ partial hand prosthesis and allow for an additional fine grasp. The&#xD;
      device will interface with research participant's existing prostheses and use the same&#xD;
      control strategy that is used for their everyday use. Each participant's prosthesis will be&#xD;
      restored to their original configuration by the end of their testing period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will focus on design feasibility testing and will compare performance of hand&#xD;
      functional outcome tests on an i-Digits™ prosthetic partial hand with and without the&#xD;
      investigational Pointdexter modification. Our primary hypothesis is that subjects using the&#xD;
      investigational device will show better performance on objective functional outcomes measures&#xD;
      than those using a standard i-Digits™ partial hand prosthesis, particularly in the&#xD;
      manipulation of small objects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will explore multiple outcomes measures as options, but our primary&#xD;
      endpoint will be performance on the Small Common Objects subtask of the Jebsen-Taylor Hand&#xD;
      Function Test, which assesses a broad range of unimanual hand functions required for ADLs.&#xD;
      The primary quantitative measure of the Jebsen-Taylor task will be completion time of each&#xD;
      subtask. Qualitative evaluation will be conducted by an occupational therapist via&#xD;
      observation, and by the user through a self-assessment questionnaire, such as the Patient&#xD;
      Specific Functional Scale (PSFS). The investigators will be performing repeated measures on&#xD;
      each individual subject to reduce the variance as well as having each subject act as their&#xD;
      own control. New and existing i-Digits™ partial hand prosthesis users will be recruited for&#xD;
      the study and consented with an approved protocol. Research participants will schedule a time&#xD;
      to conduct the testing and be informed of study details.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational device being tested is a novel prosthetic finger with a built-in split&#xD;
      gripper. The device is an index finger which can drop in place of existing digits on an&#xD;
      i-Digits™ partial hand prosthesis. The investigational device is controlled with the same&#xD;
      signals as the conventional digits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will pilot test the dexterous fingertip prosthesis with a small number of subjects&#xD;
      (up to 12). Research participants will be consented and will test the device at home and/or&#xD;
      in-lab. Subjects will be introduced to the partial hand prosthesis configuration and be&#xD;
      instructed on how to operate it to complete their testing session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The in-lab testing will be conducted in a single site visit at Össur Academy in Dublin, Ohio&#xD;
      or LTI in Holliston, MA. Subjects may be asked to come back for an additional site visit if&#xD;
      data collection is incomplete. For this study, the index finger of each participant's&#xD;
      existing everyday prosthesis will be temporarily disconnected and replaced with the&#xD;
      investigational device. The prosthesis will be restored to its original configuration when&#xD;
      the test session has been completed. At the start of the study session, subjects will prepare&#xD;
      for testing in their first configuration (investigational or comparator). If investigational,&#xD;
      subjects will doff their prosthesis and investigators will replace the usual i-Digits™ index&#xD;
      finger with the investigational device. If comparator, subjects will don their usual&#xD;
      unmodified prosthesis. Subjects will be trained on how to operate the investigational device&#xD;
      and be allowed a minimum of 30 minutes to practice using it until they are comfortable with&#xD;
      proceeding. The subjects will be guided to conduct functional outcome tests that involve&#xD;
      picking up and manipulating everyday objects (beans, coins, pegs, spoon, cloth, etc.), such&#xD;
      as the tasks outlined in the Jebsen-Taylor and Peg Board functional tests. Each sub-task in&#xD;
      the functional test will be scored by occupational therapist standards. After a round of&#xD;
      functional testing is done, subjects will fill out the PSFS survey and subjective&#xD;
      questionnaire. Subjects will then doff the prosthesis and don the next device configuration.&#xD;
      Subjects will repeat the functional tests and surveys with each device configuration. After&#xD;
      the final condition, the subject will have completed the study and their prosthesis will be&#xD;
      restored to its usual configuration. The study session should span 3-5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset of subjects will take home the investigational device for up to 4 weeks to provide&#xD;
      feedback of the device when used in everyday tasks. Investigators will restore the user's&#xD;
      prosthesis at the end of the testing period and surveys will be conducted to capture&#xD;
      feedback. Two site visits may be required: one to initialize the study and configure the&#xD;
      prosthesis, and two to restore the prosthesis at the study end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both new and existing i-Digits™ partial hand prosthesis users will be invited to participate&#xD;
      in the study. Research participants will schedule a time to conduct the testing and be&#xD;
      informed of study details. Participants will be given as much time as needed to review and&#xD;
      question the informed consent form before signing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two different technologies will be assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigational Device: i-Digits™ partial hand prosthesis with dexterous fingertip&#xD;
           modification&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparator Baseline: unmodified i-Digits™ partial hand prosthesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persons with partial hand limb absence who are new or current i-Digits™ prosthesis users will&#xD;
      be recruited for this study through the LTI and Össur clinician network. Prosthetists may be&#xD;
      contacted with the need for research subjects and, if interested, will be given flyers to&#xD;
      hand out to their patients. If subjects are interested in participating, they can call the&#xD;
      number on the flyer to speak with investigators. In addition, previous research participants&#xD;
      who have given permission to be contacted for future studies may be contacted directly to&#xD;
      assess interest in participating in this study. Enrollment will be open to people of all&#xD;
      ages, genders, races, and ethnicities. Participants must be new or current users of i-Digits™&#xD;
      partial hand prostheses. The user must have an absent index finger at minimum. Patients who&#xD;
      have 4-5 digit and/or thumb involvement will be preferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on subject population and availability, a convenience sample of up to 12 subjects will&#xD;
      be recruited for this pilot study.&#xD;
