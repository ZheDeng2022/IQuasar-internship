      The primary aims are to identify important gut microbiota signatures for youth with ASD, to&#xD;
      identify dysbiosis features for different levels of ASD features and clinical courses, to&#xD;
      search the possibility to intervene the disease course if we can tease out the dysbiosis&#xD;
      responsible for the flare-up and improvement of the symptoms of the disease. The secondary&#xD;
      aims are to identify the clinical and neuropsychological measures that are associated with&#xD;
      direct and indirect regulation or interactions from gut-brain axis signaling, and based our&#xD;
      preliminary results on reducing the measures for future large-scale microbiome study in ASD.&#xD;

      Background: Despite increased public awareness of autism spectrum d isorder (ASD) and&#xD;
      extensive research on this neurodevelopmental disorder in the past decades, the underlying&#xD;
      mechanisms of ASD remain unclear, and ASD is still recognized as having the highest disease&#xD;
      and care burden among child psychiatric disorders regarding its long-term impairment across&#xD;
      the lifespan. Hence, identifying the biomarkers for early detection and effective biological&#xD;
      treatments for ASD is among the most challenging tasks all over the world. The concerns about&#xD;
      physical comorbidities such as immune dysregulation, allergy, and gastrointestinal issues,&#xD;
      etc. emerged in the recent decade. Hence, the new perspective of searching for the underlying&#xD;
      mechanism for ASD also targets the associations between microbiota and ASD. However, despite&#xD;
      many microbiome studies in ASD, they provided limited knowledge about the specific link that&#xD;
      particular imbalance gut bacteria could affect the behavioral deficits in ASD because lack of&#xD;
      consideration of the clinical and genetic heterogeneity of ASD. With only a few studies&#xD;
      examining the well-defined ASD-related impairments, the GI system dysfunction, and the&#xD;
      microbiomes, the associations among ASD-related symptoms, GI symptoms, and microbiota remain&#xD;
      indistinct. Therefore, the investigators propose this pilot study to fill the gap between the&#xD;
      potential role of microbiome as a biomarker for ASD to facilitate developing the treatment&#xD;
      for ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method and material: The case-sibling control study design will be used to investigate&#xD;
      microbiome in 60 probands with ASD, aged 7-25 yrs old, and 30 unaffected siblings either from&#xD;
      the PI Gau's ASD cohort or the Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital.&#xD;
      The parents of all the subjects will receive the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R)&#xD;
      interviews and report on the questionnaires regarding autistic symptoms, emotional/behavioral&#xD;
      problems, social functions, G-I symptoms, and life quality. The ASD and sibling subjects will&#xD;
      receive the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale and neuropsychological tasks. The experiment&#xD;
      of microbiome will be conducted by the core lab of microbiome (co-PI Ni) at the college of&#xD;
      medicine, National Taiwan University. The data analyses will combine microbiomics and the&#xD;
      extensive behaviors/cognitive function variables to establish an objective potential&#xD;
      pipeline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated outcome: With the accomplishment of this project, the investigators will&#xD;
      establish the comprehensive yet fewer bios for the ASD risk bio-factors in Asia, and provide&#xD;
      the potential clinical interview and assessments related to GI symptoms regulated by&#xD;
      microbiota. The potential biomarkers may be further used to developing the treatment for ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: Several features of this project constitute its significance: a wealth of&#xD;
      measures of ASD phenotypes (valid phenotype), ASD as a catastrophic disease (importance), the&#xD;
      first ASD study with unaffected sibling design for microbiomics studies in ASD (originality),&#xD;
      and new approaches and technologies (novelty) for searching microbiomics in ASD.&#xD;
