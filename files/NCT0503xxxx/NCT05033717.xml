    <textblock>
      This project will be a Randomized control trial conducted to check the effects of tissue&#xD;
      flossing technique versus static stretching exercises of bicep muscle on pain, range of&#xD;
      motion and function in patients with bicipital tendinitis, so that we can have best treatment&#xD;
      option for them. Duration will be of 6 months. Purposive sampling will be done. Subjects&#xD;
      fulfilling eligibility criteria from Allied hospital Faisalabad, will be randomly allocated&#xD;
      in two groups via lottery method. Baseline assessment will be done. Group A participants will&#xD;
      be given baseline treatment along with tissue flossing. Group B participants will be given&#xD;
      stretching exercises along with baseline treatment for two weeks, 3 sessions per week. Post&#xD;
      intervention assessment will be done via, Numeric pain rating scale(NPRS),Shoulder Pain And&#xD;
      Disability Index (SPADI) and goniometric measurements of shoulder ranges. Data will be&#xD;
      analyzed by using SPSS version 20.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inflammation of the bicep tendon is also known as &quot;Bicipital Tendinitis&quot; occurs most commonly&#xD;
      in overhead athletes like racquet players, swimmers, gymnasts, tennis players, baseball&#xD;
      pitchers, and rowing athletes. Tissue Flossing is a relatively novel practice that initially&#xD;
      got recognition in weightlifting athletes. This technique has Japanese origin also known as&#xD;
      the &quot;Katsu Technique&quot; or &quot;Blood Flow Restriction technique&quot; BFR. It works on the principle of&#xD;
      optimizing the blood circulation to the muscles for fitness, early rehabilitation, and&#xD;
      recovery within safe ranges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the current study is to determine the effects of the tissue flossing technique&#xD;
      on the physical rehabilitation of bicipital tendinitis. It is a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      with the subjects having a history of bicipital tendinitis, shoulder pain, and recreational&#xD;
      athletes with difficulty in overhead activities. Subjects with a history of neurological and&#xD;
      psychological disorders, hypertension or heart diseases and with chronic arthritis will be&#xD;
      excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly placed into experimental and control groups. The experimental&#xD;
      group will receive bicep-strengthening exercises after flossing. The Control group will&#xD;
      receive bicep-strengthening exercises after bicep-stretching exercises. The total duration of&#xD;
      this study will be six months with an assessment performed at baseline, before and after the&#xD;
      treatment sessions. Numeric Pain rating scale, Goniometer, and Shoulder Pain and Disability&#xD;
      Index will be used to measure the outcomes. Data will be analyzed statistically by using&#xD;
      parametric or non-parametric tests after the completion of this study.&#xD;

    <description>The 11-point numerical pain rating scale (NPRS) is a measure of pain in which patients rate their pain ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain), and it has been shown to have concurrent and predictive validity as a measure of pain intensity.</description>

    <description>A shoulder pain and disability index (SPADI) is used to measure the pain and disability associated with shoulder pathology. The SPADI is a self-administered index consisting of 13 items divided into two subscales: pain and disability. The SPADI is responsive to change and accurately discriminates among patients who are improved or worsened.</description>

    <description>A goniometer is an instrument that measures the available range of motion at a joint. The term Goniometry is derived from two Greek words, gonia, meaning &quot;angle&quot; and metron, meaning &quot;measurement</description>
