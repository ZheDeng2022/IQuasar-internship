      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, adaptive, seamless phase I / II clinical&#xD;
      study of the safety and immunogenicity of a recombinant viral vector AAV5-RBD-S vaccine for&#xD;
      the prevention of coronavirus infection (COVID-19)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be carried out in 2 stages. Stage 1 aims to assess the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of different doses of BCD-250 in subjects without a history of COVID-19&#xD;
      infection to choose the optimal dose for further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 aims to assess the immunogenicity and safety of the chosen on stage 1 optimal BCD-250&#xD;
      dose compared to placebo in subjects with and without the history of COVID-19 infection.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Stage 1. Subjects without history of COVID-19 infection will be randomized in two treatment groups to receive different doses of BCD-250. After the last subject completes the 28 days of the main study period the safety and immunogenicity analysis will be performed. Based on these results the optimal BCD-250 dose will be selected by the Sponsor considering the Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommendations.&#xD;
Stage 2. Subjects without history of COVID-19 infection (Cohort 1) and with history of COVID-19 infection (Cohort 2) will be randomized to receive either selected dose of BCD-250 or placebo.</intervention_model_description>
