  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thirty women diagnosed with PCOS had participated in the study. They suffered from amenorrhea&#xD;
      or oligo-menorrhea and subcapsular follicles. Their ages were from 20-35 years. Their BMI was&#xD;
      from 30 - 35 kg/m². Their waist/hip ratio was ˃ 0.85. Their LH/FSH ratio was ≥ 1.5. They were&#xD;
      recruited randomly from the outpatient clinic of gynecology in Minya governorate hospital.&#xD;
      They were randomly assigned into two groups equal in number: (A and B); group A (n=15)&#xD;
      received 40000HZ ultrasound cavitation, group B (n=15) received 2600HZ ultrasound cavitation.&#xD;
      Treatment time was 30 minutes /sessions, 3 times/ week for two months. Both groups (A and B)&#xD;
      received a low caloric diet (1200 Kcal/day). All participants had their medical treatment as&#xD;
      prescribed by the physician.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants in both groups were told to follow a low calorie diet (1200 Kcal/day) tailored&#xD;
      to their specific needs (low in fat (15%), high in complex carbs (55%), and adequate in&#xD;
      protein) (30 percent ) (11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application procedure of ultrasound cavitation for both groups (A and B):-&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each participant in both groups (A and B) received instructions on the treatment&#xD;
           techniques as well as the benefits of the USFC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To improve lymphatic drainage, each subject was encouraged to consume one liter of water&#xD;
           before and after the therapy sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each participant was urged to empty her bladder before beginning each treatment session&#xD;
           so order to remain comfortable and relaxed throughout the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From a standing position, each participant's abdomen was divided transversally into&#xD;
           three sections; see fig (1) 1- Part I: from the xiphoid process to 3cm above the&#xD;
           umbilicus, 2- Section II: from 2cm below the umbilicus to the pubic bone, and vertically&#xD;
           to the linea alba, each part was separated into right and left segments, resulting in a&#xD;
           total of 6 abdominal segments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part III: 3cm above the umbilicus to 2cm below the umbilicus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After washing the skin on the anterior abdominal wall with alcohol, a conducting medium&#xD;
           (gel) was placed to the ultrasonic instrument's cavitational head.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The gadget was turned on, a 30-minute timer was set, and the intensity was gradually&#xD;
           increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The cavitation head then moved extremely gently in a small circular motion on each&#xD;
           abdomen section for 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After completing the ultrasonic application to the six regions of the abdomen, the skin&#xD;
           was cleansed with a piece of cotton.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For group (A): 40000 HZ ultrasound was delivered for 30 minutes, 3 times/week for 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For group (B):26000 HZ ultrasound was delivered for 30 minutes, 3 times/week for 2 months&#xD;
