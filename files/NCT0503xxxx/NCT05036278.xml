  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of a new risk score approach based on&#xD;
      participant's phenotypic and biologic variables to determine the most appropriate prophylaxis&#xD;
      regimen for adolescent/adult (≥ 12 years) PTPs with congenital hemophilia A who switch from a&#xD;
      SHL FVIII prophylaxis to an EHL product (Jivi).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible participants will be assigned a risk score at baseline and will start treatment&#xD;
      2x/week (40 IU/kg/dose) with Jivi for 4 weeks. Treatment will then continue based on their&#xD;
      assignment to 1 of the 3 following prophylaxis regimens:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with a high risk score (&gt; 4) continue on prophylaxis 2x/week (40&#xD;
           IU/kg/dose)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with a medium risk score (2 to 4) will switch after 4 weeks to prophylaxis&#xD;
           Q5D (50 IU/kg/dose)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with a low risk score (&lt; 2) will switch after 4 weeks to prophylaxis Q5D&#xD;
           (50 IU/kg/dose) and then after 4 weeks to a less frequent (e.g. Q7D) regimen (60&#xD;
           IU/kg/dose)&#xD;
