  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The last decades have seen a significant increase in myopia in children and young adults.&#xD;
      Possible cause: increased near-work (school, computer, smartphone). Rationale: Reading&#xD;
      glasses support the accommodative effort of the eyes. By wearing reading glasses, there is&#xD;
      less interference with the young eyeÂ´s physiological axial growth despite increased&#xD;
      near-work. Main objective: does the use of reading glasses during near-work in children and&#xD;
      adolescents reduce the incidence of myopia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In myopia (nearsightedness), the eyeball is relatively to long, which means that the image&#xD;
      produced by the cornea and lens is displayed in front of the retina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The axial length of an adult eye is on average around 23 millimeters. Every millimeter of&#xD;
      additional length must be corrected with a -2.75 diopter lens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In newborns, the eyeball is about 18 millimeters long. It is believed that there are feedback&#xD;
      loops during childhood and adolescence to control the growth of the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiological studies show that myopia is an increasing health problem. There is a growing&#xD;
      body of epidemiological evidence that environmental factors can influence the development of&#xD;
      myopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The link between the environment and myopia lies in the quality of the retinal image.&#xD;
      Experimental studies in various species have shown that if the retinal image is missing, eye&#xD;
      growth is disturbed. Of even greater importance for the development of myopia is the&#xD;
      knowledge that the primate eye can change its growth, depending on the strength and type of&#xD;
      blurring of the retinal image: if lenses are placed in front of the eye during development,&#xD;
      the eye growth changes in such a way that a sharp retinal image is achieved through these&#xD;
      lenses. If divergent lenses are placed in front of the eye, the eye becomes longer, and if&#xD;
      convergent lenses are placed in front of it, it becomes correspondingly shorter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So myopia is the result of a failure in these emmetropization mechanisms. The positive&#xD;
      correlation of myopia with a higher level of education suggests that increased close work&#xD;
      interferes with emmetropization. The growth in length of the eye changes in such a way that&#xD;
      it adapts to this requirement: the eye adjusts itself to the close work: it becomes myopic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myopia is thus possibly a physiological adaptation to increased near work with the aim of&#xD;
      improving the quality of the retinal image during close work. However, this can only be&#xD;
      achieved at the expense of the image quality when looking into the distance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators submitted a study on this subject to the Cantonal Ethics Committee of the&#xD;
      Canton of Zurich in 2003:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;An open, prospective, randomized study on the use of reading glasses in children with normal&#xD;
      vision to prevent myopia&quot; Unique Protocol ID: FR-2005-01-01 Approval Status: Approved&#xD;
      Approval Number: KEK-StV-Nr. 19/03&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was and is so far the only clinical study that examined the effect of reading glasses on&#xD;
      the development of myopia in emmetropic (normally sighted) children and has led to Patent No:&#xD;
      US 8,511,819 B2, Aug. 20, 2013 &quot;Prevention of myopia acquisition in children and young adults&#xD;
      using reading glasses&quot;&#xD;
