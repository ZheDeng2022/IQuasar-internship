  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the proposed research is to investigate the association between&#xD;
      protein intake and nutritional status with bone health and physical functioning in older hip&#xD;
      fracture patients. In addition, it will be investigated which patient characteristics and&#xD;
      modifiable factors can predict mobility, clinical frailty, living situation and mortality.&#xD;
      This study will be a 3-month prospective cohort study in adults aged 70 years and older with&#xD;
      an acute hip fracture. This study will lead to knowledge about how protein intake and&#xD;
      nutritional status in combination with patient characteristics can predict the degree of&#xD;
      recovery (bone health and physical functioning) 3 months after the hip fracture. Knowledge on&#xD;
      factors related to recovery can contribute to an improved and shorter rehabilitation in the&#xD;
      future, which results in a reduction of health care costs.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Only half of the patients with an acute hip fracture regain their pre-fracture functional&#xD;
      level and 24% dies within the following year. Identifying and targeting modifiable risk&#xD;
      factors for optimal recovery after a hip fracture is therefore essential. These factors&#xD;
      include protein intake and nutritional status, which may affect markers of bone health and&#xD;
      physical functioning and thereby influence recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements will be performed at baseline (within 5 days after the hip surgery) and after 3&#xD;
      months during an outpatient clinic visit for the evaluation of the hip fracture surgery. A&#xD;
      total of 84 older adults (aged 70 years or older) recovering from an acute hip fracture will&#xD;
      be recruited from Rijnstate hospital.&#xD;
