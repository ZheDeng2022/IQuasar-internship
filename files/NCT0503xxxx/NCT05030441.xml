  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter study exploring the efficacy of ivosidenib in patients&#xD;
      with clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance (CCUS) with mutations in IDH1. The purpose&#xD;
      is to establish proof of principle that ivosidenib is well-tolerated and potentially&#xD;
      efficacious in improving blood count abnormalities in these patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unexplained cytopenia for at least 6 months. Cytopenia is defined as the presence of&#xD;
             ≥1 blood count indexes below the following thresholds:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hgb &lt;10 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ANC &lt;1.8 × 10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets &lt;100 × 10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  IDH1 gene mutation (R132) confirmed by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) testing, at a&#xD;
             frequency &gt; 2%. This will be performed locally and confirmed at Washington University.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate organ function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 3.0 x IULN (unless the subject has Gilbert's syndrome)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x IULN (higher levels are acceptable if these can be&#xD;
                  attributed to erythropoiesis)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine &lt; 2 x IULN or creatinine clearance &gt; 30 mL/min by&#xD;
                  Cockcroft-Gault glomerular filtration rate estimation&#xD;

             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must&#xD;
             inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol&#xD;
             must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of&#xD;
             the study, and for 90 days after the last dose of ivosidenib.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Currently receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known dysphagia, short-gut syndrome, gastroparesis, or other conditions that limit the&#xD;
             ingestion or gastrointestinal absorption of drugs administered orally.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or&#xD;
             biologic composition to ivosidenib or other agents used in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 72 hours of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Heartrate corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt; 450 msec or with other factors that increase&#xD;
             the risk of QT prolongation or arrhythmic events (e.g. heart failure, hypokalemia,&#xD;
             family history of long QT interval syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known medical history of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).&#xD;
