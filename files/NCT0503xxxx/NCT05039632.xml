      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and possible benefits of NBTXR3, radiation&#xD;
      therapy, ipilimumab, and nivolumab in treating patients with solid tumor that has spread to&#xD;
      the lung (lung metastases) and/or liver (liver metastases). NBTXR3 may help make tumor cells&#xD;
      more sensitive to the radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill&#xD;
      tumor cells and shrink tumors. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab&#xD;
      and nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with&#xD;
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving NBTXR3, radiation therapy, ipilimumab,&#xD;
      and nivolumab may help to control the disease.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of hafnium oxide-containing nanoparticles NBTXR3&#xD;
      (NBTXR3) activated by radiation (Abscopal or RadScopal) in combination with immunotherapy&#xD;
      (anti-CTLA-4 &amp; anti-PD-1). (Phase I &amp; II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety profile of NBTXR3 activated by radiation (Abscopal or RadScopal) in&#xD;
      combination with immunotherapy (anti-CTLA-4 &amp; anti-PD-1). II. To evaluate time-to-event&#xD;
      outcomes of NBTXR3 activated by radiation (Abscopal or RadScopal) in combination with&#xD;
      immunotherapy (anti-CTLA-4 &amp; anti-PD-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate radiomic measurements with outcomes of study treatments. II. To evaluate&#xD;
      biomarkers of response in subjects after receiving study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT I: Patients receive NBTXR3 intratumorally on day 1. Patients also receive ipilimumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 8. Beginning day 15, patients undergo Abscopal&#xD;
      radiation therapy over 1-2 weeks. Patients then receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes and&#xD;
      nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 29. Cycles with nivolumab repeat every 4 weeks for up to&#xD;
      2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT II: Patients receive NBTXR3 intratumorally on day 1. Patients also receive ipilimumab&#xD;
      IV over 90 minutes on day 8. Beginning day 15, patients undergo RadScopal radiation therapy&#xD;
      over 1-2 weeks. Patients then receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes and nivolumab IV over 30&#xD;
      minutes on day 29. Cycles with nivolumab repeat every 4 weeks for up to 2 years in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 8 weeks for up to 2 years&#xD;
      post-radiation therapy.&#xD;
