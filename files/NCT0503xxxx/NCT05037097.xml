  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, randomized, observer-blind study in healthy adults. The study will&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of 3 SARS-CoV-2 self-amplifying RNA&#xD;
      vaccine candidates against COVID-19 in adults previously vaccinated and not previously&#xD;
      vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will initially enroll approximately 72 adult participants into 2 cohorts and may&#xD;
      expand enrollment up to 144 participants if additional cohorts are added.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first cohort (Cohort A) will include a total of 36 adult participants ≥21 to ≤65 years of&#xD;
      age who have not been previously vaccinated with a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Study vaccines will be&#xD;
      given as 2 doses separated by 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second cohort (Cohort B) will include a total of 36 adult participants ≥21 to ≤65 years&#xD;
      of age who have been previously vaccinated (5 months or longer prior to study enrollment)&#xD;
      with SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Study vaccines will be given as single doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional cohorts may increase the age range of participants up to 80 years of age.&#xD;
