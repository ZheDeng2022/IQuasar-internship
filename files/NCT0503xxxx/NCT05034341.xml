  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel prehabilitation method has been implemented at our institution to decrease&#xD;
      perioperative outcome complications for frail lumbar spine fusion surgery patients. The goal&#xD;
      of this randomized trial is to evaluate whether this prehabilitation program improves&#xD;
      preoperative functional status of frail spine disease patients and benefits patients in their&#xD;
      postsurgical outcomes.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with degenerative lumbar spine disease who are candidates for spine surgery may&#xD;
      experience multiple adverse effects from the prolonged conservative and non-operative&#xD;
      management of chronic low back pain. Due to the aging population, there is an increased&#xD;
      demand for lumbar spine surgery in the geriatric population. At the time these patients are&#xD;
      candidates for surgery, they might encounter the results of the conservative management&#xD;
      including disabling pain, catastrophizing, and Kinesiophobia. The chronicity of the spine&#xD;
      condition and the associated pain may result in functional disability, poor nutrition, and&#xD;
      poor pain management, all of which may result in a multisystemic impact on their overall&#xD;
      health in the form of frailty. Prehabilitation has been studied in the past to evaluate its&#xD;
      impact on the postoperative outcomes for patients scheduled for abdominal surgery, cardiac&#xD;
      surgery, and thoracic surgery. Currently, there are a few trials evaluating the impact of&#xD;
      prehabilitation in spine surgery. However, there are limited data on the impact of&#xD;
      prehabilitation on frail geriatric patients undergoing spine surgery and whether&#xD;
      prehabilitation will impact frail patients' preoperative and postoperative functional&#xD;
      recovery and pain management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the current literature, the investigator will hypothesize that prehabilitation will&#xD;
      improve frail geriatric patients' preoperative and postoperative functional capacity as&#xD;
      assessed by a six-minute walk test and will minimize the incidence of postoperative&#xD;
      complications. In addition, the investigator will also hypothesize that prehabilitation in&#xD;
      the form of a multimodal approach (physical exercise, nutritional, pain, and neuroscience&#xD;
      education) will increase the chances of discharge to home in the postoperative setting, and&#xD;
      as a result will lead to a decrease overall healthcare expenditure and total costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does Multimodal Prehabilitation improve frail patients' preoperative functional capacity&#xD;
           before spine surgery?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does Multimodal Prehabilitation improve frail patients' postoperative outcomes after&#xD;
           spine surgery?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Does Multimodal Prehabilitation improve frail patients' postoperative functional&#xD;
           capacity after spine surgery?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will hypothesize that Multimodal Prehabilitation (physical, nutritional, and&#xD;
      cognitive) improves frailty, functional capacity, and perioperative outcomes after spine&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

    <description>The Multimodal Prehabilitation group will receive:&#xD;
An exercise program focusing on aerobic exercise as well as strength training. Sessions will be supervised by a physical therapist, 2 times a week for a minimum of 6-8 weeks in addition to a home exercise program. Patients' compliance will be monitored by phone each week.&#xD;
Protein supplements in the form of protein shakes at a dose of 1.2-1.5 gram per kg daily for 6-8 weeks. Protein supplements will be calculated based on ideal body weight and will be given to the patient with instructions on specific use. Diabetic patients will receive protein supplements that are sugar-free.&#xD;
Pain and Neuroscience Education: Per University of Florida Health Pain and Neuroscience program at Shands hospital.&#xD;
