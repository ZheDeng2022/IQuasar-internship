  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this sub-study, approximately 400 adults participants who are generally healthy or with&#xD;
      stable pre-existing health conditions aged ≥ 20 to &lt; 65 years will be enrolled. The first 250&#xD;
      participants enrolled in this sub-study will receive MVC-COV1901(Scale A) and the remains&#xD;
      will receive MVC-COV1901(Scale B). Each participant will receive 2 doses of study&#xD;
      intervention, administered 28 days apart via IM injection in the deltoid region, preferably&#xD;
      of the nondominant arm, at Day 1 and Day 29. The study procedure and visit schedule refer to&#xD;
      the main study protocol and will be the same as the study procedure for the Immunogenicity&#xD;
      Subset.&#xD;
