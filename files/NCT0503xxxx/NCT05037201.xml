  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant morbidity and mortality across the world.&#xD;
      Effective vaccines are now available but underutilized. In July 2021, Ascension Health&#xD;
      implemented a mandate requiring all employees to obtain the COVID-19 vaccine by November&#xD;
      12th. In August 2021, the number of COVID-19 cases in the US increased rapidly, specifically&#xD;
      in states with lower vaccination rates, many of which are served by Ascension Health&#xD;
      facilities. In this study, we will evaluate a rapidly deployed health system initiative to&#xD;
      use text messaging to nudge Ascension employees who have not yet been vaccinated to commit to&#xD;
      a date and receive vaccination.&#xD;

      The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant morbidity and mortality across the world.&#xD;
      Effective vaccines are now available but underutilized. In July 2021, Ascension Health&#xD;
      implemented a mandate requiring all employees to obtain the COVID-19 vaccine by November&#xD;
      12th. In August 2021, the number of COVID-19 cases in the US increased rapidly, specifically&#xD;
      in states with lower vaccination rates, many of which are served by Ascension Health&#xD;
      facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nudges are subtle changes to the way information is framed or choices are offered that can&#xD;
      have a significant impact on behavior. Status quo bias is a preference for the current state&#xD;
      which is often used as a reference point when making decisions. Changes from the reference&#xD;
      point are often faced with high inertia and this prevents changes in behavior. Default&#xD;
      options are the setting of the baseline reference point and are often taken as an implicit&#xD;
      recommendation. In prior work, changing default options has led to significant changes in&#xD;
      health-related behaviors. For example, changing prescription default settings in the EHR from&#xD;
      opt-in to opt-out for generic prescriptions increased the rate of generic prescriptions from&#xD;
      75% to 98% across Penn Medicine (Patel et al. Annals of IM. 2014; Patel et al. JGIM 2018).&#xD;
      Framing program participation as opt-out has led to a 22% increase in enrollment in a&#xD;
      COVID-19 surveillance testing program (Oakes et al. NEJM Catalyst 2021) and triple enrollment&#xD;
      in remote monitoring programs for medication adherence (Mehta et al. JAMA Cardiology. 2018)&#xD;
      and diabetes management (Aysola et al. AJHP 2016)&#xD;
