  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzyme supplementation plays an essential role in the&#xD;
      elimination of toxic metabolites and reduction of reactive oxygen species bioactivation,&#xD;
      which can protect and relieve chemotherapy-related fatigue (CRF) in cancer patients. The aim&#xD;
      of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ALDH enzyme in CRF with advanced&#xD;
      gastrointestinal cancer patients. The primary endpoint is the change of FACIT-F (Functional&#xD;
      Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue) score on day 15 compared to baseline after&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The secondary endpoint including change of FACIT-F on day 29 compared to day&#xD;
      15, change of ESAS (Edmonton Symptom Assessment System) on day 15 compared to baseline,&#xD;
      safety and toxicities, and exploratory biomarkers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy-related fatigue (CRF) occurs universally in cancer patients which can be a&#xD;
      debilitating symptom that affects patients' quality of life. The impact of CRF has been&#xD;
      associated with mood disorder, sleep disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, inflammation&#xD;
      mediated putative biological disturbances, and functional morbidities. Although the etiology&#xD;
      is heterogeneous and complex, one of the proposed mechanisms is that chemotherapy induced&#xD;
      multiple oxidative degradation of the lipid membrane which generates reactive oxygen species&#xD;
      (ROS) and tissue damage. These conditions result in inflammation-induced reduction in central&#xD;
      dopaminergic neurotransmission, nutritional deficiency (especially in vitamins and minerals),&#xD;
      and immunodeficiency, which clinically manifest as CRF. To date, various agents including&#xD;
      psychostimulants (methylphenidate, donepezil, and modafinil), dexamethasone, and Korean red&#xD;
      ginseng (KRG) were used in the management of CRF. However, the prevalence of CRF is still&#xD;
      high primarily due to lack of proven effective therapies. ALDH enzyme supplementation plays&#xD;
      an essential role in the eliminates 4-hydoxynonenal, malondialdehyde from lipid peroxidation&#xD;
      and reduce ROS bioactivation, which can protect and relieve CRF in cancer patients. Based on&#xD;
      these rational backgrounds, the aim or this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      ALDH enzyme in CRF with advanced gastrointestinal cancer patients.&#xD;
