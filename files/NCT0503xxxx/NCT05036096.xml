    <textblock>
      Up to one thousand and twenty-eight (1028) patients from screening and diagnostic population&#xD;
      will be enrolled and consented to participate in the study to create an enriched data set.&#xD;
      These women will be enrolled from annual screening population and diagnostic workup&#xD;
      population. The enrolled patient will undergo KBCT scans within 4 weeks of her screening or&#xD;
      diagnostic mammography exam and before breast biopsy occurs if biopsy is needed.&#xD;
