    <textblock>
      Before the intervention of green tea mouthwash, patients in the experimental group and the&#xD;
      control group were tested for oral health status, bad breath and plaque degree, and received&#xD;
      routine brushing guidelines. Patients in the experimental group received green tea mouthwash&#xD;
      intervention twice a day for 7 day&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The participants assess the patient's oral health status by the oral health assessment tool scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>to evaluate the seventh day after use green tea gargle</time_frame>
    <description>Oral Health Assessment Tool (OHAT) kayser-Jones et al. (1995) Oral Health of elderly and cognitively impaired persons. A Brief Oral Health 6 Status Examination was developed. BOHSE) and may be evaluated by a nursing practitioner. Chalmers, Johnson, Tang and Titler developed the Oral Health Assessment Tool (OHAT) after modifying the Simple Oral Health Status Measurement Scale in 2004. This scale can be extended to assess the oral health of elderly people with daily living function dependence, and can be assisted by clinical nursing staff after guidance. The contents of the questionnaire were divided into eight items, including lips, tongue, gums, toothache, saliva, teeth, dentures and oral hygiene. The degree of oral health was divided by 0, 1 and 2 points for each item. The total score ranged from 0 to 16, the higher the score was, the worse the oral health was.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The participants assess the patient's degree of halitosis by the portable breath meter.</measure>
    <time_frame>to evaluate the seventh day after use green tea gargle</time_frame>
    <description>In this study, a portable breath meter (HC-150®, Tanita Co, Tokyo, Japan) was used to measure the concentration of volatile sulfide in the mouth of patients with a score ranging from 0 to 5. The higher the score, the more severe the halitosis. Manner to ensure that the portable measuring instrument measured the stability of the data, before the study, to perform 20 minutes five patients repeated measurement mouth sulfide values, the research process are made by same nurses within non-executive care plan for all the object of study manner using a portable measuring instrument for testing, in order to maintain consistency measurement. The portable breath meter is calibrated by the instrument to determine the accuracy of the measured value.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The participants assess the patient's the degree of dental plaque with the modified plaque index of &quot;Turesky&quot;.</measure>
    <time_frame>to evaluate the seventh day after use green tea gargle</time_frame>
    <description>In 1962, quigley-Hein developed a plaque index score of 0 to 5 and stained with plaque stains. In 1970, Turesky et al. improved the method. After staining with plaque stains, they scored according to the stained area. The scoring criteria were as follows: 0 was for plaque free; 1. There are scattered punctate dental plaque at the gingival margin of the tooth neck; 2: the width of dental plaque in the neck is less than 1mm(continuous); 3: dental plaque covering area of the tooth neck is more than 1mm, less than 1/3 of the tooth face; 4: the area covered by dental plaque is between 1/3 and 2/3 of the teeth; 5. The dental plaque covers more than 2/3 of the teeth. To distinguish the degree of dental plaque, the total score is 2 points. When the index is greater than 2, it is high; when the index is between 0 and 1, it is low. The higher the score is, the worse the oral health is.</description>

    <description>Use fresh green tea (package date less than one month) sourced from the local market and serve in the form of soaked tea bags. 0.5% green tea refers to a tea bag soaked in 0.5g green tea, soaked in 100ml warm water for 5 minutes and let cool. Then, put each bottle of 15ml mouthwash into a disposable opaque bottle, and give two bottles of mouthwash required daily at one time. Use 15ml twice a day, 30 minutes after breakfast and 30 minutes after lunch, each time for 30 seconds. Rinse mouth up and down for 30 seconds. Rinse mouth up and down, half sitting and lying down, and shake the head of bed for 30 degrees. After breakfast, the experimental group and the control group were instructed to clean their teeth according to routine procedures, and telephone reminders were provided to inform them to gargle.</description>
