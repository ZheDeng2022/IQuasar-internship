    <textblock>
      The aim of this works is to investigate the effect of genetic polymorphism of snps on human&#xD;
      response to treatment with empagliflozine and its correlation with with pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      parameters in Egyptian subjects&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Empagliflozin is a sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor indicated as an adjunct&#xD;
      to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adult patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
      SGLT2 co-transporters are responsible for reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular&#xD;
      filtrate in the kidney. The glucuretic effect resulting from SGLT2 inhibition reduces renal&#xD;
      absorption and lowers the renal threshold for glucose, therefore resulting in increased&#xD;
      glucose excretion. Additionally, it contributes to reduced hyperglycaemia and also assists&#xD;
      weight loss and blood pressure reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABSORPTION Following oral administration, peak plasma concentrations were reached at 1.5&#xD;
      hours post-dose and then declined in a biphasic manner with a rapid distribution phase and a&#xD;
      relatively slow terminal phase. Administration following a high-fat and high-calorie meal&#xD;
      results in a slightly lower exposure with AUC decreasing by approximately 16% and Cmax&#xD;
      decreasing by approximately 37% compared to fasted condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METABOLISM In vitro studies suggest that empaglifozin is primarily metabolized by&#xD;
      glucuronidation by 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases UG2B7, UGT1A3, UGT1A8, and UGT1A9.&#xD;
      The most abundant metabolites are three glucuronide metabolites: 2-O-, 3-O-, and&#xD;
      6-O-glucuronide. Empagliflozin does not inhibit, inactivate, or induce CYP450 isoforms. It is&#xD;
      a substrate for p-glycoprotein (p-gp), however in vitro studies suggest that it is unlikely&#xD;
      to cause interactions with drugs that are p-gp substrates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After oral administration, empaglifozin was 41.2% eliminated in feces and 54.4% eliminated in&#xD;
      urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Terminal elimination half life was found to be 12.4 h based on population pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
