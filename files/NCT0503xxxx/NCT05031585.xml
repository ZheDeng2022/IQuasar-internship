      Pivotal clinical trial, multicenter of superiority, randomized, double-blind, parallel&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed for the improvement of snoring, characterized by a noise caused by the&#xD;
      vibration of tissues obstructing the nasopharynx and oropharynx during sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is performed in participants of both sexes, over 18 years of age, who complain of snoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for studying the use of a medical device with nasal spray solution for snoring&#xD;
      improvement is due to the fact that surface tension in the pharyngeal mucosa plays an&#xD;
      important role in determining airway collapsibility.&#xD;
