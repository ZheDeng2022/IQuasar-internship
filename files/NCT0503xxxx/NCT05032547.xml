      We will evaluate a transdiagnostic digital emotion regulation treatment for youth with mental&#xD;
      health problems.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mental health problems in youth are a global problem, causing incalculable suffering in youth&#xD;
      and families, harming long-term prospects of youths, and are creating substantial economic&#xD;
      costs to society. Existing treatments are not fully addressing these problems because they&#xD;
      focus on a subset of mental health problems; they are limited in efficacy; and are not&#xD;
      provided to most youth in need. Transdiagnostic digital treatments that address mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying mental health problems, such as emotion regulation, have been called for to&#xD;
      address these problems. As an initial pilot study we will include 60 participants aged 12-17&#xD;
      years and their parents in a randomized controlled feasibility trial comparing a 6-week&#xD;
      Primary care Online Emotion-regulation Treatment (POET) to a 6-week active Supportive&#xD;
      Treatment (ST). Both interventions will be delivered in blended format combining online&#xD;
      therapist-supported treatment modules with a video-link session. The primary study aims are&#xD;
      to examine the feasibility and acceptability of study protocol and treatment protocols.&#xD;
      Preliminary utility of the experimental condition will be evaluated by youth-reported,&#xD;
      parent-reported, and clinical-reported outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>The youth component in the experimental condition will include psychoeducation, addressing maladaptive beliefs about emotions and emotion regulation, and teaching adaptive emotion regulation strategies, such as mindfulness practice and acceptance of emotions and flexible cognitive reappraisal. The parent component will include psychoeducation and teaching effective responding to their children's and their own emotions.</description>
