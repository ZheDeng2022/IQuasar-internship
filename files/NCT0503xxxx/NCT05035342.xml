      Carriage of multi-drug and extensive-drug resistant Gram negative bacteria (MDR-GNB) is&#xD;
      associated with an increased risk of infections by these bacteria for the carriers and a high&#xD;
      risk of dissemination both in the healthcare setting and the community; the main MDR-GNB&#xD;
      reservoir is the fecal microbiota. To prevent both infections and dissemination, effective&#xD;
      measures to decolonize subjects carrying MDR-GNB are urgently needed. Animal models, case&#xD;
      reports and cohort studies suggest fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) may be efficient&#xD;
      for MDR-GNB decolonization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The issue of antibiotic resistance is considered as one of the major Public Health threats of&#xD;
      the 21th century by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Given the rapid increase in the&#xD;
      dissemination of multi-drug resistant organisms globally, the real implications of spreading&#xD;
      drug resistance will be felt the world over, with developing countries and large emerging&#xD;
      nations bearing the brunt of this problem. Routine surgeries and minor infections will become&#xD;
      life-threatening once again and the hard won victories against infectious diseases of the&#xD;
      last fifty years will be jeopardised. Hospital stays and expenses will increase&#xD;
      significantly. Drug resistant infections are already on the rise with numbers suggesting that&#xD;
      up to 50,000 lives are lost each year to antibiotic-resistant infections in Europe and the US&#xD;
      alone. Globally, at least 700,000 die each year of drug resistance in bacterial infections.&#xD;
      Estimates have found that antibiotic resistance may kill more than cancer in 2050, with&#xD;
      figures reaching 10 million deaths a year globally, if nothing is done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, one of the most worrying problems is the dramatic increase in infections&#xD;
      caused by multi-drug resistant Gram Negative bacteria (MDR-GNB), including extended spectrum&#xD;
      β-lactamase and/or carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E and CRE) with few&#xD;
      effective therapeutic options remaining in the armamentarium of clinicians. There is a&#xD;
      striking lack of new antimicrobial agents especially against MDR-GNB while dissemination of&#xD;
      these MDR-GNB is accelerating. The rising epidemic of CRE is especially worrying. Southern&#xD;
      European countries such as Italy and Greece are already at epidemic levels of CRE infections,&#xD;
      which are associated with much higher death rates and are more expensive to treat because of&#xD;
      the lack of effective non-toxic antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even if new agents were discovered, the lead in time is considerable as there are no truly&#xD;
      new agents expected on the market in the short or medium term. Alternative effective measures&#xD;
      to contain resistance and limit the spread of MDR-GNB are therefore urgently needed. The gut&#xD;
      microbiota is the main reservoir of MDR-GNB. Patients carrying MDR-GNB are at higher risk of&#xD;
      clinical infections with their own bacteria and of dissemination in the community and in the&#xD;
      hospital settings. In the last 10 years, the number of MDR-GNB carriers has increased&#xD;
      strikingly (for instance, one report found a 10-fold increase in France from 2006-2011 from&#xD;
      0.6% to 6% of subjects in the community; another found a 12% ESBL-E colonization rate in&#xD;
      Parisian hospitals upon admission in 2015) and continues to rise. Finding efficient&#xD;
      decolonization strategies is urgent to attempt to limit the risk of infection at the&#xD;
      individual level and the spread of MDR-GNB at the population level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), which has been shown to be highly effective for the&#xD;
      treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infections (CDI), has also been suggested as a&#xD;
      decolonization strategy for patients carrying MDR-GNB: animal models and several clinical&#xD;
      case reports suggest that this strategy may be interesting to decolonize MDR-GNB carriers. To&#xD;
      date, the question of whether FMT may be efficient to decolonize MDR-GNB carriers in human is&#xD;
      not resolved. Because decolonization may also be spontaneous, performing a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial is essential to answer this question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis for this study is that FMT may be efficient to decolonize patients carrying&#xD;
      MDR-GNB in their gut microbiota. To determine whether this hypothesis is true, we shall&#xD;
      conduct a phase III randomized controlled trial comparing capsule-delivered FMT with a&#xD;
      placebo to decolonize subjects carrying either CRE or ESBL-E.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elimination of carriage should benefit directly the individual patient by preventing&#xD;
      infections with these resistant organisms and limiting isolation precautions, which impacts&#xD;
      their quality of care, the possibilities of transfer to other healthcare settings (such as&#xD;
      rehabilitation centres) and their psychological health. Additionally, the elimination of&#xD;
      MDR-GNB carriage should benefit the community by decreasing the risk of inter-individual&#xD;
      transmission in particular in the healthcare setting. For this intervention, we will use&#xD;
      frozen capsules rather than nasogastric infusion or colonoscopy, as they limit adverse&#xD;
      events, facilitate donor screening, allow for outpatient treatment, and are adapted to treat&#xD;
      large populations. Thanks to the above-mentioned reasons, capsules are becoming the&#xD;
      standard-of-care for FMT. In the context of the major threat that antibiotic resistance in&#xD;
      Gram negatives carries, both on an individual and a collective point-of-view; this is a&#xD;
      highly important question.&#xD;

The pellet is resuspended and manually pipetted into size 0 capsules (650 μL), which are closed and then secondarily sealed in size 00 capsules (hypromellose capsules, DR caps from Capsugel®, MA). Each capsule contains 1g ± 0,1g of fecal suspension corresponding to 0.5 to 0.8g of native stool. Capsules will be stored frozen at -80°C for up to 12 months pending use. The stability of biodiversity and viability of the frozen microbiota was regularly verified to ensure the efficacy of the transplantation (personal data).</description>
