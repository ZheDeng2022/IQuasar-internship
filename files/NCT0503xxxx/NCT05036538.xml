  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing cardiac surgery often complain of anxiety before a major operation and&#xD;
      the resulting stress. This circumstance is a risk factor for mental problems that may occur&#xD;
      after the operation (e.g., delirium or memory deficits). This study aims to prevent these&#xD;
      discomforts by a preoperative relaxation intervention.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative anxiety and stress are risk factors for postoperative delirium (PD),&#xD;
      postoperative cognitive decline (POCD), morbidity, and mortality. The primary objective of&#xD;
      this study is to reduce the preoperative stress response through the combined presentation of&#xD;
      a virtual reality environment with natural landscape and binaural beats. The proposed study&#xD;
      is a monocenter, 5-arm prospective randomized controlled intervention of 125 patients&#xD;
      undergoing elective cardiac surgery using extracorporeal circulation. A 360 Â° video sequence&#xD;
      including natural sounds (with and without binaural beats) are presented to 2 groups, and 2&#xD;
      groups receive only natural sounds (with and without binaural beats); a group without stimuli&#xD;
      (standard procedure) represents the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of admission to the acute care clinic, a detailed examination of&#xD;
      neuropsychological functions and health-related quality of life (HQL) is scheduled.&#xD;
      Cortisol-saliva, heart rate variability and electrodermal activity as indicators for stress&#xD;
      and relaxation are measured during the intervention phase (duration: approximately 30&#xD;
      minutes), which leads directly into the narcosis phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate postoperative neurocognitive dysfunctions, daily delirium screenings will be&#xD;
      performed after surgery, and a neuropsychological examination will be performed at the time&#xD;
      of discharge from the acute hospital and at 3 months after surgery. Changes in HQL will also&#xD;
      be completed at 3 months post-surgery.&#xD;
