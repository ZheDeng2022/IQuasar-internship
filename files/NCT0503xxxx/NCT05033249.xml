      Acute appendicitis is the most common cause of abdominal pain requiring surgery in the&#xD;
      emergency department. The whole life acute appendicitis rate is 7%. Only half of the patients&#xD;
      with acute appendicitis are presented with typical periumbilical pain following by nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting, and the migration of pain to the right lower quadrant. The diagnosis of acute&#xD;
      appendicitis is based on the patient's medical history, physical examination, and laboratory&#xD;
      findings. The Alvarado scoring system (ASS), recommends discharge, observation, and surgical&#xD;
      intervention to patients. However, such scoring systems should not be used as the only method&#xD;
      in diagnosis. Increased imaging use in patients with suspected acute appendicitis improved&#xD;
      the rate of correct diagnosis. American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria (ACR)&#xD;
      recommends computerized tomography (CT) as the primary imaging method to confirm the&#xD;
      diagnosis of acute appendicitis in adults. However, CT imaging has some disadvantages, such&#xD;
      as radiation exposure, undesirable effects associated with the use of contrast agents, and&#xD;
      increased workload in the emergency room. The count of immature granulocytes (IGC), which is&#xD;
      an indicator of increased activation of the bone marrow, and the percentage of IG (IGP),&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Acute appendicitis is the most common cause of abdominal pain requiring surgery in the&#xD;
      emergency department. The highest incidence of acute appendicitis is in the 2nd and 3rd&#xD;
      decades of life, but it can be seen at any age. There is a 7% chance that a person will have&#xD;
      appendicitis during life. Only half of the patients with acute appendicitis are presented&#xD;
      with typical periumbilical pain following by nausea, vomiting, and the migration of pain to&#xD;
      the right lower quadrant. The diagnosis of acute appendicitis is based on the patient's&#xD;
      medical history, physical examination, and laboratory findings. Various clinical prediction&#xD;
      rules have been developed to increase diagnostic accuracy. The most accepted among these is&#xD;
      the Alvarado scoring system (ASS). ASS classifies patients as low, moderate, and high-risk&#xD;
      groups for acute appendicitis. Accordingly, it recommends discharge, observation, and&#xD;
      surgical intervention to patients. However, such scoring systems should not be used as the&#xD;
      only method in diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased imaging use in patients with suspected acute appendicitis improved the rate of&#xD;
      correct diagnosis. American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria (ACR) recommends&#xD;
      computerized tomography (CT) as the primary imaging method to confirm the diagnosis of acute&#xD;
      appendicitis in adults. However, CT imaging has some disadvantages, such as radiation&#xD;
      exposure, undesirable effects associated with the use of contrast agents, and increased&#xD;
      workload in the emergency room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous inflammatory parameters adapted from complete blood count parameters can be used in&#xD;
      infectious inflammatory processes such as acute appendicitis, pyelonephritis, and&#xD;
      non-infectious conditions such as differentiation of tumoral masses from benign lesions, and&#xD;
      determining survival in acute myocardial infarction. Among these parameters,&#xD;
      neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, platelet lymphocyte ratio, and lymphocyte monocyte ratio were&#xD;
      used in previous studies. Similarly, the number of immature granulocytes (IGC), which is an&#xD;
      indicator of increased activation of the bone marrow, and the percentage of IG (IGP), which&#xD;
      is the ratio of IGs to the total white blood cell count, are also has been used in acute&#xD;
      necrotizing pancreatitis, differentiation of complicated acute appendicitis from&#xD;
      uncomplicated acute appendicitis, pyelonephritis, sepsis, thyroid gland malignancies, and&#xD;
      renal cell carcinomas. Previously the determination of the number of IGs could be possible&#xD;
      based on counting granulocyte precursor cells during the direct microscopic examination.&#xD;
      Nowadays automatic blood analyzers can easily measure the amount and percentage of IGs&#xD;
      simultaneously in a complete blood count test with advances in technology. Immature&#xD;
      granulocyte (IG) in peripheral blood is an indicator of increased bone marrow activity. It&#xD;
      has been reported in previous studies that IGC and IGP increase in infection and sepsis, and&#xD;
      are more reliable markers in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis than other hematological&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aimed to investigate the utility of IGC and IGP on the prediction of suspected&#xD;
      acute appendicitis according to the ASS and its effect on the need for CT scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS Study design and setting This study is a retrospective cohort analysis&#xD;
      involving adult patients who were admitted to the emergency department of a university&#xD;
      hospital between January 2019 and July 2019 due to abdominal pain and suspected acute&#xD;
      appendicitis according to ASS. Local ethics committee approval was received for the study&#xD;
      (ethics committee approval number 2019/11/06). Because the study design is retrospective, the&#xD;
      signed informed consent of patients is not required. All procedures performed in studies&#xD;
      involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the&#xD;
      institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki&#xD;
      and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Selection and Data Collection Adult patients who admitted to the Emergency Department&#xD;
      of Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam University hospital due to abdominal pain and had an ASS between&#xD;
      4-7, and whose initial imaging technique was CT were included in the study. ASS scores of the&#xD;
      patients were calculated retrospectively by examining patients' medical records. Patients&#xD;
      were used other imaging methods, underwent surgery without imaging, followed by medical&#xD;
      treatment without surgery, pregnant, under the age of 18, with incomplete medical records,&#xD;
      and with additional diseases (such as underlying hematologic or rheumatologic disease, other&#xD;
      concurrent infectious diseases) and treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factors,&#xD;
      glucocorticoids, or other immunosuppressants that may affect inflammation markers were&#xD;
      excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic files of the patients recorded in the hospital database were reviewed by the&#xD;
      investigators. Demographic data (age, gender), laboratory values, tomography reports, and&#xD;
      pathological diagnoses were recorded. The diagnosis was also confirmed histopathologically in&#xD;
      all patients diagnosed with acute appendicitis according to the result of tomography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, IGC, and IGP were&#xD;
      obtained from the blood sample taken at the time of the patient's first admission to the&#xD;
      hospital using the Sysmex XN-3000 (Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan) device.&#xD;
      Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was calculated manually from hemogram results. The patients&#xD;
      were divided into two groups as those with acute appendicitis (appendicitis positive group,&#xD;
      Group-P) and non-appendicitis (appendicitis negative group, Group-N) according to the result&#xD;
      of tomography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The data were analyzed with the IBM Statistical Package for the Social&#xD;
      Sciences (SPSS ver. 20) program. The compliance of continuous variables to normal&#xD;
      distribution was evaluated with the Shapiro-Wilk test. An independent sample t-test was used&#xD;
      to compare the data that complied with the normal distribution and the Mann Whitney-U test&#xD;
      was used for those that did not comply with the normal distribution. Pearson test was used&#xD;
      for correlation analysis of normally distributed parameters, and the Spearman test was used&#xD;
      for correlation analysis of non-normally distributed parameters. Multivariate analysis was&#xD;
      performed with parameters found to be significant in the evaluation of univariate analysis&#xD;
      and predictive values of preoperative blood parameters were calculated. The Chi-square test&#xD;
      was used to analyze categorical variables. p&lt;0.05 value was considered significant. The&#xD;
      Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the success of&#xD;
      laboratory parameters in predicting acute appendicitis diagnosis. The area under the curve&#xD;
      (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value&#xD;
      (NPV), and accuracy rate were calculated for parameters with a statistically significant&#xD;
      difference between groups.&#xD;
