    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare mepolizumab-based regimen to conventional therapeutic&#xD;
      strategy for remission induction in patients with Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with&#xD;
      Polyangiitis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), formerly called Churg-Strauss syndrome,&#xD;
      is a rare systemic small-vessel vasculitis, associated with asthma and blood and tissue&#xD;
      eosinophilia. EGPA belongs to the group of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody&#xD;
      (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV), and commonly involves upper and lower respiratory&#xD;
      tracts, the lungs, the peripheral nerve and the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic management is based on glucocorticoids alone or in combination with conventional&#xD;
      immunosuppressive agents, mainly azathioprine, methotrexate or cyclophosphamide, according to&#xD;
      disease severity assessed by the Five Factor Score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such treatments, in addition to their common side effects, are frequently insufficiently&#xD;
      effective to control chronic asthma and/or rhinosinusitis, requiring long-term high-dose&#xD;
      corticosteroids. Because EGPA shares common pathophysiological features with eosinophilic&#xD;
      disorders and asthma, new therapeutic options used in these conditions could be of interest,&#xD;
      in particular mepolizumab, a monoclonal anti-interleukin (IL)-5 antibody, which has shown&#xD;
      promising results in two small preliminary studies to control disease activity and decrease&#xD;
      glucocorticoids in cortico-dependant patients. In addition, mepolizumab has been recently&#xD;
      evaluated in a prospective trial, the MIRRA trial, targeting a small niche of patients, i.e.&#xD;
      those with corticodependent asthma unable to achieve disease control with low dose of&#xD;
      glucocorticoids. Results published revealed that mepolizumab led to significantly more&#xD;
      accrued weeks of remission than placebo (28% vs. 3% of the participants had ≥24 weeks of&#xD;
      accrued remission; odds ratio, 5.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.68 to 13.03; P&lt;0.001)&#xD;
      and a higher percentage of participants in remission at both week 36 and week 48 (32% vs. 3%;&#xD;
      odds ratio, 16.74; 95% CI, 3.61 to 77.56; P&lt;0.001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, these studies did not evaluate the interest of mepolizumab during EGPA flare&#xD;
      associating asthma, eosinophilic and vasculitis lesions, in order to induce remission of the&#xD;
      disease and rapidly decrease and discontinue glucocorticoids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, recent pathophysiological date strongly support in addition to previous therapeutic&#xD;
      studies the major interest to target IL-5 as soon as EGPA is diagnosed: 1) genetic&#xD;
      association studies demonstrated that polymorphisms in the IL-5 pathway are associated with&#xD;
      EGPA in comparison with controls, 2) increased expression of IL-5 in mice model are able to&#xD;
      induce vasculitis lesions as observed in the human diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a standardized glucocorticoid tapering schedule. From day 28&#xD;
      post-baseline onwards, if the subject's BVAS=0 their oral prednisone dose should be tapered&#xD;
      downwards. A standardized glucocorticoid tapering schedule provided in the protocol enables a&#xD;
      reduction in oral prednisone dose every 2 weeks, with the intention of achieving a prednisone&#xD;
      dose of 4 mg/day or less. Once a subject has achieved a dose of 4 mg/day prednisone, the&#xD;
      investigator is encouraged to continue tapering downwards, if clinically warranted, at dose&#xD;
      increments of 1.0 mg every week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upwards dose adjustments within the 0-4.0 mg range are permitted without necessarily being&#xD;
      considered a relapse.&#xD;
