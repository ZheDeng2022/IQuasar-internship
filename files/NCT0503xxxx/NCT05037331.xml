  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer incidence (11.6%) and mortality (18.4%)&#xD;
      globally[1]. Development of targeted therapies in the context of precision medicine changed&#xD;
      the way lung cancer was diagnosed and treated. Small molecule inhibitors, like tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase inhibitors (TKIs), are now standard first-line therapy for EGFR-positive non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC). First-generation EGFR-TKIs gefitinib and erlotinib bind&#xD;
      competitively to the ATP-binding site of EGFR TK domain. This binding in second-generation&#xD;
      TKI afatinib is irreversible. These drugs have improved better outcome compared to standard&#xD;
      conventional chemotherapy In spite of this, more than half of the patients with an EGFR TKI&#xD;
      treatment develop resistance. Deletion in exon 19 and single point substitution L858R in exon&#xD;
      21 accounting for 44% and 41% of all EGFR mutations, respectively are the most common&#xD;
      mutations in EGFR gene which cause this resistance in the patients. Asia has the highest&#xD;
      prevalence of EGFR mutations (38.4%), followed by America (24.4%) and Europe (14.1%). Median&#xD;
      progression-free survival of EGFR mutated NSCLC patients under erlotinib or gefitinib has&#xD;
      been around 12 months and 5-year survival was 15%&#xD;

      To evaluate the efficacy (Objective Response Rate), safety and tolerability of 80mg&#xD;
      Osimertinib eod dosing in NSCLC patients with sensitizing EGFR mutations and/or EGFR T790M&#xD;
      resistance mutation that have no prior EGFR treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the efficacy and safety of Osimertinib 80mg/eod. Parameters like PFS, DoR, the&#xD;
      incidence of brain metastases and OS will be assessed for the efficacy using RECIST criteria&#xD;
      version 1.1. PFS in the brain will be another endpoint. Adverse events will be graded&#xD;
      according to CTCAE v4.0 by recording vital signs, physical examinations, weight, ECG, ECOG&#xD;
      performance status, clinical chemistry, haematology, urinalysis. We would use ctDNA to detect&#xD;
      the mutations and compare the progress of the disease or the outcome of patients besides&#xD;
      clinical assessments. The relationship between PK and selected efficacy, pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      markers (like duration of inhibition of EGFR by hair follicle sampling) and safety endpoints&#xD;
      will be assessed as well.&#xD;
