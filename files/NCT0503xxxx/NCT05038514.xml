  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Almost half of the patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia develop ARDS and most of these&#xD;
      patients are treated in the intensive care unit. In the management of COVID-19 ARDS, prone&#xD;
      position is applied to improve physiological parameters by facilitating better distribution&#xD;
      of tidal volume and drainage of secretions. It has been reported that awake patients in COVID&#xD;
      clinics could not adapt their prone position due to anxiety . Jiang et al (2020) reported&#xD;
      that awake patients may not tolerate the prone position and may experience anxiety due to&#xD;
      posture habits and discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was determined that anxiety developed on the second day of hospitalization in the&#xD;
      intensive care unit, state anxiety was associated with trait anxiety and pain, and anxiety&#xD;
      was low in patients receiving mental health care/treatment . And also not to change position&#xD;
      himself of patient in prone position due to care equipment etc it can cause loss of&#xD;
      self-control and anxiety. Twelve-sixteen hour prone position recommendation for clinical&#xD;
      improvement, positioning difficulties in patients who cannot position themselves may also&#xD;
      trigger anxiety in awake patients It has been suggested that music therapy may be effective&#xD;
      in reducing anxiety related to weaning from mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
      Music therapy intervention in ICU has been tested in sessions of at least 30 minutes, 1-30&#xD;
      days, with options such as western music, classical Chinese music, nature-based music. In the&#xD;
      study of Chu and Zhang (2021), it was shown that the recovery time for tomography findings,&#xD;
      the number of days of hospital stay and the rates of transfer to the intensive care unit were&#xD;
      lower in the patient group who received holistic mode including traditional Chinese medicine,&#xD;
      music therapy, and emotional support in COVID-19 patients. Studies evaluating the&#xD;
      effectiveness of music therapy alone in the COVID-19 intensive care process could not be&#xD;
      reached. It is thought that music therapy applied in the prone position in the COVID-19&#xD;
      intensive care unit will reduce the anxiety of the patients, adapt to the prone position and&#xD;
      improve their clinical parameters.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Corona virus disease 2019 Pandemic (COVID-19) has caused a psychosocial depression in the&#xD;
      world. Acute severe or critical condition has been observed in 20% of individuals diagnosed&#xD;
      with COVID-19. It is stated that viral pneumonia or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome&#xD;
      (ARDS) and organ failures develop in these individuals. Almost half of the patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with COVID-19 pneumonia develop ARDS and most of these patients are treated in the intensive&#xD;
      care unit. In the management of COVID-19 ARDS, prone position is applied to improve&#xD;
      physiological parameters by facilitating better distribution of tidal volume and drainage of&#xD;
      secretions. It is thought that the prone position will be more effective in the early stages&#xD;
      of the disease and awake patients. It is recommended that the prone position especially in&#xD;
      moderate to severe ARDS cases be applied for at least 12 hours after symptoms stabilize.&#xD;
      Elkattawy and Noori (2020) reported that at least 6-8 hours of prone position improves&#xD;
      oxygenation in the COVID-19 case without ARDS criteria. Mac Sweeney et al. (2020) reported&#xD;
      that clinical parameters improved, intubation and ventilator requirement were delayed in an&#xD;
      awake, self-prone COVID-19 case. However, Somagutta et al (2021) reported anxiety, back pain,&#xD;
      adjustment and tolerance problems in awake and not mechanically ventilated patients. Bastoni&#xD;
      et al, in the study which they evaluated prone adapt at emergency department in Italy; it is&#xD;
      reported positioning could not be maintained in four out of ten patients due to unconformity,&#xD;
      pain, and rejection of prone position. It has been reported that awake patients in COVID&#xD;
      clinics could not adapt their prone position due to anxiety. Jiang et al (2020) reported that&#xD;
      awake patients may not tolerate the prone position and may experience anxiety due to posture&#xD;
      habits and discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was determined that anxiety developed on the second day of hospitalization in the&#xD;
      intensive care unit, state anxiety was associated with trait anxiety and pain, and anxiety&#xD;
      was low in patients receiving mental health care/treatment. And also not to change position&#xD;
      himself of patient in prone position due to care equipment etc it can cause loss of&#xD;
      self-control and anxiety. Twelve-sixteen hour prone position recommendation for clinical&#xD;
      improvement, positioning difficulties in patients who cannot position themselves may also&#xD;
      trigger anxiety in awake patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Music therapy is applied as a non-pharmacological nursing intervention in the anxiety&#xD;
      management of patients in intensive careIt is stated that music therapy is effective in&#xD;
      stress-anxiety management, improves vital signs and sleep quality, and may have a muscle&#xD;
      relaxant effect in interventions applied in covid-19. It has been suggested that music&#xD;
      therapy may be effective in reducing anxiety related to weaning from mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      in COVID-19 patients. Music therapy intervention in ICU has been tested in sessions of at&#xD;
      least 30 minutes, 1-30 days, with options such as western music, classical Chinese music,&#xD;
      nature-based music. It has been reported that music therapy applied with all types of music&#xD;
      provides normal heart rate, respiratory recovery and muscle relaxation. Golino et al.&#xD;
      listened to music for 30 minutes according to the preferences of the patients in the&#xD;
      intensive care unit and their vital signs, pain and anxiety were evaluated. While there was&#xD;
      an improvement in heart rate and respiration, oxygen saturations did not change. At the same&#xD;
      time, patients reported less pain and anxiety. In the study of Chu and Zhang (2021), it was&#xD;
      shown that the recovery time for tomography findings, the number of days of hospital stay and&#xD;
      the rates of transfer to the intensive care unit were lower in the patient group who received&#xD;
      holistic mode including traditional Chinese medicine, music therapy, and emotional support in&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients. Studies evaluating the effectiveness of music therapy alone in the&#xD;
      COVID-19 intensive care process could not be reached. It is thought that music therapy&#xD;
      applied in the prone position in the COVID-19 intensive care unit will reduce the anxiety of&#xD;
      the patients, adapt to the prone position and improve their clinical parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of music therapy applied in the&#xD;
      prone position on anxiety, compliance with the prone position, and vital signs in patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with COVID-19 in the intensive care unit.&#xD;
