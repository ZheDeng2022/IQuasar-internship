  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer (GC),including cardia and noncardia gastric cancer, is responsible for over&#xD;
      480,000 new cases in 2020 and an estimated 370,000 deaths, making it the third most&#xD;
      frequently diagnosed cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death in China. Majority of&#xD;
      patients(63%) are presented with locally advanced gastric cancer (stage Ⅱ/Ⅲ) and the&#xD;
      prognosis is poor. Previous studies have shown that patients with pathological complete&#xD;
      response(pCR) following neoadjuvant therapy have longer survival. In 2019, Lancet Oncology&#xD;
      published the FLOT4-AIO study which testified that perioperative chemotherapy with FLOT&#xD;
      (5-FU/LV, oxaliplatin and docetaxel) regimen has improved pCR rate and prolonged progression&#xD;
      free survival(PFS) and overall survival(OS) in patients with stage II/III gastric cancer.&#xD;
      Moreover, PD-1 blockade such as nivolumab or pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy&#xD;
      has shown higher objective response rate(ORR) as compared to chemotherapy alone in advanced&#xD;
      gastric cancer. The nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel has been recommended as the&#xD;
      second-line chemotherapy for unresectable or recurrent gastric cancer based on the Chinese&#xD;
      Society of Clinical Oncology(CSCO) guideline. When PD-1 antibody is applied, albumin-bound&#xD;
      paclitaxel is considered as a better partner since no pretreatment of corticosteroids is&#xD;
      needed. Thus, the investigators plan to conduct a phase II clinical trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of toripalimab (PD-1 antibody) combined with the FLOAP (albumin-bound&#xD;
      paclitaxel, oxaliplatin, fluorouracil and leucovorin) regimen as the perioperative treatment&#xD;
      of cT2-4 and/or N+ GC. The primary end point is pCR rate. The secondary end points include&#xD;
      disease free survival(DFS), OS, ORR, R0 resection rate, incidence of adverse events(AE).&#xD;

      This phase Ⅱ trial is a single-arm, open-label, non-randomized and single center clinical&#xD;
      study. Patients who met the inclusion criteria will receive the combination of toripalimab&#xD;
      (160mg, iv, d1,q2w) with FLOAP (fluorouracil,2600mg/m2; leucovorin, 200mg/m2; oxaliplatin,&#xD;
      85mg/m2; albumin paclitaxel, 150mg/m2, d1, q2w) up to four cycles. After the fourth cycle of&#xD;
      the treatment, the clinical efficacy and operation feasibility will be evaluated by the MDT&#xD;
      discussions. And then, surgery will be performed within 4 weeks. After the surgery, patients&#xD;
      will receive 4-cycle treatments of toripalimab combined with FLOAP regimen. The primary end&#xD;
      point is pCR rate. The secondary end points included DFS, OS, ORR, R0 resection rate,&#xD;
      incidence of AE.&#xD;
