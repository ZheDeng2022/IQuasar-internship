      The main objective of the present study is the genotyping of M. leprae strains found in&#xD;
      leprosy patients in French Guiana. The secondary objectives are to investigate the presence&#xD;
      of M. lepromatosis in these patients, the molecular research of M. leprae resistance to&#xD;
      anti-leprosy antibiotics, the study of risk factors for leprosy in humans in Guyana and in&#xD;
      particular direct or indirect contact with armadillos, as well as the determination of&#xD;
      phylogenetic links between the M. leprae strains found in French Guiana, and with the&#xD;
      regional and world reference strains Epidemiology of leprosy in French Guiana.&#xD;

      Rationale: Leprosy (also known as Hansen's disease) is a chronic infection caused by&#xD;
      intracellular mycobacteria, Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis (discovered&#xD;
      in 2008), preferentially affecting the skin and peripheral nervous system. The disease in&#xD;
      humans is potentially disabling and stigmatising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The modes of transmission of leprosy are not yet fully understood, although it is generally&#xD;
      accepted that the main mode of transmission is human-to-human. Apart from humans, the only&#xD;
      other major confirmed animal reservoir of M. leprae is the 9-banded armadillo Dasypus&#xD;
      novemcinctus, which is found only in the Americas. Recent studies in the southern United&#xD;
      States suggest transmission of M. leprae between D. novemcinctus and humans, where 64% of&#xD;
      human cases may be attributable to armadillos. Uncertainties remain regarding the zoonotic&#xD;
      nature of the disease outside the US and the precise mode of transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disease is endemic on the American continent where 92% of new cases come from Brazil. In&#xD;
      French Guiana - bordering Brazil - leprosy is still present and shows a tendency to&#xD;
      recrudesce with about 10 new cases per year. Armadillo consumption is frequent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The main objective of the present study is the genotyping of M. leprae strains&#xD;
      found in leprosy patients in French Guiana. The secondary objectives are to investigate the&#xD;
      presence of M. lepromatosis in these patients, the molecular research of M. leprae resistance&#xD;
      to anti-leprosy antibiotics, the study of risk factors for leprosy in humans in Guyana and in&#xD;
      particular direct or indirect contact with armadillos, as well as the determination of&#xD;
      phylogenetic links between the M. leprae strains found in French Guiana, and with the&#xD;
      regional and world reference strains Population and methods: A cross-sectional study will be&#xD;
      conducted on approximately 150 cases of leprosy diagnosed between 2006 and 2022 in French&#xD;
      Guyana, seen by the department's anti-leprosy service and for which a skin biopsy (or dermal&#xD;
      smear or nasal swab) is available. Genotyping of M. leprae and the search for antibiotic&#xD;
      resistance, as well as the search for M. lepromatosis will be carried out by molecular&#xD;
      biology. Human strains will be compared with environmental strains from French Guiana and&#xD;
      with reference strains found in humans and armadillos. A minimum-spanning-tree and maximum&#xD;
      parsimony analysis will be performed to determine the phylogenetic relationships between the&#xD;
      different strains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 3:1 matched case-control study will be conducted to assess risk factors for leprosy in&#xD;
      French Guiana. The 92 cases will be recruited from among leprosy cases diagnosed between 2006&#xD;
      and 2022 in French Guyana, seen by the departmental leprosy control. The 276 controls will be&#xD;
      recruited by dermatologists from the Cayenne hospital, throughout the territory, by matching&#xD;
      3 controls per case according to sex and age (Â± 5 years). A standardised exposure&#xD;
      questionnaire will be conducted face to face or by telephone. The search for leprosy risk&#xD;
      factors and in particular direct or indirect contact with armadillos (proximity / hunting /&#xD;
      handling / consumption) will be explored by univariate and then multivariate conditional&#xD;
      logistic regressions taking into account known potential confounding factors.&#xD;
