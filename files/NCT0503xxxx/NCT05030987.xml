  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction has a high mortality, which is contrasted by a&#xD;
      total absence of therapy options besides symptomatic diuretic treatment. This study aims to&#xD;
      explore the potential of renal denervation as a treatment option for heart failure with&#xD;
      preserved ejection fraction.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is one of the most important diseases worldwide, with a 5-year mortality of up&#xD;
      to 75% in symptomatic patients. While substantial progress has been made in the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF), mortality for patients with&#xD;
      heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) remains unchanged, despite a comparable&#xD;
      prevalence and mortality of the disease as for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HFpEF is a heterogeneous condition and has been a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for&#xD;
      clinicians and researchers over the past decades. While some rare cases of HFpEF can be&#xD;
      attributed to specific diseases like amyloidosis, in most other patients common&#xD;
      characteristics are increased ventricular filling pressures and ventricular and arterial&#xD;
      stiffening as frequently caused by ageing, diabetes and arterial hypertension. Furthermore,&#xD;
      increased sympathetic activity has been described as one pathogenic contributor to chronic&#xD;
      heart failure and is associated with poor clinical prognosis. It also leads to a more&#xD;
      pulsatile BP profile which can cause a mismatch in arterio-ventricular coupling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The modulating effects on the sympathetic nervous system induced by renal denervation (RDN)&#xD;
      should be beneficial in HFpEF, as they improve resting and exercise hemodynamics due to an&#xD;
      improved ventriculoarterial coupling by reduced aortic stiffness and lower systemic blood&#xD;
      pressure. In addition, RDN leads to optimized stroke volume and stroke work and might affect&#xD;
      cardiac preload by improving blood distribution into the splanchnic compartment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to explore the potential of RDN as a therapy for HFpEF in a single center&#xD;
      pilot trial using a randomized, sham-controlled double-blind design.&#xD;
