  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the hypothesis that early physiotherapy in patients hospitalized for COVID-19&#xD;
      improves their functional capacity, perceived quality of life and decreases anxiety. Our main&#xD;
      objective is to analyze the differences between groups with respect to functional&#xD;
      deterioration, need for oxygen therapy and anxiety when implementing an early physiotherapy&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a randomized clinical trial with two arms and single-center, to be developed in&#xD;
      hospitalization units and intermediate respiratory care units (IRCU), with patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with COVID. The sample will consist of an experimental group of 66 admitted patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19 to whom an early physiotherapy program will be implemented from 48-72 hours after&#xD;
      admission. The control group will be made up of another 66 admitted patients with COVID-19&#xD;
      who will receive the treatment according to the usual procedure of the hospital center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sociodemographic and clinical variables will be collected, including: modified MMRC dyspnea&#xD;
      scale, amount of oxygen therapy, MRC-SS, sit to stand test, hand grip, Tinetti, HADS anxiety&#xD;
      and depression questionnaire, SF-12 quality of life questionnaire, clinical frailty scale&#xD;
      (CFS) and FRAIL scale. Patients in both groups will be re-evaluated two months after hospital&#xD;
      discharge with the above variables in addition to the PCFS post-COVID patient functional&#xD;
      status scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A basic descriptive analysis and logistic regression will be performed to determine the&#xD;
      effect of the intervention.&#xD;

    <description>Patients in the intervention group will receive early physiotherapy treatment. This intervention will consist of exercises and physiotherapy techniques commonly used and aimed at improving the patient's respiratory and motor conditioning.&#xD;
At the respiratory level: diaphragmatic and costal targeted ventilation, pursed-lip breathing and bronchial hygiene techniques if required.&#xD;
At the motor level: passive, active-assisted kinesitherapy and analytical and global potentiation of the upper and lower limbs that will allow the maintenance and improvement of the articular pathway and will prevent muscle weakness; retraining of transfers and balance; gait reeducation.</description>
