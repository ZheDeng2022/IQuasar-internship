  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objectives: To examine the feasibility of conducting night-time home blood pressure(BP)&#xD;
      monitoring (during sleep) and titration of medications in the evening. This will provide data&#xD;
      for sample size calculation for the main trial, which will examine whether night-time BP is a&#xD;
      better target than conventional daytime BP for hypertension management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis to be tested: night-time home BP monitoring(HBPM) and evening drug titration are&#xD;
      acceptable to patients; and future main trial is feasible in terms of recruitment/dropout&#xD;
      rate/medication adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and subjects: This pilot randomized-controlled trial will recruit 78 patients with&#xD;
      nocturnal hypertension (asleep systolic BP 120mmHg on ambulatory blood pressure&#xD;
      monitoring(ABPM)). They will be allocated in 1:1 ratio to have their medication titrated in&#xD;
      the evening according to night HBPM (Experimental group) or in the morning according to&#xD;
      daytime HBPM (control group) respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments: ABPM/HBPM. Interventions: titration of the dose(s) of anti-hypertensive&#xD;
      medications in the evening according to night HBPM (experimental group) and in the morning&#xD;
      according to daytime HBPM (control group) every 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measures: ABPM at baseline and at 6 months Data analysis and expected results:&#xD;
      The rate of recruitment/dropout and adherence to night HBPM will be presented. The&#xD;
      feasibility of HBPM will be assessed by the patients' adherence to HBPM and by patients'&#xD;
      interviews. ANCOVA will be used to evaluate whether titration of medication can normalize BP&#xD;
      levels. We expect patients to have a high adherence rate and that titration of evening doses&#xD;
      of medications will better improve night-time BP on ABPM.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  diagnosed hypertension (HT) from clinical records&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  nocturnal HT (night-time systolic blood pressure (SBP) during sleep ≥120 mmHg) and&#xD;
             stage I hypertension (daytime SBP = 135-159mmHg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with atrial fibrillation (many home blood pressure (BP) machines are not&#xD;
             validated in these patients and these patients have greater BP variability)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  daytime office systolic BP ≥180 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥120 mmHg (regardless of&#xD;
             nocturnal BP) because these patients need urgent BP treatment and it is not known if&#xD;
             medications given in the evening are equally effective&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with known obstructive sleep apnoea because the night-time BP of these&#xD;
             patients is predominately affected by the sleep apnoea&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with known stroke, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, kidney failure,&#xD;
             peripheral vascular disease and diabetes mellitus because their daytime BP targets&#xD;
             will be different&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  dementia or psychiatric illness that impairs patients' ability to perform home blood&#xD;
             pressure monitoring (HBPM) by themselves&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with end-stage malignancies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  nocturnal worker, because they will have a reverse BP pattern to other participants&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients who sleep after 2am or wake up before 4am because these patients will not be&#xD;
             asleep during night HBPM&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients receiving ≥3 BP medications at maximal tolerated doses because there is&#xD;
             little space for drug titration and these patients may have secondary HT representing&#xD;
             another disease spectrum&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients receiving anti-coagulants because ABPM can induce significant bruises (during&#xD;
             repeated cuff inflations) in these patients.&#xD;
