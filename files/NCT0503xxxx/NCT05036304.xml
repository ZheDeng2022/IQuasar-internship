  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aerobic exercise is an evidence-based approach to mitigate cognitive decline in older adults&#xD;
      with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Emerging evidence suggests that the cognitive benefits&#xD;
      of exercise may be enhanced when performed in outdoor, natural settings, as compared to&#xD;
      indoor or built settings. Thus, the investigators aim to compare the effects of outdoor&#xD;
      versus indoor walking programs on cognitive function among older adults with MCI. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes are motor function, emotional well-being, health-related behaviours, and quality of&#xD;
      life. Participants will be randomly assigned to a 12--week, 3x/week program of either outdoor&#xD;
      walking on forest trails or indoor walking on a treadmill. A 3-month followup will also be&#xD;
      completed after trial completion.&#xD;

      Study Design: A 12-week, single-blinded, trial with two experimental arms. Participants will&#xD;
      be randomized (1:1) to either outdoor walking (OP) or indoor walking or cycling (IP).&#xD;
      Measurement will occur in person at baseline and at trial completion. Additionally, follow-up&#xD;
      measurement of questionnaire-based outcomes will occur via email or phone at 3 months&#xD;
      following trial completion. Outcome assessors will be trained by the research team and&#xD;
      blinded to group allocation of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: 68 community-dwelling adults aged 65-80 years old with probable MCI and in&#xD;
      sufficient health to participate in aerobic exercise of moderate intensity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional Arms: All participants will receive three group-based training sessions per&#xD;
      week for 12 weeks, under the supervision of instructors with a relevant background and first&#xD;
      aid certification. Each session will consist of 10 min of warm-up, 40 min of aerobic&#xD;
      exercise, and 10 min of cool-down. For both OP and IP, aerobic exercise will be progressive&#xD;
      and of moderate intensity. During training, each participant will wear a heart rate monitor&#xD;
      and will be asked to work initially at approximately 45% of their heart rate reserve (HRR)&#xD;
      and gradually progress to reach the target of 70% of HRR over the 12-week study period.&#xD;
      Participants will also subjectively monitor workout intensity using the 20-point Borg's&#xD;
      Rating of Perceived Exertion. OP participants will walk or jog a pre-determined route in&#xD;
      trails of an urban forest (Pacific Spirit Park). IP participants will walk or jog on&#xD;
      treadmills in the Exercise Prescription Suite of the Centre for Hip Health and Mobility&#xD;
      (CHHM). Both OP and IP training groups will have a participant to instructor ratio of 3:1. To&#xD;
      promote adherence to the exercise program, sessions will be offered at times that are&#xD;
      convenient for each individual participant. Protocols will be adjusted as necessary to align&#xD;
      with COVID-19 guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of descriptors and outcomes: Standardized protocols will be developed and study&#xD;
      personnel will be trained. Assessors will be blinded to treatment allocation. We will measure&#xD;
      descriptors and outcomes at baseline and at trial completion. Each measurement session will&#xD;
      be 2 hours in duration. For these measurements, participants will complete a session of&#xD;
      behavioural and clinical testing at the VCH Research Pavilion and the CHHM. To account for&#xD;
      time-of-day effects, each participant's session start time will be the same at both&#xD;
      timepoints, and the order of the assessments will be the same for all participants.&#xD;
