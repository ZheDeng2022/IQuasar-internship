  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed randomized controlled trial (RCT) is guided by the RE-AIM (i.e. reach, efficacy,&#xD;
      adoption, implementation, maintenance) framework and targets 244 adults from rural&#xD;
      Appalachia. The overall goal is to examine the efficacy of iSIPsmarter in a 2 group&#xD;
      [iSIPsmarter vs. static Patient Education (PE) website] by 4 assessment (Pre, 3-, 6- and&#xD;
      18-month follow-up) design. It is hypothesized that iSIPsmarter will be more efficacious at&#xD;
      reducing SSB consumption than a PE website at post assessment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB, e.g., soda/pop, sweet tea, sports and energy drinks, fruit&#xD;
      drinks) are the largest single food source of calories in the United States (US) diet and&#xD;
      contributes approximately 7% of total daily energy intake for US adults. Among Appalachian&#xD;
      adults, SSB intake is disproportionately high, averaging about 14% of total daily energy&#xD;
      intake. There are strong and consistent data documenting relationships among high SSB&#xD;
      consumption and numerous health issues such obesity, diabetes, some obesity-related cancers,&#xD;
      coronary heart disease, hypertension, and dental decay. Further compounding the SSB problem,&#xD;
      the Appalachian region lacks access to providers, medical services, and evidence-based&#xD;
      behavioral prevention programs. There is also limited data on technology-based behavioral&#xD;
      interventions in Appalachia. However, given recent progress in shrinking the digital divide,&#xD;
      the timing is optimal to evaluate technology-based behavioral interventions in this region.&#xD;
      The current proposal is designed to target this major SSB dietary risk factor and public&#xD;
      health challenge, as well as address notable gaps in the rural e/m-Health literature.&#xD;
      Importantly, this proposal builds on our team's e/m-Health intervention expertise and decade&#xD;
      of SSB behavioral intervention research in rural Appalachia. iSIPsmarter is a&#xD;
      technology-based behavioral and health literacy intervention targeting SSB reduction and&#xD;
      weight reduction/maintenance. It is comprised of six core Internet-delivered modules, an&#xD;
      integrated short message service (SMS) strategy to engage users in tracking SSB behaviors,&#xD;
      and a cellular enabled scale for in-home weight tracking. iSIPsmarter is a highly&#xD;
      interactive, structured, and self-guided program that uses strategies previously proven to&#xD;
      promote behavior change. iSIPsmarter also incorporates a stepped care approach to engage&#xD;
      users who struggle to complete components of the intervention. The proposed RCT is guided by&#xD;
      the RE-AIM framework and targets 244 adults from rural Appalachia. The overall goal is to&#xD;
      examine the efficacy of iSIPsmarter in a 2 group [iSIPsmarter vs. static Patient Education&#xD;
      (PE) website] by 4 assessment (Pre, 3-, 6- and 18-month follow-up) design. It is hypothesized&#xD;
      that iSIPsmarter will be more efficacious at reducing SSB consumption than a PE website at&#xD;
      post assessment. Changes in secondary outcomes (e.g. overall dietary quality, weight, quality&#xD;
      of life) and maintenance of outcomes at 6- and 18-months post intervention will also be&#xD;
      evaluated. Additional secondary aims include to examine reach and representativeness,&#xD;
      patterns of user engagement, and cost. Two tertiary aims include exploratory mediation&#xD;
      analyses and a systems-level, participatory process to understand context for future&#xD;
      organizational-level adoption of iSIPsmarter, and specifically to explore factors that would&#xD;
      promote or inhibit a sustainable SSB screening and referral process. The long-term goal of&#xD;
      this line of this research is to sustain an effective, scalable, and high reach behavioral&#xD;
      intervention to improve SSB behaviors and weight and to reduce SSB-related health inequities&#xD;
      and chronic conditions in rural Appalachia and beyond.&#xD;
