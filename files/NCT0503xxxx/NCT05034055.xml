  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation can induce immunogenic cell death, local release of inflammatory cytokines, and&#xD;
      damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) resulting in local effects on endothelial cell&#xD;
      expression of adhesion receptors, increased immune cell trafficking, and immune cell&#xD;
      activation. Dose, fractionation, and volume of radiation can influence immunologic effects in&#xD;
      the tumor microenvironment. Nonclinical studies suggest that despite an initial local&#xD;
      depletion of lymphocytes, hypofractionated regimens of radiation may be immune activating.&#xD;
      Additionally, recent work suggests that standard fractionation and hypofractionation induce&#xD;
      expansion of unique immune populations with standard fractionation favoring a myeloid&#xD;
      response and hypofractionation driving a lymphoid response that may be more favorable to&#xD;
      adaptive anti-tumor immunity. Compared to high doses of radiation, which induce immunogenic&#xD;
      cell death, dose-dependent increases of MHC-I and death receptors, moderate fractional doses&#xD;
      of 3-10 Gy may be optimal for activating a type I IFN response in tumor cells via a&#xD;
      dose-dependent increase in the cytoplasmic leakage of DNA from micronuclei, which activates&#xD;
      the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase/stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS/STING) pathway. Extensive&#xD;
      experimental evidence indicates that radiotherapy can work in synergy with immunotherapy to&#xD;
      generate T cells that reject not only the irradiated tumor but also the metastases outside of&#xD;
      the field of irradiation, which offers a rationale for utilizing radiotherapy to enhance&#xD;
      response to immunotherapy where tumors are unlikely to respond to immunotherapy alone.&#xD;
