  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a Phase 2/3 study that will determine the recommended dose of&#xD;
      mitapivat and evaluate the efficacy and safety of mitapivat in sickle cell disease by testing&#xD;
      how well mitapivat works compared to placebo to increase the amount of hemoglobin in the&#xD;
      blood and to reduce or prevent the occurrence of sickle cell pain crises. In addition, the&#xD;
      long-term effect of mitapivat on efficacy and safety will be explored in an open-label&#xD;
      extension portion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mitapivat is a small molecule, oral activator of pyruvate kinase R (PKR). PKR is involved&#xD;
      with maintaining health, energy, and longevity of red blood cells (RBCs). The study aims to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with mitapivat in participants with sickle cell&#xD;
      disease. The study is a Phase 2/3 study in which the recommended dose of mitapivat will be&#xD;
      selected and further evaluated. The Phase 2 portion includes a 12-week randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled period in which participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      receive 2 dose levels of mitapivat or placebo. The Phase 3 portion includes a 52-week&#xD;
      randomized, placebo-controlled period in which participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio&#xD;
      to receive the recommended mitapivat dose level or placebo. Participants who complete either&#xD;
      the Phase 2 or Phase 3 portion will have the option to move into a 216-week open label&#xD;
      extension period to receive mitapivat.&#xD;
