  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/IIA trial finds out the possible benefits and/or side effects of radiosurgery&#xD;
      before surgery (preoperative) in treating patients with high grade glioma. Radiosurgery uses&#xD;
      special equipment to position the patient and precisely give a single large dose of radiation&#xD;
      to the tumor. This method may kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and&#xD;
      cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving pre-operative radiosurgery may improve the odds of&#xD;
      brain tumor control and reduce treatment-related side effects.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety of preoperative radiosurgery in the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      biopsy-proven high grade glioma prior to conventional therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Acute clinical toxicity profile using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&#xD;
      (CTCAE) version 5 (defined as within 4 weeks of completion of postoperative radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Radiographic tumor control at 12 months following surgery (per Response Assessment in&#xD;
      Neuro-Oncology [RANO] criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Rate of pseudoprogression at first post radiation scan (RANO criteria). IV. Overall&#xD;
      survival at 12 months following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluation of the tumor repair pathways triggered by radiation, tumor vascular changes,&#xD;
      tumor microenvironment immune profiling, cell cultures, and the creation of orthotopic&#xD;
      xenograft models for future study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT A: Patients undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided stereotactic biopsy.&#xD;
      Patients then undergo radiosurgery over 1 fraction. Within 14 days, patients undergo surgery.&#xD;
      Within 4-6 weeks, patients then receive standard of care radiation therapy over 30 fraction&#xD;
      and temozolomide daily with or without tumor treating fields (TTF) at the discretion of the&#xD;
      treating neuro-oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT B: Patients undergo surgery. Within 4-6 weeks, patients then receive standard of care&#xD;
      radiation therapy over 30 fraction and temozolomide daily with or without TTF at the&#xD;
      discretion of the treating neuro-oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2-3 months for up to 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
