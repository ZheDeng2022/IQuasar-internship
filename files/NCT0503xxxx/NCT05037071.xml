      This study is designed to observe muscle oxygen saturation during intense video game using&#xD;
      gridlock training with and without upper arm compression sleeves.&#xD;

      A competitive esport player can perform up to 500-600 mouse and keyboard actions per minute&#xD;
      (APM) on a typical training day(1). A routine training day for a competitive esport player&#xD;
      can range from 5- 10 hours of play with no break (1). In comparison, office workers perform&#xD;
      an average of 130-180 keyboard and mouse inputs over the course of an 8 hour work day (2).&#xD;
      These APM's require sustained wrist extension in conjunction with repetitive forearm muscle&#xD;
      contractions in multiple planes, as well as shoulder stability and postural stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maneuvering a mouse and keyboard requires repeated contractions of the extensor carpi ulnaris&#xD;
      and extensor digitorum. With these fine motor demands, it is common for players to suffer&#xD;
      from acute and chronic overuse wrist and arm injuries (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle tissue oxygenation (Sm02) saturation is important to all athletic populations&#xD;
      including endurance athletes and power athletes. It's a marker of how efficient that muscle&#xD;
      is performing. A decrease in Sm02 indicates less ATP to that muscle and fatigue. Muscle&#xD;
      deoxygenation and reoxygenation has been studied in multiple athletic populations. In&#xD;
      competitive rock climbers, a lesser rate of deoxygenation of the finger and wrist extensor&#xD;
      muscles was related to a higher level of climbing ability (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of compression wear has expanded from clinical use into the sports market. The&#xD;
      recommendations to wear compression gear in athletes is based on improvement in venous blood&#xD;
      flow which improves exchange of fresh blood and blood waste. The research on its use on&#xD;
      improving running performance has been mixed. Anecdotally, in 2001 Allen Iverson of the&#xD;
      National Basketball Association (NBA) wore a compression arm sleeve to prevent swelling and&#xD;
      provide relief of bursitis in his elbow. Lebron James of the NBA and London marathon runner&#xD;
      Paul Radcliffe both swear by compression gear. In the 2016 Olympics, it was estimated that&#xD;
      90% of athletes used some form of compression performance gear. (5) The compression wear&#xD;
      sports industry market is a billion-dollar industry projected to be worth 3.96 billion&#xD;
      dollars by 2022.(5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Athletes in various sports wear compression garments with the assumption that it will improve&#xD;
      performance and facilitate muscle recovery. Most modern compression gear marketed toward&#xD;
      athletes use 'graduated compression'. This means that the highest amount of pressure is on&#xD;
      the most distal parts of your body (e.g ankles if you are using lower body compression) and&#xD;
      the pressure gradually reduces as it moves up toward your body. Compression wear varies in&#xD;
      pressure range. The measurement is measured in mmHg and light compression can range from&#xD;
      18-21 mmHg, moderate 23-32 mmHg, strong 34-46 mmHg and &gt; 49 mmHg very strong. (6) Most over&#xD;
      the counter athletic compression garments range from 18-21 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With esports literature in its infant stages, oxidative capacity of the finger and wrist&#xD;
      extensors during prolonged gaming have never been explored. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      compare changes in tissue oxygenation of the wrist extensor muscles with and without&#xD;
      graduated arm compression during competitive game play.&#xD;
