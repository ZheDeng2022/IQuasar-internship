  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite currently available treatment, a large proportion of patients with bipolar disorder&#xD;
      (BD) suffer from affective symptoms, impaired psychosocial and cognitive function.&#xD;
      Inflammation seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of BD and preliminary data suggest that&#xD;
      low-dose Aspirin may have beneficial effects. The objective of this RCT is to investigate&#xD;
      whether add on of low dose aspirin versus placebo add on to standard drug treatment improves&#xD;
      mood stabilisation and other critical patient outcomes in patients with BD and whether its&#xD;
      principal effects are antimanic, antidepressant or prophylactic against relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial will investigate whether augmentation with&#xD;
      low dose Aspirin to standard drug treatment improve mood stabilization.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BD is increasingly conceived as a multisystem disorder with pathophysiologic abnormalities&#xD;
      involving inflammation, oxidative stress imbalance, neurotrophic deficiencies and telomere&#xD;
      shortening. Specifically, inflammation has been confirmed to be involved in the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of BD. Emerging yet compelling data converge to suggest that aspirin may protect against the&#xD;
      onset and deterioration in BD. Nevertheless, a pragmatic large scale RCT is needed to for a&#xD;
      conclusive risk-benefit analysis of aspirin and to clarify its therapeutic role at the&#xD;
      different clinical stages of BD.The investigators propose to include smartphone-based&#xD;
      self-assessment of mood as the primary outcome measure in the RCT. Thus, during the last ten&#xD;
      years, the investigators have developed and tested a unique smartphone-based system, the&#xD;
      Monsenso system, for monitoring, diagnosing and treating BD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is designed as a two arm, parallel randomized trial with randomisation 1:1 to add&#xD;
      on of low dose aspirin (Hjertemagnyl 150 mg/day) versus add-on of placebo to current&#xD;
      treatment and with stratification according to age (&lt; 30 years) and gender. The trial is&#xD;
      planned and will be conducted in concordance with the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and&#xD;
      Elaboration: updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised trials. Patients will&#xD;
      be included from The Copenhagen Affective Disorder Clinic, which is a mood disorder clinic&#xD;
      providing treatment service for patients with newly diagnosed/first episode BD from the&#xD;
      entire Capital Region of Denmark covering a catchment area of 1.6 million people and all&#xD;
      psychiatric centres in the region. The Clinic receives more than 300 patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed BD each year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: Add on low dose aspirin versus placebo to standard drug treatment improves mood&#xD;
      stabilisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: Effects on mood stabilisation is higher in patients with increased inflammatory&#xD;
      marker levels at inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary: Low dose aspirin improves cognition.&#xD;
