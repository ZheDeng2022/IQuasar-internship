      years with a diagnosis of epidermolysis bullosa simplex, junctional epidermolysis bullosa,&#xD;
      Kindler syndrome.&#xD;

      Determination of sexual development in children with various types of inherited epidermolysis&#xD;
      bullosa using clinical, laboratory and instrumental methods for diagnosing the condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phenotyping of patients with inherited epidermolysis bullosa, taking into account their&#xD;
      physical and sexual development, indicators of self-attitude and socialization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of algorithms for individual care for patients with inherited epidermolysis&#xD;
      bullosa, including an assessment of the psychological state at different age stages (primary&#xD;
