  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for patients with early-disease esophageal and gastric&#xD;
      cancer. Open surgery for oesophageal cancer commonly involves large incisions in the chest,&#xD;
      which is associated with a high rate of respiratory complications in the postoperative&#xD;
      period. Patients with oesophageal or gastric cancer furthermore commonly present with&#xD;
      significant weight loss, affecting both muscle mass and muscle strength. This could further&#xD;
      decrease the physical fitness and increase the risk for experiencing complications after&#xD;
      treatment. Patients also report a decreased physical functioning in quality of life at least&#xD;
      3 years after surgery, suggesting this is a persistent deficit. Currently, no long-term data&#xD;
      is available assessing physical activity levels in oesophageal or gastric cancer survivors.&#xD;
      Thus, quantifying physical activity levels in these patients may identify the period in which&#xD;
      patients' activity levels are most likely to deteriorate. Activity levels will be assessed&#xD;
      from Google Location History from the patient's phone, providing summary of physical activity&#xD;
      over time. This information could be used in the future to provide adequate physical therapy&#xD;
      intervention which might improve recovery in several aspects, such as physical fitness but&#xD;
      also respiratory function and quality of life.&#xD;

      Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for patients diagnosed with early-disease esophageal and&#xD;
      gastric cancer. Open surgery for oesophageal cancer commonly involves large incisions in the&#xD;
      chest, which is associated with a high rate of respiratory complications in the postoperative&#xD;
      period. Several studies have shown that low physical activity levels are associated with&#xD;
      increased risk for respiratory complication. Furthermore, patients with oesophageal or&#xD;
      gastric cancer often present with significant weight loss, affecting both muscle mass and&#xD;
      muscle strength. This could further decrease the physical fitness and increase the risk for&#xD;
      experiencing complications after treatment. Moreover, open oesophagectomy involves&#xD;
      thoracotomy, thus impairing respiratory mechanics with further deterioration in physical&#xD;
      fitness. Patients also report a decreased physical functioning in quality of life at least 3&#xD;
      years after surgery, suggesting this is a persistent deficit. Currently, no long-term data is&#xD;
      available assessing physical activity levels in oesophageal or gastric cancer survivors.&#xD;
      Enhanced recovery programmes are evidence-based protocols aiming at early recovery after&#xD;
      surgery with early mobilisation and physiotherapy, and have been shown to reduce respiratory&#xD;
      complication rates. Thus, quantifying physical activity levels in these patients may identify&#xD;
      the period in which patients' activity levels are most likely to deteriorate and whether&#xD;
      these changes in physical activity are associated with changes in quality of life. Activity&#xD;
      levels will be assessed from Google Location History from the patient's phone, providing&#xD;
      summary of patterns of physical activity over time. This information could be used in the&#xD;
      future to provide adequate physical therapy intervention which might improve recovery in&#xD;
      several aspects, such as physical fitness but also respiratory function and quality of life.&#xD;
