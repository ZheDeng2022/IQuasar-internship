  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a highly prevalent and costly condition. Intermittent&#xD;
      claudication (IC), defined as ischemic leg pain that occurs with walking, results in&#xD;
      functional impairment, reduced daily physical activity, and a lower quality of life. Although&#xD;
      the mechanisms contributing to functional impairment are not fully delineated, current&#xD;
      evidence suggests that the uncoupling of skeletal muscle cellular metabolism from tissue&#xD;
      perfusion may be responsible for exercise intolerance. We have previously shown increases in&#xD;
      plasma inorganic nitrite, via oral nitrate, produced clinically significant increases&#xD;
      exercise performance in patients with PAD+IC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this proposal is in patients with PAD+IC, 3-6 days of oral dietary nitrate&#xD;
      consumption (in the form of concentrated beetroot juice) will produce a greater tissue&#xD;
      perfusion, oxygen delivery, and enhanced muscle metabolism in comparison to placebo. This&#xD;
      will translate into an increase in physical performance in both muscle specific plantar&#xD;
      flexion exercise and treadmill measures of pain free ambulation. In order to test this&#xD;
      hypothesis, we will recruit 10 patients PAD+IC in a randomized, double-blind, placebo&#xD;
      controlled, cross over design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) is characterised by blockages (occlusion or stenosis) in&#xD;
      the large arteries of the lower limbs. It is estimated that worldwide prevalence of PAD has&#xD;
      increased by 23.5% in the last decade and now affects 202 million people. PAD prevalence&#xD;
      increases with age from 5% of 45-49-year-old up to 19% in those &gt;70years old and smoking and&#xD;
      diabetes are causative factors. PAD is vastly understudied in comparison to cardiac or&#xD;
      cerebrovascular diseases. Intermittent claudication (IC) is the major clinical manifestation&#xD;
      of PAD and occurs when arterial occlusive disease reduces blood flow to the peripheral&#xD;
      vasculature during exercise. Among subjects with intermittent claudication from PAD, 1/3rd&#xD;
      have pain during light activity at home and an additional 1/3rd have pain walking a short&#xD;
      distance (one block). These patients suffer from a markedly impaired quality of life and a&#xD;
      high perception of disability. Increased pain free ambulation is a primary goal of therapy&#xD;
      for PAD as this is related to improved quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the ankle-brachial systolic blood pressure index (ABI) and limb blood flow testing&#xD;
      are used to diagnose PAD, most research studies fail to show a relationship between these&#xD;
      measures and functional capacity. Confounding the understanding of this disease is that&#xD;
      surgical revascularization, which improves blood flow, does not normalize exercise&#xD;
      performance and ambulation can be increased without changes in hemodynamics. Professor Allen&#xD;
      (PI) has previously shown increases in peak hyperemic leg blood flow with exercise training&#xD;
      but failed to find a relationship between these changes and increases in claudication onset&#xD;
      time (COT) and peak walk time (PWT). Professors Allen and Annex (Chief UVa Health System -&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Medicine) have also shown increases in gastrocnemius capillary density&#xD;
      following exercise training and a correlation with VO2peak. This suggests, in the presence of&#xD;
      conduit vessel stenosis, patients become more reliant on the microvasculature to distribute&#xD;
      available blood and oxygen to working tissues more efficiently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nitric Oxide (NO) is produced by the vascular endothelium and plays an important role in&#xD;
      vasodilation, flow regulation and platelet function. Disruptions in the production of NO have&#xD;
      been implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular disease. It was originally believed that the&#xD;
      bioactivity of NO was limited both temporally and spatially to the proximity of the vascular&#xD;
      endothelium where it was produced. It is now clear that several protected NO-derived species&#xD;
      may be transported through the vasculature to be released at critical areas of the&#xD;
      circulation, where it can influence macro- and micro-vascular tone and possibly vasculopathy.&#xD;
      Under normal conditions, this endocrine-like role is precisely controlled: whereby during&#xD;
      normoxia NO is conserved but under hypoxic conditions NO is liberated and can initiate&#xD;
      vasodilation. One potential therapeutic option involves the conversion of inorganic nitrate&#xD;
      (NO3-) and nitrite (NO2-) anions into NO (and other bioactive species). This is an attractive&#xD;
      approach, as it is biologically distinct from endothelial-NO synthase and can be achieved&#xD;
      easily via oral administration. Inorganic NO3- is abundant in green leafy vegetables, beets,&#xD;
      celery, lettuce, radishes and spinach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We were the first group to demonstrate acute increases in plasma NO2- concentration (using&#xD;
      beetroot juice containing 9mM NO3-), and increased walking performance in subjects with&#xD;
      PAD+IC. COT increased by 18% (32sec) and PWT by 17% (65sec). This is a clinically meaningful&#xD;
      and statistically significant increase for a disease state characterized by reduced physical&#xD;
      function and quality of life. There were no changes in ABI or endothelial function suggesting&#xD;
      no increase in endogenous vascular NO. The increases in performance were accompanied by a&#xD;
      reduction in fractional oxygen extraction at the working tissues, measured by near infra-red&#xD;
      spectroscopy (NIRS) suggesting increased perfusion to working tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have subsequently demonstrated that chronic dosing in combination with 36 sessions of&#xD;
      exercise training (EX+BR) also generated significant increases in pain free ambulation (COT)&#xD;
      and like-wise reductions in deoxyhemoglobin during exercise, when compared to an identical&#xD;
      exercise regimen coupled with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, while Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) data during a physiological challenge&#xD;
      is indicative, it is also relatively imprecise -NIRS measures only relative&#xD;
      oxygenation/deoxygenation for the whole tissue-bed. A much more precise non-invasive approach&#xD;
      has been developed by Professor Christopher Kramer (UVa Health System - Cardiovascular&#xD;
      Medicine, Noninvasive Cardiovascular Imaging) and Professor Craig H. Meyer (Department of&#xD;
      Biomedical Engineering) which utilizes Pulsed Arterial Spin Labelling (PASL) coupled with a&#xD;
      cuff occlusion or plantar flexion exercise stress test developed by Professor Arthur Weltman&#xD;
      (UVa - Department of Kinesiology). This allows for the creation of tissue perfusion maps and&#xD;
      differentiation between specific gastrocnemius muscle compartments in a spatial and&#xD;
      temporally resolved fashion. Additionally, we will employ Creatine Exchange Saturation&#xD;
      transfer (CrCEST) to measure PCr recovery kinetics after exhaustive exercise or until&#xD;
      subjects symptoms limit their exercise tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These techniques in combination will allow us to differentiate deficits in tissue perfusion&#xD;
      and metabolism (mitochondrial function) for specific compartments of the gastrocnemius muscle&#xD;
      before and after intervention. The sensitivity to detect changes following inorganic nitrate&#xD;
      (BR) supplementation was previously demonstrated in healthy subjects during severe exhaustive&#xD;
      exercise (which creates hypoxic conditions in the tissue bed analogous to those in patients&#xD;
      with PAD+IC during mild exercise). The participants on BR showed an increase in exercise&#xD;
      tolerance and a reduction in PCr depletion, suggesting changes in muscle metabolism/function.&#xD;
      However, the effect of BR on the metabolic responses and tissue perfusion during exhaustive&#xD;
      exercise in PAD patients has not been investigated to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this proposal is in patients with PAD+IC, 3-6 days of oral dietary nitrate&#xD;
      consumption (in the form of concentrated BR) will produce a greater tissue perfusion, oxygen&#xD;
      delivery, and enhanced muscle metabolism in comparison to placebo (PL). This will translate&#xD;
      into an increase in physical performance in both muscle specific planter flexion exercise and&#xD;
      treadmill measures of pain free ambulation. In order to test this hypothesis, the following&#xD;
      specific aims will recruit 24 PAD+IC patients in a randomized, double-blind, placebo&#xD;
      controlled, cross over design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To determine between treatment differences (BR v PL) in phosphocreatine recovery time&#xD;
      constant (PCr) measured by Creatine chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CrCREST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To determine between treatment differences (BR v PL) in peak exercise, maximal&#xD;
      hyperemia in different lower limb compartments (anterior, lateral, gastrocnemius, soleus and&#xD;
      deep compartments) by Pulsed Arterial Spin Labelling (PASL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. To determine relations in between treatment changes in walking performance COT and PWT&#xD;
      and lower limb compartmental perfusion characteristics (Aim 2) and phosphocreatine recover&#xD;
      kinetics (Aim 1).&#xD;
