  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an imaging study designed to illuminate the function of the cholinergic system and&#xD;
      its association with cognitive skills in people with Parkinson's disease. The hypothesis of&#xD;
      this study is that there will be an association between cholinergic terminal density, sex&#xD;
      hormones, and cognitive functioning. Participants will receive a PET and MRI scan along with&#xD;
      a battery of neurocognitive tests at baseline and again at 18 months follow-up. Hormone&#xD;
      levels will be measured at baseline.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an imaging study designed to illuminate the functioning of the cholinergic system in&#xD;
      people with Parkinson's disease. Some people with Parkinson's disease develop trouble with&#xD;
      certain aspects of thinking such as memory. Studies have shown an association between a&#xD;
      decline in thinking skills and dysfunction of the cholinergic system. This study will use the&#xD;
      novel PET tracer [18F]VAT to provide more specific information about how the cholinergic&#xD;
      system works by enabling direct measurement of cholinergic terminal density and projections.&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that there will be an association between cholinergic&#xD;
      terminal density, sex hormones, and cognitive functioning. This is a longitudinal&#xD;
      observational study that involves a screening visit and four study visits over the course of&#xD;
      18 months. The visits consist of neurocognitive assessments and imaging (MRI and PET scans)&#xD;
      administered at baseline and at 18 months follow-up. Hormone levels will also be measured at&#xD;
      baseline. This study is open to people with Parkinson's disease who have either normal&#xD;
      cognition or mild cognitive impairment.&#xD;

    <description>As measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The MoCA measures eight domains commonly affected by mild cognitive impairment. The one-page 30-point test includes assessments of short-term and delayed memory recall, visuospatial abilities, language, orientation to time and space, and executive functions including attention, concentration, and working memory. The MoCA has been shown to be sensitive to change over time. Scores on the MocA range from 0-30 with higher scores indicating better cognitive functioning.</description>
