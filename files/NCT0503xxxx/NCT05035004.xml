    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effects of post moderate intensity aerobic exercise hot water&#xD;
      immersion on physiological and perceptual responses in physically inactive middle-aged adults&#xD;
      when compared to moderate intensity aerobic exercise and hot water immersion alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A large number of middle aged adults do not achieve the minimum recommended amount of&#xD;
      physical activity. This consequently increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and&#xD;
      all-cause mortality. Although below the recommended physical activity guidelines, it is&#xD;
      important to highlight that a considerable proportion of these individuals do take part in&#xD;
      some form of physical activity within their weekly routines. Hence, identifying complementary&#xD;
      therapies that can enhance the health benefits from smaller amounts of exercise are of great&#xD;
      value for many physically inactive middle-aged adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An in increase in body temperature from a single session of passive heating has been shown to&#xD;
      mimic many of the beneficial physiological responses of exercise, such as, an increase in&#xD;
      heart rate, skin blood flow and an increase in circulating angiogenic factors. However, lab&#xD;
      based studies often push participants to the limit of thermal tolerance which may reduce long&#xD;
      term adherence in the real world. Therefore, this study will investigate whether the use of&#xD;
      post exercise hot water immersion can prolong and / or intensify exercise mediated&#xD;
      physiological responses that underpin health benefits, whilst also assessing the perceptual&#xD;
      responses, in comparison to exercise and hot water immersion alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through the use of a repeated measures design, participants will randomly take part in three&#xD;
      conditions; 1) post exercise hot water immersion (30 minutes of moderate intensity cycling&#xD;
      followed by 10 minutes of supine rest and 30 minutes of whole body hot water immersion at&#xD;
      40°C); 2) aerobic exercise (30 minutes of moderate intensity cycling followed by 10 minutes&#xD;
      of supine rest and 30 minutes of seated rest at room temperature); 3) hot water immersion&#xD;
      condition (30 minutes of whole body hot water immersion at 40°C followed by 10 minutes of&#xD;
      supine rest and 30 minutes of whole body hot water immersion at 40°C). Each condition will be&#xD;
      separated by a minimum of 1-week. Outcome measures will either be assessed at regular&#xD;
      intervals or at 0, 30, 70 and 100 minute time points for each condition.&#xD;
