    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of iNexin™ The&#xD;
      secondary objective is to compare the efficacy of iNexin™ to Vehicle for the treatment of the&#xD;
      signs and symptoms associated with dry eye disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical hypothesis for this study is that iNexin™ demonstrates safety and tolerability&#xD;
      in subjects with DED and can be evaluated for further safety and efficacy measures compared&#xD;
      to vehicle. This is a Phase 1b single-center, randomized, double masked, vehicle controlled&#xD;
      clinical study to assess the safety and exploratory efficacy of iNexin™ compared to vehicle&#xD;
      in subjects with Dry Eye Disease. A total of 36 subjects, at least 18 years of age, with a&#xD;
      subject-reported history of DED in both eyes and meeting all other study eligibility criteria&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive treatment with iNexin™ or vehicle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An individual subject's participation time is expected to be approximately 24 days. 36&#xD;
      eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 allocation for each of three concentrations of&#xD;
      iNexin™ to Vehicle, to be administered bilaterally BID for 15 days (from Visit 2 to the&#xD;
      evening of Visit 4). There will also be a 1-day post-final dose follow-up visit (Visit 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a 7-day study run-in period prior to randomization (from Visit 1 to the evening before&#xD;
      Visit 2), all subjects will receive Vehicle eye drops (Vehicle) bilaterally at the same&#xD;
      dosing frequency as iNexin™ (BID).&#xD;
