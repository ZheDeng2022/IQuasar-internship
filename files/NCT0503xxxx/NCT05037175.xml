  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a pressing need to increase capacity to treat PTSD related to or exacerbated by the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic. Texting-based therapy holds promise to increase capacity and reduce&#xD;
      barriers to delivering evidence-based treatments (EBTs), but ongoing engagement in digital&#xD;
      mental health interventions is low. This study will compare a texting-based EBT for PTSD to&#xD;
      texting-based treatment as usual, and it will also compare a unique incentive strategy to&#xD;
      typical platform reminders aimed to prevent early discontinuation in therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated mental health challenges for trauma-exposed individuals&#xD;
      due to increased isolation, insufficient capacity in the mental health workforce, and a&#xD;
      predicted fourth wave of mental health impacts of the pandemic itself. There is a pressing&#xD;
      need to increase treatment capacity. Digital mental health (DMH) interventions for&#xD;
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) address well-documented barriers to traditional&#xD;
      in-person psychotherapy or telehealth delivery of evidence-based treatments (EBTs) for PTSD,&#xD;
      but many consumers do not remain engaged. Thus, acceptable, efficient, and engaging forms of&#xD;
      EBTs are sorely needed, particularly for those who are less likely to access traditional&#xD;
      psychotherapy or use online programs. Asynchronous texting therapy platforms may facilitate&#xD;
      treatment engagement among those who seek discrete, convenient, and affordable support. In&#xD;
      our pilot of a texting-based format of an EBT for PTSD, Cognitive Processing Therapy&#xD;
      (CPT-Text), we found CPT-Text was feasible to deliver, and clients showed substantially&#xD;
      greater PTSD symptom improvement over a shorter time compared to text therapy as usual (TAU).&#xD;
      A larger scale, more rigorous test is necessary. We propose a randomized, Hybrid Type 1,&#xD;
      effectiveness-implementation trial with a factorial design to compare text-based therapies&#xD;
      for PTSD utilizing the HIPAA-compliant secure texting platform of our DMH partner, Talkspace.&#xD;
      We will randomize participants (N= 400) who have PTSD that is related to or has been&#xD;
      exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic into CPT-Text or text-based TAU. Participants will also&#xD;
      be randomized into one of two engagement strategies: therapist reminder as usual (RAU) or RAU&#xD;
      + incentive (RI). We will examine an innovative incentive structure in which participants who&#xD;
      remain engaged in the intervention will have the option of retaining their introductory&#xD;
      discount or donating it to individuals in need of financial support. We will compare the&#xD;
      impact of engagement strategy on treatment response and engagement, and we will examine&#xD;
      motivation as a potential mechanism. We also will evaluate a novel Natural Language&#xD;
      Processing (NLP) approach to assessing CPT-Text fidelity. This study will (1) provide&#xD;
      critical information about how to promote sustained DMH engagement using unique incentive&#xD;
      strategies and moderators of engagement and outcomes and (2) offer first guidance on&#xD;
      supporting quality and fidelity of messaging-based EBTs using NLP.&#xD;

    <measure>PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) is a 20-item self-report measure that evaluates the degree to which individuals have been bothered by PTSD symptoms tied to their most currently distressing event [114] . The monthly version will be administered at baseline and the weekly version thereafter.</description>

    <description>The PHQ-9 [115,116] is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders that will be administered on the schedule outlined in the table. The PHQ-9 is the 9-item depression module and is a multipurpose instrument for screening, diagnosing, monitoring, and measuring the severity of depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavioral Intention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Behavioral Intention (BI; which captures motivation to engage in a behavior) will be measured to examine patterns of motivation in our treatment conditions and to investigate BI as the hypothesized mechanism of change in engagement. BI measures are created based on recommendations for constructing a very brief BI measure, a frequent approach to measuring this construct, which has demonstrated reliability [119-123] . Participants will be asked, &quot;How likely or unlikely are you to complete (baseline) or continue (mid-treatment) treatment?&quot; on a 7-item Likert scale ranging from &quot;Extremely Unlikely&quot; to &quot;Extremely Likely&quot; at the baseline and both mid-treatment assessments.</description>

    <description>CPT is a 12-session, trauma-focused, cognitive therapy that teaches clients to examine and change problematic beliefs about themselves and the world that were altered as a result of trauma. Each session includes psychoeducation and introduction of a new skill or module, which builds on the previous information and skills. Participants will receive psychoeducation video links via Talkspace and an electronic workbook with handouts, written explanations of the concepts and activities, and CPT worksheets, which will be embedded in the platform and sent by the therapist at the appropriate point in the protocol. Therapists encourage the client to complete each module using the provided materials and assist clients in reflecting on their beliefs through Socratic questions and feedback on their worksheets [5,6]. Clients work at their own pace, with therapists sending the skill or module after the client has practiced the previous one.</description>

If client participants do not re-engage after 24 hours from the RAU (3 days without engagement), they will receive an automated text-message reminding them to message their therapist regularly (on average, every other business day) in order to get their 30% discount in the next month. They can choose to use the incentive themselves or donate it to Talkspace's assistance fund, which provides free therapy to individuals who demonstrate financial need.</description>
