  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, single-arm, multicenter, phase 2 clinical trial. Eligible&#xD;
      patients are with previously untreated gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      as defined by cT2-4 and/or cN+ without evidence of metastatic disease. Study treatment in&#xD;
      this study is neoadjuvant treatment with the investigational drug, T-DXd alone, followed by&#xD;
      surgery. T-DXd will be administered at a dose of 6.4 mg/kg (decimal) by intravenous infusion&#xD;
      every 21 days (3 weeks) for 3 cycles as the neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analyses will be performed on the following 2 cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction cancer with HER2 overexpression (IHC3+, or&#xD;
           IHC2+ and ISH positive [FISH or DISH]) (Primary cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer patients with HER2 low expression (IHC1+, or&#xD;
           IHC2+ and ISH-negative [FISH or DISH]) and HER2-ECD &gt; 11.6 ng/mL (Exploratory cohort)&#xD;
