      Rationale: The humoral and cellular immune response after two mRNA vaccinations is severely&#xD;
      attenuated in kidney transplant patients compared to controls, especially when their&#xD;
      immunosuppressive regimen contains mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) / mycophenolic acid (MPA). A&#xD;
      booster strategy is therefore required to improve the efficacy of vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To investigate the immunogenicity of booster SARS-CoV-2 vaccination strategies in&#xD;
      kidney transplant patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Prospective, multicentre, open-label randomized clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Kidney transplant patients who did not sero-convert after two doses (100&#xD;
      μg, i.m.) of the mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Moderna).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  stratum A: patients receiving triple immunosuppressive therapy, consisting of a&#xD;
           calcineurin inhibitor, MMF/MPA, and steroids&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A1: Third dose (100 μg, i.m) of the mRNA-1273 vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A2: Third dose (100 μg, i.m) of the mRNA-1273 vaccine with discontinuation&#xD;
                discontinuation of MMF/MPA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  stratum B: patients receiving any combination of immunosuppressive drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  B1: third dose (100 μg, i.m) of the mRNA-1273 vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  B2: two single doses of mRNA-1273 into the left and the right upper arm (2 x 100&#xD;
                μg, i.m; B2)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  B3: Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (Janssen, 5x1010 viral particles, i.m; B3).&#xD;

      2. OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the immunogenicity (expressed as percentage of responders) of various COVID-19&#xD;
      booster vaccination strategies in kidney transplant patients that failed to mount a&#xD;
      sufficient antibody response after two primary doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-specific IgG antibodies in serum at&#xD;
           28 days after the 3rd vaccine administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the durability of the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-specific IgG antibody response at 6&#xD;
           and 12 months after the 3rd vaccine administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the presence and titer of neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after&#xD;
           booster vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure anti-S1 antibody (IgG and IgA) responses and neutralizing capacity of these&#xD;
           antibodies in nasal mucosal fluid&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate vaccine safety in terms of incidence of solicited local and systemic adverse&#xD;
           events (AEs) graded according to severity, including the incidence of acute rejections&#xD;
           within 6 months after the third vaccination .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the association between baseline clinical and immunological parameters and the&#xD;
           immune response to booster vaccinations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate RNA-seq data at one week after vaccination to the subsequent antibody and T&#xD;
           cell response&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcome of COVID-19 disease during&#xD;
           12 months after the 3rd vaccine administration by questionnaire and by measurement of&#xD;
           SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid-specific antibodies&#xD;
&#xD;
           3. STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, multicentre, open-label, randomized study to evaluate the&#xD;
      immunogenicity and safety of various booster vaccination strategies in kidney transplant&#xD;
      patients without a sufficient antibody response after two doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The four participating study sites are: Amsterdam UMC, ErasmusMC, Radboudumc and UMCG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on their immunosuppressive treatment, patients will participate in one of the following&#xD;
      strata:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  stratum A: patients treated with triple immunosuppressive therapy consisting of a&#xD;
           calcineurin inhibitor, MMF/MPA, and steroids,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  stratum B: patients treated with any combination of immunosuppressive drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In stratum A, patients will be randomized to one of two booster strategies::&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A1: 3rd dose of mRNA-1273 (100 μg, i.m)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A2: 3rd dose of mRNA-1273 (100 μg, i.m), with temporary discontinuation of MMF/MPA&#xD;
           during one week before and one week after the 3rd dose&#xD;
&#xD;
      In stratum B, patients will be randomized to one of three booster strategies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  B1: 3rd dose of mRNA-1273 (100 μg, i.m)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  B2: 3rd dose of mRNA-1273 (100 μg, i.m) in both upper arms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  B3: Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (Janssen, 5x1010 viral particles i.m.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the immune response after vaccination, blood samples will be collected at baseline&#xD;
      (i.e. prior to third dose administration), at 28 days, and at 6 and 12 months after the third&#xD;
      dose administration. A complete blood count, kidney function, and liver enzymes will be&#xD;
      determined at the same time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a subset of patients we will collect a blood sample at 1 week after the booster&#xD;
      administration for specific immunological assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For safety reasons, a blood sample will be collected in stratum A at one and two weeks after&#xD;
      discontinuing MMF/MPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum volume of blood collected for this study is 62.5 mL per timepoint, and no more&#xD;
      than 200 mL for the one year study period, which is well within the safe limits of blood&#xD;
      collection for clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasal mucosal lining fluid (MLF) will be collected for assessment of secreted mucosal&#xD;
      antibodies at the same time points used to collect blood. MLF will be collected by use of&#xD;
      soft synthetic absorptive matrix (SAM) strips, which are gently inserted into one nostril of&#xD;
      the participant and placed along the surface of the inferior turbinate. The index finger is&#xD;
      then lightly pressed against the side of the nostril to keep the SAM strip in place and to&#xD;
      allow MLF absorption for 60 seconds (see Figure), after which the SAM strip is placed back in&#xD;
      the protective plastic tube. The procedure may tickle slightly but is completely painless.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The occurrence of acute rejection and COVID-19 will be monitored during 6 and 12 months after&#xD;
      the third vaccine administration, respectively. To evaluate vaccination related AEs, patients&#xD;
      will be asked to collect solicited local and systemic AEs for 7 days after each vaccination&#xD;
      using a questionnaire, as vaccination related AEs are mainly expected in the first week after&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
