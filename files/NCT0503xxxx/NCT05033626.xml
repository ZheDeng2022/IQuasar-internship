      Simultaneous operations on the thyroid gland and hyoid suspension in patients with combined&#xD;
      thyroid pathology and moderate to severe OSA.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ineffectiveness of conservative treatment of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS)&#xD;
      (CPAP-therapy) or its rejection leads to a surgical solution of the issue, the purpose of&#xD;
      which is to eliminate obvious anatomical obstacles, to increase the lumen of the upper&#xD;
      respiratory tract. Modern methods of multilevel surgical treatment of OSAS make it possible&#xD;
      to achieve more than 80% success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most often, at the first stage of OSAS treatment, otorhinolaryngologists use rhinosurgical&#xD;
      techniques such as septoplasty, lower submucosal vasotomy, partial conchotomy, removal of&#xD;
      nasal polyps, including using endoscopic techniques. At the subsequent stages of multilevel&#xD;
      treatment, depending on the level of obstruction and the severity of OSAS, uvulopalatoplasty&#xD;
      or uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, partial resection of the tongue or lingual tonsil, suspension&#xD;
      of the tongue root and sublingual system, various types of genioplasty and maxillary&#xD;
      reduction are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This approach allows expanding the airways in the oropharyngeal region and laryngopharynx,&#xD;
      improving functional outcomes and quality of life in patients with OSAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, first of all, it is necessary to carefully assess the benefits and&#xD;
      potential risks of surgical treatment, especially in patients with an unfavorable morbid&#xD;
      background and from older age groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • The investigators will offer patients with concomitant thyroid pathology and moderate or&#xD;
      severe OSAS to perform simultaneous operations from one access, where the hyoid bone to the&#xD;
      thyroid cartilage will be sutured in the second stage. The stabilization of the hyoid bone&#xD;
      and the muscular frame, as an integral complex of the laryngopharynx, increases the airway&#xD;
      space and neutralizes obstruction. (1-3) Under endotracheal anesthesia, a horizontal skin&#xD;
      incision up to 5 cm long is made at the level of the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage, the&#xD;
      skin and subcutaneous fat are dissected. The sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles are&#xD;
      retracted. An audit of the thyroid gland is performed. Step by step, using the ultrasonic&#xD;
      dissector, the sections of the gland necessary for resection are separated, ligated, and&#xD;
      transected. The vessels of the upper and lower poles are separated with the preservation of&#xD;
      blood supply to the right and left upper and lower parathyroid glands. Using a microsurgical&#xD;
      technique, neurolysis of the recurrent laryngeal nerves is performed. The control of the&#xD;
      integrity of the recurrent laryngeal nerves was performed using the neuromonitoring&#xD;
      apparatus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hyoid bone is mobilized in the anterocaudal direction and is fixed to the thyroid&#xD;
      cartilage with four permanent non-absorbable sutures. If sufficient mobilization does not&#xD;
      occur during the operation, the tendon of the stylohyoid muscle is dissected. Surgical&#xD;
      drainage is installed 24 hours after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advantages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  access from one incision with combined pathology of the thyroid gland and OSAS which&#xD;
           reduces the need for delayed operations;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  decrease in apnea hypopnea index (AHI) to 50.7% and subjective daytime sleepiness&#xD;
           according to foreign literature.&#xD;

    <description>There are five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, and extreme problems. Patients choice results into a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension.

    <measure>Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, Day 30 and Day 60</time_frame>
    <description>Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is the total number of episodes of complete or partial cessation of breathing during one hour of sleep (with polysomnography or cardiorespiratory monitoring). AHI is used to assess the severity of OSAS. Calculated using the formula: (number of apnea episodes + number of hypopnea episodes) / sleep or study time.&#xD;
AHI &lt;5 is considered the norm. Average degree of OSAS 15≤IAG &lt;30. Severe AHI ≥30. A decrease in the indicator shows an improvement in OSAS during treatment.</description>

    <description>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is a scale for measuring daytime sleepiness using a questionnaire. Helpful in diagnosing sleep disorders.&#xD;
Subjects are asked to rate the likelihood of falling asleep on a scale of increasing probability from 0 to 3 for various situations they encounter in everyday life. The scores for the eight questions are added to form a single number. A number in the range of 0-9 is considered normal, while a number in the range of 10-24 indicates that you should seek professional advice.</description>

    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a questionnaire that assesses sleep quality over a 1 month time frame. It consists of 19 individual elements, making up 7 components that give one overall rating. Each item is weighted on a scale from 0 to 3. The overall PSQI score is then calculated by adding the scores of the seven components to give an overall score of 0 to 21, where lower scores mean healthier sleep quality.</description>

    <measure>The intensity of pain assesment</measure>
    <time_frame>On the day of surgery, 2 days after the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The intensity of pain is quantified using Verbal Rating Scale. The following scale of verbal assessments is applied: 0 - no pain, 1 point - mild, 2 - moderate, 3 - strong, 4 points - very strong and 5 points - unbearable pain.</description>
