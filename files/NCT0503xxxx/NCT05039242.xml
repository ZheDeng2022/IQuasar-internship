      The aim of this research is to compare the effects of I-shape and fan shape kinesiotape&#xD;
      techniques on pain, range of motion, grip strength and ADLs of patients with Rheumatoid&#xD;
      Arthritis. Randomized controlled trials done at Pain Clinic, Rawalpindi and Fauji Foundation&#xD;
      Hospital, Rawalpindi. The sample size was 66. The subjects were divided in three groups, 22&#xD;
      subjects in control group receiving conventional physical therapy treatment, 22 subjects in&#xD;
      second group with I-Band application of kinesiotaping and 22 in the third group with&#xD;
      fan-shaped application of kinesiotaping. Study duration was of 6 months. Sampling technique&#xD;
      applied was non-probability convenience sampling. Only 25-50 years symptomatic female&#xD;
      patients with established RA were included. Tools used in the study are Michigan Hand Outcome&#xD;
      Questionnaire (MHQ), Numeric Pain Raiting Scale, Dynamometer and Goniometer. Data was be&#xD;
      analyzed through SPSS 21.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune systemic condition characterized by joint inflammation&#xD;
      and extra-articular erosions. The symptoms of RA usually progress with age from mild to&#xD;
      severe. The progression can either occur insidiously over a period of months or it can occur&#xD;
      in weeks or overnight. RA with symptoms lasting less than six months is called as &quot;early&quot;,&#xD;
      while with symptoms lasting longer than this is known as &quot;established&quot;. RA has significant&#xD;
      direct costs, such as health-care costs, as well as indirect costs, such as lost income due&#xD;
      to morbidity and reduced life expectancy. In the urban population of southern Pakistan,&#xD;
      Karachi, the prevalence of RA is reported to be 0.142%, whereas in northern Pakistan the&#xD;
      estimated prevalence is 0.55%. In 2014, the overall age-adjusted prevalence of RA ranged from&#xD;
      0.53 to 0.55% (0.29-0.31% for males and 0.73-0.78% for females). In general, rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis preferentially affects women with female to male ratio of about 3:1; however,&#xD;
      patients with above 60 years of age have equal female to male ratio. The most prevalent age&#xD;
      is 45-60 years. The disease severity increases with increase in the age and reaches to its&#xD;
      peak in above 60 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The joints of hand affected by of RA include polyarthritis of small joints like proximal&#xD;
      interphalengeal (PIP), metacarpophalengeal (MCP) joints, wrist and metatarsophalangeal (MTP)&#xD;
      joints. Patients experience morning stiffness in these joints which lasts unto several hours.&#xD;
      The signs on examination involves swelling, stiffness, tenderness over the affected joints,&#xD;
      decreased range of motion and deformity like; trigger finger, boutonniere and swan neck&#xD;
      deformity. These signs results in loss of function and mobility. Moreover, the progression of&#xD;
      RA occurs in four stages. Stage 1 has no destructive changes on x-ray, stage 2 shows&#xD;
      periarticular osteoporosis and subchondral bone destruction on x-ray with no joint deformity,&#xD;
      stage 3 reveals periarticular osteoporosis with cartilage and bone destruction on x-ray and&#xD;
      significant joint deformity and stage 4 proceeds with stage 3 with the addition of bony and&#xD;
      fibrous ankylosis Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic, incurable disease. All of the currently&#xD;
      known treatments are aimed at alleviating symptoms and increasing quality of life. Treatments&#xD;
      aim to relieve pain and decrease the progression of RA in order to prevent disability and&#xD;
      improve functional capability . The four most common components of Physical therapy for RA&#xD;
      hands are exercise therapy, joint protection advice and provision of functional splinting and&#xD;
      assistive devices, massage therapy and patient education. Exercise therapy includes ROM&#xD;
      exercises, aerobic exercise and stabilization/coordination exercises. Joint protection&#xD;
      includes rest and splinting that uses orthosis to prevent the development of deformities and&#xD;
      support joints. Massage therapy involves manual trigger of an articular movement focused on&#xD;
      the improvement of function, pain reduction, reduction of disease activity improve&#xD;
      flexibility and welfare (dimension of depression, anxiety, mood and pain). Patient education&#xD;
      is done to inform them about their disease and the various therapies available to help them&#xD;
      live a better life. Additional interventional strategies include application of cold therapy,&#xD;
      heat therapy, Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) and hydrotherapy exercises&#xD;
      are also beneficial as they induce minimal loads on the joints during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2016 Sarah Roberts et al conducted an RCT in order to check the effects of kinesio tape on&#xD;
      pain and metacarpophalengeal joints of hands in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the&#xD;
      results revealed significant reduction in pain, improvement in ROM and enhanced grip strength&#xD;
      in work and ADLs. Another study in 2016 conducted by Vilija Zebrauskaite et al in their study&#xD;
      about the additive effects of kinesiotape for physiotherapy of patients with rheumatoid hand&#xD;
      to correct to ulnar positioning of hand and improve hand function. The results were&#xD;
      significantly positive with the hand function improved considerably in comparison with the&#xD;
      group receiving only physiotherapy exercises. In 2019 Majid Farhadian et al conducted an RCT&#xD;
      to investigate the effects of kinesio tape on pain, range of motion, hand strength and&#xD;
      functional abilities in patients with hand osteoarthritis. The findings of this study&#xD;
      revealed that Kinesio taping and hand training may help patients with HOA improve their&#xD;
      discomfort, range of motion, hand strength, and upper-extremity functional capacities.&#xD;
      Furthermore, these two approaches can be utilised in conjunction for the treatment of this&#xD;
      illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The previous studies have shown the positive effects of kinesiotape on hand functions of&#xD;
      patients with RA. Since kinesiotape has vast variety of application techniques, and in order&#xD;
      to determine the effectiveness of each application technique, current study is going to be&#xD;
      conducted to compare the effects of I strip application technique and fan cut or web strip&#xD;
      application technique.&#xD;
