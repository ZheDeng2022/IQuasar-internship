      This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study&#xD;
      designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FlecIH-103 (flecainide acetate inhalation&#xD;
      solution) compared with placebo in patients with recent-onset, symptomatic newly diagnosed or&#xD;
      paroxysmal AF. Approximately 400 patients are expected to be enrolled in this study. Patients&#xD;
      will be randomized 3:1 to receive FlecIH-103 at a total dose of up to 120 mg estimated total&#xD;
      lung dose (eTLD) (n=300) or placebo inhalation solution (n=100). Randomization will be&#xD;
      stratified by geographic region (US and ex-US) and duration of symptoms of the current AF&#xD;
      episode (≥1 hour to ≤24 hours and &gt;24 hours to ≤48 hours).&#xD;

      This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study&#xD;
      designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FlecIH-103 (flecainide acetate inhalation&#xD;
      solution) compared with placebo in patients with recent-onset, symptomatic newly diagnosed or&#xD;
      paroxysmal AF. Approximately 400 patients are expected to be enrolled in this study. The&#xD;
      study will consist of the following periods: Screening, Observation, and Follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Screening Period comprises the time from the patient signing informed consent to the time&#xD;
      of randomization. Screening begins at least 45 minutes prior to dosing and may be extended as&#xD;
      needed due to site logistics. During screening, the patient will be evaluated for study&#xD;
      eligibility, have a standard triplicate 12-lead ECG to confirm the diagnosis of AF, have a&#xD;
      single-lead patch electrode applied for continuous ECG (cECG) recording, undergo a targeted&#xD;
      physical examination (including cardiovascular and respiratory systems), have blood drawn for&#xD;
      laboratory assessments and a predose pharmacokinetic (PK) sample, have their AF-related&#xD;
      symptoms assessed, have vital signs assessed periodically, and be monitored via telemetry to&#xD;
      ensure they remain predominantly in AF prior to dosing (ie, no period of SR ≥1 minute in&#xD;
      duration or any abnormal rhythm other than AF). After confirmation that the patient meets all&#xD;
      applicable eligibility criteria, randomization will take place using a central randomization&#xD;
      system. The patient is considered enrolled at the time of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Observation Period comprises the time from randomization through 90 minutes after&#xD;
      initiation of dosing. After randomization and just prior to the start of dosing (T0), the&#xD;
      patient's AF will again be confirmed by a standard triplicate 12-lead ECG; patients who are&#xD;
      not in AF at this time must be withdrawn. The patient will inhale the study drug until&#xD;
      conversion of AF to SR occurs for ≥1 minute or the complete dose is administered, whichever&#xD;
      occurs first. The complete dose of study drug comprises 2 separate 3.5-minute inhalations&#xD;
      separated by a 1-minute break. Telemetric recording of ECG and cECG monitoring will continue&#xD;
      and vital signs will be monitored periodically. A PK sample will be collected 2 minutes after&#xD;
      completion of dosing followed by another standard triplicate ECG collected 5 minutes after&#xD;
      completion of dosing. Finally, AF-related symptoms will be checked and a final PK sample will&#xD;
      be collected at 90 minutes after initiation of dosing. Wherever a time point requires&#xD;
      collection of ECG and/or vital signs in addition to a PK sample, the PK sample is collected&#xD;
      last.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient's AF converts to SR (sustained for ≥1 minute) as observed on telemetry during&#xD;
      the Observation Period, vital signs and a standard triplicate 12-lead ECG will be recorded&#xD;
      immediately following the time of conversion. The Investigator may not offer the patient&#xD;
      another rhythm control therapy to cardiovert their AF to SR until after 90 minutes after&#xD;
      initiation of dosing. At the end of the Observation Period (ie, 90 minutes after initiation&#xD;
      of dosing), the cECG patch will be removed and a standard triplicate 12 lead ECG will be&#xD;
      recorded. If the patient's AF converts to SR (sustained for ≥1 minute) after the Observation&#xD;
      Period but prior to discharge (eg, due to ECV or other PCV), a standard triplicate 12-lead&#xD;
      ECG will be recorded at the time of conversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient may be discharged per the Investigator's discretion any time after completion of&#xD;
      the 90-minute time point assessments. If patient discharge occurs &gt;1 hour after completion of&#xD;
      the last 90-minute time point assessment, all 90-minute time point assessments must be&#xD;
      repeated just prior to discharge, excluding the PK sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Follow-Up Period consists of 2 follow-up telephone contacts: one at 24 (+12) hours after&#xD;
      initiation of dosing, and one at 96 (±24) hours after initiation of dosing. The patient will&#xD;
      also be given contact information and be instructed to contact the clinic in the event that&#xD;
      any AF-related symptoms occur before these scheduled contact times. Follow-up contacts may&#xD;
      also be performed by video call or in-person if the patient is at the clinic. During each&#xD;
      follow-up contact, the patient will be queried for concomitant medications and procedures,&#xD;
      AEs, AF-related symptoms, and AF-related interventions. End of study coincides with the&#xD;
      96-hour follow-up contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor safety throughout the study. An&#xD;
      independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC) will review blinded data to adjudicate the&#xD;
      primary and several secondary efficacy endpoints and to adjudicate CV events of special&#xD;
      interest (ie, hypotension, ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, sinus pause, atrial flutter&#xD;
      with 1:1 conduction, and other arrhythmias).&#xD;
