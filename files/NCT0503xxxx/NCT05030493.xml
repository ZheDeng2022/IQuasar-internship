  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to check gene change in tumor tissues with an additional&#xD;
      analysis of the data from PARADIGM Exploratory Study, which is conducted for people with&#xD;
      advanced/recurrent colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the PARADIGM Exploratory Study (NCT02394834), the drug being tested in this study is&#xD;
      called Panitumumab and the main aim of this study is to check side effect from the study&#xD;
      treatment (mFOLFOX6 + bevacizumab versus mFOLFOX6 + panitumumab therapy) and check if the&#xD;
      study treatment improves symptoms of advanced/recurrent colorectal cancer.&#xD;

      This is a non-interventional study to do additional exploratory analysis of biomarkers from&#xD;
      the PARADIGM Exploratory Study (NCT02394834), which is conducted for participants with&#xD;
      advanced/recurrent colorectal cancer. 757 patients have enrolled in the PARADIGM Exploratory&#xD;
      Study.&#xD;
