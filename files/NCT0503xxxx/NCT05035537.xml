    <textblock>
      This study is a multicentric randomized controlled trial comparing two groups of patients&#xD;
      undergoing single or dual kidney transplantation from deceased donors. To reduce&#xD;
      perioperative complications optimal fluid management is essential in patients undergoing&#xD;
      kidney transplantation. Heart rate, Medium Arterial Pressure (MAP), Central Venous Pressure&#xD;
      (CVP), and urine output have been proposed in the literature to guide perioperative fluid&#xD;
      therapy. These criteria are routinely applied in clinical practice; however these criteria&#xD;
      have shown low sensitivity and poor predictive of postoperative complication, especially if&#xD;
      used alone. The traditional approach in renal transplantation is the volume infusion guided&#xD;
      whit CVP to the point of no further fluid responsiveness, but this can lead to excess fluid&#xD;
      which can damage the endothelial glycocalyx and lead to organ failure for a fluid shift into&#xD;
      the interstitial space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a way to reduce postoperative complications in surgical patients, in recent years, several&#xD;
      studies have examined Perioperative Goal Directed Therapy (PGDT) as fluid administration&#xD;
      guided by optimization of preload with the use of algorithms based on fluids, inotropes&#xD;
      and/or vasopressors to achieve a certain goal in stroke volume (SV), cardiac index (CI), or&#xD;
      oxygen delivery (DO2). However results regarding the potential role of PGDT cannot be&#xD;
      considered definitive, because the various studies on the subject have not all conformed to&#xD;
      the same methods and have not uniformly applied the same measurements, so their results&#xD;
      regarding the potential role of PGDT cannot be considered definitive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this work is to compare the effects of PGDT with conventional fluid therapy in&#xD;
      patients undergoing kidney transplantation achievable through implementation of the non&#xD;
      invasive monitoring.&#xD;

&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHODS. This study is a multicentric randomized controlled trial comparing two&#xD;
      groups of patients undergoing single or dual kidney transplantation from deceased donors. All&#xD;
      patients who will meet eligibility criteria will be randomised, using a computer generated&#xD;
      randomization list, to either Group 1 (PGDT, intervention group) where minimally invasive&#xD;
      continuous CI monitor (Edwards ClearSight) will be used to guide a goal directed fluid&#xD;
      administration protocol, and Group 2 (control) managed according to local and international&#xD;
      best practice guidelines using standard hemodynamic monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN. The study protocol will be developed across the intraoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative periods. In the intraoperative phase all standard monitored parameters such as&#xD;
      EKG, SpO2 (oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry), airway pressure etc. will be the same for&#xD;
      both groups. Where ClearSight minimally invasive monitoring will be used (Group 1),&#xD;
      hemodynamic optimization goals will be as follows: CI ≥ 2.5 L/min/m2 and the SVV &lt;10%.&#xD;
      Sequential interventions used to reach the hemodynamic goals are regulated by a flow-chart&#xD;
      provided in the study protocol. In Group 2 conventional static hemodynamic parameters (CVP,&#xD;
      IBP) are evaluated to achieve an intraoperative MAP ≥ 70 mmHg with corrective actions&#xD;
      (fluids, vasoactive agents) implemented according to the recommendations of good clinical&#xD;
      practice and international guidelines. Both groups will receive standard induction&#xD;
      immunosuppression according to our centre's practice as well as corticosteroid bolus (or two&#xD;
      boluses if a dual kidney transplant was performed) before graft reperfusion. In the&#xD;
      postoperative period all patients will be transferred to a dedicated post-surgical intensive&#xD;
      care unit. The same standardized fluid therapy regimen will be adopted across both groups.&#xD;
      Patient data will be prospectively collected, according to the study protocol, by designated&#xD;
      personnel using a digital case report form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. The investigators speculate that in order&#xD;
      to detect a minimum reduction in the primary outcome of at least 18%, considering a power of&#xD;
      80% and a type I error of 5%, a total of 200 patients would be needed (100 per group). All&#xD;
      results will be summarized in the text as means, unless differently stated each time with&#xD;
      measures of variability expressed using mean and standard deviation. When reporting medians,&#xD;
      measures of variability will be indicated as interquartile range, minimum value, and maximum&#xD;
      value. Difference between population means will be obtained using the 2-sample t test;&#xD;
      difference between population proportions will be obtained with the chi-square test and&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test. Graft survival will be calculated from the date of kidney transplant to&#xD;
      the date of last follow-up evaluation, graft loss, or patient death. P-values below or equal&#xD;
      to 0.05 are considered as statistically significant.&#xD;
