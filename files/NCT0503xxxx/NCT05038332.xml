  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the quality of life (QOL) reported by&#xD;
      prostate cancer patients 2 years after treatment with ultra-hypofractionated&#xD;
      post-prostatectomy radiation therapy (also known as stereotactic body radiation therapy&#xD;
      [SBRT]) versus the self-reported QOL of those treated with moderately hypo-fractionated&#xD;
      post-prostatectomy radiation (a current standard of care option).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Conventional or moderately hypo-fractionated radiation therapy are the current standard of&#xD;
      care treatment options for men receiving post-prostatectomy radiation therapy. These&#xD;
      treatment regimens typically span 4-8 weeks, representing a high burden of therapy, which may&#xD;
      result in decreased utilization of salvage radiotherapy, the only potentially curable&#xD;
      treatment for men with relapsed disease following prostatectomy. Ultra-hypofractionated&#xD;
      radiation therapy (also known as stereotactic body radiation therapy [SBRT]) would decrease&#xD;
      the total number of treatments to 5, delivered over 2 weeks, which would greatly reduce&#xD;
      treatment burden.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in patient reported GI and GU quality of life (QOL) at 2-years post-treatment from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>2-years post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>GI and GU QOL assessed with the EPIC-26 questionnaire, bowel and urinary domains. Change scores will be calculated as baseline score subtracted from 2-year score. All patients with EPIC bowel and urinary domain scores will be included in the primary endpoint analysis. The EPIC scoring manual will be followed which requires ≥ 80% of items in a domain to be completed in order to obtain a score for that domain. High bowel score &gt;96, low bowel score &lt;= 96, high urinary score &gt; 84, low urinary score &lt;=84.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient reported GU quality of life (QOL) up to 60 months</measure>
    <time_frame>60 months post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>GU QOL assessed with the EPIC-26 questionnaire, urinary domain; at the end of radiation, 3, 6, 12, and 60 months post-treatment. The EPIC scoring manual will be followed which requires ≥ 80% of items in a domain to be completed in order to obtain a score for that domain. High urinary score &gt; 84, low urinary score &lt;=84. A longitudinal analysis incorporating all follow-up time points, will be conducted separately for each domain score.</description>

    <description>Time to progression (where progression is defined as the first occurrence of biochemical failure, local failure, regional failure, distant metastasis, start of salvage therapy, or death from prostate cancer)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of biochemical failure</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Biochemical failure will be assessed using two definitions. Definition one is a PSA ≥ 0.4 ng/mL followed by a second higher value. Definition two is the post-radiation PSA nadir + 2ng/mL</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Local failure, Regional failure, Distant metastases</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the number of local, regional and distant metastases.&#xD;
Local failure is defined as development of a new biopsy-proven mass or prostate specific PET avid mass in the prostate bed after completion of protocol treatment&#xD;
Regional failure is defined as radiographic evidence of pelvic lymphadenopathy (lymph node size ≥ 1.5 cm in short axis) or PET avid lymph nodes within the pelvis following protocol treatment&#xD;
Distant metastases is defined as any clinical or radiographic evidence of lymph node, bone, or visceral involvement of prostate cancer</description>

    <time_frame>up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Prostate cancer specific survival defined as the duration of time from the start of treatment to death attributable to prostate cancer. Patients who have not died or die of non-prostate cancer related causes will be censored at the date of last known follow-up or date of death, respectively.</description>
