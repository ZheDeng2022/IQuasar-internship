             informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable or metastatic melanoma and&#xD;
             pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cohort 2A: had confirmed progressive disease during treatment with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1&#xD;
             with or without CTLA-4 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cohort 2B: had confirmed progressive disease during treatment with first line standard&#xD;
             of care chemotherapy per local guideline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cohort 2C: must not have received any prior systematic treatment, including&#xD;

             advanced/ metastatic pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  3. Subject must have at least 1 unidimensional measurable disease by RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  4. Subjects must be age between 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  5. Subjects must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status&#xD;
             of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  6. Life expectancy ≥3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  7. Subjects must have adequate organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

          -  Subjects who meet any of the following criteria cannot be enrolled:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Cohort 2A: History of life-threatening toxicity or treatment discontinuation due to&#xD;
             related to prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 with or without CTLA-4 treatment for subjects with&#xD;

             for an adverse hypersensitivity to YH003 or Toripalimab. (For cohort 2C: history of&#xD;
             severe hypersensitivity reaction to Nap-paclitaxel and/or gemcitabine).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  7. Primary central nervous system (CNS) malignancies or symptomatic CNS metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  8. History of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required corticosteroids or current&#xD;
             pneumonitis, or history of interstitial lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  9. Active, hemodynamically significant pulmonary embolism within 12 weeks prior to the&#xD;
             first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  10. Subjects must not have a known or suspected history of an autoimmune disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  11. Clinically uncontrolled intercurrent illness,&#xD;

             York Heart Association class III or IV), unstable angina, uncontrolled hypertension,&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmia, a history of myocardial infarction within 6 months or a history of&#xD;
             arterial thromboembolic event and pulmonary embolism within 3 months of the first dose&#xD;
             of investigational agent.&#xD;

          -  13. QTc &gt; 480 ms (Fridericia equation) at baseline; no concomitant medications that&#xD;
             would prolong the QT interval; no family history of long QT syndrome.&#xD;
