    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the use of a mattress overlay system to promote the healing of full&#xD;
      thickness pressure ulcers. The overlay is placed over the patient's bed making it easier for&#xD;
      patients to get in and out of bed. In addition, the overlay has blue tooth capabilities that&#xD;
      will allow clinicians to remotely monitor adherence with the device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multi-center, prospective, study designed to evaluate the use of an&#xD;
      alternating mattress overlay in the treatment of stage 3 pressure ulcers. After screening,&#xD;
      eligible subjects will receive a mattress overlay system for the 4 weeks of treatment. The&#xD;
      mattress is fitted to the patient's bed/mattress in his/her home or skilled nursing facility&#xD;
      (SNF). Patients responding to the offloading regimen (percent wound area reduction &gt;20% at 4&#xD;
      weeks) may use the overlay for up to 12 additional weeks. The SOC in this study is&#xD;
      debridement, proper moisture balance, reduction of bacterial burden and nutritional&#xD;
      counseling.&#xD;

    <description>Assessment of the pain level linked to the wound, using a numeric pain scale. Numeric Pain Scale from 0-10 anchored by word descriptors at each end. A numerical scale will be used to assess pain. Subject will be asked to indicate a numerical value that best represents the pain intensity at ulcer site on a scale of 0 to 10 anchored by &quot;word descriptors&quot; at each end, as &quot;no pain&quot; on the left side and &quot;worst possible pain&quot; on the right side of the number line. The number 0 represents &quot;no pain&quot;, the number 5 represents &quot;moderate pain&quot; and the number 10 represents the &quot;worst possible pain&quot;. The subject indicates the level of pain intensity by selecting a number on the line that represents their perception of their current state.</description>

    <description>Eligible patients are treated with a mattress overlay system and standard of care (debridement, proper moisture balance, reduction of bacterial burden and nutritional counseling). Subjects will be seen weekly for 4 weeks. Patients who respond to the offloading device, may use the overlay for an additional 12 weeks with monthly follow-up visits in the clinic or their home. Subjects undergo study procedures on a weekly basis.</description>

    <intervention_name>Dabir Mattress Overlay System</intervention_name>
    <description>Dabir Surface mattress overlay system consists of a controller and a low-profile alternating pressure (AP) surface (placed over a non-powered mattress) with hundreds of air-filled geometric nodes arranged in rows. . The multiple rows of nodes inflate and deflate in alternating sequence every five minutes. During deflation phase, the skin and soft tissues experience reduced pressure/loading and enhanced perfusion. In conjunction with Standard of Care: Debridement, Proper moisture balance, off-loading, reduce bacterial burden and nutritional counseling.</description>
