    <textblock>
      The study has 2 parts. Part 1 will investigate the effects of introducing teledermoscopy in&#xD;
      clinical practice, more specifically the change in referral patterns, the risk of undetected&#xD;
      skin cancers and the effect on diagnostic accuracy in general practitioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 will investigate how to introduce artificial intelligence (AI) within teledermocsopy.&#xD;
      In this study the investigators will measure the effect of displaying the results of&#xD;
      artificial intelligence in different ways and at different time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collcted through teledermoscopic referrals, patient records, national registries&#xD;
      and questionnairs.&#xD;

      Study objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is teledermoscopy an equally safe method as conventional care for skin cancer patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How does teledermoscopy affect current care and organization of skin diseases?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How should the results of diagnostic algorithms be displayed in real-life health care to&#xD;
           achieve the proper effect?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. In what stage of the assessment of a skin lesion should the results of a diagnostic&#xD;
           algorithm be presented to the physician to ensure the highest diagnostic accuracy while&#xD;
           minimizing risk of undetected skin cancer?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study setting Patients scheduled for a skin examination for a suspected skin lesion can&#xD;
           be recruited, both in dermatology clinics and participating primary care clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data acquisition Patient data and images will be collected with the Dermicus®&#xD;
           application. Participating PCP and dermatologists will also fill in a questionnaire&#xD;
           about their assessment of the patient. Additional informaiton will be collected from&#xD;
           medical records, i.e. histopathological diagnoses, and from national registries.&#xD;
           Questionnaires will be entered in a digital data base using REDCap®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Statistical analyses 4.1. In part 1, the number of consultations send to dermatologists&#xD;
      and for pathological analyses before introduction of teledermoscopy and during the first and&#xD;
      second year if using teledermoscopy will be analysed. Descriptive statistics will be&#xD;
      presented and differences between the different time periods will be tested with t-tests and&#xD;
      paired t-tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2. In part 2, different ways of displaying the results of the artificial intelligence as&#xD;
      well as feeding the results at different time points will be compared using analyses of&#xD;
      sensitivity, specificity, and Area under ROC-curve (AUROC). The study will also report the&#xD;
      impact the results of the artificial intelligence has on the willingness to change a&#xD;
      diagnosis or a management plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Power set to 0.8 and significance to 0.05. 10% censures. 5.1. Patients recruited to this&#xD;
      study can be used in several of the sub-studies. The aim of the study is to collect 8000&#xD;
      patients in total in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2. To detect a difference in &quot;unimaged skin cancers&quot; between teledermoscopy and&#xD;
      conventional care of patients 1200 cases and 2400 controls need to be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3. To detect a 10% difference in sensitivity/ specificity of diagnostic ability in PCPs&#xD;
      before and after working with teledermoscopy 3400 patients need to be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4. To investigate how artificial intelligence should be implemented in clinical care the&#xD;
      investigators have calculated that 6000 patients are needed to detect a 10% difference in&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity in the subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations and data management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected using Dermicus®, a CE-certified digital platform and mobile&#xD;
      application. With the application downloaded on iPhones®, locked for any other uses, the&#xD;
      history of the patients are registered. Then, by connecting the iPhone to a dermoscope,&#xD;
      macroscopic and dermoscopic images are captured. All data will be stored on the servers of&#xD;
      the health care region of Skåne, where the studies are conducted. Patients participating in&#xD;
      the studies will be tagged with a study code enabling the investigators to extract the data&#xD;
      from the patients that has agreed to participate in our study. Once a case has been created&#xD;
      and sent to the data base all information will be deleted from the iPhone®. Additional data&#xD;
      will also be retrieved from relevant medical records, e.g. histopathological diagnosis, and&#xD;
      manually registered in an electronic database at a highly secure location (LUSEC/ REDCap&#xD;
      provided by Lund University) . Data collected from PCP and dermatologists by questionnaires&#xD;
      will also be registered in this data base by means of electronic surveys (REDCap).&#xD;
      Information from primary care on total number of visits, referrals to dermatologists and&#xD;
      referrals to pathology regarding skin lesions will be extracted from patient administrative&#xD;
      systems. Age- and sex matched controls will be used for the study investigating missed skin&#xD;
      cancer. These controls will be randomly selected from patients that was referred to a skin&#xD;
      clinic by paper referral during the same period as the teledermoscopically referred patients&#xD;
      were gathered. Algorithms for skin cancer diagnosis will be implemented in the web platform&#xD;
      of Dermicus for the studies of introduction of artificial intelligence. Teledermoscopic&#xD;
      assessors will be instructed on when and how to use these different tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every week the newly entered data will be checked for completeness, and in the case of&#xD;
      missing data, reminders to participating investigators will be send.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then the data sets are complete, identifiers (such as personal identification number) will be&#xD;
      replaced by a code kept secure at a different location than the data set. Data will&#xD;
      thereafter be extracted from the data base to perform statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority and all relevant approvals for&#xD;
      data extraction and data storage has been obtained.&#xD;
