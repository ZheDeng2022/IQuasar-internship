      Pre-market feasibility clinical investigation designed to evaluate the clinical performance&#xD;
      and safety of the investigational product in its intended target population&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical clinical investigation is prospective, cross-over, interventional, multicentre&#xD;
      and pre-market. The investigation aims to demonstrate the performance and safety of a new&#xD;
      absorbing hygiene product (medical device) when used as intended in subjects affected with&#xD;
      light to medium urinary incontinence compared to a reference (control) product representing&#xD;
      standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants will be randomly assigned to one of 4 groups. Each group will receive&#xD;
      a predefined pair of investigational and reference products (variants: either high waist or&#xD;
      low waist) to be used in a predefined order (crossover design: investigational or reference&#xD;
      product to be used first). Hence, each study subject will use two products (one&#xD;
      investigational product and a corresponding reference product of the same variant) and act as&#xD;
      its own control. The study subjects will use one product for 5 days and then switch to use&#xD;
      the other product for 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint for the investigation is the comparison in leakage performance of the&#xD;
      investigation product with the reference product. There are also secondary endpoints&#xD;
      regarding safety and product satisfaction and product preference.&#xD;
