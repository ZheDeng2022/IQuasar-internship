      1. Timing of Dose Administration for Pembrolizumab Trial interventions should be&#xD;
           administered on Day 1 of each cycle after all procedures/assessments have been completed&#xD;
           as detailed on the Schedule. Trial interventions may be administered up to 3 days before&#xD;
           or after the scheduled Day 1 of each cycle due to administrative reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All trial interventions will be administered on an outpatient basis. Pembrolizumab 200&#xD;
           mg will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion every 3 weeks. Sites should make&#xD;
           every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible.&#xD;
           However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of -5&#xD;
           minutes and +10 minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: -5 min/+10&#xD;
           min).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Lenvatinib administration Lenvatinib will be administered with water orally once a day&#xD;
           (with or without food) in 21-day cycles at approximately the same time each day.&#xD;
           Treatment cycles will be counted continuously regardless of dose interruptions. On Day 1&#xD;
           (D1) of each cycle, it will be administered approximately 1 hour after completion of&#xD;
           pembrolizumab administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Treatment Period The Treatment Phase will begin with the administration of the first&#xD;
           dose of study treatment to the first subject in Cycle 1 and continues in 21-day (3-week)&#xD;
           cycles. Subjects will continue to receive study treatment until confirmed PD by IIR,&#xD;
           development of unacceptable toxicity, subject request, withdrawal of consent, completion&#xD;
           of 35 treatments (approximately 2 years) with pembrolizumab, or study termination by the&#xD;
           sponsor. Those subjects that discontinue study treatment transition to the Off-Tx Visit&#xD;
           of the Follow-up Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Safety Follow-Up Visit The mandatory Safety Follow-Up Visit should be conducted&#xD;
           approximately 30 days after the last dose of study intervention or before the initiation&#xD;
           of a new anti-cancer treatment, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Efficacy Follow-up Visits Participants who complete the protocol-required cycles of&#xD;
           study intervention of who discontinue study intervention for a reason other than disease&#xD;
           progression will begin the Efficacy Follow-Up Phase and should be assessed every 6 weeks&#xD;
           (42 ± 7 days) by radiologic imaging to monitor disease status. After 6 months, the&#xD;
           imaging time point will occur every 9 weeks (± 7 days). Every effort should be made to&#xD;
           collect information regarding disease status until the start of new anti-cancer therapy,&#xD;
           disease progression, death, end of the study. Information regarding post-study&#xD;
           anti-cancer treatment will be collected if new treatment is initiated. Participants who&#xD;
           completed all efficacy assessments and/or will not have further efficacy assessments&#xD;
           must enter the Survival Follow-up Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE, SAE, and Other Reportable Safety Event&#xD;
           Information :&#xD;
&#xD;
      All AEs, SAEs, and other reportable safety events that occur after the consent form is signed&#xD;
      but before intervention allocation must be reported by the investigator if the event cause&#xD;
      the participant to be excluded from the study, or is the result of a protocol-specified&#xD;
      intervention, including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet,&#xD;
      or a procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All AEs from the time of intervention allocation through 30 days following cessation of&#xD;
           study intervention must be reported by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All AEs meeting serious criteria, from the time of intervention allocation through 90&#xD;
           days following cessation of study intervention or 30 days following cessation of study&#xD;
           intervention if the participant initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier,&#xD;
           must be reported by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All pregnancies and exposure during breastfeeding, from the time of intervention&#xD;
           allocation through 120 days following cessation of study intervention, or 30 days&#xD;
           following cessation of study intervention if the participant initiates new anticancer&#xD;
           therapy must be reported by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additionally, any SAE brought to the attention of an investigator at any time outside of&#xD;
           the time period specified above must be reported immediately to MSD if the event is&#xD;
           considered drug-related.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs or other reportable safety&#xD;
      events in former study participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE,&#xD;
      including a death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and&#xD;
      he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention or study&#xD;
      participation, the investigator must promptly notify MSD.&#xD;

             starting therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Previous radiotherapy to the only measurable lesion: but previous radiotherapy will be&#xD;
             permitted unless the lesion is the only measurable lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects having &gt;1+ proteinuria on urinalysis will undergo 24-hour urine collection&#xD;
             for quantitative assessment of proteinuria. Subjects with urine protein ≥1g/24-hour&#xD;
             will be ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Gastrointestinal malabsorption, gastrointestinal obstruction, or any other condition&#xD;
             that might affect the absorption of lenvatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Significant cardiovascular impairment within 6 months of the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
             History of congestive heart failure greater than New York Heart Association (NYHA)&#xD;
             Class II, unstable angina, myocardial infarction or stroke, cardiac arrhythmia&#xD;
             associated with significant cardiovascular impairment, or a left ventricular ejection&#xD;
             fracture (LVEF) below the institutional normal range as determined by MUGA or&#xD;
             echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Prolongation of QTc interval to &gt;480 msec&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Bleeding or thrombotic disorders or subjects at risk for severe hemorrhage. The degree&#xD;
             of tumor invasion/infiltration of major blood vessels should be considered because of&#xD;
             the potential risk of severe hemorrhage associated with tumor shrinkage/necrosis&#xD;
             following lenvatinib therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
             Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles,&#xD;
             mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus&#xD;
             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection&#xD;
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza&#xD;
             vaccines (eg, FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational&#xD;
             agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy&#xD;
             (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of&#xD;
             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug. The use&#xD;
             of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved at the discretion of treating&#xD;
             physician. In mitotane treated subject, adrenal insufficiency happens inevitably and&#xD;
             required dose of corticosteroid is higher than usual due to altered metabolism of&#xD;
             corticosteroid.48 Therefore, the decision on whether the dose of maintenance&#xD;
             corticosteroid is acceptable for enrollment depends on investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment&#xD;
             within the past 2 years. Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous&#xD;
             cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in situ (eg, breast carcinoma, cervical&#xD;
             cancer in situ) that have undergone potentially curative therapy are not excluded.&#xD;
             Clinically insignificant or curatively treated localized prostate cancer and&#xD;
             curatively treated thyroid cancer of any stage can be included at the discretion of&#xD;
             treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Has known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with&#xD;
             previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically&#xD;
             stable, i.e. without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging&#xD;
             (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically&#xD;
             stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to&#xD;
             first dose of study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years&#xD;
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment and is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current&#xD;
             pneumonitis. Non-infectious pneumonitis include, but not limited to, idiopathic&#xD;

             reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA [qualitative] is&#xD;
             detected) infection. Note: no testing for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C is required&#xD;
             unless mandated by local health authority.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Has an active tuberculosis. However, inactive tuberculosis (previously treated or&#xD;
             latent infection without evidence of active disease) is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the participant's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the participant to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
