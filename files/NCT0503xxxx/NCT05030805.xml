  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2020, epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) accounts for 313,959 new cases and 207,252 deaths&#xD;
      worldwide. The standardized 5-year net survival of a woman with EOC is 44% for cases&#xD;
      diagnosed between 2005-2010. This is because 2 out of 3 cancers are found at an advanced&#xD;
      stage with invasion beyond the ovaries to the entire peritoneum or distant metastasis.&#xD;
      Treatment of EOC is currently based on platinum-based chemotherapy combined with paclitaxel&#xD;
      and maximal cytoreduction surgery. Newer combination therapies may be introduced such as&#xD;
      bevacizumab and oral poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Despite the combination of&#xD;
      different therapeutic modes, the 5-year survival has not progressed much since the 1980s. The&#xD;
      development of new and more effective therapies is essential but requires a better&#xD;
      understanding of cancer heterogeneity and the identification of new therapeutic targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer heterogeneity results from genetic and transcriptional variations between tumors but&#xD;
      also between cells of the same tumor. This heterogeneity has an impact on the development of&#xD;
      the tumor and its resistance to treatment. One of the methods to study this heterogeneity is&#xD;
      single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) which allows to analyze individually and simultaneously&#xD;
      the gene expression (transcriptomics) of thousands of cells. Studies on EOC using this&#xD;
      technique have already been performed but they were based on small numbers with very&#xD;
      different tumor types and stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this protocol is to characterize by scRNA-seq the architecture and&#xD;
      microenvironment of primary and secondary tumors of 50 patients with EOC at the single cell&#xD;
      level and to correlate the data with the clinical characteristics of the patients, especially&#xD;
      during recurrence and/or chemoresistance, in order to identify the molecular parameters&#xD;
      allowing tumor cells to acquire survival, invasion, metastasis and chemoresistance capacity&#xD;
      as well as to carry out the inventory of cell populations within the different sites of EOC.&#xD;
      We will also analyze the interaction between tumor cells and the microenvironment, by&#xD;
      studying on the one hand the involvement of immune cells in the antitumor response and on the&#xD;
      other hand how tumor cells modulate the microenvironment to make it permissive to the&#xD;
      development of the EOC. We will compare the data obtained for each patient with healthy&#xD;
      tissue (from the same patient) in order to determine the common and specific tumor molecular&#xD;
      signatures in EOC, the latter point allowing us to evaluate the intra and inter-patient&#xD;
      variability. Similarly, the comparison of the transcriptomic profile of the same tumor&#xD;
      subtype in several patients will allow us to determine if certain transcriptional&#xD;
      perturbations are ubiquitous. The identification of these common pathways would allow the&#xD;
      discovery of potential therapeutic targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the molecular processes leading to chemoresistance are still unknown. We will&#xD;
      investigate whether known chemoresistance markers are present in tumor cells from primary&#xD;
      sites and whether their presence correlates with the response to treatment in patients. We&#xD;
      will also study the molecular mechanisms of resistance to treatment in our patients which&#xD;
      will ultimately allow the development of new therapies. We will also try to find new&#xD;
      prognostic markers which is made possible by the clinical follow-up of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The existence of this heterogeneity will be confirmed by complementary genetic analyses of&#xD;
      the genome and exome (search for mutations, variation in gene copy number or chromosome copy&#xD;
      number, epigenetic effects) by different molecular biology techniques (qPCR, NGS sequencing)&#xD;
      and the markers that will be identified can be confirmed by histochemical analysis.&#xD;

      After tumor stage determination by the pathology department the fresh tumor samples will be&#xD;
      prepared for the single cell preparation.. The samples will be transported in a cold&#xD;
      transport solution (MACS Storage tissue, Miltenyi). These samples will be used for library&#xD;
      preparation using the Chromium Controller (10X Genomics) and sequencing using the NextSeq550&#xD;
      system (Illumina) as well as for HLA-bound neoantigen identification by mass spectrometry.&#xD;
      After data analysis by bioinformatics, we will study the transcriptome of each identified&#xD;
      cell population. The identified markers will be confirmed by histochemical and molecular&#xD;
      biological analysis.&#xD;

    <description>We will study the cellular populations constituting ovarian tumors by comparing the existing cellular heterogeneity between patients (inter-patient) but also within the same patient, between primary and secondary sites on the one hand and within the same tumor tissue on the other hand (intra-patient) as well as the comparison with tissue considered as healthy between patients.</description>
