    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies the use of virtual reality technology and three dimensional&#xD;
      surgery (3D-surgery) modeling to enhance current treatments in head and neck cancer surgery.&#xD;
      Virtual reality 3D-surgery modeling may improve quality of surgical planning and&#xD;
      interdisciplinary communication between surgeons and pathologists during the treatment of&#xD;
      head and neck squamous cell cancer and ultimately increase the accuracy of planning, the&#xD;
      quality of communication, and maximize the outcome patients with head and neck cancer&#xD;
      experience throughout treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the feasibility of Virtual Reality/3D- Case Enhancement Protocols&#xD;
      (VR/3D-CEPs) for facilitating interdisciplinary intraoperative consultation of pathology&#xD;
      during head and neck cancer (HNC) surgery as an addition to standard treatment (ST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the quality of existing interdisciplinary intraoperative communication using&#xD;
      the proposed VR/3D-CEPs as an evaluating medium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether utilization of VR/3D-CEPs is associated with decreased surgical care&#xD;
      related physician task load burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine whether utilization of VR/3D-CEPs is associated with decreased robotic&#xD;
      surgical difficulty ratings during transoral robotic surgery (TORS). (FOR ROBOTIC CASES ONLY)&#xD;

    <time_frame>Completion of surgical resection</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility will be measured as the proportion of successful VR3D-CEPs to the proportion of VR3D-CEP attempts. Successful attempts are defined as creation 3D-True-Tumor-Model, importation into the VR environment on an Oculus Quest, and &quot;digital ink marking&quot; of surgical margins on two separate models by the head and neck cancer (HNC) surgeon and pathologist.</description>

    <measure>Quality of existing interdisciplinary intraoperative communication</measure>
    <time_frame>Completion of surgical resection</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using the proposed VR/3D-CEPs as a evaluating medium. This will be achieved by measuring the X-, Y-, Z- dimension coordinate values of &quot;digital ink&quot; markings of anatomic surgical margin sampling location by HNC surgeons and consulted pathologist.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physician task load burden</measure>
    <time_frame>Completion of surgical resection</time_frame>
    <description>Physician task load burden will be measured using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration - Task Load Index (NASA - TLX) which is a validated tool for the perceived burden of a particular task. This will be documented as an overall score as well as in individual subscale scores, which include mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, effort, frustration, and performance. A NASA-TLX score will be administrated in reference to surgical operation for HNC surgeons and completion of consultation by pathologist.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Robotic surgical difficulty</measure>
    <time_frame>Completion of surgical resection</time_frame>
    <description>Will be measured as Global Evaluative Assessment for Robotic Skills (GEARS) Score. GEARS Score is a validated index used to assess robotic surgical performance across six domains (depth perception, bimanual dexterity, efficiency, force sensitivity, autonomy, and robotic control) and is completed by a supervising HNC surgeon of the enrolled-HNC surgeon.</description>
