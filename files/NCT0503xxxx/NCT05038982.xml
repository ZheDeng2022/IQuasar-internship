  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Abrocitinib for&#xD;
      the treatment of Prurigo Nodularis (PN) or Chronic Pruritus of Unknown Origin (CPUO) in&#xD;
      patients experiencing moderate to severe pruritus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a trial to assess the efficacy of Abrocitinib as a therapeutic for Prurigo Nodularis&#xD;
      (PN) and Chronic Pruritus of Unknown Origin (CPUO). The study will consist of a 4-week&#xD;
      Screening period, a 12-week treatment period and then a 4-week follow up period. The arms&#xD;
      will run in parallel and patients will take 200 mg oral Abrocitinib daily for the duration of&#xD;
      the 12-week treatment period.&#xD;

    <measure>Percent change in weekly average Peak Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (PP-NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in weekly average Peak Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (PP-NRS) at Week 12. PP-NRS is a single self-report item on an 11-point scale (0 to10) where 0 is No itch, and 10 is the Worst itch imaginable.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of subjects achieving a reduction in weekly average PP-NRS</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of subjects achieving at least a 4-point reduction from baseline in weekly average PP-NRS at Week 12. The PP-NRS is a single self-report item on an 11-point scale (0 to10) where 0 is No itch, and 10 is the Worst itch imaginable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in itch severity</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in itch severity as assessed by 5-D pruritus scale. The 5-D pruritus scale scores pruritus over the past 2 weeks along 5 dimensions: duration, degree, direction, disability and distribution. Duration, degree and direction are scored from 1 to 5, with &quot;1&quot; indicating better control and resolution of symptoms, and &quot;5&quot; indicating increased intensity, severity and worsening. Disability is assessed in Leisure/Social, housework/errands, and work/school with scores ranging from N/A, and 1-5, with &quot;1&quot; indicating that itch never affects the activity, and &quot;5&quot; meaning that itch always affects this activity. The scores of each of the 5 domains are achieved separately and then summed together to obtain a total score. Scores can range between 5 no pruritus, and 25 most severe pruritus.</description>

    <measure>Change in quality of life - Dermatology</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in quality of life as assessed by the Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI). The DLQI is 10 questions used to assess impact of skin disease. Scores range from 0-30, with &quot;0&quot; corresponding to best quality of life, and &quot;30&quot; corresponding to worst quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pruriginous lesions</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in pruriginous lesions as assessed by the Prurigo Activity Score (PAS). The PAS is a 7-item questionnaire that assesses the number, distribution and activity of pruriginous lesions. The score is calculated via summation of the scoring values, added up with 123 and afterwards divided by 10. This results in a range of values from 1.3 to 21.3.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in itch-scratching behavior as assessed by PROMIS® Itch Questionnaire (PIQ) T-Score: Scratching. The PIQ T-Score: Scratching, is comprised of 5 questions to assess Itch-Scratching Behavior over the past 7 days. Scores for each question range from 1-5, Score range of 5-25 with scores of &quot;1&quot; indicating less scratching behavior and scores of &quot;5&quot; indicating the greatest scratching behavior.</description>

    <measure>Changes in prurigo nodule severity</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in prurigo nodule severity using the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA). The IGA is a physician scale assessing the number of nodules a Prurigo Nodularis (PN) patient has. Patients receive a score between 0 and 4, where &quot;0&quot; is clear: &quot;No prurigo nodules. Post-inflammatory hypo/hyper pigmentation may be present&quot;. Grades of &quot;4&quot; are severe: &quot;Abundant prurigo nodules. Marked nodule elevation.&quot;</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life - debilitation</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in quality of life as assessed by EuroQoL 5-Dimension (EQ-5D). The EQ-5D-3L assesses degree of debilitation in 5 major aspects of health: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has three possible answers. These answers equate to: &quot;No problems&quot; or &quot;Some/Moderate Problems&quot; or &quot;Severe/Extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate their health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. A unique health state is then defined by combining one level from each of the 5 dimensions. Each state is referred to in terms of a 5-digit code. A total of 243 possible health states codes is defined in this way. State 11111 indicates no problems on any of the five dimensions. The patient then rates how good or bad their health is on that day from a range from 0 the worst health you can imagine, to 100 the best health you can imagine.</description>
