    <textblock>
      The purpose of this non-randomized control trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      virtual nurse-led survivorship clinic for prostate cancer (PCa) survivors. Through this&#xD;
      trial, investigators will compare pre-determined survivorship outcomes of men receiving care&#xD;
      via traditional specialist-led PCa virtual care model (Specialist Ned) to those receiving&#xD;
      care via the newly-proposed nurse-led PCa virtual care model (Nurse Ned). In total, it is&#xD;
      anticipated that a maximum of 600 men (300 in control arm; 300 in intervention arm) across&#xD;
      five clinical sites (3 in Ontario; 1 in Alberta; and 1 in Nova Scotia) will be enrolled into&#xD;
      this trial and will be followed for 12 months.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer among Canadian men, with over 25,000&#xD;
      diagnosed yearly. While advances in treatment and care, including the PSA (prostate-specific&#xD;
      antigen) test have resulted in more men entering survivorship and living longer, many&#xD;
      continue to experience undesirable symptoms, side effects and psychosocial concerns. The&#xD;
      current healthcare system is not optimized to deliver survivorship care at scale and&#xD;
      struggles to support the increasing number of survivors across the cancer care continuum.&#xD;
      Increasing patient loads in specialty clinics result in brief and infrequent follow-up&#xD;
      visits, leaving patients without the opportunity to ask questions and fully understand their&#xD;
      health status, all the while tasking providers with making quick and effective treatment&#xD;
      decisions with minimal patient information or interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to address this increasing need for improved care delivery, investigators have&#xD;
      developed the Ned (&quot;No Evidence of Disease&quot;) PCa survivorship platform, which allows patients&#xD;
      to access clinical information (i.e. lab results), virtually complete patient reported&#xD;
      outcomes (PROs) on their quality of life, and complete virtual visits with their specialist.&#xD;
      Despite the promise and potential of Ned, ongoing evaluation of this platform shows&#xD;
      specialists often lacked the availability and flexibility to consistently review ePROs and&#xD;
      lab results prior to a study visit. In response, researchers aim to expand the current Ned&#xD;
      platform to design, develop and implement a digitally mediated nurse-led survivorship care&#xD;
      model that can address the growing needs of prostate cancer survivors and healthcare&#xD;
      providers at scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, investigators aim to evaluate the effectiveness of a nurse-led survivorship&#xD;
      care model by comparing the clinical outcomes of patients enrolled in the Specialist Ned&#xD;
      Clinic (control) for their PCa follow-up care and those that will be enrolled into the Nurse&#xD;
      Ned Clinic (intervention) a year later. Participants will be enrolled in the study for one&#xD;
      year, and will be asked to complete standardized questionnaires related to their PCa&#xD;
      follow-up care at the start of the study, 6-months into using their respective Ned Clinic and&#xD;
      at study completion.&#xD;
