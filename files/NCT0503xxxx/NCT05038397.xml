      A study to evaluate efficacy and safety of TheraSphere and resection combination therapy in&#xD;
      patients with single large ((&gt; 5cm, long diameter ) hepatocellular carcinoma :&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer and the third leading cause of&#xD;
      cancer related death worldwide. Because HCC usually occurs in patients with underlying liver&#xD;
      disease, candidates for treatment strategies should be selected based on tumor status and&#xD;
      liver function. According to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system, which&#xD;
      is widely used for treatment allocation , hepatic resection is considered the treatment of&#xD;
      choice for single tumors without macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread. These&#xD;
      patients are beyond the Milan criteria; liver transplantation is not recommended as the first&#xD;
      treatment choice because of the risk of recurrence and the scarcity of donors. Ablative&#xD;
      therapies, such as percutaneous ethanol injection and radiofrequency ablation (RFA), rarely&#xD;
      achieve complete necrosis in tumors &gt; 3 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, hepatic resection is considered the only po tentially curative treatment for&#xD;
      these patients. Nevertheless, few patients are candidates for hepatic resection because of&#xD;
      associated liver cirrhosis and the risk of inducing postoperative liver decompensation.&#xD;
      Although perioperative mortality of hepatic resection in cirrhotic patients has decreased,&#xD;
      candidates must be selected carefully to avoid life threatening complications. The lon g term&#xD;
      outcome of hepatic resection remains poor, mainly because tumors often recur after resection.&#xD;
      Moreove r, s ingle large ( 5cm) tumor showed significantly worse survival than other BCLC&#xD;
      stage A, which indicate that single tumor should be differently staged according to their&#xD;
      tumor size . For these reasons, whether hepatic resection is the optimal treatment for large&#xD;
      single HCCs is a matter of debate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yttrium 9 0 radioembolization (Y90) allow s accurate tumor targeting while spa ring&#xD;
      surrounding parenchyma, resulting in down staging potential and bridging to transplantation&#xD;
      strategies The responsiveness of HCC to radiation, while long recognized, has been limited by&#xD;
      nontargeted tissue exposure and radiation injury. With the devel opment of advanced&#xD;
      microcatheters and short radius of emission of Y90, single lesions confined to particular&#xD;
      liver segment s may now be approached with s uperselective radiotherapy, permitting ablative&#xD;
      doses to a confined liver volume. The purpose of this study i s to assess the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of neo adjuvant Therapsphere to down stage in single large ( (&gt; 5cm , long diameter&#xD;
      HCC treated with resection.&#xD;

    <description>Prior to the administration of TheraSphere, the patient should undergo hepatic arterial catheterization using balloon catheterization or other appropriate angiographic techniques to prevent extrahepatic shunting. Following the placement of the hepatic catheter, 75 MBq to 150 MBq (2 mCi to 4 mCi) of Tc-99m MAA is administered into the hepatic artery to determine the extent of A-V shunting to the lungs and to confirm the absence of gastric and duodenal flow. When the possibility of extrahepatic shunting has been evaluated and the patient deemed acceptable for treatment, TheraSphere may be administered.</description>
