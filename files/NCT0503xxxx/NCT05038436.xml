  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is widespread and the number of overweight people has tripled from 1975 to 2016.&#xD;
      According to the WHO (World Health Organisation), 1.9 billion adults worldwide are&#xD;
      overweight, of which 650 million are obese. Thus, obesity is caused by a balance problem&#xD;
      between the amount of food consumed and the energy used. The weighting of the diet in favour&#xD;
      of a far too high fat intake also has a negative influence on the fat metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity is associated with a number of secondary diseases, such as diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      increased inflammatory parameters in the blood and a higher risk of heart attack and stroke.&#xD;
      These secondary diseases reduce the quality and duration of life of the person affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In animal studies, polyglucosamine was found to have a cholesterol-lowering effect. In human&#xD;
      studies conducted over 3 and 12 months, formoline L112 was shown to lower LDL levels in the&#xD;
      blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For research purposes, the present study will focus on investigating whether the intake of&#xD;
      polyglucosamine L112 leads to a reduction in cholesterol intake from food, which should&#xD;
      result in a reduced fat and thus calorie intake.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, the influence of polyglucosamine L112 on cholesterol absorption in&#xD;
      humans is to be investigated in more detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, the subjects undergo two randomised study periods in a crossover design:&#xD;
      first, there is a 2-week run-in phase, during which baseline values are collected without&#xD;
      influence, then the subjects undergo two identical study periods, during which the subjects&#xD;
      randomly take either polyglucosamine L112 or placebo twice a day. The study periods are&#xD;
      separated by a two-week washout phase. After two weeks, a final examination takes place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the course of the study, lipids in the serum are measured regularly. In order to&#xD;
      examine cholesterol absorption, however, it is not sufficient to determine the cholesterol&#xD;
      levels in the blood, as reduced absorption is physiologically compensated for by increased&#xD;
      endogenous synthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, the plant sterol campesterol, which is absorbed from the intestine like&#xD;
      cholesterol, is determined as a surrogate marker for cholesterol absorption. At the same&#xD;
      time, a surrogate marker for endogenous cholesterol synthesis is determined with lathosterol,&#xD;
      which behaves like the endogenously synthesised cholesterol in terms of concentration.&#xD;
      However, campesterol must also be set in relation to cholesterol via the&#xD;
      campesterol-cholesterol quotient, since the concentration of campesterol is also dependent on&#xD;
      the concentration of LDL lipoproteins as transport molecules, which reacts in the same way as&#xD;
      the cholesterol concentration. Accordingly, a lower value of the campesterol-cholesterol&#xD;
      quotient indicates reduced cholesterol absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The values corrected for total cholesterol then give an overview of the endogenous&#xD;
      cholesterol synthesis for the cholesterol precursors, that of the plant sterols via the&#xD;
      cholesterol resorption rate in the small intestine and that of the oxysterols via the bile&#xD;
      acid synthesis rate.&#xD;
