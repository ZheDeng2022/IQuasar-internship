    <textblock>
      This phase I trial finds the best dose and side effects of cabozantinib and pamiparib in&#xD;
      treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body (advanced)&#xD;
      or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Cabozantinib and pamiparib may stop the growth&#xD;
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) and&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxic effects (DLTs) of cabozantinib and pamiparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To define the safety profiles of cabozantinib and pamiparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To perform plasma pharmacokinetic analyses of cabozantinib and pamiparib interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate patient reported outcomes (PRO). III. To evaluate pre-identified mutations in&#xD;
      circulating free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cfDNA) by next generation sequencing (NGS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To estimate complete responses (CRs), partial responses (PRs), stable disease &gt;= 6 months&#xD;
      (SD &gt;= 6months), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To relate changes in phosphorylated AKT (pAKT), phosphorylated ERK2 (pERK2),&#xD;
      phosphorylated c-MET (pc-MET), phosphorylated PARP1 (PARP1-pY907), phosphorylated histone H2A&#xD;
      variant H2AX (gamma-H2AX) and RAD51 in tumor specimens with antitumor efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To relate cancer-associated mutations at baseline with antitumor efficacy. VII. To&#xD;
      explore potential biomarkers of acquired resistance by comparing molecular signatures at&#xD;
      baseline with those at time of relapse in patients in whom SD &gt;= 6 months/CR/PR or a mixed&#xD;
      response are documented, by next-generation deep sequencing or more sophisticated techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cabozantinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and pamiparib PO twice daily (BID).&#xD;
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.&#xD;

                  rivaroxaban, edoxaban, or apixaban in subjects without known brain metastases who&#xD;
