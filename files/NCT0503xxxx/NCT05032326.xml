    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, multicentre, interventional cohort study in children with PWS&#xD;
      over 4 years (no treatment administered). The duration of the preceding OTTB3 study is 26&#xD;
      weeks. An untreated cohort of children with PWS will be included at an age of 2 years and&#xD;
      followed up until an age of 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the untreated cohort, children with PWS born in France and too old to be recruited&#xD;
      in OTBB3 trial, principally those who were born within one year before the start of OTBB3&#xD;
      trial, will be offered to participate in this study. Infants born later who couldn't be&#xD;
      included in OTBB3 study will be also offered to participate.&#xD;
