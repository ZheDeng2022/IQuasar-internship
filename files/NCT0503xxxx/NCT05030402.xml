  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The shoulder is a mobile structure which generates a lot of pathologies. One of them is&#xD;
      rotator cuff tendinosis. On the other hand, it has been investigated that Maitland is&#xD;
      effective for reducing pain and for mobility in the cervical and lumbar spine and in joints&#xD;
      such as the knee and ankle, however, there are few studies that confirm that it is effective&#xD;
      in shoulder pathologies.So here the investigatprs want to study the effectiveness of Maitland&#xD;
      as an adjunctive treatment for shoulder pathologies, comparing it with conventional&#xD;
      physiotherapy treatment, in relation to the reduction of pain and increased mobility. For&#xD;
      that the investigators have a randomized clinical trial with two group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Group 1 receives tens, SW, conventional physiotherapy and exercises as treatment. Group 2&#xD;
      receives tens, SW, Mailtland, and exercises. An assessment is carried out at the beginning of&#xD;
      the treatment, at the end and 2-4 weeks after finishing the treatment. The EVA ASES, DASH and&#xD;
      SF-36 scales are included and the biomechanics study is used for the range of mobility.&#xD;
