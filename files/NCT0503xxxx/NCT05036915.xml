  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the effect of the routine 5-min pacifier use before&#xD;
      feeding and the random 30-min pacifier use independent from feeding during the day on the&#xD;
      transition to bottle feeding process in preterm infants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm infants, may most frequently experience feeding difficulties as a result of lower&#xD;
      oral-motor tone, poor coordination during sucking-swallowing-respiration, sleepy behavior,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal dysmotility and immature sucking pressure and being unable to sustain their&#xD;
      physiological values at a normal level during feeding. In the literature, it is reported that&#xD;
      approximately 82% of preterm infants have an oral feeding difficulty. As a consequence, it is&#xD;
      a very complex process to acquire a safe and effective feeding skill and preterm infants need&#xD;
      support in the weeks after birth until participants develop skills that are necessary for&#xD;
      oral feeding and complete a successful transition to total oral feeding independent from&#xD;
      orogastric catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although studies have stressed positive effects of the Non-nutritive sucking (NNS)&#xD;
      intervention on feeding performance, it is reported that there is a need for more&#xD;
      comprehensive randomized controlled studies revealing the use frequency, duration or effect&#xD;
      of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) where the study will be conducted, an appropriate&#xD;
      method is chosen for preterm infants based on their general condition and the feeding&#xD;
      transition stages are determined incrementally with repetitive follow-ups during feeding. The&#xD;
      routine 5-min pacifier use method before feeding and the random 30-min pacifier use method&#xD;
      during the day will be applied to newborns who have enteral feeding. Newborns who already use&#xD;
      pacifier independent from feeding during the day in the clinic and to whom these methods are&#xD;
      applied, will comprise the control group. In order to ensure a homogeneous application in the&#xD;
      control group, the pacifier use duration will be limited to 30 minutes. Pacifier use&#xD;
      durations have been determined in line with the literature examining the contribution of&#xD;
      pacifier use to the feeding of preterm infants. Newborns, to whom the routine 5-min pacifier&#xD;
      use method is applied before each feeding, will comprise the experimental group. All newborns&#xD;
      included in the study will be followed until participants are discharged.&#xD;
