  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the antihypertensive effects of Mei-Gin formula-4&#xD;
      (MGF-4) and Mei-Gin formula-7.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It's a randomized, and single-blind trial and was designed to evaluate the effects of MGFs&#xD;
      (MGF-4 and MGF-4) on blood pressure. 50 participants with hypertension (systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure between 130-179 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure between 85-109 mmHg) who did not&#xD;
      accept any hypertension medication were randomized allocated to either MGF-4 or MGF-7 group.&#xD;
      Participants were instructed to take 4 capsules of MGF-4 or MGF-7 daily throughout the&#xD;
      duration of the 8 weeks intervention study. After treatment, the change of the blood pressure&#xD;
      and relative mechanism were analyzed.&#xD;
