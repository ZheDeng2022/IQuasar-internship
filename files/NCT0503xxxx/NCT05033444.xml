    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 study is designed to assess the safety, tolerabilty and pharmcokinetics of&#xD;
      different dose levels of PRV-002 in Healthy Volunteers. The study will evaluate 3 dose levels&#xD;
      of the investigational product, PRV-002, in 3 cohorts of 8 healthy volunteers per cohort. In&#xD;
      each cohort, 6 volunteers will receive the investigational product and 2 volunteers will&#xD;
      receive placebo. Dose levels will be evaluated in a sequential manner starting at the lowest&#xD;
      dose level.&#xD;
