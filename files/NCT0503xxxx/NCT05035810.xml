  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is one of the most common and disabling conditions among Veterans.&#xD;
      Management of KOA is challenging as there are few effective treatments other than joint&#xD;
      replacement. Importantly, low levels of physical activity in patients with knee problems&#xD;
      might worsen pain and disability. This study aims to determine the feasibility of using&#xD;
      methods to change behavior that use social incentives and promote physical activity through&#xD;
      playing games and interacting with a web-based platform. The study will also evaluate an&#xD;
      important and widely used treatment, namely corticosteroid injections. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized into one of 4 arms and will receive a different combination of social incentives&#xD;
      and injections. The study will evaluate which approach is most effective at promoting&#xD;
      physical activity and reducing pain and disability.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is one of the most prevalent and disabling conditions among&#xD;
      Veterans and accounts for high morbidity and high costs for the VA. Management of KOA is&#xD;
      challenging as there are few consistently effective treatments other than joint replacement.&#xD;
      Importantly, chronic reductions in physical activity in patients with KOA may worsen pain,&#xD;
      physical function, and exacerbate the metabolic consequences of obesity. Moreover, the&#xD;
      greater mortality observed in symptomatic knee OA populations is likely mediated through its&#xD;
      effect on physical activity. The current proposal aims to derive preliminary data to support&#xD;
      a large pragmatic trial testing the impact of interventions geared towards improving physical&#xD;
      activity and function in KOA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Promoting physical activity has been shown to be helpful in reducing pain and improving&#xD;
      function in KOA and other groups. However, promoting behavioral change in the arthritis&#xD;
      population is a significant challenge. The group has shown that social incentives [and&#xD;
      gamification] derived from concepts from the field of behavioral economics to promote&#xD;
      behavioral change and increase physical activity can be both practical and effective in other&#xD;
      settings. The investigators' group is studying incentives in patients with inflammatory&#xD;
      arthritis with the goal of addressing fatigue, pain, and deficits in physical function. The&#xD;
      incentivization of physical activity using this approach represents a novel intervention for&#xD;
      the managing symptoms of KOA and to improving overall health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analgesic therapies can help KOA patients participate in exercise therapy. However, whether&#xD;
      corticosteroid injections, a commonly used medical therapy for KOA pain, has a positive&#xD;
      impact of physical activity is unknown and is an additional important question addressed by&#xD;
      the current proposal. Despite widespread use, definitive data demonstrating a consistent&#xD;
      benefit of corticosteroids are lacking. A large randomized trial recently tested the effects&#xD;
      of repeated corticosteroids injections every 3 months for a period of 2 years on patient&#xD;
      reported pain as well as progression of disease measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
      This study demonstrated no improvement in pain compared to saline injections. In addition, a&#xD;
      small but statistically significant decline in cartilage thickness on MRI was observed,&#xD;
      raising a concern for side effects. These recent data might suggest that corticosteroid&#xD;
      injections result in more harm than good, and may discourage providers from performing this&#xD;
      intervention. However, there are critical weaknesses to this study. Pain and function were&#xD;
      only assessed at 3-month intervals, while previous trials have suggested that peak benefit is&#xD;
      expected at 4-8 weeks. Moreover, the clinical and biologic significance decrease in cartilage&#xD;
      thickness is unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to fill these important knowledge gaps with an innovative and&#xD;
      efficient pragmatic clinical trial with a factorial and crossover design. A large and&#xD;
      definitive practical trial would lead to better understanding of the clinical effectiveness&#xD;
      of these interventions, the meaningfulness of their combined impact, and the subgroups that&#xD;
      are most likely to derive benefit. This clinical trial will leverage unique resources&#xD;
      available through the Penn Center for Innovation to better capture important patient-reported&#xD;
      outcomes in real-time through a web-based platform. The study will also test the feasibility&#xD;
      of a crossover and factorial design to improve efficiency and reduce confounding. Each&#xD;
      patient will receive each intervention (saline, corticosteroids) in random order over 1 year.&#xD;
      A factorial design will be employed and will randomize participants to receive social&#xD;
      incentives with gamification to promote increases in their physical activity. To accomplish&#xD;
      these aims, the investigators will utilize innovative mobile applications for smart phones&#xD;
      and wearable activity trackers through the Way-to-Health platform and assess, in real time,&#xD;
      the impact of the intervention on patient-reported function and pain as well as physical&#xD;
      activity. The technology will allow for the recording of outcomes as they occur, between&#xD;
      clinic visits, thereby avoiding information bias due to poor recall. It will also provide&#xD;
      real-time assessment of symptoms, providing granular assessments of response over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine whether an incentive based on behaviorally-enhanced gamification can&#xD;
      improve physical activity among patients with KOA and reduce self-reported pain and&#xD;
      disability. The intervention will result in sustained improvements in average daily step&#xD;
      counts over 10 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine if corticosteroid injections can reduce pain and disability in patients&#xD;
      with KOA when compared to lidocaine only. Participants will report improvements in&#xD;
      self-reported pain and disability, and improvements in quality of life.&#xD;
