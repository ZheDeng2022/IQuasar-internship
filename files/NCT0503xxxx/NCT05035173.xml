      This study's aim is to evaluate the feasibility of introducing a women's malignancy&#xD;
      survivorship clinic incorporating symptom management through ePRO collection (complex&#xD;
      intervention) into routine follow up care in patients with early-stage Hormone&#xD;
      Receptor(HR)-positive breast and gynaecologic cancer post primary curative therapy.&#xD;
