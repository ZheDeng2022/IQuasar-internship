      This study compares and evaluates differences in patient-reported outcome, survivorship and&#xD;
      radiological analysis between patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty with use of either&#xD;
      Zimmer Biomet PERSONA Posterior Stabilized (PS) system and Smith&amp;Nephew Journey II&#xD;
      Bi-Cruciate Stabilized (BCS) system&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The aim of this study is to assess patient-reported outcome, survivorship and radiological&#xD;
      analysis in patients after total knee arthroplasty, who will undergo the surgery with the use&#xD;
      of either Zimmer Biomet PERSONA Posterior Stabilized (PS) system and Smith&amp;Nephew Journey II&#xD;
      Bi-Cruciate Stabilized (BCS) system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this study 45 consecutive patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty will be recruited to&#xD;
      each group. Study protocol is designed as a prospective, blinded, parallel-group, superiority&#xD;
      trial, with balanced randomization [1:1]. All participants will be operated in single&#xD;
      clinical orthopedic department, by single high-volume surgeon, who performed more than 3000&#xD;
      total knee arthroplasties in his professional career.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the surgery patients will fulfill the author's questionnaire concerning their age,&#xD;
      height and body mass, level of activity, WOMAC and KOOS scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1-day posteoperatively patients will undergo standard computed tomography examination to&#xD;
      assess components placement&#xD;
