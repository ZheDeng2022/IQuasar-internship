  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 was pandemic since 2020. Vaccination is one of&#xD;
      the most important measure to control the outbreak. The countries of the world started the&#xD;
      vaccination since December, 2020. Taiwan started since March, 21st, 2021. Currently,&#xD;
      Taiwanese people receive COVID-19 vaccination by either AZ or Moderna; Pfizer/BNT vaccine may&#xD;
      import in the near future. The side effects post vaccination including injection site pain,&#xD;
      fatigue, headache, myalgia, chills, arthralgia, fever, and so on. Incidence of side effects&#xD;
      more frequent in young people than elders; more frequent in the first dose than second dose&#xD;
      in AZ vaccine; more frequent in the second dose in Moderna or Pfizer/BNT vaccine. Taiwan&#xD;
      V-watch is a system monitored by CDC for people proactive notification of side effects post&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccination. But it doesn't include the objective cardiovascular parameters, for&#xD;
      example, heart rate, arrhythmia, blood pressure, central body temperature (ear temperature)&#xD;
      and blood oxygen saturation level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to monitor the physiologic and psychologic effects, and side effects before&#xD;
      and after COVID-19 vaccination in patients at high cardiovascular risk, including&#xD;
      hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes, and arrhythmia or coronary artery disease.&#xD;
      The investigators arrange two weeks of continuous home BP/HR monitoring (7 days pre- and&#xD;
      post-vaccination) for evaluation of physiologic effects post vaccination. Due to fever noted&#xD;
      in some people post-vaccination, the investigators also measure ear temperature, pulse&#xD;
      oximetry, and environmental temperature and humidity, for the reference of BP monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, this study may provide important information of cardiovascular response and&#xD;
      psychosocial effects after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination for proactive prevention of cardiovascular&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
