  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to examine Go&amp;Grow as a social exergame intervention to increase&#xD;
      physical activity and social support, to promote well-being in family caregivers, and to test&#xD;
      social support and physical activity as mechanisms for the effects of the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a 2-week baseline and 6-week intervention aimed at comparing the feasibility and&#xD;
      efficacy of an exergame (Go&amp;Grow without social contact components) and a social exergame&#xD;
      (full version of Go&amp;Grow) in promoting physical activity, social support, and well-being in&#xD;
      family caregivers. The study also seeks to test social support and physical activity as&#xD;
      mechanisms for the relationships between condition (exergame non-social vs social exergame)&#xD;
      and wellbeing. Participants will be randomly assigned using a random assignment generator to&#xD;
      either the control condition (exergame non-social) or the treatment condition (social&#xD;
      exergame) on a rolling basis. Participants from both conditions will be reminded daily via&#xD;
      app-based notifications during the intervention period to wear their Fitbit and to play the&#xD;
      game.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Pretest (before week 1) and posttest (after week 8), and at the end of every week from week 1 to week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The UCLA Loneliness Scale captures one's subjective feelings of loneliness over the past week for weekly surveys and over the past month for pretest and posttest surveys (20 items with ratings from 1 &quot;Never&quot; to 4 &quot;Often&quot;). A higher score indicates more loneliness (Russell, 1996).</description>

    <time_frame>Pretest (before week 1) and posttest (after week 8), and at the end of every week from week 1 to week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) (20 items) asks participants to report how often participants felt positive and negative feelings over the past week for weekly surveys, and over the past month for pre-test and post-test surveys (Total positive and negative affect scores can range from 10 - 50, with a higher score indicating a higher level of positive affect or negative affect) (Watson et al., 1988).</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Change in Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pretest (before week 1) and posttest (after week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) asks participants' stress perception over the last month (Possible scores will range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating higher stress) (Cohen et al., 1994).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of every week from week 1 to week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) captures participants' psychological distress over the past week (Total score will range from 0-72, with higher scores indicating more stress) (Derogatis, 1975).</description>

    <measure>Change in Caregiver's Stress Scale (Pearlin et al., 1990)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pretest (before week 1) and posttest (after week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver's Stress Scale (Pearlin et al., 1990) has a series of 15 scales based on a conceptual model of caregivers' stress. Each scale ranges from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree), and each scale will be averaged so that higher scores would indicate higher stress.</description>

    <time_frame>Pretest (before week 1) and posttest (after week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>International Physical Activity Questionnaire - Short Version (IPAQ-short; Craig et al., 2003). A continuous score will be calculated expressed as MET (Metabolic Equivalents) minutes per week: Total MET-min/week = (Walk METs*min*days) + (Mod METs*min*days) + Vig METs*min*days). A higher score indicates higher level of physical activity.</description>

Items are assessed from 1 (very sure) to 4 (not at all sure). A mean across all items will be calculated. A higher score indicates lower exercise self-efficacy.</description>
