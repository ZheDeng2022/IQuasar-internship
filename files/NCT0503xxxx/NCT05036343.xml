  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the use of the InPen® for teens and young adults up to&#xD;
      age 21 years with type 1 diabetes helps to decrease burden and improve glycemic control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Investigators will perform a randomized, cross-over prospective interventional study. Half of&#xD;
      the participants will be randomized to the InPen® and the other half will continue with their&#xD;
      conventional insulin injection protocol. After 90 days, participants will switch to the&#xD;
      second arm. Randomization will occur via block randomization. Teaching to use the InPen® will&#xD;
      be done by Sarah Jackson, DO with supervision by Ana Creo, MD, which can be done by a&#xD;
      telemedicine visit if it does not align with clinic visit. You will be followed for three&#xD;
      months with hemoglobin A1c at the beginning and the end of the study. Data from the CGM and&#xD;
      InPen® will be analyzed including time in glucose goal range (70-180 mg/dL), glucose standard&#xD;
      deviation, percentage of time that is spent high (&gt;180-250 mg/dL), very high(&gt; 250 mg/dL),&#xD;
      low(54-70 mg/dL) and very low(&lt;54 mg/dL), along with total daily insulin dose. Data on missed&#xD;
      insulin doses will be assessed via data from the InPen®. You will be randomized to&#xD;
      traditional injections we will ask them to record missed insulin doses weekly. You should&#xD;
      still adjust insulin doses at home, like they do at baseline. If insulin adjustments are made&#xD;
      while in one arm of the study they should still continue that dosing when they cross over.&#xD;
      Investigators will also assess quality of life and fatigue related to technology with surveys&#xD;
      prior to start of the study and at the end. Specifically, investigators will assess diabetes&#xD;
      distress, transition readiness, and parental experience of childhood illness scales.&#xD;
      Investigators will also utilize the insulin delivery satisfaction survey to assess how you&#xD;
      view your current regimen and then how you view the effects of the InPen in managing your&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes.&#xD;

    <description>A smartpen that has been FDA approved for children with diabetes age seven years and older that uses an app on a smartphone to help calculate insulin doses using the amount of carbohydrates that will be consumed at a meal along with what the current blood sugar reading is, to give a correction dose as well. The InPen app also serves as a log book to record insulin doses given, blood sugar at the time of a meal, and amount of carbohydrate eaten.</description>
