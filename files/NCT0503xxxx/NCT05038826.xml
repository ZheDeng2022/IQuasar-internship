      Double reads in blinded independent central reviews (BICRs) are recommended to control the&#xD;
      quality of trials but they are prone to discordances. We analyzed inter-reader discordances&#xD;
      in a pool of lung cancer trials using RECIST 1.1.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the past decade, the lung cancer treatment landscape has dramatically evolved,&#xD;
      increasingly branching out thanks to better understanding of disease mechanisms of action,&#xD;
      novel technologies, and some amount of serendipity in drug development. Today, approximately&#xD;
      2500 clinical trials registered on clinicaltrial.gov are about to recruit or are actively&#xD;
      recruiting in order to investigate new therapeutics of lung cancer, offering new hope to&#xD;
      patients for better survival and for improvements in quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinded independent central reviews (BICRs) are advocated in clinical trials to&#xD;
      in-dependently verify endpoints and control bias that might result from errors in response or&#xD;
      progression assessments. In the BICR settings with double reads, the medical images are&#xD;
      reviewed by two independent readers blinded to the results of the other reader, the study&#xD;
      treatment, the investigator assessment, and some pre-defined clinical information. The&#xD;
      double-reading paradigm creates the possibility for discordance between the two readers;&#xD;
      therefore, a third radiologist is involved to make the final decision of the evaluation&#xD;
      outcome. The monitoring of reader performance is required by regulatory bodies to ensure data&#xD;
      quality and reliability. At the trial level, a high adjudication rate could be an alert of&#xD;
      poor quality at the study level, and a low number of endorsements from a given reader would&#xD;
      raise concerns about the reliability of that specific reader. Therefore, relevant key&#xD;
      performance indicators (KPIs) must be designed and implemented before starting the reads;&#xD;
      these allow the study monitor to trigger corrective actions accordingly. A pooled analysis of&#xD;
      79 oncology clinical trials showed that the proportion of cases requiring adjudication among&#xD;
      the 11 lung cancer trials included in the analysis was 38% (95% CI: 37-40%). However, this&#xD;
      study was general to all cancer types and did not included details on discrepancy root cause&#xD;
      or recently approved novel therapeutics. Considering the atypical response patterns provided&#xD;
      by those drugs, we thought it prudent to provide an update on reader performance specific to&#xD;
      new therapeutics in lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focusing on BICRs in assessing novel drugs, the aim of this study was to analyze a pool of&#xD;
      lung trials using RECIST 1.1, document the proportion of reader discrepancies, and provide&#xD;
      suggestions to aid in improving the read consistency of future trials by estimating relevant&#xD;
      KPIs.&#xD;

        Patient diagnosed with lung cancer and included in a clinical trial between 2017 and 2021.&#xD;
        Assessments of read discordance are part of the quality program that tracks any inherent&#xD;
        reader variability. Monitoring processes usually rely on several read performance KPIs,&#xD;
        including the inter-reader discordance rate, the adjudication rate, the endorsement rate,&#xD;
        and the error rate used to identify reader outliers. The adjudicator and the medical&#xD;
        monitor document every discrepancy event along with the possible root causes, which here&#xD;
        included four RECIST-derived categories along with two operationally based causes. These&#xD;
        discordances were also categorized ac-cording to the type of expected discordance: &quot;read&#xD;
        error&quot; or &quot;medically justifiable difference&quot;.&#xD;
