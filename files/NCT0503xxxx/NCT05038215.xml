  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea is a chronic condition that has serious health consequences including&#xD;
      increased risk of hypertension, type-2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke and reduced life&#xD;
      expectancy. This study proposes to use behavioral reinforcement and support to increase&#xD;
      adherence to oral appliance therapy for obstructive sleep apnea. The control group in the&#xD;
      study will receive routine care. In addition, their oral appliance wear time will be&#xD;
      monitored using a sensor built into the appliance. Routine care includes an initial 1-hr&#xD;
      consult, then delivery of the oral appliance (with sensor) and follow-up appointments at 1&#xD;
      week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. The second, experimental group will receive&#xD;
      adherence promotion techniques in addition to routine care. These adherence promotion&#xD;
      techniques can be categorized into 6 methods. 1- spouse/partner included in a patient&#xD;
      counseling session. 2- Educational brochure delivery at follow up appointments. 3- Electronic&#xD;
      reminder/communication system established by patient and provider. 4-Follow up communication&#xD;
      between primary care physician and orthodontist. 5-Celebratory certificate for good adherence&#xD;
      with the oral appliance evaluated at 3 month, and 6 month visits. 6-Gift card delivery, $25,&#xD;
      when patient schedules a follow up with sleep physician. Patients will be followed for within&#xD;
      the research protocol for 6 months. There are no additional risks involved with the research&#xD;
      and the anticipated benefit is to develop methods to increase adherence to treatment for&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea. This will benefit many patients with obstructive sleep apnea who use&#xD;
      oral appliances to control the condition.&#xD;
