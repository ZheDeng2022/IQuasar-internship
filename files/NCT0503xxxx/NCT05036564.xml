  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thi is a prospective and low-intervention clinical trial. We propose to design a panel of&#xD;
      &quot;core&quot; genetic alterations by sequencing Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) DNA in patients with&#xD;
      confirmed or suspicious Primary Central Neurvous System Lymphoma (PCNSL) with the aim to&#xD;
      improve diagnostic sensitivity, response assessment and monitoring early CNS relapse in&#xD;
      routine practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will receive conventional treatments according to well-established&#xD;
      international guidelines, DNA assessments will not influence the treatment choices.&#xD;

  <arm_group>

    <arm_group_type>Other</arm_group_type>
    <description>Pts with suspicion of secondary CNS lymphoma, that includes subjects with DLBCL and involvement of the CNS at presentation in association with systemic disease, or subjects with systemic DLBCL and CNS relapse during or after primary therapy.&#xD;
Pts with histological diagnosis of systemic DLBCL at high risk of CNS relapse according to Institutional guidelines and patients with histological diagnosis of systemic high grade B cell lymphoma, according to 2017 WHO classification;&#xD;
pts affected by neurological disorders that are usually differential diagnosis of PCNSL (i.e. neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders, toxic or infective encephalitis, other primary CNS tumors).</description>

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Lumbar puncture</intervention_name>
    <description>A lumbar puncture (spinal tap) is performed in patient lower back, in the lumbar region.&#xD;
During a lumbar puncture, a needle is inserted between two lumbar bones (vertebrae) to remove a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This is the fluid that surrounds brain and spinal cord to protect them from injury.&#xD;
This procedure is usually performed at the time of diagnosis for disease staging and/or repeated in the course of the disease history, only if positive or for clinical reasons (i.e. suspicious of relapse progression).&#xD;
In this study sequential CSF and peripheral blood samples of study population will be collected also at different time points, with the aim to improve diagnostics sensitivity, response assessment and monitoring early CNS relapse.</description>
