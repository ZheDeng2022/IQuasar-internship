  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caries is a biofilm-mediated global public health problem causing health, social and economic&#xD;
      consequences for individuals, communities and countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances is associated with impaired oral hygiene. This&#xD;
      results in a demineralization of the enamel (white spot lesions). The prevalence is fairly&#xD;
      high (30-50%) among adolescents and self-applied fluorides cannot completely prevent such&#xD;
      lesions. It is therefore important to investigate novel approaches to combat these unwanted&#xD;
      adverse effects. A systematic review has suggested that mouthwashes may be suitable&#xD;
      technology to control biofilm accumulation in orthodontic patients. The aim of the present&#xD;
      pilot study is to evaluate the effect of a novel mouth rinse containing a blend of natural&#xD;
      enzymes in addition to fluoride on the presence of oral biofilm in patients undergoing&#xD;
      treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances.&#xD;

      Study design A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled design with two parallel groups&#xD;
      will be performed. The null hypothesis is that the effect on the dental biofilm of the&#xD;
      experimental mouth rinse will not differ from that of a placebo rinse without active enzymes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients Adolescent patients (14-18 years) attending the Orthodontic specialist clinic in&#xD;
      Karlshamn, Sweden will be invited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The patients are randomly allocated to the test group or the control group with aid&#xD;
      of computer-generated random number. After the baseline clinical registration, the&#xD;
      participants are instructed to thoroughly rinse their mouth by swishing the mouth rinse&#xD;
      around the teeth twice daily (morning and evening) for 30 seconds. 10 mL of the assigned&#xD;
      solution should be used at each occasion. After rinsing, the subjects should spit out but no&#xD;
      additional rinsing with water is allowed afterwards. The duration of the intervention is one&#xD;
      week and the patients are instructed to brush their teeth twice daily using a 1,450 ppm&#xD;
      fluoride toothpaste. The test and the placebo mouth rinses should be separated from the daily&#xD;
      tooth brushing with at least 30 minutes. The patients are provided with a standardized&#xD;
      enzyme-free toothpaste to be used during the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The water-based test rinse contains a blend of enzymes in an aqueous solution.&#xD;
      The safety evaluation of the three enzymes is tested. The control (placebo) rinse has an&#xD;
      identical taste, color and texture but contains no enzymes. The solutions are provided in&#xD;
      color-coded tubes, each containing exactly 10 mL of the test or placebo mouth rinse. An&#xD;
      independent monitor based at Malmö University but not involved in the project will guarantee&#xD;
      the allocation concealment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods All clinical data are processed with the IBM-SPSS software (version 25.0,&#xD;
      Chicago, USA). Descriptive analyses will be performed with continuous and categorical data.&#xD;
      Differences between and within the groups are compared with unpaired and paired tests,&#xD;
      respectively. A p-value less than 0.05 is regarded as statistically significant. The&#xD;
      statistical calculations are completed before the group allocation is unveiled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation There are no previous clinical data available on the biofilm response to&#xD;
      the experimental mouth rinse and this pilot study will form the basis of future sample-size&#xD;
      calculations. A mean difference of 0.5 units (SD 0.4) is considered as clinically meaningful&#xD;
      and an estimation based on α=0.05 and β=0.8 indicate that 20 patients in each group needs to&#xD;
      be enrolled to the pilot project.&#xD;
