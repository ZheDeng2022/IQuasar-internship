Receive at least 3 cycles of combined treatment, and perform imaging evaluation after 3 cycles of treatment. If surgical treatment is not possible, imaging evaluation will be performed every two cycles thereafter until surgical treatment is feasible. If more than 7 cycles are still not possible for surgical resection, enter Tislelizumab + Lenvatinib maintenance treatment until the disease progresses or the toxicity cannot be tolerated.&#xD;
If patients undergoing R0 resection, start to receive Tislelizumab + Lenvatinib+Gemox regimen in 4-8 weeks after surgery for 7 cycles, and then entered Tislelizumab+Lenvatinib for 1 year or disease progression or toxicity cannot be tolerated</description>
