      This study's goal is to partner with public libraries to prevent substance use and sexual&#xD;
      risk-taking among urban African American adolescents (ages 13-16) affected by parental drug&#xD;
      use. An existing universal evidence-based intervention (Focus on Youth with Informed Parents&#xD;
      and Children Together, abbreviated as FOY+ImPACT) will be adapted for adolescents affected by&#xD;
      parental drug use and delivered in libraries. FOY+ImPACT is a skill-building intervention&#xD;
      aimed at preventing substance use and sexual risk-taking among high-risk African American&#xD;
      youth. The investigative team will conduct a pilot study to assess the feasibility and&#xD;
      initial efficacy of a library-based prevention intervention for adolescents affected by drug&#xD;
      use. Participants will be Black adolescents (13-16 years old) affected by parental drug use&#xD;
      (N=120). Adolescents will be randomized by partner organization to receive the intervention&#xD;
      virtually. Pre, Post and 3-month follow-up data will be collected using computerized surveys.&#xD;
      Primary outcomes will be substance use (i.e., marijuana and alcohol use, two of the most&#xD;
      common drugs for this age group) and sexual risk behaviors (i.e., initiation of sex and&#xD;
      frequency of unprotected sex).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With nearly 17,000 public libraries nationwide and four million visits each day, libraries&#xD;
      have extensive population reach. Libraries are an ideal partner because they are stable,&#xD;
      safe, accessible, confidential community spaces with a low barrier to entry and&#xD;
      non-judgmental staff. This study's goal is to partner with public libraries to prevent&#xD;
      substance use and sexual risk-taking among urban African American adolescents (ages 13-16)&#xD;
      affected by parental drug use. An existing universal evidence-based intervention (Focus on&#xD;
      Youth with Informed Parents and Children Together, abbreviated as FOY+ImPACT) will be adapted&#xD;
      for adolescents affected by parental drug use and delivered in libraries. FOY+ImPACT is a&#xD;
      skill-building intervention aimed at preventing substance use and sexual risk-taking among&#xD;
      high-risk African American youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, a 'parent with a history of drug use' is defined as a biological parent who&#xD;
      abused an illicit drug for longer than 1 month in the past 2 years. This group includes&#xD;
      parents in recent recovery and those enrolled in substance abuse treatment programs. Many&#xD;
      youth affected by parental drug use live with someone who does not use drugs, extended family&#xD;
      members, or are in the care of social services. Thus, primary caregivers will be eligible to&#xD;
      participate in the absence of a biological parent. A 'primary caregiver', is defined as a&#xD;
      person who regularly provides care for a child that is not their birth child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigative team will conduct a pilot study to assess the feasibility and initial&#xD;
      efficacy of a library-based prevention intervention for adolescents affected by drug use.&#xD;
      Participants will be Black adolescents (13-16 years old) affected by parental drug use&#xD;
      (N=120). Adolescents will be randomized by partner organization to receive the intervention&#xD;
      virtually. Pre, Post and 3-month follow-up data will be collected using computerized surveys.&#xD;
      Primary outcomes will be substance use (i.e., marijuana and alcohol use, two of the most&#xD;
      common drugs for this age group) and sexual risk behaviors (i.e., initiation of sex and&#xD;
      frequency of unprotected sex).&#xD;

    <description>The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey (YRBS) monitors six categories of health-related behaviors that contribute to the leading causes of death and disability among youth and adults, including alcohol and other drug use. The survey asks about frequency current use (i.e., number of days in the past 30 days) of alcohol and other drugs. Responses for each substance can be &quot;0 days&quot;, &quot;1 or 2 days&quot;, &quot;3 to 5 days&quot;, &quot;6 to 9 days&quot;, &quot;10 to 19 days&quot;, &quot;20 to 29 days&quot;, or &quot;all 30 days&quot;.</description>

    <description>The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey (YRBS) monitors six categories of health-related behaviors that contribute to the leading causes of death and disability among youth and adults, including Sexual behaviors related to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV infection. The survey asks about initiation of sex and frequency of unprotected sex. Responses for sexual initiation are &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. Responses for other contraceptive use at last sex are &quot;I have never had sexual intercourse &quot;, &quot;No method was used to prevent pregnancy&quot;, &quot;birth control pills&quot;, &quot;Condoms&quot;, &quot;An intrauterine device (IUD, such as Mirena or ParaGard) or implant (such as Implanon or Nexplanon)&quot;, &quot;A shot (such as Depo-Provera)&quot;, &quot;patch (such as Ortho Evra), or birth control ring (such as NuvaRing)&quot;, &quot;Withdrawal or some other method&quot;, and &quot;Not sure&quot;.</description>
