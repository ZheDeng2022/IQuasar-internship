    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate muscle stiffness in relation to muscle damaging&#xD;
      work and to investigate how well the change in muscle stiffness correlates with the degree of&#xD;
      muscle damage (myofibrillar disruption and necrosis). To date, the reduction in&#xD;
      force-generating capacity is the best non-invasive marker of muscle damage. It is already&#xD;
      established that muscle stiffness correlates well with the decline force-generating capacity&#xD;
      after damaging exercise. However, the correlation between degree of muscle damage and muscle&#xD;
      stiffness has not yet been investigated. The main focus of this study is therefore to&#xD;
      investigate the relationship between muscle stiffness and muscle damage. Further, the&#xD;
      researchers aim to investigate how calcium cycling is affected by damaging work, and if&#xD;
      impaired calcium cycling may partially explain the observed reduction in force-generating&#xD;
      capacity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Regardless of whether an individual is in rehabilitation or exercise for general health or&#xD;
      athletic performance, resistance exercise is an essential form of exercise when the goal is&#xD;
      to increase muscle mass, strength and function. Although, resistance exercise primarily is&#xD;
      associated with positive effects it may also result in muscle damage when the exercise is of&#xD;
      high intensity and/or unaccustomed. This is known as exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD)&#xD;
      and is reflected by a substantial decrease in force-generating capacity and often accompanied&#xD;
      by intracellular swelling and delayed onset muscle soreness. On a cellular level, EIMD&#xD;
      include myofibrillar disruption, inflammatory response and in severe cases of EIMD; myofibre&#xD;
      necrosis. While EIMD with its symptoms clearly is evident, its underlying mechanisms are&#xD;
      still to be fully elaborated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One interesting hypothesis regarding the molecular basis of decreased muscle strength as a&#xD;
      result of EIMD, is related to the strain of this exercise mode causing &quot;popped&quot; sarcomeres.&#xD;
      When sarcomeres are stretched beyond actin-myosin overlap, some sarcomeres may over-stretch.&#xD;
      This results in overload of membranes, leading to opening of stretch-activated channels, and&#xD;
      subsequently influx of Ca2+. High levels of cytoplasmic Ca2+ may cause degradation of&#xD;
      contractile proteins or Excitation-Contraction coupling proteins mediated through increased&#xD;
      calpain activity. However, a recent study by Cully and colleagues (2017) suggest a protective&#xD;
      mechanism post heavy-load strength training related to Ca2+-handling. Cully et al. observed&#xD;
      formation of vacuoles in longitudinally connecting tubules post exercise when exposing fibers&#xD;
      to 1.3 μM [Ca2+] in the cytoplasma. These vacuoles provide an enclosed compartment where Ca2+&#xD;
      can be accumulated, preventing Ca2+ from initiating damage to the muscle. The role of&#xD;
      Ca2+-regulation in recovery of muscle function warrants further investigation and&#xD;
      clarification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of the investigators knowledge, the most valid method for estimating EIMD is by&#xD;
      investigating myofibrillar disruption, and in some cases necrosis, in muscle biopsies. This&#xD;
      requires many resources and is rather expensive. Currently, the best non-invasive marker of&#xD;
      muscle damage is the force deficit observed at 48 hours post exercise. However, a measurement&#xD;
      estimating muscle damage immediately post exercise is warranted because force deficit&#xD;
      immediately post exercise will be confounded by muscle fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A novel study performed by Lacourpaille et al. (2017) showed a strong negative correlation&#xD;
      (-0.80) between stiffness of the muscle tissue, shear modulus, measured 30 minutes post&#xD;
      exercise and peak isometric force measured at 48 hours post exercise and therefore a strong&#xD;
      relationship between the decline in force production capacity and increased stiffness post&#xD;
      exercise, suggesting a possible method to predict EIMD immediately after exercise. However,&#xD;
      direct evidence of this association is warranted, with measurements of shear modulus and EIMD&#xD;
      biomarkers, such as the proportion of disrupted fibers and sarcoplasmic Ca2+ regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to predict EIMD after training is of great interest to athletes, but also&#xD;
      patients suffering from e.g. muscular dystrophies. Being able to predict EIMD quickly and&#xD;
      non-invasively after exercise will help employ optimal recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to investigate the link between exercise-induced muscle damage&#xD;
      (EIMD) as changes in shear modulus by ultrasound shear wave elastography, and muscle damage&#xD;
      as observed in the analysis of muscle biopsies. Our hypothesis is that there is a strong&#xD;
      relationship between muscle stiffness acute post exercise and degree of muscle damage&#xD;
      observed in muscle biopsies. A secondary aim is to further the understanding of cellular&#xD;
      mechanisms causing EIMD and the role of Ca2+ in the recovery of muscle function.&#xD;
