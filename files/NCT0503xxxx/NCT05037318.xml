  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breaking bad news (e.g., telling patients that they have cancer) is not only very stressful&#xD;
      for the patients concerned, but also for the physicians delivering the diagnosis. It is&#xD;
      unclear how this burden and the associated communication performance can be optimized. The&#xD;
      project contributes to this goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of the project is to scientifically analyze to what extent the stress reaction&#xD;
      and communication performance of medical students can be optimized when breaking bad news.&#xD;
      Two strategies will be employed and tested for their effectiveness: First, &quot;stress arousal&#xD;
      reappraisal&quot;, which consists in reinterpreting physiological arousal (e.g., increased heart&#xD;
      rate) as adaptive and beneficial for task performance. Second, medical students can be well&#xD;
      prepared for breaking bad news by learning from worked examples (step-by-step demonstrations&#xD;
      of how to break bad news).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that both strategies will shift the interpretation of breaking&#xD;
      bad news from a threat to a challenge state. This will lead to better communication&#xD;
      performance during the task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the hypothesis, about 200 medical students' communication performance, cardiovascular&#xD;
      activity, stress hormone release, and subjective stress perception when communicating a&#xD;
      serious cancer diagnosis to a simulated patient (actor) will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the study provide a first comprehensive picture of the psychophysiological&#xD;
      stress patterns of medical students who are entrusted with a stressful communication task.&#xD;
      Ultimately, this may promote stress management and communication skills in future physicians.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Breaking bad news (BBN; e.g., telling patients that they have cancer) is a frequent task in&#xD;
      the medical field. Appropriate communication when BBN is crucial for patient-related&#xD;
      outcomes. For many physicians, BBN is a very demanding task often associated with high levels&#xD;
      of stress, which can negatively impact their communication skills and health. It is thus&#xD;
      important to provide future physicians with effective tools that enable them to cope&#xD;
      successfully with their stress response and to perform the BBN task at their best. The&#xD;
      planned project aims to contribute to this important goal in novel ways. One promising&#xD;
      approach to improve people's stress response to demanding tasks is stress arousal&#xD;
      reappraisal, which consists in reinterpreting physiological arousal as adaptive and&#xD;
      beneficial for task performance. Recent work suggests that medical students can be well&#xD;
      prepared for BBN by learning from worked examples (step-by-step demonstrations of how to&#xD;
      break bad news).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall objectives: The study adopts the biopsychosocial model (BPSM) of challenge and threat&#xD;
      as organizing theoretical framework to investigate the effects of stress arousal reappraisal&#xD;
      and preparatory worked example-based BBN learning on the psychophysiological responses and&#xD;
      communication skills performance of medical students tasked with BBN to simulated patients&#xD;
      (SPs). The BPSM of challenge and threat holds that individuals are in a threat state when&#xD;
      perceived resources fall short of perceived demands in a motivated performance situation,&#xD;
      whereas they are in a challenge state when evaluated resources outweigh perceived demands.&#xD;
      These states are primarily assessed with a self-reported resources-demands differential&#xD;
      (perceived resources minus perceived demands) and a cardiovascular index (sum of cardiac&#xD;
      output and reverse scored total peripheral resistance), with larger scores reflecting greater&#xD;
      challenge. Secondarily, as suggested by recent research, they are also associated with&#xD;
      salivary indices of the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (cortisol and&#xD;
      dehydroepiandrosterone) and of the sympatho-adrenal-medullary system (alpha-amylase).&#xD;
      Compared to threats, challenge-type responses are associated with better task performance and&#xD;
      better health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims: The idea guiding the planned research is that both stress arousal reappraisal&#xD;
      and preparatory worked example-based BBN learning will shift medical students'&#xD;
      psychophysiological state from threat to challenge and by doing so their task performance&#xD;
      will improve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses are: 1) students receiving stress arousal reappraisal instructions will show&#xD;
      (i) more challenge-type psychophysiological responses and (ii) better BBN skills performance&#xD;
      than students receiving no stress arousal reappraisal instructions; 2) students learning from&#xD;
      a BBN-related worked example will show (iii) more challenge-type psychophysiological&#xD;
      responses and (iv) better BBN skills performance than students not learning from a&#xD;
      BBN-related worked example; 3) the challenge-threat resources-demands differential and&#xD;
      cardiovascular index will be mediators of the effects of the interventions on BBN skills&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: A randomized controlled trial with a 2 (stress arousal reappraisal vs. no stress&#xD;
      arousal reappraisal) x 2 (preparatory BBN learning with worked example vs. without worked&#xD;
      example) between-subjects design with N = 200 Swiss medical students is envisioned. The&#xD;
      investigators will assess participants' perceived task demands and coping resources, record&#xD;
      their cardiovascular activity and collect their saliva before, during and after a videotaped&#xD;
      BBN encounter with an SP. Three assessors will independently rate participants' BBN skills&#xD;
      performance from the recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications and relevance: Findings will support determining to what extent medical&#xD;
      students' BBN-related stress responses and communication performance can be examined and&#xD;
      understood from the challenge and threat perspective. Stress arousal reappraisal and&#xD;
      preparatory worked example-based learning could be easily incorporated into the curriculum of&#xD;
      medical students to help promote more adaptive challenge-type responses when facing BBN&#xD;
      situations and potentially other stress-inducing communications with patients. This would&#xD;
      ultimately have beneficial effects for both physicians and patients.&#xD;
