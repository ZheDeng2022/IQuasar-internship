  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as persistent abnormalities of kidney structure or&#xD;
      function for more than 3 months leading to a sustained reduction in glomerular filtration&#xD;
      rate (GFR) and/or to the occurrence of kidney damage markers, such as albuminuria. [1] CKD is&#xD;
      an emerging global public health problem, having significant morbidity and mortality costs on&#xD;
      society. It is considered as an important component of the epidemic of non-communicable&#xD;
      diseases in developed, as well as low-income/middle-income countries. [2] In the Kingdom of&#xD;
      Saudi Arabia, CKD has been established as a major health issue in recent decades due to the&#xD;
      growing incidence and prevalence of end stage kidney disease (ESKD) among the Saudi&#xD;
      population. The overall prevalence of CKD was 5.7% in 2010. [3] In 2017, there were around&#xD;
      two million cases of CKD and 3818 deaths due to CKD in Saudi Arabia in 2017. [4] A recent&#xD;
      study also reported the overall prevalence of CKD stages 3 to 5 was 4.4% among the Saudi&#xD;
      population. [5] The major consequences of CKD include disease progression and, subsequently,&#xD;
      increased risk of cardiovascular disease.&#xD;

      A cross-sectional study, enrolled 607 Saudi patients, of both sexes, registered for Ha'il&#xD;
      University Medical Polyclinic, Ha'il city, Saudi Arabia, from October 6, 2020 to January 31,&#xD;
      2021. Patients eligible for inclusion in this study included those who were aged 18 years or&#xD;
      older and were diagnosed with hypertension. Hypertension is defined as a systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure (SBP) of 140 mm Hg or more, or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 90 mm Hg or more,&#xD;
      or taking antihypertensive medication or a positive self-reported history of hypertension&#xD;
      (based on a response to the questions &quot;have you ever been told you have high blood pressure&quot;&#xD;
      or &quot;a past history of high blood pressure&quot;).[13] Exclusion criteria included pregnant or&#xD;
      breastfeeding females; history of nephrotoxic drugs use and any case with known cause of CKD&#xD;
      other than hypertension such as diabetes mellitus, polycystic kidney disease, obstructive&#xD;
      uropathy or autoimmune diseases. Among 607 hypertensive patients who underwent health&#xD;
      examinations, 175 patients met the exclusion criteria and were removed from the study. We&#xD;
      also removed 40 patients from the remaining 432 individuals due to missing data, leaving 392&#xD;
      patients for analysis.Minimum sample required for this study was calculated using the&#xD;
      formula: n = z2 [P (1 - P)/(D2)], confidence level at 95 % (z = 1.96), margin of error (D) is&#xD;
      set at 0.05, and (P) is the prevalence of hypertension in adult Saudi population set as 25.5&#xD;
      %. (n = 292). Data was collected through an interview questionnaire. The questionnaire&#xD;
      included sociodemographic variables (age, sex, height, weight, BMI and smoking habit),&#xD;
      hypertension (duration and drugs taken), as well as other chronic comorbidities in addition&#xD;
      to previous family history of renal diseases. This is in addition to the laboratory&#xD;
      investigations and radiological reports collected from the participants during the interview.&#xD;
