  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) has shown its effectiveness for the treatment of acute ischemic&#xD;
      stroke (AIS) related to large vessel occlusion and rapidly became a cornerstone in the&#xD;
      management of these patients. No strong evidence is available on the benefit of MT in AIS&#xD;
      related to more distal occlusions. Some previous observational studies suggested a possible&#xD;
      benefit but most of them were single-centre and retrospective studies providing a very low&#xD;
      level of evidence. To date, no randomized controlled trial has been conducted in this&#xD;
      indication, which represents 10% to 20% of all AIS involving intracranial vessel occlusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is a multicenter open randomized controlled trial with two parallel groups :&#xD;
      best medical treatment alone VS mechanical trombectomy + best medical treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this trial is to assess the efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy in&#xD;
      addition to the best medical treatment as compared to the best medical treatment alone in AIS&#xD;
      related to a distal intracranial artery occlusion. The medical device used will be a stent&#xD;
      retriever among : Trevor NXT ProVue Retriever ; Catchview mini ; pReset Lite ;&#xD;
      Tigertriever13, and the medical treatment used will depend on the stroke's etiology and will&#xD;
      consist of IV trhombolysis or tenecteplase or antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulant therapy&#xD;
      ... The main inclusion criteria are : 1) patients aged ≥ 18 years ; 2) Delay between symptoms&#xD;
      onset and expected groin puncture ≤ 6h ; 3) Symptomatic occlusion as evaluated by a National&#xD;
      Institute of Health Stroke Score (NIHSS) ≥ 5 ; 4) Distal occlusion evaluated on CT&#xD;
      angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and defined as an occlusion in one of&#xD;
      the following segments : a-Distal M2, above the mid-height of the insula, b-M3 segment,&#xD;
      c-Posterior cerebral artery (PCA) = P1, P2 or P3 segment, d-Anterior cerebral artery (ACA) :&#xD;
      A1, A2 or A3 segment ; 5) Written informed consent signed by the patient or the trustworthy&#xD;
      person / family member / close relative, or inclusion in case of emergency and written&#xD;
      informed consent will be signed by the patient (if needed by trustworthy person, family&#xD;
      member or close relative) as soon as possible (article L1122-1-2 of the French Public Health&#xD;
      Code).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives and endpoints are to evaluate the : 1) Success of the procedure&#xD;
      defined as recanalization of the occluded vessel, evaluated on the AOL (Arterial Occlusion&#xD;
      Lesion) score within 48 hours ; 2) Excellent clinical outcome (defined as a modified Rankin&#xD;
      scale [mRS]≤1) at 3 months ; 3) Safety with reporting of all adverse and serious adverse&#xD;
      events with a particular attention to perforation rate, embolus migration in a new territory&#xD;
      and symptomatic hemorrhagic complications ; 4) Death rate up to 3 months ; 5) Cost&#xD;
      effectiveness and utility of the procedure. The study will also evaluate the rate of&#xD;
      angiographic reperfusion in the intervention group on the final angiogram at the end of the&#xD;
      MT (which is part of the intervention) using the modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction&#xD;
      (mTICI) (2B-3) and the eTICI.&#xD;
