      This is a seamless Phase 2/3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, study that comprises 5&#xD;
      substudies designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of etrasimod as&#xD;
      therapy in subjects with moderately to severely active CD who are refractory or intolerant to&#xD;
      at least 1 of the current therapies for CD (ie, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, or&#xD;
      biologics). Subjects who are refractory or intolerant to corticosteroids and/or&#xD;
      immunosuppressants may be either previously exposed to or naïve to biologics. Randomized&#xD;
      subjects will remain on stable doses of 5-aminosalicyclic acid compounds, low-dose oral&#xD;
      corticosteroids, and/or anti-diarrheal medications as background therapy for CD; however,&#xD;
      corticosteroid tapering may be required in subjects who continue treatment beyond the&#xD;
      Induction Period. The 5 substudies are presented in the study schematic and described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy A - Phase 2 (SSA-P2): A Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, substudy to assess the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and efficacy of oral etrasimod therapy in subjects with moderate to&#xD;
      severe CD that supports the selection of an induction and maintenance dose(s) for Phase 3.&#xD;
      Substudy 1 - Phase 2 (SS1-P2b): A Phase 2b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      dose-ranging induction substudy to evaluate etrasimod as induction therapy and select an&#xD;
      induction and maintenance dose(s) for continued evaluation in Phase 3. Substudy 2 - Induction&#xD;
      (SS2-I): A Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled substudy to evaluate&#xD;
      etrasimod as induction therapy. Substudy 3 - Maintenance (SS3-M): A Phase 3 randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled substudy to evaluate etrasimod as maintenance therapy.&#xD;
      Substudy 4 - Long-Term Extension (SS4-E): A long-term extension (LTE) substudy for subjects&#xD;
      who complete at least 52 weeks of treatment.&#xD;

    <masking_description>SSA-P2: This Phase 2 substudy is to evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy in 2 doses of etrasimod with no inferential comparison between groups. SS1-P2b: This substudy is powered to detect a dose-response relationship in the primary endpoint of endoscopic response at Week 14 based on pair-wise comparisons using 2-sample Fisher's exact test with Type I error rate at 0.05 (1-sided).SS2-I: The assumptions for sample size and power calculations are preliminarily based on published data of CDAI &lt; 150. With a 2:1 randomization ratio and a Type I error rate at 0.025 (1-sided), a total sample size of 495 subjects (330 etrasimod, 165 placebo) will achieve 95% power for testing endoscopic response. SS3-M: Only Week 14 etrasimod responders enrolling from induction studies will be part of the formal efficacy analyses. SS4-E: No formal sample size calculations were performed. Since all subjects will enroll from parent studies SSA-P2 and SS3-M,</masking_description>
