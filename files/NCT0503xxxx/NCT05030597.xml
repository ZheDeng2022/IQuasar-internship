  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Positron emission tomography (PET) molecular imaging provides a valuable method for the&#xD;
      diagnosis, differential diagnosis and staging of various tumors. Cancer associated&#xD;
      fibroblasts (CAFs) are the main components of tumor stroma, which are involved in tumor cell&#xD;
      proliferation, invasion, metastasis and tumor angiogenesis, and play an important role in the&#xD;
      occurrence and development of tumors. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is the most&#xD;
      potential specific molecular marker of CAF, which is mainly expressed in stromal fibroblasts&#xD;
      of epithelial tumors and is a potential molecular target for tumor diagnosis and treatment.&#xD;
      Oral cancer is the most common type of malignant head and neck cancer, seriously endangering&#xD;
      human health. Accurate delineation of the primary tumor, detection of regional nodal&#xD;
      metastases, distant metastases and second primary tumors are important for determining the&#xD;
      therapeutic strategy and prognosis of oral cancer. Currently, the molecular imaging agent&#xD;
      most commonly used in clinical practice for oral cancer is 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose&#xD;
      (18F-FDG). However, 18F-FDG exhibits some shortages. Inflammatory lesions and the surrounding&#xD;
      normal tissue such as brain, tonsils and salivary glands show high uptake of 18F-FDG, often&#xD;
      affecting the judgment of lesions. In this prospective study, the investigators will use&#xD;
      integrated PET/CT with the agent 68Ga-FAPI and conventional imaging agent 18F-FDG to explore&#xD;
      the application value of FAP-targeted molecular imaging in the diagnosis and staging for oral&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
