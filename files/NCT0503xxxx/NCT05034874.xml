  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2 study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of monthly intravenous doses of&#xD;
      IXT-m200 in treatment-seeking individuals with methamphetamine (METH) use disorder. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that treatment with IXT-m200 will reduce the occurrence of stimulant-positive&#xD;
      samples compared to placebo (following an initial grace period during which relapses may&#xD;
      occur).&#xD;

    <description>IXT-m200 binds METH with high selectivity and affinity. The product contains a murine METH-binding variable region and the constant domains of a human immunoglobulin G (IgG) 2Îº. This antibody isotype was chosen because of the lower risk of immune response compared to an IgG1 or IgG3. IXT-m200 targets METH, does not rely on binding to any endogenous target for its action, and has been well-tolerated in previous clinical studies.</description>
