  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare safety and efficacy of Endoscopic conventional technique (cyanoacrylate alone) to&#xD;
      the EUS-guided injection technique (coil and cyanoacrylate) in the treatment of gastric&#xD;
      varices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients would be recruited from the endoscopy centre prior to their scheduled endoscopic&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study intervention :- Cyanoacrylate injection and EUS guided coil and glue injection The&#xD;
      procedures would be performed by experienced endoscopists. The procedure would be performed&#xD;
      under conscious sedation or monitored anaesthesia. The procedures would be performed by a&#xD;
      therapeutic endoscope with the through the scope method. The endoscope would be used to reach&#xD;
      the site of Varices. In Conventional technique treatment with cyanoacrylate the injection was&#xD;
      performed using a 23-G sclerotherapy needle catheter (Interject®,Cook). One vial of&#xD;
      N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (0.5 mL) was mixed with Lipiodol® in a 1:1 ratio, and injected&#xD;
      intravesically as a 1 mL bolus. The injection was repeated until total hardening of the&#xD;
      varix. In treatment with coil and cyanoacrylate once the gastric varix was identified, the&#xD;
      total diameter of the vascular pseudotumor was measured and the puncture was made at the site&#xD;
      of the widest varix. The puncture was performed using a 19 G needle (Expect®,Cook). The size&#xD;
      of the coil used was selected based on the size of the widest varix in the pseudotumor; the&#xD;
      size of the coil after release should not be greater than the caliber of the vessel.&#xD;
      Following coil deployment, 2 mL of distilled water was injected, followed by one vial (0.5&#xD;
      mL) of N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate mixed with Lipiodol in 1:1 ratio. Then, another 2 mL of&#xD;
      distilled water was injected, and the needle was removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COIL and GLUE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cyanoacrylate injection remains the conventional treatment method. Since coils were first&#xD;
      used to treat ectopic varices by Levy in 2008(6), this technique has been increasingly&#xD;
      implemented into clinical practice. However, its higher cost has been a limiting factor in&#xD;
      more widespread use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the ectasia of the varix the following coil was deployed: 8 mm x 20 cm, 10 mm x&#xD;
      20 cm, or 10 mm x 30 cm (Interlock-18 Fibered IDC Occlusion System,Cook).&#xD;
&#xD;
      D.2.5 Randomization Patients were randomized into two groups: group I received standard&#xD;
      endoscopic treatment with injection of a cyanoacrylate/Lipiodol (1:1) solution and group II&#xD;
      received EUS-guided coiling and cyanoacrylate injection treatment A computer-based&#xD;
      randomization list was generated with the online software Research Randomizer with 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      (www.randomizer.org). An independent researcher not involved in this trial created the&#xD;
      randomization list and sealed sequential opaque envelopes containing the random allocation&#xD;
      sequence. The complete list generation occurred before the first enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D.2.6 Post-procedural management After the procedure, EUS with Doppler flow evaluation was&#xD;
      repeated to check the presence or absence of flow within the varix. The patients remained&#xD;
      under observation in the GI endoscopy unit for at least one hour, being released if no&#xD;
      complaint was reported. After endoscopic treatment, all patients underwent thoracic and&#xD;
      abdomen computerized tomography (CT) scanning within one week, independent of the development&#xD;
      of clinical symptoms.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients returned to the GI endoscopy unit approximately one month after initial&#xD;
      endoscopic intervention for a repeat EUS evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technical success is defined as complete obliteration of varices and absence of flow&#xD;
      signal.On this occasion, if any residual flow was identified, new treatment was performed&#xD;
      following the same technique initially used, and another evaluation was thus performed one&#xD;
      month later. This scenario was repeated until complete thrombosis was achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications that occurred during the procedure or within seven days post-intervention were&#xD;
      defined as early complications, whereas those that occurred greater than or equal to seven&#xD;
      days post-intervention were defined as late complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrence was defined as evidence of any flow within the varix which occurred after initial&#xD;
      obliteration had been confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.Esophageal stricture 6.Iodine allergy (for EV)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once complete thrombosis was achieved, follow-up evaluations were performed three and nine&#xD;
      months later (i.e. four and 10 months after therapy), at which time patients were questioned&#xD;
      about any post-procedure complications, and underwent another EUS examination, which&#xD;
      permitted repeat evaluations of flow within the treated vessel.&#xD;
