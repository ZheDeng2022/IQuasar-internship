  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of these case studies is to determine the efficacy of the Kinesthetic Awareness&#xD;
      Training (KAT) device in facilitating the restoration of desired movement patterns when&#xD;
      people with acquired central nervous system damage perform functional activities such as&#xD;
      walking, transitioning from one position to another, or reaching with the arms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with acquired neurological disorders often exhibit impaired movement patterns when&#xD;
      performing functional activities such as walking, standing up from a seated position, and&#xD;
      reaching for objects. Re-establishing normal movement patterns is an essential part of&#xD;
      rehabilitation; however, achievement of this typically requires thousands of accurate&#xD;
      movement repetitions. Only through this repetition can a person benefit from the inherent&#xD;
      neuroplasticity of the nervous system to make restored patterns habitual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory and/or proprioceptive problems may limit a person's awareness of ways in which&#xD;
      abnormal movement patterns differ from desired ones. Because of these problems, provision of&#xD;
      external feedback in the form of verbal comments, physical repositioning of the limbs by&#xD;
      another person, or other auditory or haptic cues is critical. As a general rule, a person&#xD;
      benefits most when provided with precise feedback about the position of body parts when&#xD;
      he/she is actively engaged in performing a desired movement. As such, the linking of motion&#xD;
      sensors programmed to detect achievement of a target position with immediate auditory (i.e.,&#xD;
      beeps) and/or haptic (i.e., vibrations) feedback has the potential to be a powerful treatment&#xD;
      tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Kinesthetic Awareness Training (KAT) device developed by PantherTec is a wearable, motion&#xD;
      capture system that can be programmed to detect and provide immediate auditory and/or haptic&#xD;
      feedback when a person moves a specified body part to a target position during performance of&#xD;
      a functional sequence of movements. Each time a person replicates the desired movement, the&#xD;
      device either begins emitting or ceases emitting beeps and/or vibrations-as specified during&#xD;
      programming-to indicate achievement of the correct position. Adjustment of the sensitivity&#xD;
      (i.e., margin of error per target value) allows for specification of how close a performed&#xD;
      movement must be to the target position to elicit feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PantherTec has made a prototype of the KAT device available to Quality Living, Inc. (QLI) for&#xD;
      feasibility testing and exploration of possible applications with people with movement&#xD;
      impairments resulting from acquired neurological injury. The purpose of the proposed case&#xD;
      studies is to determine the efficacy of the KAT device in facilitating the restoration of&#xD;
      desired movement patterns when people with acquired central nervous system damage perform&#xD;
      functional activities such as walking, transitioning from one position to another, or&#xD;
      reaching with the arms.&#xD;

    <measure>Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) in rehabilitation</measure>
    <time_frame>completion of 8-week treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The GAS uses a 5-point rating scale to describe the extent of a participant's goal achievement. Scores for each attainment goal range from -2 (much worse than expected) to +2 (much better than expected). The composite GAS (the sum of attainment levels x the relative weight for each goal) is transformed into a standardized measure or T score with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>System Usability Scale (SUS)</measure>
    <time_frame>completion of 8-week treatment provision period</time_frame>
    <description>The SUS is a feasibility rating scale for that will be used by professional participants to evaluate the KAT device. It includes 10 items with 5 response options ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Scores for odd-numbered items on the scale are calculated by subtracting 1 from the user's rating; scores for even-numbered items on the scale are calculated by subtracting the user's response from 5. This scales all values from 0 to 4, with four being the most positive response. Summing the converted scores and multiplying by 2.5 yields a score between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most positive score.</description>
