  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) has gained acceptance as an effective treatment for&#xD;
      colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) in selected patients, providing similar oncologic outcomes&#xD;
      compared to open liver resection (OLR). A single-center retrospective analysis of a&#xD;
      prospectively maintained database was performed. The primary aim of this study was to&#xD;
      determine prognostic factors for the survival outcomes associated with LLR for CRLM.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LLR was defined as pure LLR, including conversions to OLR. In case of missing data,&#xD;
      additional details were retrieved from the individual patient file. Data on patient&#xD;
      demographics, timing of diagnosis, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), tumor characteristics&#xD;
      (both primary tumor and CRLM), histopathology, molecular characteristics, operative technique&#xD;
      (including classification into anatomically major/technically major/minor LR), intra- and&#xD;
      postoperative course, adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) as well as oncological outcomes (OS and DFS)&#xD;
      were gathered and analyzed. Postoperative complications were graded according to the&#xD;
      Clavien-Dindo classification. Complications were classified as major in case of Clavien-Dindo&#xD;
      â‰¥ 3A.&#xD;
