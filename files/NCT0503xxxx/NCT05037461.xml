      Patients with the Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome are genetically&#xD;
      predisposed for developping multiple pancreatic neuro-endocrine tumours (pNET). The&#xD;
      management of small (pNET) in both MEN1 and sporadic cases, pose a major clinical challenge.&#xD;
      At present, pancreatic surgery is the only curative treatment but it is associated with high&#xD;
      morbidity. To reduce the morbidity ascosiated with surgery and thereby potentially improve&#xD;
      quality of life for MEN1 patients introduction of less invasive techniques for treatment of&#xD;
      pNET is important. High-dose-high precision MR-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) holds promise as a&#xD;
      new less invasive treatment option for pNET. The aim of this study is to assess efficiacy and&#xD;
      safety of MRgRT for treatment of pNET in MEN1 patients.&#xD;

      Background Patients with the Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome are&#xD;
      genetically predisposed for developping multiple pancreatic neuro-endocrine tumours (pNET),&#xD;
      with a cumulative pNET incidence of over 80% at an age of 80 years. In MEN1 patients,&#xD;
      metastatic pNET is the primary cause of premature death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of small (pNET) in both MEN1 and sporadic cases, pose a major clinical&#xD;
      challenge. At present, pancreatic surgery is the only curative treatment. Since surgery is&#xD;
      associated with significant short- and long-term morbidity the management of small pNET&#xD;
      depends on carefully outweighing the risk of liver metastasis leading to premature death and&#xD;
      the morbidity of pancreatic surgery. Guidelines advocate that for tumours smaller than 2 cm&#xD;
      an intensive watchful waiting strategy seems to be safe. However, although most pNETs remain&#xD;
      indolent for years, many lesions eventually progress and metastasize. To prevent the&#xD;
      development of metastases for growing tumours or tumours above 2 cm a surgical resection is&#xD;
      advised. Due to the high incidence of pNET in the MEN1 population many MEN1 patients receive&#xD;
      surgery for pNET in their lifespan and cope with the morbidity of pancreatic surgery. To&#xD;
      reduce the morbidity ascosiated with surgery and thereby potentially improve quality of life&#xD;
      for MEN1 patients introduction of less invasive techniques for treatment of pNET is&#xD;
      important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-dose-high precision MR-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) holds promise as a new less invasive&#xD;
      treatment option for pNET. With MRgRT accurate and precise delivery of high irradiation dose&#xD;
      levels to the pNET is possible, while monitoring the tumor with MR imaging. The UMC Utrecht&#xD;
      has pioneered the development of this technology, and gained experience with MRgRT treatments&#xD;
      for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and other upper abdominal malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim Aim of this project is to assess the safety and efficacy of high-dose-high precision&#xD;
      MRgRT for pNET in a cohort of MEN1 patients that will require surgery in the near future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Efficacy and safety of MRgRT will be explored in a prospective cohort study of MEN1&#xD;
      patients with pNET, the Precision Radiotherapy using MRLInac for Pancreatic Neuroendocrine&#xD;
      Tumours in MEN1 patients (PRIME)study. The PRIME study is a single arm interventional cohort&#xD;
      study, recruiting 20 MEN1 patients enrolled in the Dutch MEN1 Study Groups (DMSG)&#xD;
      longitudinal cohort. Eligible patients are patients with pNET surpassing 2.0 cm, and patients&#xD;
      with a growing pNET measuring between 1.0- 2.0 cm. Patients who give informed consent will&#xD;
      receive MRgRT with a minimum dose to the tumour bed of 40 Gy in 5 fractions delivered within&#xD;
      2 weeks. The primary outcome will be the change in maximum diameter of pNET at follow-up MRI&#xD;
      scan at 12 months after diagnosis. Secondary outcome parameters include incidence of surgical&#xD;
      resection following MRgRT, toxicity of radiotherapy, quality of life, endocrine and exocrine&#xD;
      pancreatic functioning, metastases free survival, overall survival and tumour characteristics&#xD;
      on follow-up MRI.&#xD;

    <description>Radiotherapy for pancreatic NET will be delivered in an image-guided, hypofractionated scheme of 5 fractions of 8 Gy, prescribed to 95% of the planning target volume (PTV). Treatment is delivered on alternate days 2 or 3 times a week with a maximum overall treatment time of 14 days on the 1.5T MR-Linac (Elekta Unity MR-Linac).&#xD;
The Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) is defines as the pNET visible on pre-treatment CT and MRI scan. No clinical target volume (CTV) is used. The PTV is made by adding a 3mm margin to the GTV.&#xD;
The treatment plan is a 9-14 field intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) plan with dose prescribed to 95% of the PTV. While respecting the dose constraints to adjacent tissues</description>
