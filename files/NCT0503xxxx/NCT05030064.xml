  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center trial, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled clinical&#xD;
      intervention study which intends to explore the safety and effectiveness of FMT capsule for&#xD;
      the treatment of ulcerative colitis with depression.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 54 patients with definite diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (light-to-moderate&#xD;
      active period) with depressive state were included. According to the random table, patients&#xD;
      were randomly divided into the FMT capsule group and the placebo group, and received the FMT&#xD;
      capsule and placebo interventions once a week for 4 consecutive times, respectively. The&#xD;
      patients were followed up at the 4th, 8th and 12th week of intervention, and a simple&#xD;
      physical examination was performed to evaluate the patient's condition changes (abdominal&#xD;
      pain degree score, diarrhea frequency, stool characteristics and extraintestinal&#xD;
      manifestations such as skin and joints) and modified Mayo score , IBD-QOL scale, PHQ9, SDS,&#xD;
      HADS, HAMA, HAMD scale, etc. The improvement and effective colonization of the intestinal&#xD;
      flora in the FMT capsule group or the placebo group of patients with depression and IBD were&#xD;
      observed by methods such as 16S rRNA analysis of the intestinal flora In the 12th weeks.&#xD;
