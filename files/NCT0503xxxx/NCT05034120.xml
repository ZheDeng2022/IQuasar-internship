    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, single-dose phase I study, the study is divided into two&#xD;
      stages. The stage 1 is to investigate the absorption, metabolism and excretion of XZP-3621&#xD;
      tablets in healthy Chinese subjects. The stage 2 is to evaluate the effect of food on the&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics of single-dose XZP-3621 tablets in Chinese Healthy Volunteers. In addition,&#xD;
      the safety of XZP-3621 tablets in Chinese Healthy Volunteers will also be evaluated.&#xD;

      Stage 1: 10 healthy adult subjects will be included in the study. Excretion (feces, urine)&#xD;
      and vomit samples will be collected daily and tested for prototype drug and metabolites of&#xD;
      XZP-3621, the metabolites will be identified in all substrates except vomits pose-dose of 400&#xD;
      mg XZP-3621 tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vomit samples collection: Time interval for subject vomit collection (if any) (planned):0~4&#xD;
      h,4~8 h,8~12 h,12~24 h,24~48 h,48~72 h,72~96 h,96~120 h,120~144 h,144~168 h,168~192 h after&#xD;
      taking single XZP-3621 tablet. Samples of all vomits during that time interval will be&#xD;
      collected at each time interval after taking single XZP-3621 tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine samples collection: Time interval for sample collection(planned):24h before taking&#xD;
      single XZP-3621 tablet,0~4 h,4~8 h,8~12 h,12~24 h,24~48 h,48~72 h,72~96 h,96~120 h,120~144&#xD;
      h,144~168 h,168~192 h after taking single XZP-3621 tablet, Urine samples were collected from&#xD;
      each subject at a total of 12 time intervals (Only one urine sample should be collected&#xD;
      within 24 hours before taking single XZP-3621 tablet), Urine volume was accurately recorded&#xD;
      for each time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feces samples collection: Interval of fecal sample collection of subjects (planned):24h&#xD;
      before taking single XZP-3621 tablet,0~24 h,24~48 h,48~72 h,72~96 h,96~120 h,120~144&#xD;
      h,144~168 h,168~192 h after taking single XZP-3621 tablet. Feces samples will be collected&#xD;
      from each subject at a total of 9 time intervals (Only one sample was collected within 24 h&#xD;
      before taking single XZP-3621 tablet), And accurate fecal weight will be recorded for each&#xD;
      time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK blood sample collection: PK blood samples of subjects will be collected before&#xD;
      administration (within 2 h before administration) and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48,&#xD;
      72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 192 h after administration at 18 collection points. Plasma samples for&#xD;
      metabolite identification should be separately packaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: This stage of study will be a randomized, open, three-cycle crossover study to&#xD;
      evaluate the pharmacokinetic effects and safety of a single oral dose of XZP-3621 in healthy&#xD;
      subjects on a high-fat diet versus a standard diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study stage, 24 healthy subjects meeting the requirements of the protocol will be&#xD;
      planned to be enrolled and randomly divided into groups A, B, C, D, E and F at 1:1:1:1:1:1 ,&#xD;
      with 4 subjects in each group. Each subject will undergo three cycles of fasting&#xD;
      administration, high-fat postprandial administration, and standard postprandial&#xD;
      administration (in random order) throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK blood sample collection: PK blood samples will be collected before taking single XZP-3621&#xD;
      tablet (within 2 h before drug administration) and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48, 72,&#xD;
      96, 120, 144, 168, 192 h after taking single XZP-3621 tablet in each cycle, with a total of&#xD;
      18 collection points.&#xD;
