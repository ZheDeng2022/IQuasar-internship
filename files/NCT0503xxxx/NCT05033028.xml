  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatments for opioid addiction exist, but effectiveness is compromised when subjects use&#xD;
      illicit opiates during treatment. Reuse rates during treatment can be high, and reducing&#xD;
      illicit opiate use during treatment has thus recently become a major NIDA policy goal. The&#xD;
      5-minute battery indicates the numerical probability that a patient will reuse illicit&#xD;
      opiates within the next 7-10 days.&#xD;

      The primary goal in this mid-scale clinical trial is to test the hypothesis that clinicians&#xD;
      who use the output of the mobile system to adjust buprenorphine and methadone dosing achieve&#xD;
      lower opiate reuse rates than physicians who provide care-as-usual. The secondary goal is to&#xD;
      examine the usability and desirability of this solution for clinicians with an eye to&#xD;
      usability and large-scale deployment. The third and final goal is to measure the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of this solution from multiple perspectives. If successful it will be&#xD;
      possible to employ an algorithmic and measurement-based approach to OUD treatment with&#xD;
      methadone and buprenorphine which reduces reuse rates and relapse rates amongst OUD patients.&#xD;

    <measure>Proportion of patients will reduce illicit substance reuse rates with PREDICTIVE-DOSING relative to treatment as usual (TAU).</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month visit, 3 months visit, 6 months visit</time_frame>
    <description>This is measured by collecting one salivary drug test every two weeks in addition to any drug testing they may complete as part of their clinical treatment. Once saliva samples are obtained they will be aggregated and sent weekly for analysis by mass spectrometry. The primary outcome from these data will be the number of toxicology tests positive for illicit opioids. These data are count in nature and truncated at both 0 and 12.</description>

    <time_frame>1 month visit, 3 months visit, 6 months visit</time_frame>
