      This is a pilot randomized clinical trial testing an implementation intervention to support&#xD;
      delivery of a smoking cessation app tailored to the needs of those individuals with SMI who&#xD;
      at community mental health programs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Learn to Quit (LTQ), an evidence-based smoking cessation app tailored to the needs of&#xD;
      individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) that demonstrated promising smoking cessation&#xD;
      outcomes in a recent pilot randomized controlled trial (R00 DA037276). In parallel, several&#xD;
      trials demonstrated that widely available social media platforms can be effectively utilized&#xD;
      to enhance the effects of standard of care evidence-based smoking cessation treatments. Both&#xD;
      approaches capitalize on highly scalable digital technologies, and are therefore likely to&#xD;
      have population level impact. Drawing from these two separate programs of research, the&#xD;
      central premise of this proposal is that LTQ, a stand-alone smoking cessation app tailored to&#xD;
      patients with SMI, can be enhanced with peer-support delivered on social media. Therefore,&#xD;
      this proposal seeks to develop and asses the acceptability and feasibility of LTQ-Connect --&#xD;
      the integration of the evidence-based smoking cessation app, LTQ, with social support&#xD;
      delivered via social media -- to boost the efficacy and community reach of digital&#xD;
      therapeutics tailored for patients with SMI. To achieve this goal, we will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) determine the ideal design requirements of an LTQ-Connect integration among smokers with&#xD;
      SMI, and (2) investigate the feasibility of LTQ-Connect in a single group pilot trial. Both&#xD;
      interventions will be combined with nicotine replacement therapy, a safe and widely available&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;

    <description>An adapted version of Online Social Support (OSS) scale for smokers will be used to evaluate self-reported social support from online smoking cessation treatment (LTQapp + Facebook group) The OSS scale is a 14 item scale with choices - 1 disagree a lot, to 4 agree a lot. Scale range 14- 56 with higher score indicating better outcome.</description>
