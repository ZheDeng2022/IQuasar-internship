    <textblock>
      In this study, quantitative characterization of plaque using coronary computed tomographic&#xD;
      angiography (CTA) will be used to determine if women who were treated with intensive medical&#xD;
      therapy have a greater reduction in the amount and type of cholesterol plaque compared to&#xD;
      women receiving usual care and if this results in beneficial changes in clinical symptoms.&#xD;
      The study will provide an understanding of how intensive medical therapy works in providing&#xD;
      clinical benefit in women with nonobstructive plaque.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an ancillary substudy of the WARRIOR Trial (NCT03417388), a multi-site, PROBE design,&#xD;
      that will evaluate an intensive statin/ACE-I (or ARB)/aspirin treatment strategy (IMT) vs.&#xD;
      primary prevention risk factor therapy treatment strategy (UC) in 4,422 symptomatic (chronic&#xD;
      angina or equivalent) women with non-obstructive CAD (&lt;50% diameter narrowing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this ancillary substudy, 400 patients will be recruited from the WARRIOR trial with 200&#xD;
      patients from each of the treatment groups (IMT vs UC). From this cohort, 150 patients per&#xD;
      treatment group, most compliant with WARRIOR protocol will undergo a CTA at the end of 3&#xD;
      years; with changes in plaque and PCAT characteristics quantified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aims are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare changes in coronary plaque characteristics and their hemodynamic significance&#xD;
           using CTA in WARRIOR women treated with IMT vs UC;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare changes in plaque inflammation-related characteristics in PCAT in WARRIOR&#xD;
           women treated with IMT with statin in combination with angiotensin converting enzyme&#xD;
           inhibitor (ACEI) and/or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) medications vs UC;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To relate plaque burden and plaque composition, CT flow reserve, and PCAT density&#xD;
           changes to angina score (Seattle Angina Questionnaire [SAQ]) changes in IMT and&#xD;
           UC-randomized WARRIOR women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be analyzed include CT angiography scans at baseline and Year 3 follow-up and&#xD;
      corresponding study data and laboratory tests (e.g. hsCRP); plus, selected data from the main&#xD;
      WARRIOR study that are relevant to the present ancillary study.&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In addition to the inclusion criteria of the WARRIOR trial, only women who meet the&#xD;
             following criteria will undergo final CTA at the same sites where they are screened&#xD;
             and enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Initial CTA with excellent or good image quality-defined as images where we are able&#xD;
             to clearly identify the atherosclerotic plaque. Based on our preliminary assessment,&#xD;
             we expect 90% of studies to be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable plaque with NCP volume â‰¥ 200mm3; women without significant plaque will not&#xD;
             receive additional radiation, and we can detect measurable changes in plaque burden&#xD;
             and plaque composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In addition to exclusion criteria of the parent WARRIOR trial, key exclusion criteria&#xD;
             are:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-adherent with IMT. The parent trial is already powered for non-adherence. In our&#xD;
             ancillary trial we have built in an exclusion, from final analysis, of an additional&#xD;
             30% who may be nonadherent with IMT or UC.&#xD;
