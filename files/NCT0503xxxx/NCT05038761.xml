  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are looking for a better way to help Chinese people who have diabetes to monitor&#xD;
      their blood sugar situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 2 types of diabetes. In people with type 1 diabetes, the body's immune system&#xD;
      attacks and destroys cells in the pancreas that produce a hormone called insulin. In people&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes, the body does not make enough insulin or does not use insulin well.&#xD;
      This results in high blood sugar (glucose) levels. Over time, high blood sugar levels can&#xD;
      cause damage to certain parts of the body. These include the eyes, the kidneys, the nerves,&#xD;
      and the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are tests and devices available for doctors and patients to measure blood sugar levels.&#xD;
      In order to see if the diabetes treatment is workable to stabilize the blood sugar level,&#xD;
      repeated blood sugar measurement is always needed. Such tracking of the blood sugar is also&#xD;
      called blood sugar monitoring. Blood sugar monitoring tests and devices can however be&#xD;
      difficult to use and one test or device may not work for all patients. Researchers think that&#xD;
      better monitoring systems would help patients improve the control of their blood sugar&#xD;
      levels. This could help to stabilize their blood sugar condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the researchers want to learn more about how well a new monitoring system&#xD;
      called Cascade works in Chinese patients with diabetes. Cascade is a continuous glucose&#xD;
      monitoring system. It regularly measures the level of glucose in the tissue throughout the&#xD;
      day and night. Cascade is made up of a small sensor that patients apply in the belly region&#xD;
      where it is placed just under the skin, into the so-called subcutaneous tissue. The sensor&#xD;
      measures the level of glucose in the fluid that surrounds cells in the subcutaneous tissue.&#xD;
      It also has a transmitter which attaches to the sensor and sends the results via Bluetooth to&#xD;
      a smart device, which can instantly display the glucose level. The glucose level can then be&#xD;
      used to adjust the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to learn how well Cascade monitors glucose levels in&#xD;
      Chinese patients when used in usual practice. To answer this question, the researchers will&#xD;
      compare the glucose levels collected with the Cascade monitor to the blood sugar levels&#xD;
      collected with venous blood glucose testing. This is where a blood sample is taken from the&#xD;
      veins, and then the level of sugar in the blood sample is measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include adult Chinese patients who have type 1 or type 2 diabetes and who the&#xD;
      study doctors think need to monitor their diabetes using Cascade and venous blood glucose&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no study treatments given as part of this study. The patients will be in the&#xD;
      study for up to 18 days. The device will be worn up to a maximum of 14 days. The total&#xD;
      duration of the study will be about 4 months. The patients will get training on how to use&#xD;
      the Cascade monitor and will attach it to their belly area on Day 1 of the study. The&#xD;
      patients will wear Cascade for up to 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will then collect the information about their glucose levels. The study&#xD;
      doctors will also take blood samples and measure blood sugar levels using venous blood&#xD;
      glucose testing. They will compare the sugar levels recorded from the blood samples to the&#xD;
      glucose levels recorded by Cascade at the closest time points. After wearing Cascade for 14&#xD;
      days, the study doctors will remove it from the patients' bellies. About 3 days later, the&#xD;
      researchers will call the patients to check for any discomfort that has happened after the&#xD;
      removal of the Cascade device. The patients may also take photos of the area and send these&#xD;
      to the study doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, the study staff will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  take blood samples as part of the usual care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  compare glucose levels recorded by Cascade to the levels recorded from the venous blood&#xD;
           glucose tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  check the skin for any swelling or areas of rash where Cascade was worn • record any&#xD;
           instances of Cascade errors or malfunctioning&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  record any alarms for when glucose levels are too high or too low&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  check the patients' overall health&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ask the patients about how they are feeling and what medical problems they are having.&#xD;
