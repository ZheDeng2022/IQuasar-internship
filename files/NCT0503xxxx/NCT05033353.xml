    <textblock>
      During (OLV) in (VATS) ; many physiological factors may increase risk of hypoxemia such as&#xD;
      positioning and intrapulmonary shunt thus compromising cerebral blood flow and oxygenation,&#xD;
      resulting in postoperative neurocognitive dysfunctions. The authors hypothesized that&#xD;
      increasing (EtCO2) is the most convenient and powerful method for the management of cerebral&#xD;
      desaturation. Methods: Seventy patients undergoing VATS were enrolled in this randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial. Mechanical ventilation was adjusted to maintain an EtCO2 of 33-38 mm Hg in&#xD;
      group I and an EtCO2 of 39-45 mm Hg in group II. Regional cerebral oxygenation was monitored&#xD;
      using near-infrared spectroscopy (O3TM, Masimo, Irvine, CA) placed on the patient's forehead.&#xD;

      All patients were operated on by the same surgical team. Patients with severe bronchial&#xD;
      asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe renal insufficiency, severe liver&#xD;
      dysfunction, cerebrovascular disease, coagulopathy, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      uncontrolled hypertension or cardiovascular disease, mental disabilities, hearing impairment&#xD;
      were excluded. Patients were seen on the day of surgery in the preoperative area prior to&#xD;
      administration of premedication. A 16 or 18-gauge peripheral venous cannula and a 20-gauge&#xD;
      radial artery were inserted to all patients preoperatively. Randomization was done by sealed&#xD;
      envelope method and the patients were divided into two groups; group I (targeted EtCO2 32-38&#xD;
      mmHg) and group II (targeted EtCO2 39-45 mmHg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the operating room, Patients were monitored by 5 lead electrocardiogram, invasive arterial&#xD;
      blood pressure (IABP) through the arterial catheter and (Masimo®, Irvine, CA) which provides&#xD;
      non-invasive continuous technologies for monitoring and measuring many physiological&#xD;
      variables such as arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate (HR) and hemoglobin&#xD;
      concentration (Hb%) from the (RD Rainbow® SET Pulse Co-Oximeter), end tidal CO2 by capnometer&#xD;
      (Nomoline sampling line Masimo ®, CA), noninvasive blood pressure, body temperature, (O3 ®,&#xD;
      Masimo, Irvine, CA) attached to the patient to provide continuous monitoring of regional&#xD;
      cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) of the two hemispheres by a near-infrared spectroscopy&#xD;
      sensors connected to regional oximetry system. The sensors were placed bilaterally on&#xD;
      patient's forehead after the skin of the forehead had been wiped with an alcohol swab and&#xD;
      allowed to dry as recommended by the manufacturer, and (SedLine ®, Masimo, CA) brain function&#xD;
      monitoring by Patient State Index (PSI) which is a processed EEG parameter affected by the&#xD;
      anesthetic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before general anesthesia, an epidural catheter was inserted at T5, 6 or T6, 7 interspace and&#xD;
      a test dose of 3 ml of 2% lidocaine with epinephrine was given to exclude intrathecal or&#xD;
      intravascular positioning of the catheter, for perioperative administration of 4-8 ml/ h of&#xD;
      bupivacaine 0.125%. After preoxygenation for 2 minutes, anesthesia was induced in all&#xD;
      patients with propofol 1.5-2 mg /kg, fentanyl 3-5 micg/ kg, and rocuronium 0.6-0.8 mg/ kg. A&#xD;
      left-sided double-lumen tube (DLT) (39F for males and 37F for females) (Broncho-Cath;&#xD;
      Mallinckrodt Medical Ltd, Athlone, Ireland) was used for endotracheal intubation and checked&#xD;
      by fibreoptic bronchoscope (Olympus company, Tokyo, Japan) and auscultation. The patient was&#xD;
      then positioned in left or right lateral decubitus position according to the surgical side&#xD;
      and the DLT was rechecked again. Maintenance anesthesia was provided by sevoflurane to keep a&#xD;
      patient state index (Psi) measured by (SedLine, Masimo®, CA) level between 25-50. Additional&#xD;
      doses of fentanyl to a total of 7-15 micg/kg and rocuronium boluses were given to control the&#xD;
      depth of anesthesia and to maintain stable neuromuscular block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, all patients were applied with two-lung ventilation using a constant-flow,&#xD;
      volume-controlled ventilation mode with a tidal volume 8 mL/kg of the actual body weight, an&#xD;
      inspiratory to expiratory (I:E) ratio of 1:2, a respiratory rate of 12 breaths/min, oxygen&#xD;
      flow rate of 1.5 L/min, and FiO2 (fraction of inspiratory oxygen) of 1.0 without PEEP. OLV&#xD;
      was initiated with skin incision, and the tube lumen of the dependent non ventilated lung was&#xD;
      opened to room air. During OLV, tidal volume was reduced to 7 mL/kg, respiratory rate of&#xD;
      12-15 breaths/min, PEEP of 5 cm H2 O, FiO2 of 1.0, oxygen flow rate of 1.5 L/min, I:E 1:2.&#xD;
      Then patients were assigned a ventilation strategy designed to achieve an EtCO2 of 32-3 8mm&#xD;
      Hg or of 39-45mmHg in group I or II respectively throughout the intraoperative period by&#xD;
      (MAQUET FLOW i anesthesia delivery system). This could be achieved by changing the&#xD;
      respiratory rate and inspiratory: expiratory (I:E) ratio . rSO2 values obtained and After&#xD;
      achieving and maintaining the target EtCO2 for 3 minutes baseline %ΔrSO2 was considerd and&#xD;
      recorded every 10 minutes till the end of surgery. Although the data were available to both&#xD;
      the anesthetist, there were no specific recommendations made on possible interventions by the&#xD;
      study team. Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) was monitored using a side stream spirometry&#xD;
      device (MAQUET FLOW-i). If PIP &gt;30 cmH2O, the volume controlled ventilation mode was changed&#xD;
      to a pressure-controlled mode to achieve a targeted VT. Intraoperative fluid replacement by&#xD;
      lactated Ringer's solution or hydroxyethyl starch solution was infused at rate of 8-10&#xD;
      ml/kg/h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      rSPO2, PSi, SpO2, mean BP, and HR were recorded before anesthesia, 5 minutes after&#xD;
      intubation, 5 minutes after putting the patient in lateral position, after initiating OLV,&#xD;
      after achieving and maintaining this target ETCO2 for 3 minutes, and every 10 min till the&#xD;
      end of surgery . Hypotension (defined as more than 20% drop in mean ABP from baseline values&#xD;
      obtained on admission to the operating room) was treated with ephedrine in 4 mg increments.&#xD;
      We used ephedrine rather than phenylephrine as a previous study showed that cerebral oxygen&#xD;
      saturation decreases after phenylephrine but remains unaffected after ephedrine in&#xD;
      anaesthetized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABG analysis by (ABL 800, Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark. PaO2, PaCO2 , pH, serum lactate,&#xD;
      HCO3 concentration, haemoglobin concentration (Hb) ,and sodium and potassium ion&#xD;
      concentrations. ABG was performed before anesthesia, after induction of anesthesia when the&#xD;
      patient was in supine position, after positioning in the lateral decubitus position during&#xD;
      two lung ventilation (TLV), 15 minutes after one lung ventilation (OLV) and every 15 minutes&#xD;
      till the end of surgery. All the patients were in lateral position with head down 10º during&#xD;
      surgery. If SpO2 decreased below 92% and lasted 30 seconds during OLV, surgery was&#xD;
      temporarily interrupted and two-lung ventilation was resumed. At the end of surgery patient&#xD;
      turned supine and neuromuscular block was antagonized with sugamadex 2mg/kg. At the time of&#xD;
      closure of thoracic cavity, two-lung ventilation was started and both lungs were re-expanded&#xD;
      by hand bagging in all patients. Aldrete scores were recorded by post anesthesia care unit&#xD;
      (PACU) nurses blinded to group assignment on arrival to the PACU and then every 15 min&#xD;
      thereafter until discharge from PACU. Patients were followed up for any complications of lung&#xD;
      during their hospital stays. Delirium was assessed using a validated and widely used&#xD;
      Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) rating scale, adapted from Inouye et al, immediately on&#xD;
      arrival to hospital, then within 18-24 hours after surgery. Diagnosis of delirium requires&#xD;
      the presence of both acute onset with fluctuating course and inattention, together with&#xD;
      either disorganized thinking or altered level of consciousness. A single trained interviewer,&#xD;
      blinded to randomization and proficient and trained in CAM, conducted all the assessments&#xD;
      preoperatively when each patient arrived at the hospital and on the next day after surgery.&#xD;
