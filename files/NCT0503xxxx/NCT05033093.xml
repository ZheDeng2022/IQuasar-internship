  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After endodontic procedures, depending on the individual and many variables, postoperative&#xD;
      pain can be occur within hours and continue for days following the treatment. It is thought&#xD;
      that acute inflammation that develops due to chemical, mechanical or microbial injuries in&#xD;
      the periapical tissue after endodontic treatment causes postoperative pain. Materials used&#xD;
      for root canal obturation can reach periodontal tissues through the apical foramen, lateral&#xD;
      canals or leakage and may affect the healing process in the periodontium. For this reason,&#xD;
      knowing the properties of root canal obturation materials is important in terms of preventing&#xD;
      postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calcium silicate-based root canal sealer are recommended to be used as they enhance healing&#xD;
      after endodontic treatment by promoting differentiation of odontoblasts and the release of&#xD;
      bioactive compounds. At the same time, it has been reported that it has less cytotoxic effect&#xD;
      compared to the resin-based AH Plus, which is widely used for root canal). Silicone-based&#xD;
      root canal sealers have good biological properties on human ligament periodontal fibroblasts.&#xD;
      It has been reported that GuttaFlow Bioseal root canal sealer, which has been used in recent&#xD;
      years, has less cytotoxic effect than GuttaFlow2, MTA Fillapex and AH Plus sealers. Ateş et&#xD;
      al.(2019) evaluated that the effects of different root canal sealers on postoperative pain&#xD;
      and reported that the use of iRoot SP or AH Plus did not significantly affect pain levels,&#xD;
      but iRoot SP sealer required less analgesic intake than AH Plus sealer. Aslan et al. (2020)&#xD;
      concluded in their study that calcium silicate and resin-based root canal sealers are similar&#xD;
      in terms of postoperative pain and need for analgesic intake. Ferreira et al.(2020) compared&#xD;
      the effects of AH Plus, Endofill and MTA Fillapex root canal sealers on postoperative pain&#xD;
      and stated that all three root canal sealers cause similar pain levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When reviewing the studies on postoperative pain, it is seen that mostly resin and calcium&#xD;
      silicate based root canal sealers are evaluated. Studies on calcium silicate and&#xD;
      silicone-based root canal sealers seem to focus more on cytotoxicity. However, no study has&#xD;
      been found in the literature on the effect of GuttaFlow Bioseal sealer on postoperative pain,&#xD;
      which has been popularity in recent years and has low cytotoxicity. Acoording to this&#xD;
      information, it is planned to conduct the research described below, on the effect of calcium&#xD;
      silicate-based (iRoot SP), silicone-based (GuttaFlow Bioseal) and rezin-based (AH Plus)&#xD;
      sealer on postoperative pain.&#xD;

      The study is planned to be carried out on 84 patients who were diagnosed and followed up in&#xD;
      Van Yüzüncü Yıl University, Faculty of Dentistry, Department of Endodontics, aged between&#xD;
      18-50 years, without any systemic disease. Patients diagnosed with irreversible pulpitis will&#xD;
      be included in the study group. Patients with periapical lesions and open apex teeth will not&#xD;
      be included in the study group. Before the treatment, pain levels of patients will be record&#xD;
      according to the VAS scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental anesthesia will be achieved using local anesthetic solution (Maxicaine DS fort, Vem,&#xD;
      Istanbul, Turkey) for inferior alveolar nerve blockade. After rubber dam isolation,&#xD;
      endodontic access cavity will be prepared using high-speed burs. The working length will be&#xD;
      determined with using apex locator (Propex Pixi, Dentsply Maillefer) and periapical&#xD;
      radiographs with placing a #15 K-file (VDW GmbH, Munich, Germany) into the root canals at the&#xD;
      end of the apical narrowing. The root canals will be mechanically prepared using ProTaperNext&#xD;
      (DentsplyMaillefer,Baillagues,Switzerland) up to the X3 numbered instrument as standard in&#xD;
      each patient. During instrumentation, irrigation will be performed with 2 mL 5.25% NaOCl&#xD;
      (Microvem AF, İstanbul, Türkey) at each file change. A dental injector and a 27 gauge dental&#xD;
      needle tip will be used for irrigation. The tip of the cannulas will be adjusted to reach&#xD;
      two-thirds of the working size. According to the final irrigation procedure, all canals will&#xD;
      be irrigated with 5 mL of 17% EDTA solution (Imicryl, Konya, Turkey), 5 mL of 5.25% NaOCI&#xD;
      solution and 5 mL of saline, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the final irrigation process root canals will be dried with sterile paper points and&#xD;
      then randomly divided into three main groups according to the root canal sealer (G1: AH Plus;&#xD;
      G2: iRoot SP; G3: GuttaFlow Bioseal) to be used in the obturation process (n: 28). All groups&#xD;
      will be filled with sterile gutta-percha and root canal sealers in the same session using the&#xD;
      single-cone technique. Teeth with completed root canal treatment will be restored with&#xD;
      coronal sealing. After the treatment, patients in all three groups will be asked to report&#xD;
      their pain levels according to the VAS scale at certain intervals (6th hour - 24th hour - 48.&#xD;
      hour - 72. hour - 1st week) and their need of analgesic use. According to the questionnaires&#xD;
      collected with patient feedback, pain levels will be evaluated after root canal treatment&#xD;
      completed in a single session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics in terms of the features emphasized; It will be expressed as Average,&#xD;
      Standard Deviation, Minimum and Maximum value. In order to compare the groups and Times (6,&#xD;
      24, 48, 72nd Hour and 1st Week) in terms of these characteristics, directional analysis of&#xD;
      variance with two factors and one factor repeated, will be used. Duncan test will be used to&#xD;
      identify different groups following analysis of variance. In determining the relationship&#xD;
      between these variables, Pearson correlation coefficients will be calculated separately for&#xD;
      the groups. Statistical significance level will be taken as 5% in calculations and SPSS&#xD;
      statistical package program will be used for calculations.&#xD;
