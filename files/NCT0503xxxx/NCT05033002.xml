  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The inclusion criteria for this study are: (1) women who are living with HIV; (2) age 18&#xD;
        (age of adulthood as defined by the Tanzanian government); (3) able and willing to&#xD;
        voluntarily consent to participate in the study; (4) able to travel to a data collection in&#xD;
        their local community (as described above); (5) demonstrate mental competence at time of&#xD;
        informed consent; (6) verbally indicate that they plan to reside in their current community&#xD;
        for at least 6 months after enrollment (necessary to prevent attrition); and (7) score at&#xD;
        the median or higher level on the Swahili Version of the Multidimensional Measure of&#xD;
        Internalized HIV Stigma Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        At the time of obtaining informed consent, eligible participants will be excluded if there&#xD;
        is (1) any acute psychological or physiological distress; if there is evidence of acute&#xD;
        psychologic and/or physiologic, they will be excluded from this study and referred to an&#xD;
        appropriate site for evaluation and treatment. (2) Transgender women living with HIV will&#xD;
        not be eligible to participate in this study to reduce the potential for confounding&#xD;
        sources of stigma recognizing that a transgender identity is highly stigmatized and&#xD;
        culturally sensitive in Tanzania. Further, it would be exceedingly difficult to recruit a&#xD;
        sufficient sample of transgender women living with HIV to conduct an appropriate analysis.&#xD;
        (3) Participants may be enrolled in other HIV-related studies except cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
        intervention studies addressing stigma, self-efficacy, self-esteem, and/or disclosure&#xD;
