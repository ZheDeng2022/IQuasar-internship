  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a multifactorial degenerative disorder, which if untreated&#xD;
      might lead to catastrophic complications. The treatment for AAA includes open and&#xD;
      endovascular repair, both of which carry a significant degree of risk. Thus, researchers have&#xD;
      performed several studies addressing simple and readily available risk stratification&#xD;
      markers, such as complete blood count in patients undergoing open AAA repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been frequently used as a marker of systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory response, which reflects neutrophilia and lymphopenia. The primary&#xD;
      pathophysiology of AAA involves chronic inflammation in the aortic wall and atherosclerosis,&#xD;
      accompanied with thrombosis. NLR was proposed as a fair indicator for poor prognosis in&#xD;
      patients with AAA. The mean platelet volume (MPV) is the marker of platelet activation and an&#xD;
      indicator of the activation of thrombus formation. Moreover, it is reportedly associated with&#xD;
      the prognosis of patients with cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, the platelet to lymphocyte&#xD;
      ratio (PLR) suggests thrombosis and inflammation and indicates a high risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      events in various groups of patients. The PLR is associated with poor prognosis following AAA&#xD;
      repair. Despite accumulating evidence for the prognostic value of white blood cell counts in&#xD;
      abdominal aortic aneurysm, few studies have investigated the value of these parameters,&#xD;
      including NLR, MPV, and PLR, in patients undergoing AAA open repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aimed to investigate if preoperative neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR),&#xD;
      platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), or mean platelet volume (MPV) could be used to predict&#xD;
      1-year mortality in patients undergoing open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair.&#xD;

      The investigators will retrospectively review medical records who underwent open abdominal&#xD;
      aortic aneurysm repair between Jan 2008 and July 2019. The investigators will divide the&#xD;
      patients into two groups according to the occurrence of 1-yr mortality. Then the&#xD;
      investigators compare complete blood count including NLR, PLR and MPV between the groups.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the patient will be divided into tertiles according to the preoperative NLR,&#xD;
      PLR, and MPV values to compare the incidence of 1-yr mortality and other morbidities.&#xD;
      Multivariable logistic regression analysis will be performed to investigate possible&#xD;
      prognostic factor for 1-yr mortality in these patients.&#xD;
