  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, two-arm, randomized, controlled post-market study to&#xD;
      evaluate and compare the clinical accuracy of component placement in robotic-assisted UKA and&#xD;
      that of traditional methods.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sites will enroll participants into two separate arms for this study (ROSA® and Conventional&#xD;
      Instrumentation), following the assigned randomization. Consecutive patients who meet all of&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be eligible for participation&#xD;
      in the study and will be pre-screened for participation in the informed consent process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate and compare the accuracy of the ROSA®&#xD;
      Partial Knee System in regards to implant placement with that of traditional instrumentation.&#xD;
      This will include the assessment of the planned vs. actual component positioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives include the evaluation of safety and efficacy of this system and will&#xD;
      include the assessment of common adverse events, physical exam findings, radiologic results&#xD;
      and patient reported outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will occur at the following intervals: Pre-operative, Operative, 6-weeks,&#xD;
      3-months, 1-year, and 2-years. Enrollment for the study is anticipated to last approximately&#xD;
      12-18 months. Allowing for 24 months of follow-up, the total estimated study time to&#xD;
      final-patient final-visit will be approximately 42 months.&#xD;
