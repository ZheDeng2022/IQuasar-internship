  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ReMonit study is a 18-months, non-inferiority randomized, controlled trial with three&#xD;
      parallel arms to determine if two, new follow-up strategies for patients with axial&#xD;
      spondyloarthritis (axSpA) are non-inferior in maintaining stable, low disease activity over&#xD;
      time compared to the conventional follow-up regimen with regular hospital visits.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will include Norwegian adult males and females with axial spondyloarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      240 participants will be randomized 1:1:1 to either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control group: a. Usual care, i.e. conventional follow-up strategy with blood tests,&#xD;
           patient-reported outcomes (PROs), and pre-scheduled visits at the hospital every 6th&#xD;
           month&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Remote monitoring: hospital health professionals (HPs) perform remote monitoring of&#xD;
           frequent PROs, blood test results, and physical activity data available on a digital&#xD;
           platform&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient-initiated care: no pre-scheduled visits or remote monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has 18 months follow-up. We will use a 15% non-inferiority margin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also include qualitative research including semi-structured interviews and&#xD;
      observations of patients in the two intervention groups and health professionals involved in&#xD;
      the study. The interviews will explore experiences with remote monitoring and video&#xD;
      consultations.&#xD;

    <description>Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) is a clinical measure of disease activity calculated from four patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and C-reactive Protein (CRP) (or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) if CRP is not available). The formula for calculating ASDAS CRP = 0.12 × back pain + 0.06 × duration of morning stiffness + 0.11 × patient global + 0.07 × peripheral pain/swelling + 0.58×Ln(CRP + 1)). Higher values indicate worse outcome.</description>
