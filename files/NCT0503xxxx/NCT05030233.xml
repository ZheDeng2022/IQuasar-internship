  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized cross-over clinical trial to determine the effect of a nurse-administered&#xD;
      comforting touch intervention on the biobehavioral stress responses of preterm infants&#xD;
      hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm infants will receive one episode of essential nursing care as standard care and one&#xD;
      episode of essential nursing care that includes a nurse-administered comforting touch&#xD;
      intervention approximately 24 hours apart in a randomized sequence. For 10 minutes prior to&#xD;
      the start of the two observed care episodes, during the care episodes, and for 60 minutes&#xD;
      after the conclusion of the care episodes, researchers will measure infants' biobehavioral&#xD;
      stress responses. When infants reach 35 weeks post-menstrual age, researchers will perform a&#xD;
      neurobehavioral assessment.&#xD;

    <description>The nurse-administered touch intervention is a bare-handed, comforting touch intervention administered during an episode of essential nursing care. The bedside nurse will cradle the infant's head with one hand, using the other hand to gently support the infant's lower body and legs in a flexed position. The touches will be administered for 1 minute at the start of the essential care episode, 30 seconds after the diaper change, and 1 minute at the conclusion of the care episode.</description>
