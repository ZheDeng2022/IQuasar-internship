    <textblock>
      This is a randomized control study with 42 laboring women allocated to virtual reality&#xD;
      intervention and control groups. The objective of this study, to evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;
      of immersive virtual reality in laboring women on patient satisfaction and pain relief. The&#xD;
      satisfaction of patients was measured with a &quot;Virtual reality satisfaction survey&quot; which was&#xD;
      prepared by the investigators. Pain levels were assessed by a virtual pain rating scale in&#xD;
      the early and the active phase of labor in both groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Labor is a long and painful process for women. For avoiding or alleviating pain, adjuvant&#xD;
      treatments such as hydrotherapy, yoga, hypnosis, acupuncture, and relaxation techniques could&#xD;
      be used. Recent literature indicates the successful use of immersive virtual reality for a&#xD;
      variety of painful medical procedures. Immersive virtual reality is hypothesized to reduce&#xD;
      pain through distraction, a non-pharmacologic attentional mechanism. The user's brain is&#xD;
      preoccupied with the flood of information presented by the virtual environment restricting&#xD;
      the mind from processing pain signals. The investigators hypothesized that laboring women&#xD;
      find immersive virtual reality as a beneficial tool for their overall labor and delivery&#xD;
      experience. The 42 laboring women were randomized into two arms: virtual reality group (&#xD;
      intervention group) and control group. The investigators used Oculus Quest All-in-one VR&#xD;
      Gaming Headset (128 GB) VR system. Before the intervention, the authors introduced the&#xD;
      equipment and instructed study participants on how to wear and activate the headsets. Anxiety&#xD;
      and depression scales were also applied on admission. The laboring women who enrolled in the&#xD;
      VR group first wore the headsets in early labor (Cervical dilation 3 cm) for 20 minutes. The&#xD;
      patients were offered to choose among several virtual environments including orange sunset,&#xD;
      green meadows, black beginning, red savannah, blue deep, blue moon, blue ocean, white winter,&#xD;
      and red fall. Cards printed out from the images of the Nature Trek application representing&#xD;
      these novel immersion options were provided to the patients to help them pick up their&#xD;
      preferred environment in advance. The second implementation of VR headsets was after the&#xD;
      epidural analgesia in the active phase of labor for another 20 minutes (Cervical dilation&#xD;
      6-7cm). After the second intervention, the &quot;Virtual Reality Satisfaction Survey&quot; was applied&#xD;
      by the authors. Patients were asked to fill out a visual pain rating scale right before and&#xD;
      after the VR use in early and active labor. The primary objective of this study was to&#xD;
      assessed whether immersive virtual reality provided pain relief in the latent or active phase&#xD;
      of labor. The authors also evaluated anxiety and depression in both groups on admission as&#xD;
      potential confounders. Anxiety and depression levels, assessed with the Beck Anxiety&#xD;
      Inventory and Beck Depression Inventory. Patient satisfaction with the use of VR was assessed&#xD;
      by a &quot;Virtual Reality Satisfaction Survey&quot; 10 question survey prepared by our team: 0 being&#xD;
      the lowest and 100 being the highest possible VR satisfaction score.The investigators also&#xD;
      asked these women whether the participants would like to use VR in future labor. Patient&#xD;
      satisfaction with overall labor and delivery experience was assessed using a Visual Analog&#xD;
      Scale (VAS). All discharged women were called a week following discharge and asked to rate&#xD;
      their overall childbirth experience on a scale from 0 to 10. Zero indicates the most negative&#xD;
      experience possible and 10 indicates the highest satisfaction possible. The authors&#xD;
      classified a score of 8 to 10 as high satisfaction. Pain scores both in early and active&#xD;
      labor in each group were assessed using Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Pre-intervention, on admission</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety levels of study participants were assessed with Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). [19] This inventory consists of 21 items, each scored from 0 to 3. This is a self-report questionnaire measuring somatic and cognitive parts of anxiety. The total score is calculated by finding the sum of 21 items. A score of 0 to 7 indicates minimal anxiety, 8 to 15 mild anxiety, 16 to 25 moderate anxiety, and 30 to 63 is associated with severe anxiety.</description>
