      In GATEKEEPER intervention, Big Data Analytics techniques will be exploited to address risk&#xD;
      stratification and early detection, based on lifestyles analysis including: pattern&#xD;
      recognition for the improvement of public health surveillance and for the early detection of&#xD;
      chronic conditions; data mining for inductive reasoning and exploratory data analysis;&#xD;
      Cluster Analysis for identifying high-risk groups among elder citizens. In the above cases&#xD;
      timely intervention is provided by through AI-based, digital coaches, structured&#xD;
      conversations, consultation and education. The main target group (N=960) is older adults and&#xD;
      elderly citizens with risk factors for MetS and their carers. Therefore, the GATEKEEPER&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 1.5 billion people worldwide are affected by Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) - a cluster of&#xD;
      conditions reflecting behavioural risk factors typical of modern lifestyle (excessive food&#xD;
      intake, low physical activity, etc) - with a huge socioeconomic impact and a total estimated&#xD;
      cost of trillions of euros.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early prevention measures especially for elderly at high risk of chronic conditions, such as&#xD;
      prediabetics or obese, include structured lifestyle change programs that help people achieve&#xD;
      and sustain changes in dietary and physical activity habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well established that MetS prevalence, as well as its individual components (high blood&#xD;
      pressure, high glucose, central adiposity) increase with age. Notably, MetS percentages in&#xD;
      the age group 50-55 years old and older is almost 2-3 times higher than in the younger age&#xD;
      groups, probably due to a life time accumulation of adversities including overnutrition, a&#xD;
      sedentary lifestyle, obesity and dyslipidemia, changes in the hormones, untreated&#xD;
      hypertension, changes of the functioning of beta cells and other environmental and&#xD;
      physiological factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it is important to target not only elderly citizens, but rather older adults aged&#xD;
      ≥55 years old as the optimum target group for a MetS prevention intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In GATEKEEPER intervention, Big Data Analytics techniques will be exploited to address risk&#xD;
      stratification and early detection, based on lifestyles analysis including: pattern&#xD;
      recognition for the improvement of public health surveillance and for the early detection of&#xD;
      chronic conditions; data mining for inductive reasoning and exploratory data analysis;&#xD;
      Cluster Analysis for identifying high-risk groups among elder citizens. In the above cases&#xD;
      timely intervention is provided by through AI-based, digital coaches, structured&#xD;
      conversations, consultation and education. The main target group (N=960) is older adults and&#xD;
      elderly citizens with risk factors for MetS and their carers. Therefore, the GATEKEEPER&#xD;
      intervention aims at primary (avoid occurrence of disease) and secondary (early detection and&#xD;
      management) prevention of the ageing population at risk for MetS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      960 older adults and elderly citizens (aged &gt;=55 years old) with risk factors for MetS as&#xD;
      well as their carers (n=40) will be recruited and will be randomized to either: i) the&#xD;
      intervention group 1 (n=320), who will be provided with the standard care plus a lifestyle&#xD;
      application to promote self-management, increase health literacy and awareness through a&#xD;
      digital coach, ii) the intervention group 2 (n=320), who will be provided with the standard&#xD;
      care, the lifestyle application and additionally digital tools and wearables, such as a smart&#xD;
      tracker and weight scale, or iii) the control group (n=320), who will only receive standard&#xD;
      care, as provided by the local and national healthcare system as well as one face-to-face&#xD;
      counselling session for lifestyle modification to improve their risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be followed up for a total duration of 3 months, when they will be&#xD;
      re-evaluated to assess whether their risk factors were improved through the lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The users will be recruited at local community centres, such as the &quot;Open Day Elderly&#xD;
      Centres&quot;, health centres, private offices of health care professionals, hospitals etc. upon&#xD;
      written informed consent form.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The present study is a cluster-randomized lifestyle intervention aimed at primary and secondary prevention of MetS, including three study arms: standard care (control group), standard care plus lifestyle application (intervention group 1) and standard care plus lifestyle application and wearables and devices (intervention group 2). It is conducted with older adults and elderly (aged ≥55 years old) living at home and at risk for MetS, as well as their carers. The total duration of the intervention for each participant will be 3 months.</intervention_model_description>
