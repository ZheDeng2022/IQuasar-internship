  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Motion during radiation therapy can be categorized as inter-fraction (changes in anatomy that&#xD;
      occur between treatment days) and intra-fraction (changes that occur during the &quot;beam on&quot;&#xD;
      window of treatment delivery). Inter-fraction motion is managed by adaptive radiotherapy&#xD;
      (ART), the process of making changes in the treatment plan while the patient remains on the&#xD;
      treatment table. This is now a standard-of-care therapy within Washington University's&#xD;
      clinic. Intra-fraction motion is managed by gated and non-gated delivery techniques. Varian&#xD;
      Medical Systems has integrated the necessary components into a CT-guided radiotherapy device&#xD;
      (ETHOS). In the ETHOS, Varian has built a device that integrates on-board cone beam CT&#xD;
      imaging capable of delineating target and organ-at-risk positions and a dedicated artificial&#xD;
      intelligence-driven treatment planning system for inter-fraction motion management as well as&#xD;
      a paired optical surface image guidance system for intra-fraction motion management. Although&#xD;
      online ART is a standard-of-care practice in the clinic and has previously been shown to be&#xD;
      feasible, use of surface-guidance for intra-fraction gating of abdominal and thoracic SBRT on&#xD;
      ETHOS is novel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in this study, the investigators propose to evaluate the feasibility and safety of&#xD;
      using a novel surface guidance beam-gating system, incorporated with a CBCT-guided adaptive&#xD;
      radiotherapy platform, to manage respiratory motion during delivery of CT-guided stereotactic&#xD;
      radiotherapy. To best assess the utility of this technology to manage respiratory motion, the&#xD;
      investigators will focus on disease sites that are highly affected by respiratory motion:&#xD;
      upper abdominal or lower thoracic malignancies.&#xD;
