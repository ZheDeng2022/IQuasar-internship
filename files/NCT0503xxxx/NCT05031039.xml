  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research is to evaluate the skeletal and dental maturation of cleft lip and&#xD;
      palate patients in a sample of Egyptian population using the CVM as indicator for the&#xD;
      skeletal maturation and the Demirjian method as indicator for the dental one when compared to&#xD;
      a group of Egyptian non-CLP subjects of the same age.&#xD;

      Chronological age (CA) is not considered an accurate method for assessing the stage of&#xD;
      physical or growth development of an individual in childhood or adolescence. For that reason,&#xD;
      skeletal and dental maturation can be used in order to examine the rate of physical&#xD;
      maturation of the population. Cervical vertebral maturation (CVM) method uses lateral&#xD;
      cephalometric radiography to evaluate skeletal maturity. It is considered the preferable&#xD;
      method due to its advantage of avoiding unnecessary extra radiation. The CVM method developed&#xD;
      by Baccetti et al. (2005) depends on the morphology of the three cervical vertebrae (C2, C3,&#xD;
      and C4), which divided skeletal growth into six stages of based on the morphology of the&#xD;
      previously mentioned cervical vertebrae. The Demirjian method is considered as one of the&#xD;
      most worldwide used method for assessment of the dental maturation due to its reliability. It&#xD;
      depends on panoramic x-rays through which the dental developmental stage of 7 lower left&#xD;
      teeth appears, and according to the gender of the patient the sum of values of the teeth will&#xD;
      be transform to age through the standard tables of Carmen M. Nolla; 1960.&#xD;
