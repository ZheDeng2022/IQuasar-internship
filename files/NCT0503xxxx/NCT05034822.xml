  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label maximum use trial to evaluate ruxolitinib safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      blood levels after its topical application twice daily to affected areas (≥ 35% BSA) in&#xD;
      pediatric participants with atopic dermatitis (AD) and to determine if its systemic&#xD;
      bioavailability results in any adverse events.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Open-label, BID application to all affected areas identified at BSLN for 4 weeks (maximum use&#xD;
      trial (MUsT) period). The next 4 weeks (treatment extension period) will be applied BID to&#xD;
      active lesions only for the next 4 weeks for a total treatment period of 8 weeks. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will be offered option to continue into 44-wk LTS period of BID to treat&#xD;
      as-needed to active lesions. All participants will have 30 day safety follow-up visit.&#xD;
