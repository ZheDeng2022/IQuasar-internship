  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The microbiome has the potential to serve as a robust biomarker of clinical response to&#xD;
      immunotherapy. Additionally, microbial manipulation, through diet, exercise, prebiotics,&#xD;
      probiotics, or microbially-derived metabolites, may prove to be beneficial in promoting&#xD;
      anti-tumor immune responses. However, large prospective studies in humans with longitudinal&#xD;
      sample collection and standardized methods are needed to understand how microbiota and their&#xD;
      byproducts affect cancer therapies, particularly among patients undergoing identical therapy&#xD;
      but experiencing different outcomes. The proposed observational study builds upon these&#xD;
      hypotheses by proposing a large cohort design to further assess the associations between the&#xD;
      gut microbiota (composition and function), host immune system, and ICI treatment efficacy&#xD;
      across multiple cancer types.&#xD;
