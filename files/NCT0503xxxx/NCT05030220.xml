  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1: In 51 patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasties, total serum testosterone, free&#xD;
      testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin levels obtained in the clinic before surgery&#xD;
      were correlated with the levels of Cutibacterium on the skin in clinic, in the operating room&#xD;
      prior to surgery, and in the skin incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: The investigators wish to determine if preoperative serum testosterone levels are&#xD;
      associated with risk for shoulder PJI (periprosthetic joint infection) in patients undergoing&#xD;
      primary shoulder arthroplasty. Also to determine if preoperative serum testosterone levels&#xD;
      are predictive of bacterial load of deep tissue cultures taken at the time of revision&#xD;
      shoulder arthroplasty in patients undergoing primary shoulder arthroplasty.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1: 51 patients having elective shoulder arthroplasty were offered the opportunity to&#xD;
      participate, consented and enrolled in this prospective clinical cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At a preoperative clinic visit, basic demographic information was collected along with the&#xD;
      patient's response to a question about taking supplemental testosterone. A swab of the&#xD;
      unprepared skin over the area of the intended surgical incision was obtained and sent for&#xD;
      culture. At this clinic visit, a sample of the patient's blood was also obtained and&#xD;
      submitted to our clinical laboratory for the levels of total serum testosterone, sec hormone&#xD;
      binding globulin (SHBG), and free testosterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately before surgery, another swab of the unprepared skin over the area of the intended&#xD;
      surgical incision was once again obtained and sent for culture. After incision, a swab of the&#xD;
      freshly incised dermis was obtained and sent for culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All 3 swabs that were obtained were observed for 21 days. The investigators analyzed the&#xD;
      cultures to determine the presence and load of bacteria using a semiquantitative method,&#xD;
      known as the Cutibacterium specimen value (SpCuV)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: This phase will also involve a onetime pre-operative testosterone serum test. If the&#xD;
      subject consents to participate, this additional sample of blood will be collected for a&#xD;
      testosterone serum test during the routine pre-operative blood draw that all patients have&#xD;
      before a shoulder arthroplasty regardless of research participation. The investigators will&#xD;
      include cultures such as skin swabs taken at pre-operative clinic appointments, skin swabs&#xD;
      taken at the time of surgery, incision swabs taken at the time of surgery, and discarded&#xD;
      tissue from surgery using our standard protocol for specimens. For this study's outcome&#xD;
      measures, the investigators will record the culture results from those clinical specimens and&#xD;
      compare them to the testosterone serum test. Some subjects may also be a part of a long term&#xD;
      follow-up study and the follow-up data (self-reported outcome measures, etc.) from that study&#xD;
      will be included for analysis for those patients.&#xD;
