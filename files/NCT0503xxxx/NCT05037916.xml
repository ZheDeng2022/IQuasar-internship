  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Timely and accurate estimation of the surface area and depth of a burn injury is essential&#xD;
      for determining an appropriate treatment modality. Inappropriate or inadequate treatment may&#xD;
      result in complications and increased societal costs. Burn depth is determined by subjective&#xD;
      assessing the characteristics of burn injury. Some objective methods are available (e.g.,&#xD;
      biopsy and histology, thermography and laser doppler imaging), but these are cumbersome. In&#xD;
      assessing burn wounds, laser Doppler imaging (LDI) which has a good correlation with&#xD;
      histology, is currently the most widely used and validated noninvasive measurement tool. In&#xD;
      addition, it is the only technique that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration. However, the use of LDI is accompanied by some disadvantages. The current&#xD;
      commercial available LDI device is rather costly, cumbersome and has a poor spatial&#xD;
      resolution. Another laser-based technique, laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI), works with&#xD;
      a similar principle and might become an alternative for LDI. LSCI has some advantages over&#xD;
      LDI such as higher spatial resolution, much easier to position, no valuable time wasted on&#xD;
      setting up the instrument, easy to take several images of burns that have a large surface&#xD;
      area and/or much curvature, faster measurements, fraction of the time needed for getting a&#xD;
      high-quality measurement, able to follow changes in the perfusion in real time. In contrast&#xD;
      to the LDI, the LSCI has not been validated in terms of a diagnostic tool for stratifying the&#xD;
      severity of a burn (based on LDI color coding). Consequently, we will compare the LSCI with&#xD;
      LDI to improve burn care by providing cheaper, faster and higher resolution imaging&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;

      After receiving adequate information and when informed consent is signed, patients are&#xD;
      included. All patients receive usual care. Within 2-5 days post burn the LSCI and LDI are&#xD;
      performed. Ideally, LDI is performed after 2 days, scanning up to 5 days is permitted when&#xD;
      patients present later post burn or due to logistic reasons. The wounds are scanned by a&#xD;
      trained research physician or nurse, during regular wound care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.4 Population base: Measurements of microcirculation with laser-based technique will be&#xD;
      initiated upon the ethical consent is approved. Fifty burn patients will be included in the&#xD;
      study. All patients will be asked for the existence of any comorbid disease. Once the patient&#xD;
      meets the inclusion criteria, he will be eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LSCI and LDI devices will alternately be used to record blood flux. Burn wound including the&#xD;
      healthy area 5 cm wider than the borders will be scanned by LDI and LSCI. After completing&#xD;
      the data collection, all images will be compared to test the linearity between arbitrary&#xD;
      units of LDI and LSCI. Based on the measured blood flux, a color image will be created, based&#xD;
      on a color map created in a study on volunteers. Blood flux is calculated by the dedicated&#xD;
      software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Names of the patients will be coded with numbers. Only the main investigator will be aware of&#xD;
      who corresponds to which number. Results of Perimed (LSCI) and Moore Devices (LDI) will be&#xD;
      analyzed with the software PIMsoft 1.5 (Perimed AB, Järfälla, Sweden), MoorLDI2-BI Burn's&#xD;
      Software Version 4.0, respectively. Two investigators will perform the analysis. If one&#xD;
      investigator will make the analysis, the other will check the results, as well. Stored data&#xD;
      will be extracted and stored coded in the castor study management system en electronic data&#xD;
      capture system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of microcirculation with the Perimed LSCI Pericam PSI System (Perimed AB,&#xD;
      Järfälla, Sweden) Laser Speckle Contrast Imager is used to measure skin perfusion. The system&#xD;
      uses a divergent laser beam with a wavelength of 785 nm. Perfusion images are acquired by&#xD;
      averaging data from 21 images taken in rapid succession (acquisition time 1 seconds), over&#xD;
      1-minute intervals. A flexible working distance from 10 to 40 cm allows measurement areas up&#xD;
      to 24 x 24 cm. Tissue blood perfusion is visualized in real time with a resolution of up to&#xD;
      100 µm/pixel. The system is calibrated according to the manufacturer recommendations.&#xD;
      Perfusion images will be further analyzed by calculating mean perfusion levels in regions of&#xD;
      interest using PIMsoft 1.5 (Perimed AB, Järfälla, Sweden).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operating procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Switch on the computer and any peripherals&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Switch on the Perimed instrument to be used via the switch on the rear panel&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Allow the instrument at least 5 minutes for warm-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Start the PIMSoft software on computer&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Make sure that you allowed the subject at least 20 minutes to rest and acclimatize&#xD;
           before the measurement, make sure the subject is in a comfortable position.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Position the instrument head within the recommended measurement distance from the tissue&#xD;
           (10-40 cm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The head should be parallel, and the laser beam perpendicular to the tissue being&#xD;
           measured&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Set the size of the measurement area by entering the desired width and height in the&#xD;
           corresponding text boxes. Select a point density (resolution).&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Click on the start button&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. After recording the image and/or video click on the stop button and finalize the&#xD;
           recording&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Recorded document is already saved to the computer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of microcirculation with the Moor LDI&#xD;
&#xD;
      MoorLDI2-BI System (Moor Instruments Ltd., Axminster, Devon, UK) is used to measure skin&#xD;
      perfusion. The system uses a divergent laser beam with a wavelength of 633 nm. A flexible&#xD;
      working distance from 30 to 100 cm allows measurement areas up to 50 x 50 cm. Scan times are&#xD;
      ranging from 40 seconds up to 2 minutes. The scan speed is approximately 4ms/pixel. Tissue&#xD;
      blood perfusion is visualized in real time with a maximum image resolution of 256x256 pixels.&#xD;
      The system is calibrated according to the manufacturer recommendations. Perfusion images will&#xD;
      be further analyzed by calculating mean perfusion levels in regions of interest using&#xD;
      MoorLDI2-BI Burn's Software Version 4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operating procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. It is common practice to perform moorLDI2-BI scans after dressings have been removed&#xD;
           during routine dressing change. This avoids extra patient discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Remove dressings (during routine wound management) and any cream (e.g., silver&#xD;
           sulphadiazine) to a light smear or better.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Position the patient with due regard to maintenance of a sterile environment for the&#xD;
           wound. The wound should be held in a comfortable position so that it can be held&#xD;
           reasonably still for the duration of the moorLDI2-BI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The patient should breathe normally during the scan and should avoid coughing or holding&#xD;
           breath.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. When scanning the face and/or upper body areas, the eyes must be covered. If the patient&#xD;
           is unable to wear eye protection, the face must not be scanned.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Ensure that the room or space to be used for scanning has the correct laser warning&#xD;
           labels and screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Ensure clean or sterilized eye protection is on hand for patient and staff if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Angle the scan head downwards prior to turning on the moorLDI2-BI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Turn on the moorLDI2-BI.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Enter Patient Information; use the Comment box for details of sickness, medication or&#xD;
           any other factors which may influence peripheral blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Plan to avoid scanning under direct sunlight, theatre lights or another bright lighting.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Plan the scan head positions for all burn wounds. Consider scan directions that will&#xD;
           avoid direct reflection of the moorLDI2-BI laser back into the scan head from moist&#xD;
           wound surfaces.&#xD;
