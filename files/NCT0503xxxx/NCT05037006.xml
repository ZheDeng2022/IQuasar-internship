      The aim of the present study will be to evaluate by means of a prospective randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial, the time required for the reversal of moderate neuromuscular blockade (NMB)&#xD;
      (Train-of-four count = 3; TOFc 3) to Train-of-four ratio (TOFr) &gt; 0.9 and TOFr = 1.0 after&#xD;
      administration of different doses of neostigmine (30, 50 and 70 mcg/kg) in patients&#xD;
      undergoing general anesthesia with propofol or sevoflurane. In addition, the probability of&#xD;
      NMB reversal in less than 10 minutes or 15 minutes after neostigmine administration will be&#xD;
      registered.&#xD;

      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the approval of the Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medical and Health&#xD;
      Sciences of Pontificia University Catholic of Sao Paulo (PUC-SP), patients submitted to nose&#xD;
      or ear surgeries at Santa Lucinda Hospital and able to participate in this clinical,&#xD;
      prospective, and randomized trial will be evaluated. The following will be included: patients&#xD;
      aged between 18 and 65 years old, physical status according to the American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiologists I and II, submitted to general anesthesia. Exclusion criteria will be: (i)&#xD;
      refusal to participate in the study; (ii) presence of kidney, liver or neuromuscular disease;&#xD;
      (iii) contraindication to the use of any of the drugs used in the study or (iv) body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI) ≥ 30. Patients will be randomly distributed into one of 6 groups according to the&#xD;
      type of anesthesia (inhalational or venous) and the dose of neostigmine used to reverse NMB:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group I-30: inhalational anesthesia and reversal with neostigmine 30 mcg/kg and atropine&#xD;
           15 mcg/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group I-50: inhalational anesthesia and reversal with neostigmine 50 mcg/kg and atropine&#xD;
           25 mcg/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group I-70: inhalational anesthesia and reversal with neostigmine 70 mcg/kg and atropine&#xD;
           35 mcg/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group V-30: intravenous anesthesia and reversal with neostigmine 30 mcg/kg and atropine&#xD;
           15 mcg/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group V-60: intravenous anesthesia and reversal with neostigmine 50 mcg/kg and atropine&#xD;
           25 mcg/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group V-70: intravenous anesthesia and reversal with neostigmine 70 mcg/kg and atropine&#xD;
           35 mcg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient, an opaque envelope will be prepared, sealed and numbered sequentially&#xD;
      containing the group to which the patient will be allocated. A list of randomized&#xD;
      computer-generated numbers (www.random.org) will be used for this purpose. No surgeon,&#xD;
      members of the nursing team, anesthesiologist involved in anesthesia or data collection will&#xD;
      be aware of the dose of neostigmine to be administered. The type of anesthesia (inhalation or&#xD;
      venous) will not be covered. An anesthesiologist not involved in the study will be&#xD;
      responsible for preparing the solution containing neostigmine and atropine (diluted with&#xD;
      saline solution until complete 20 mL) according to the group to which each patient belongs.&#xD;
      Syringes (20 mL) will be similar and identified only with a label with the word &quot;reversal&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY SEQUENCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
      After entry into the operating room, all patients will be monitored with cardioscopy,&#xD;
      noninvasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry and, after tracheal intubation, with capnography.&#xD;
      Venous access will be obtained on one of the upper limbs. After pre-oxygenation, anesthetic&#xD;
      induction and maintenance will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group I-30, I-50 and I-70 - Induction with remifentanil at a dose of 0.5 mcg/kg/min for&#xD;
           3 minutes, followed by a maintenance dose of 0.3 mcg/kg/min. Propofol bolus (2.0 mg/kg)&#xD;
           followed by maintenance with sevoflurane 2% diluted in O2/air flow (60%) 2L/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group V-30, V-50 and V-70 - Induction with remifentanil at a dose of 0.5 mcg/kg/min for&#xD;
           3 minutes, followed by maintenance dose of 0.3 mcg/kg/min. Bolus propofol (2.0 mg/kg)&#xD;
           followed by infusion at the rate of 4 to 6 mg/kg/h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both groups, cisatracúrio (0.1 mg/kg) will be administered before tracheal intubation,&#xD;
      which will be performed when T1 was less than 5%. Ventilation will be controlled, with tidal&#xD;
      volume and respiratory rate adjusted for the maintenance of PETCO2 between 30 and 40 mmHg.&#xD;
      When there is a suspect of inadequate anesthesia plan, the infusion rate of propofol or&#xD;
      sevoflurane will be increased and if adequacy is not sufficient, the infusion rate of&#xD;
      remifentanil will be increased. Patients who have a decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP)&#xD;
      greater than 30% or heart rate (HR) less than 50 bpm will be treated with ephedrine (10 mg)&#xD;
      and atropine (0.5 mg), respectively. Hydration will be performed with 0.9% saline solution&#xD;
      (500 ml in the first 30 minutes and 2 mL/kg/min the following hours). The central temperature&#xD;
      will be maintained above 35oC and peripheral (tenar eminence of the monitored palm) above 32o&#xD;
      C. Reversal of NMB will be performed when TOFc 3 by administration of the previously prepared&#xD;
      solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of neuromuscular blockade NMB will be monitored by acceleromyography method (TOF&#xD;
      Watch SX®;¬ Schering-Plough) as recommended for use in clinical research. 9 The acceleration&#xD;
      transducer will be fixed on the volar side of the distal phalanx of the thumb. Venous access&#xD;
      and blood pressure cuff will be positioned on the opposite arm to the limb used for NMB&#xD;
      monitoring. After cleaning the skin in the path of the ulnar nerve in the forearm, the&#xD;
      electrodes will be positioned at the height of the wrist with a distance between 3 to 6 cm&#xD;
      between them. Calibration will be performed after automatically after a 50 Hz tetanus&#xD;
      stimulus for 5 seconds. The stimulation (Train-of-Four-TOF) will be applied every 15 seconds&#xD;
      for 2 minutes before cisatracúrio is given. No additional doses of NMB will be administered.&#xD;
      Once the third response to the TOF is obtained, a dose of neostigmine (30, 50 or 70 mcg/kg)&#xD;
      will be administered and the time for until the TOF reaches values equal to 0.9 and 1.0 will&#xD;
      be recorded. The primary outcome will be the time required for the reversal of moderate NMB&#xD;
      (TOF=3) up to TOF = 0.9 and TOF = 1.0. In addition, the probability of reversion of NMB will&#xD;
      be evaluated in less than 10 minutes or 15 minutes after the administration of different&#xD;
      doses of neostigmine in patients undergoing intravenous or inhalational anesthesia. The&#xD;
      sample size will be based on a previous study that determined the need for 12 patients per&#xD;
      group to detect with a power of 90% and alpha error of 5% a difference between groups equal&#xD;
      to or greater than 1.3 standard deviations. 10 Considering possible losses, 90 patients will&#xD;
      be included.&#xD;
