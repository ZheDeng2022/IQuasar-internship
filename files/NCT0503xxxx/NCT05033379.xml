  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reliably achieving peak performance requires balancing the strain of the prior day with&#xD;
      sufficient recovery to be ready for the next day. Surgery has a long standing tradition long&#xD;
      hours of hard work often at the expense of adequate sleep. Decreased sleep and recovery has&#xD;
      physiologic consequences which can be measured using biometric data. The goal of this study&#xD;
      is to quantify surgeon performance and biometric data to understand how modifiable behaviors&#xD;
      including mindfulness training and diet can maximize recovery and performance. The goal of&#xD;
      this study is to quantify the impact if modifiable daily behaviors including sleep,&#xD;
      nutrition, in order to understand the factors that contribute to high level performance,&#xD;
      burnout, and physician wellbeing in surgical trainees and attendings.&#xD;

      Informed consent will be obtained prior to participation in the research study. A member of&#xD;
      the research team will provide the participant with the consent form and allow them adequate&#xD;
      time to read and ask questions prior to giving consent. If consent is not obtained, the&#xD;
      participant will not be allowed to participate in the research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to wear a biometric sensor for six months. The biometric sensor,&#xD;
      namely, 'The Whoop strap' collects heart rate and heart rate variability data. Half of the&#xD;
      participants will complete coaching to improve resilience with Arena Strive and half will be&#xD;
      a control group instructed that sleep is important. If we are able to 600 participants then&#xD;
      we will have a third group called the circadian alignment groups that will be told that sleep&#xD;
      can be enhanced by 1) maintaining a regular sleep/wake schedule, 2) avoiding meals within two&#xD;
      hours of bedtime, and 3) viewing bright light within 20min of waking and avoiding bright&#xD;
      lights within 3 hours of bedtime. During the study period participants will also have the&#xD;
      opportunity to participate in executive functioning tasks with EEG monitoring (via the&#xD;
      Neurable wearable headset) on a voluntary basis. At the completion of the study period all&#xD;
      participants will have access to Arena strive coaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other data gathered will be in the form of surveys and comments from subjects on wellness,&#xD;
      burnout, modifiable activities including sleep, nutrition, glucose levels using continuous&#xD;
      glucose monitoring, exercise and mindfulness, and surgical performance as well as video and&#xD;
      audio recordings during a simulated surgical task.&#xD;
