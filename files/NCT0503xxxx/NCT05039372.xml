    <textblock>
      Ensuring disease management begins with comprehensive education and drug therapy. Symptoms&#xD;
      such as deformities, pain and fatigue, which are most common in rheumatoid arthritis&#xD;
      patients, seriously affect the daily activities of the patients. In order to improve the&#xD;
      quality of life of the patient, it is essential that he receives planned education about his&#xD;
      disease and constant follow up it like this helps him manage his disease by providing&#xD;
      behavioral changes. There are similar studies on chronic diseases in the literature, and it&#xD;
      has been seen to make a positive contribution. Studies have shown that patient education&#xD;
      includes only information, counseling or behavioral therapies, and does not necessarily turn&#xD;
      into behavior change on its own. Which was developed on the basis of education and human&#xD;
      behavior theories, According to The Theory of Planned Behavior it is thought that patients&#xD;
      can cope with their illnes, manage their illnesses and show behavioral changes by adapting to&#xD;
      the illness with the help of nursing counseling. The importance of patient follow-up has once&#xD;
      again come to the fore when it comes to the problems that those with chronic diseases may&#xD;
      experience during the pandemic process and the difficulties in finding solutions. Recently,&#xD;
      training and follow-up are carried out with remote access in the management of many chronic&#xD;
      diseases. Especially in chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, which affects all&#xD;
      systems, the counseling service to be provided to the extent that behavior change can be&#xD;
      achieved has become more important. In this direction, it is thought that it will be&#xD;
      beneficial in the long term for patients to gain behavioral changes by telephone monitoring&#xD;
      after education.&#xD;

      Examining the studies in the literature, the effect size between the experimental group and&#xD;
      the control group was calculated and it was estimated to be around 0.70. In the experimental&#xD;
      and control groups, a total of 68 individuals, including at least 34 individuals in both&#xD;
      groups, should be included in the study in order to determine the difference between the&#xD;
      groups in the power analysis calculated with 80% power and 0.05 significance. Considering&#xD;
      that there would be individuals who could not continue to work or could not be reached&#xD;
      afterwards, the number of required to be reached individuals was calculated as 74&#xD;
      individuals. In this study, the sample size was calculated with the GPower program version&#xD;
      3.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type and Time of Research&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is planned to be conducted as a randomized controlled experimental study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application of Research&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the research, the applications to be made to the control and experimental groups are&#xD;
      explained separately:&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Control Group Intervention: After obtaining written consent from the patients who agreed to&#xD;
      participate in the study, the patients included in the control group were asked to continue&#xD;
      their rheumatologist follow-up and their normal lives (hospital routine, daily life).&#xD;
      Patients in this group will fill out the &quot;Patient Description Form, Bristol Rheumatoid&#xD;
      Arthritis Fatigue Multidimensional Questionnaire, McGill Pain Scale Short Form, Stanford&#xD;
      Health Evaluation Questionnaire&quot; at the first interview. After 3 months, data collection&#xD;
      tools other than the &quot;Patient Identification Form&quot; will be applied to the patients and the&#xD;
      training guide to be prepared for Rheumatoid Arthritis patients will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Group Initiative: After obtaining written consent from the patients who agreed&#xD;
      to participate in the study, they will be asked to continue with their rheumatologist&#xD;
      follow-up and their normal lives (hospital routine, daily life).&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Patient Description Form, Bristol Rheumatoid Arthritis Fatigue Multidimensional&#xD;
      Questionnaire, McGill Pain Scale Short Form, Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire&quot; will&#xD;
      be administered to the patients in this group at the first interview. Individual training&#xD;
      will be given to the patient in line with the training guide prepared for the rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis patient, and the guide will be shared after the training. Mutual contact&#xD;
      information will be shared with the patient and it will be stated that he can call during the&#xD;
      counseling period (3 months).In line with the theory of planned behavior in patients with&#xD;
      Rheumatoid Arthritis counseling service will be provided by the researcher to the extent of&#xD;
      the training plan prepared for symptom management. At the end of the 3rd month, the patients&#xD;
      will be interviewed face to face and the &quot;Bristol Rheumatoid Arthritis Fatigue&#xD;
      Multidimensional Questionnaire, McGill Pain Scale Short Form, Stanford Health Assessment&#xD;
      Questionnaire&quot; will be administered again.&#xD;
