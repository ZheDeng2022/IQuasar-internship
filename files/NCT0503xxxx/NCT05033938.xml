  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to establish the utility of early mobilization in&#xD;
      improving patient satisfaction following plate and screw fixation of wrist fractures.&#xD;
      Subjects will have objective range of motion data collected and subjective survey data&#xD;
      collected at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1 year after being randomized either to an early&#xD;
      mobilization group that receives a removable wrist splint or a late mobilization group that&#xD;
      is placed in a splint for 2 weeks post-operatively. The investigators expect that early wrist&#xD;
      mobilization following locking plate fixation of wrist fractures will lead to an increase in&#xD;
      postoperative patient satisfaction without a significant increase in complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a prospective randomized clinical trial which will explore differences in&#xD;
      outcomes between early and late mobilization in patients undergoing volar plate fixation of&#xD;
      distal radius fractures (DRF). The data will be collected at two weeks, six weeks, three&#xD;
      months, and one year postoperatively. Data will be collected utilizing questionnaires,&#xD;
      in-office measurements, and radiographic evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be identified for potential enrollment to the study by physician investigators&#xD;
      at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH), Robert Wood Johnson Somerset, University&#xD;
      Orthopaedic Associates, and St. Peter's University Hospital Center for Ambulatory Resources&#xD;
      (CARES). Once enrolled to the study, patients will be randomized to the two study arms in an&#xD;
      alternating fashion. Every other patient will be randomized to one of the two groups. A&#xD;
      potential source of bias exists in the fact that the surgeon will not be able to be entirely&#xD;
      blinded to which group the patient is assigned, as the postoperative dressing is different&#xD;
      between the two, so the surgeon must know which dressing to apply. Once assigned to a group&#xD;
      preoperatively, patients will be counseled on their postoperative rehabilitation program.&#xD;
      They will be given a pamphlet detailing restrictions, exercises, and motions allowed at each&#xD;
      specific time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will undergo distal radius open reduction and internal fixation utilizing a&#xD;
      volar locking plate. Either a modified Henry volar approach or a trans-flexor carpi radialis&#xD;
      (FCR) approach to the distal radius will be used. The specific type and brand of plate will&#xD;
      be recorded. Immediate post-operative radiographs will be acquired. Patients assigned to the&#xD;
      early mobilization group will be given a Velcro removable wrist splint to go home with,&#xD;
      measured off their contralateral hand. All patients in both groups will be administered 10&#xD;
      Percocet pills (5 mg/325 mg) for postoperative pain. Patient consumption of pain medication&#xD;
      will be captured at subsequent visits starting at 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the early mobilization group, patients will be placed in a bulky soft dressing&#xD;
      immediately after surgery. They will be made non-weight bearing, but active and passive&#xD;
      motion of digits, forearm, elbow, and shoulder will be allowed with light functional tasks&#xD;
      permitted as tolerated. Wrist motion within the soft dressing will be permitted as tolerated&#xD;
      by patient. On postoperative day 3, patients will be advised to remove the dressing at home&#xD;
      and begin home hand/wrist therapy. They will use a removeable Velcro wrist splint for&#xD;
      nighttime wear and strenuous activity. This splint can be removed during normal activities of&#xD;
      daily living (ADLs) and therapy. At this point, patients can shower without covering surgical&#xD;
      site. However, soaking in standing water is not permitted. The first postoperative visit will&#xD;
      be in 2 weeks. Sutures/staples will be removed if applicable. Patients will be advised to&#xD;
      wean splint as tolerated with progressive weight bearing as pain permits. Patients will&#xD;
      continue active and passive wrist motion exercises at home until 6 weeks post-op. From the&#xD;
      6-week timepoint onward, patients will have no restrictions. At the 6-week, 3 month, and 1&#xD;
      year postoperative visits, patients will have repeat radiographs taken, all measurements&#xD;
      performed, and all questionnaires administered. All radiographs and visits for this study are&#xD;
      standard of care. These data points are outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the late mobilization group, immediately post-operatively patients will be placed in a&#xD;
      plaster volar resting splint. They will be made non-weight bearing, with use of digits for&#xD;
      light functional tasks permitted. They will be given home exercises for their fingers but&#xD;
      will not yet resume wrist motion. At the first post-operative visit at the 2-week timepoint,&#xD;
      the dressing and volar splint will be removed, along with sutures/staples if applicable.&#xD;
      Patients will be converted to removeable Velcro wrist splint for nighttime and strenuous&#xD;
      activity, which can be removed during normal ADLs and therapy. Patients will be given a list&#xD;
      of home exercises to be performed as a pamphlet. Patients will be advised to wean splint as&#xD;
      tolerated with progressive weight bearing as pain permitted. They will continue active and&#xD;
      passive wrist motion exercises at home until 6 weeks post-op. From the 6-week timepoint&#xD;
      onward, patients will have no restrictions. At the 6-week, 3 month, and 1 year postoperative&#xD;
      visits, patients will have repeat radiographs taken, all measurements performed, and all&#xD;
      questionnaires administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As stated, the follow-up visits for this study will be at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1&#xD;
      year. At each visit the patients will have radiographs taken, questionnaires administered,&#xD;
      and quantitative testing done to assess range of motion and strength. Details further&#xD;
      outlined below.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will be placed in a bulky soft dressing immediately after surgery. They will be made non-weight bearing, but active and passive motion of digits, forearm, elbow, and shoulder will be allowed with light functional tasks permitted as tolerated. Wrist motion within the soft dressing will be permitted as tolerated by patient. On postoperative day 3, patients will be advised to remove the dressing at home and begin home hand/wrist therapy. They will use a removable Velcro wrist splint for nighttime wear and strenuous activity. This splint can be removed during normal activities of daily living and therapy.</description>
