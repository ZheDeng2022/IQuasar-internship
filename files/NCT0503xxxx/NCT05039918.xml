  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomised control trial is to determine the efficacy of CT-optimal touch&#xD;
      (gentle stroking at 3cm/s) for newborn's who require a heel prick.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Newborn infants are subject to several novel experiences that cause physiological,&#xD;
      biochemical and behavioural indicators of stress; even routine and common events such as&#xD;
      handling, changing a diaper or being bathed can increase salivary cortisol levels. Excluding&#xD;
      surgery and mechanical ventilation, the most common procedural pain sources in newborns are&#xD;
      heel-lancing and venepuncture. Tactile interventions such as skin to skin care and 'still&#xD;
      containment hold' are widely used in clinical care with apparent positive results such as&#xD;
      lower mean respiratory heart rate and pain measures, and higher oxygen saturation; yet,&#xD;
      dynamic touch interventions have reported to be more beneficial than static touch&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A distinct type of nerve fibres, CT (C tactile) afferents, found exclusively in hairy skin,&#xD;
      that respond optimally to gentle stroking at a velocity of ~1-10cm/s, are part of a system&#xD;
      for processing pleasant and social rewarding touch. CT fibre activation also plays a role in&#xD;
      pain inhibition and may be linked to the development of self-regulation, thereby, serving a&#xD;
      neuroprotective function for the developing infant brain. Here we will investigate whether&#xD;
      tactile stimulation at CT-optimal velocity will reduce biochemical and physiological&#xD;
      indicators of stress in infants, as determined by salivary cortisol, heart rate and blood&#xD;
      oxygenation levels.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Allocation sequence will be randomised in advance by a trusted member of LJMU staff who is not involved in the study, using a computerised website to generate random numbers. The sequences will be placed in sealed opaque envelopes and stored in a secure location on-site. The use of an off-site computerised system for group allocation will decrease the risk of allocation bias. Eligible infants whose person(s) with parental responsibility have provided consent will be assigned the next available envelope which will be accessed by the lead researcher prior to the intervention.</masking_description>

    <description>Following randomisation, infants will receive CT-optimal stimulation (gentle stroking) at a velocity of 3cm/s over the area which the infant will be stroked (10cm) for a duration of 10s applied proximally to the pain site prior to the heel prick. Location of the heel prick will be based on clinical judgement. There will be an inter-stimulus interval of approximately 1 second between the end of the touch and heel prick, and touch stimulation will be applied to the lower leg ipsilateral to the heel receiving the noxious stimuli. All infants will have cardio-respiratory monitoring during the intervention. All other environmental factors will be as standard care (e.g., temperature, lighting and sounds).&#xD;
The heel prick will be performed by a member of the infants designated clinical team who have performed the procedures in a standardised manner according to the institutional and unit policy.</description>
