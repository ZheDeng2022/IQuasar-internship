      The DESyne BDS Plus Randomized Clinical Study is a prospective, multi-center, single blind,&#xD;
      randomized clinical study. Randomization (1:1; DESyne BDS Plus : DESyne X2) of up to 100&#xD;
      patients (50 in each arm) requiring treatment of up to two de novo coronary artery lesions ≤&#xD;
      34 mm in length in vessels ≥ 2.25 mm and ≤ 3.5 mm in diameter will be conducted. Clinical&#xD;
      endpoints will be assessed at each follow-up point: 3 days or hospital discharge (whichever&#xD;
      comes first), 1, 6, and 12 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and performance of the DESyne BDS Plus DECSS (Test) as compared to the&#xD;
      CE Mark approved DESyne X2 Novolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System (DESyne X2 NECSS; DESyne&#xD;
      X2) (Control) in the treatment of de novo native coronary artery lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DESyne BDS Plus Randomized Clinical Study is a prospective, multi-center, single blind,&#xD;
      randomized clinical study. Randomization (1:1; DESyne BDS Plus : DESyne X2) of up to 100&#xD;
      patients (50 in each arm) requiring treatment of up to two de novo coronary artery lesions ≤&#xD;
      34 mm in length in vessels ≥ 2.25 mm and ≤ 3.5 mm in diameter will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to two target lesions, located in separate epicardial vessels, which meet the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, may be treated with the assigned study device. Alternatively,&#xD;
      one target lesion may be treated with the assigned study device after successful,&#xD;
      uncomplicated treatment with any commercially-available DES of a non-target lesion, located&#xD;
      in a separate epicardial vessel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an imaging subset of approximately 60 subjects (30 per arm), Angiography and OCT will be&#xD;
      performed at index procedure, and again at 6 month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PK sub-study will enroll up to 10 non-randomized subjects treated only with the DESyne&#xD;
      BDS Plus device, with a maximum of 3 DESyne BDS stents implanted. The PK sub-study is being&#xD;
      conducted to assess the blood pharmacokinetics of the three drugs (Sirolimus, Rivaroxaban,&#xD;
      Argatroban) eluted from the DESyne BDS Plus after implantation. PK measurements will be&#xD;
      conducted by obtaining plasma blood samples at pre-treatment, and post-treatment at 10&#xD;
      minutes, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 72 hours, and 7 days. In addition, all PK subjects&#xD;
      will undergo clinical assessments/follow-up at 3 days or hospital discharge (whichever comes&#xD;
      first), 1, 6 and 12 months. The PK sub-study subjects are not considered part of the primary&#xD;
      analysis population.&#xD;

                       associated with the non-target lesion should be considered unsuccessful.&#xD;
                       Examples of unsuccessful treatment include but are not limited to: inability&#xD;
