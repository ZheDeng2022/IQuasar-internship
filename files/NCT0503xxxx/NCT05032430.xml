  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maternal stress is associated with children's risk for obesity controlling for socioeconomic&#xD;
      status. The association between maternal stress and child obesity is particularly strong in&#xD;
      Latinx families, whose children also have the highest rates of obesity in the United States.&#xD;
      A mindful parenting program might reduce Latina mothers' psychological stress and lead to&#xD;
      improved parenting practices and ability to create a healthier environment. The primary&#xD;
      objective of the proposed research is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a&#xD;
      culturally-relevant intervention that integrates mindfulness-based stress reduction and&#xD;
      mindful parenting in Latina mothers. The investigators will conduct a randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial comparing the ATIENDE (Awareness Training to Influence Eating, Nutrition,&#xD;
      Decision-making, and Exercise) intervention to an active control condition in 50 Latina&#xD;
      mothers of elementary-school age children. Participant satisfaction rates and qualitative&#xD;
      interviews will provide evidence of the program's acceptability. Feasibility will be&#xD;
      determined by examining recruitment rates, retention rates, and treatment fidelity.&#xD;
      Completion of this project will inform the development of a full-scale efficacy trial.&#xD;
