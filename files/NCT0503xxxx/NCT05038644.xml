  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, dose-escalation study (using 3 + 3 dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) criteria)&#xD;
      evaluating the safety and tolerability of XmAb18968, as well as establishing a recommended&#xD;
      phase II dose (RP2D) in subjects with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and T cell&#xD;
      lymphoblastic (lymphoma) T-LBL (Group A) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Group B).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this portion of the study is to determine a recommended phase II&#xD;
      dose (RP2D) for XmAb18968. The trial will use a variation of the 3 + 3 design where both&#xD;
      escalation and de-escalation are possible. There will be separate cohorts; Group A (T cell&#xD;
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia, T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma) and Group B (acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia). A minimum of 24 and a maximum of 60 subjects will be needed for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) will be split into two doses to ensure the safety of&#xD;
      subjects and to closely monitor for CRS. The dose will be split into C1D1 and Cycle 1 Day 2&#xD;
      (C1D2) with approximately 25% of the dose given on C1D1 and 75% of the dose given on C1D2.&#xD;
      Thereafter, subjects will receive the full dose planned for that cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to enrolling subjects at the next applicable dose level, the Data Safety Monitoring&#xD;
      Committee (DSMC) will review the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although AEs may occur at any point during treatment, only AEs occurring during Cycle 1 of&#xD;
      treatment will necessarily influence decisions regarding dose escalation, expansion of a dose&#xD;
      level, or evaluation of intermediate dose levels. Subjects will be monitored through all&#xD;
      cycles of therapy for treatment-related toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity will be evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. If multiple AEs are seen, the&#xD;
      presence of a DLT will be based on the most severe AE experienced. The DLT will be based on&#xD;
      the tolerability observed during the first 28 days (or up to 42 days for hematological DLTs)&#xD;
      of treatment/observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DLT will be defined as any of the following events:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any grade 4 or higher non-hematological adverse reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a possible side effect that can occur as a result of&#xD;
           administration of XmAb18968. For this protocol, any grade 3 or higher CRS adverse event&#xD;
           (AE) (per revised CRS grading system will be considered a DLT except grade 3 CRS AE that&#xD;
           resolves to grade 1 within seven days).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any subject meeting the criteria for Hy's Law case (i.e., severe drug-induced liver&#xD;
           injury (DILI)). A Hy's Law case is defined as: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or&#xD;
           alanine transaminase (ALT) values ≥ 3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) AND with serum total&#xD;
           bilirubin (TBIL) level &gt; 2 × ULN or international normalized ratio (INR) &gt; 1.5 without&#xD;
           signs of cholestasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any non-Hy's Law grade 3 liver abnormality lasting more than 72 hours will be considered&#xD;
           a DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 3 electrolyte abnormalities - sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl), carbon&#xD;
           dioxide (CO2), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), phosphate - that do not return to grade 1&#xD;
           or lower within 72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any grade 4 neurotoxicity will be considered a DLT. Grade 3 neurotoxicity that lasts&#xD;
           more than 72 hours will be considered a DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any grade 3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea that requires hospitalization, tube feeding or&#xD;
           total parenteral nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any adverse reaction that leads to dose reduction or withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 3 transaminitis (AST/ALT) elevation that does not return to grade 1 or lower&#xD;
           within 72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any grade 3 infection lasting more than seven days in the absence of active leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any grade 3 bleeding with thrombocytopenia in the absence of active leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any grade 4 or higher neutropenia lasting past cycle day 42 in the absence of active&#xD;
           leukemia.&#xD;
