  <detailed_description>

      The study is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, adaptive design, double blinded clinical&#xD;
      study, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Vibrant Capsule vs. placebo in relieving&#xD;
      constipation in subjects with Chronic Idiopathic Constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two arms will be assessed (at a ratio of 1:1 of Vibrant Treatment vs. placebo):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vibrant Capsule administered twice a week (Monday and Thursday)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo Capsule administered twice a week (Monday and Thursday) Subjects will come for 4&#xD;
           visits: Screening (visit 1), baseline (visit 2), after 4 treatment weeks from baseline&#xD;
           (visit 3) and after 8 treatment weeks from baseline (Final visit , visit 4). A total of&#xD;
           8 treatment weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the entire study period subjects will be asked to refrain from taking any medications&#xD;
      or supplements to relieve their constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be authorized to use rescue medication after 3 consecutive days without a bowel&#xD;
      movement&#xD;

    <masking_description>This is a double-blind study. The subjects and the evaluators will be blinded to the treatment allocated to each subject. Each site will assign an unblinded person that will handle all issues related to capsule administration and accountability. The unblinded person will not be involved in any subject's assessments.

    <description>The Vibrant Capsule is designed to mechanically induce a peristaltic wave in the large intestine, thus aiding in relieving constipated subjects. Constipation relief is achieved by the capsule's vibrations impinging on the gastrointestinal wall, consequently inducing peristaltic activity which promotes transit and facilitates defecation</description>
