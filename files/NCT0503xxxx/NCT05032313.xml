      Multi-site, prospective performance study to determine equivalency between the&#xD;
      investigational CLPD Limited Panel on the FACSLyric system versus the final clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis.&#xD;

      Hematology laboratories rely on flow cytometry technology (in addition to classic&#xD;
      hematological methods) to aid in screening, diagnosing, and monitoring patients with&#xD;
      hematological disorders. High speed and broad applicability of flow cytometry allows for the&#xD;
      diagnosis. Currently, there are no consensus panels being used; consequently, the leukemia &amp;&#xD;
      lymphoma (L&amp;L) testing remains a single-vial antibody being used with various in-house&#xD;
      laboratory developed tests (LDTs) being used to test patient specimens. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      analysis of flow cytometer generated data is not standardized and requires a high level of&#xD;
      expertise and training for interpretation of complex data. Therefore, optimized and&#xD;
      standardized immunostaining protocols for the diagnosis, classification, and prognostic&#xD;
      sub-classification of hematological malignancies are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigational reagent panel for chronic lymphoproliferative diseases (CLPD) is&#xD;
      intended for in vitro diagnostic use for qualitative flow-cytometric immunophenotyping of&#xD;
      mature lymphocyte populations on the BD FACSLyric flow cytometer . These reagents are used as&#xD;
      an aid in the differential diagnosis of hematologically abnormal patients having, or&#xD;
      suspected of having, B-cell CLPD, T-cell CLPD, and NK-cell CLPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will occur at up to 8 investigational sites . Data will be acquired from Eligible&#xD;
      remnant/leftover specimens on the BD FACSLyric flow cytometer and evaluated by site personnel&#xD;
      and expert analysts .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final diagnosis and the affected cell population will be determined by site standard of&#xD;
      care .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of data will evaluate identification of normal vs abnormal cell population of the&#xD;
      expert &amp; site analysts as compared to the final diagnosis.&#xD;
