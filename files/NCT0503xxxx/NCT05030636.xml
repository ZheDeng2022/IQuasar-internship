      The main objective of this research project is to assess the impact of the timing of exercise&#xD;
      on sensory perception, more specifically on taste and smell. Also, the investigators want to&#xD;
      identify the optimal exercise timing scenario that maximizes the short-term anorexigenic&#xD;
      effect of exercise (i.e. decrease in energy intake at the meal following the exercise&#xD;
      session) in each group of teenagers. Hypothesis: exercise immediately before a meal&#xD;
      (EX-&gt;MEAL) will be the most efficient scenario, and will show a larger impact on males&#xD;
      individuals and people who suffer obesity. Subsequently, the investigators want to understand&#xD;
      the impacts of exercise on lifestyle habits (i.e. sleep and sedentariness).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the realization of this research project, the investigators plan to recruit approximately&#xD;
      144 participants, boys and girls with normal weight/obesity, aged 12 to 17 years. Of these&#xD;
      participants, half will be male. There are two different exercise timings (i.e. performed at&#xD;
      9:30 am and 11:00 am using a treadmill to test the maximal aerobic capacity) and one&#xD;
      sedentary control condition. Participants will take part in 3 experimental visits in a random&#xD;
      order (~5 hours/visit at LAPS-UdeM + 24h of real-life monitoring). Appetite sensations,&#xD;
      energy intake (i.e. total and macronutrient), activity monitoring using actigraphy, hormonal&#xD;
      (i.e. anorexigenic and orexigenic) and chemosensory (i.e. cortical response to taste and&#xD;
      smell stimulations) response will be monitored in the laboratory and/or remotely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will measure acute response in laboratory and real-life settings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity before adulthood is associated with increased risk of cardiometabolic disease as well&#xD;
      as musculoskeletal and psychosocial complications. Until recently, the two major components&#xD;
      of energy balance (i.e. energy expenditure and intake) were thought to act independently on&#xD;
      body weight, but a growing body of knowledge in the field of human physiology supports the&#xD;
      theory that exercise and nutrition interact (EXiNU). Complementary lifestyle behaviours [e.g.&#xD;
      sedentariness and sleep] can also influence energy balance, all acting synergistically on&#xD;
      energy balance (EXiNU+). Dr. Mathieu's innovative work recently revealed that the modulation&#xD;
      of EX Timing relative to lunch can significantly improve the choice of healthier foods and&#xD;
      lower total (-10%) and lipid (-25%) energy intake without further nutritional compensation&#xD;
      during the rest of the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This unique research project focuses specifically on understanding how EX Timing can regulate&#xD;
      energy balance, filling a major gap in the current literature. The strengths and novelty of&#xD;
      the current proposal are that: 1) Youth of both sexes and of different body weight status&#xD;
      will be investigated; 2) A varied profile of orexigenic and anorexigenic hormones as well as&#xD;
      the cortical response to taste and smell will be studied to better understand food choices;&#xD;
      3) Sleep and sedentary behaviours will be evaluated with EX and nutrition to better assess&#xD;
      the global influence of EX Timing on energy balance; 4) Cardiometabolic indicators linked to&#xD;
      obesity will be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective : To identify the optimal EX Timing that maximizes the short-term&#xD;
      anorexigenic effect of EX (i.e. decrease in energy intake at the meal following the EX&#xD;
      session) in each group of teenagers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: EX immediately before a meal (EX--&gt;MEAL) will be the most efficient scenario, and&#xD;
      will show a larger impact on individuals with obesity and in males.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective #1 : To identify the optimal EX Timing that maximizes the medium-term&#xD;
      anorexigenic effect of EX (i.e. caloric reduction during the 24 hours following the lunch) in&#xD;
      each group of teenagers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: EX immediately before a meal (EX--&gt;MEAL) will be less efficient with time. A&#xD;
      reduced impact on Day 1 (i.e. reduction in energy intake less important between EX and&#xD;
      control conditions) and the absence of impact on Day 2 (similar energy intake between 4&#xD;
      conditions) are expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective #2 : To elucidate the hormonal and chemosensory response associated with&#xD;
      the anorexigenic effect of EX Timing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: EX--&gt;MEAL will show a maximal change in anorexigenic hormones (e.g. lowest&#xD;
      ghrelin and highest leptin levels), and will maximally alter the cortical chemosensory&#xD;
      processing to smell and taste. A dose-response effect is expected: the change in anorexigenic&#xD;
      hormones being inversely proportional to the EX-meal delay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective #3 : Understand how complementary lifestyle factors are influenced by EX&#xD;
      Timing and how these can induce a negative energy balance. Hypothesis: It is speculated that&#xD;
      the EX Timing condition having the largest impact on nutrition will also reduce sedentary&#xD;
      habits and improve sleep behaviours. Those lifestyle habits need to be monitored to control&#xD;
      for/explore their moderating effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective #4 : Monitor cardiometabolic parameters following each EX Timing&#xD;
      scenario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The EX→Meal scenario would have larger effects on blood pressure and lipid&#xD;
      profiles given its larger impact on energy intake. The greatest effects will be seen on&#xD;
      participants with a poor profile (high blood pressure and lipids levels).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will involve 4 meetings over 4 consecutive weeks at LAPS, a laboratory equipped&#xD;
      to meet the needs of the study [Physical Activity and Health Laboratory (FCI and don Molson)&#xD;
      at CEPSUM].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods : The preliminary visit (approximately 4 hours) will include standardized&#xD;
      questionnaires on physical activity and nutrition, various anthropometric tests (percentage&#xD;
      of fat and body mass using DXA, height and waist circumference), an assessment of their&#xD;
      resting metabolism (indirect calorimetry), a standardized physical test (VO2max with indirect&#xD;
      calorimetry) as well as a culinary exposure the meals that will be served to them. During the&#xD;
      following week (7 days), there will be a monitoring of their lifestyle (physical activity,&#xD;
      sedentary behavior, sleep, etc.), which involves wearing an accelerometer and three food&#xD;
      reminders by a nutritionist. Three experimental tours (approximately 5 hours / visit) will&#xD;
      follow. These meetings present different temporal conditions in which the exercise will be&#xD;
      immediately followed by taste and odor tests as well as blood samples. Participants will take&#xD;
      part, in a randomized fashion, in 3 experimental conditions, all preceded by a standard&#xD;
      breakfast served at 8 am. Condition 1: active-early (30 min at 70% VO2max) at 9 a.m.,&#xD;
      condition 2: active-late (30 min at 70% VO2max) at 11 a.m., condition 3: sedentary (control&#xD;
      condition) from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. Their energy intake and food choices will be assessed at 12&#xD;
      noon and during the 48 hours following each experimental visit, using validated lunch boxes.&#xD;
      Measurements of appetite, taste [electroencephalogram (EEG) + gustometer] and smell (EEG +&#xD;
      olfactometer) as well as blood tests measuring appetite hormones (ghrelin, oxytomodulin,&#xD;
      Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 and Peptide YY-36) will be carried out at each experimental visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes : Currently, exercise periods in schools, workplaces, and free time are set&#xD;
      randomly rather than scientifically scheduled. This is potentially suboptimal and not aligned&#xD;
      with other medical treatments (e.g. medication) where timing is an essential component of the&#xD;
      treatment regimen. Outcomes of this project on EX Timing will be important to improve EX&#xD;
      interventions in order to enhance positive outcomes from each minute of exercise performed.&#xD;
