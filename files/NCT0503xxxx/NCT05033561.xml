    <textblock>
      Study to determine immunogenicity and safety following administration of 2 doses of novel&#xD;
      oral poliovirus vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) given at different intervals of 1 week or 2 weeks or&#xD;
      the standard 4-week interval in infants&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label, parallel-group Phase III&#xD;
      study in healthy infants aged 6 to 8 weeks who have never been vaccinated against&#xD;
      poliomyelitis. Approximately 900 infants will be included in the study and randomized with a&#xD;
      1:1:1 ratio to the following treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: approximately 300 subjects to receive 2 doses of nOPV2 administered 1 week&#xD;
           apart, at Day 0 and Day 7;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B: approximately 300 subjects to receive 2 doses of nOPV2 administered 2 weeks&#xD;
           apart, at Day 0 and Day 14;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group C (control group): approximately 300 subjects to receive 2 doses of nOPV2&#xD;
           administered 4 weeks apart, at Day 0 and Day 28. A total of 4 on-site visits are&#xD;
           planned. Approximately 7 days after each administration of study vaccine, a phone call&#xD;
           or on-site visit will be performed to monitor subjects' safety and review with the&#xD;
           subject's parent(s)/guardian(s) any solicited AEs reported in the electronic diary card.&#xD;
           All subjects will have a safety follow-up phone call 6 months after the last dose of&#xD;
           study vaccine.&#xD;

             member of the subject's household.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Known allergy to any component of the study vaccine or to any antibiotics that share&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products since birth or planned&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Acute severe febrile illness on the day of vaccination deemed by the Investigator to&#xD;
             be a contraindication for vaccination (the child can be included at a later time if&#xD;
