  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 outbreak has been categorized as a pandemic and declared an international public&#xD;
      health emergency by WHO. In this context, an exceptional mobilization and a complete&#xD;
      reorganization of the organization of the healthcare offer was put in place.The investigators&#xD;
      will study the psychological consequences among emergency department (ED) / SAMU (Service&#xD;
      d'Aide Médicale Urgente) professionals exposed during the COVID-19 pandemic to high&#xD;
      psychological stress due to work overload, changes in practices and fears of&#xD;
      contamination.They will evaluate at 9 and 12 months after the end of the second lockdown&#xD;
      (July December 2020), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), personal and professional&#xD;
      stress, anxiety and depression, burn-out and consumption of anxiolytic products. This is a&#xD;
      multi-center study and includes doctors, DE interns and nurses, other paramedics and medical&#xD;
      regulatory assistants working in one of the ED or SAMU working during phase 3 of the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic. It should make it possible to know the psychological load of the months following&#xD;
      the epidemic among health professionals who worked in emergencies during this period and to&#xD;
      understand their risk of occurrence of PTSD. These elements are also essential to improve the&#xD;
      management of health crises and to put in place preventive measures for health professionals,&#xD;
      in particular in anticipation of recurrences, second wave or future new episode.&#xD;
