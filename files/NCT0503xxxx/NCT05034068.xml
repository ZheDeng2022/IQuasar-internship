    <textblock>
      A prospective study will be conducted at the Department of Oral Medicine, Periodontology,&#xD;
      Diagnosis and Oral Radiology Faculty of Dental Medicine, Assiut branch Al-Azhar University.&#xD;
      Patients with head and neck cancer under RT, CT treatment participated in this study were&#xD;
      selected from South Egypt Cancer Institute. During clinical examination the medical history&#xD;
      of the patient will be recorded. Data related to base illness, type and stage of RT&#xD;
      treatment, association or not to chemotherapy will be collected during the whole treatment.&#xD;
      After clinical examination, the patients will receive a kit containing toothbrush,&#xD;
      dentifrice, and subsequent oral hygiene instruction. Then the patients will be classified&#xD;
      into 3 groups as follow: Group I (control group): the patients will be treated by using oral&#xD;
      care only and evaluation will be done before cancer treatment and weekly till the treatment&#xD;
      completed. Group II: the patients will be treated by using 0.15% bezaydamine hydrochloride.&#xD;
      All patients were advised to rinse 15 mL of the solution benzydamine for 2 min, four to eight&#xD;
      times daily before and during, and for 2 weeks after completion of cancer therapy. Group III:&#xD;
      the patients will be treated by using a low-level laser therapy, the irradiations will be&#xD;
      done three times a week using low power laser with a wavelength of 870 nm. The irradiation&#xD;
      mode will be punctual and in contact, perpendicular to the oral mucosa.&#xD;
