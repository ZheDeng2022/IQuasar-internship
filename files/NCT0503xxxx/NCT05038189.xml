  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Axial Spondyloarthritis (Ax-SpA) are chronic systemic inflammatory rheumatological diseases&#xD;
      characterized by axial skeletal involvement and enthesitis. Sacroiliitis is the most&#xD;
      prominent sign of the disease. The International Society for the Evaluation of&#xD;
      Spondyloarthritis created a new classification for Ax-SpA in 2009. According to this&#xD;
      classification, Ax-SpA; It is divided into two groups as ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and&#xD;
      non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the emergence of the term nr-axSpA, studies have begun to compare AS and nr-axSpA in&#xD;
      terms of genetic, epidemiological and clinical features, treatment needs and response to&#xD;
      treatment.However, more studies are needed to better understand the clinical features and&#xD;
      symptoms of nr-axSpA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to determine the clinical features of patients with nr-axSpA and&#xD;
      AS; To evaluate spine posture, trunk position sense and gait parameters, and also to compare&#xD;
      these results with healthy individuals.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are no studies comparing spine posture, trunk position sense and gait parameters in&#xD;
      patients with nr-axSpA and AS. It is important to determine the changes that occur in&#xD;
      nr-axSpA patients in the early period. At the same time, taking the necessary precautions and&#xD;
      following these patients with the rehabilitation process can ensure that the radiographic&#xD;
      development is delayed or not at all in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Trunk position sense is different from each other in individuals with Nr-axSpA and AS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: Spatio-temporal features of gait are different in individuals with Nr-axSpA and AS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3: Plantar pressure distribution is different in individuals with Nr-axSpA and AS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Location of the Research: The research is carried out in Konya Necmettin Erbakan&#xD;
      University Meram Faculty of Medicine, Rheumatology Department. After obtaining the permission&#xD;
      of the ethics committee, official permission was obtained from Necmettin Erbakan University&#xD;
      Meram Medical Faculty Hospital Chief Physician to conduct the study.&#xD;

    <description>The spatiotemporal parameters of gait will be evaluated using the Diagnostic Support Baropodometer Footscan® 3D system. The spatial parameters of gait, step length (cm), step width (cm) and foot angle (degrees) and the temporal parameters of gait, speed (m/min), cadence (step/min) and stance time (sec) will be recorded. For evaluating of the plantar pressure distribution will be used the Diagnostic Support Baropodometer Footscan® 3D system, besides the dynamic evaluation and recording of the spatiotemporal parameters, the data on the total load on the forefoot, midfoot and hindfoot; the average pressure; and the distribution of load in the forefoot, midfoot and hindfoot will be also obtained.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Spine posture</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Thoracic and lumbar curvature tests will be performed with a digital inclinometer (Acumar®, Dual Digital Inclinometer, Lafayette Instrument Company, IN, USA). For throcic curvature, the 7th cervical vertebra, the most prominent spinous process, and the sacrum will be used as reference points to palpate the spinal processes of T1-T2 and T12-L1, respectively. The feet of the inclinometers will be placed as simultaneously as possible over T1-T2 and T12-L1. The angle on the digital display of the inclinometer will be recorded as degree. The mean of three successful measurements will be used. For lumbar curvature, the sacrum and iliac crest will be used as reference points to palpate the spinal processes of T12-L1 and L5-S1, respectively. The feet of the inclinometers will be placed as simultaneously as possible over T12-L1 and L5-S1. The angle on the digital display of the inclinometer will be recorded in degrees.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Trunk position sense</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Trunk position sense, as indicated by trunk reposition errors (TRE), will be assessed with a digital inclinometer (Acumar®,Dual Digital Inclinometer, Lafayette Instrument Company, IN, USA). The participants will be asked to stand upright in a comfortable position. The inferior angle of the scapula will first palpated as a bony landmark to find the spinousprocess of T4. After the placement of the inclinometer over the spinous process of T4, the participants will be asked to flex the trunk approximately 30° in the sagittal plane and hold this position for 3 s in eyes closed position. After returning to the neutral upright position, they will be asked to duplicate the previously attained position and held the position for 3 s for five times in a row. The absolute differences between the original position and the other five attempts will be recorded. The highest and lowest scores will be discarded and the mean of the tree remaining scores will be used to assess the trunk position sense.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stabilometric test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>In the stabilometric evaluation, a STABYLO platform, which is produced by Diagnostic Support, will be used. A 40x80 cm sensing surface with 12,800 active sensors is used for the examination of body oscillations in the upright position (the foot at 30°) and for the evaluation of body strategies in a specific time frame (maximum 51.2 sec) by maintaining the eyes in the open and closed positions. In the present study, the body oscillations with open and closed eyes will be calculated as an area in cm².</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index which consists of 6 questions will be used to evaluate disease activity. BASDAI is a composite index, consisting of an assessment on a 10 cm horizontal visual analog scale of fatigue, axial pain, peripheral pain, enthesopathy and stiffness. Fifth and sixth questions are averaged. Addition to this score, other questions are averaged. Total score is between 0 and 10. Higher score represent worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lumbopelvic stabilization assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Lumbopelvic stabilization will be evaluated by a pressure biofeedback unit (Stabilizer Pressure Biofeedback Unit, Chattanooga Group Inc., Hixson, TN, USA). The participant will be positioned in crook lying position and the pressure cell will be placed under the lumbar spine and inflate to the baseline pressure of 40 mmHg. The participant will be instructed to perform abdominal hollowing without moving their spine or pelvis, and to hold the contraction for 10 seconds monitored by using a digital watch. The change in pressure during abdominal hollowing will be repeated three times and the mean of all the measurements will be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease-Related Functional Status</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) was used to assess the functional status. BASFI includes 10 items which eight of them related to physical limitations, and two of them inquiry about the coping strategies in daily life. Each item is scored between 0 and 10 (0: easy, 10: impossible) by the patient. The total score is calculated by summing all the items and dividing them to 10. Higher scores indicate a higher level of functional limitations.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease-Related Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (ASQoL) will be used to evaluate the disease-related quality of life. It includes 18 yes/no questions. Each yes answer is scored as onepoint. ASQoL is a valid and reliable tool for both clinical purposes and scientific research. Higher scores indicate poorer quality of life.</description>
