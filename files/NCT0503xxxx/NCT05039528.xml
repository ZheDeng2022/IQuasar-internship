  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this protocol is to conduct a focus group to identify OSA beliefs,&#xD;
      attitudes, and knowledge among employees in the transportation industry on shift schedules.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transportation shift workers (TSW, e.g., overnight, on-call, or rotating) have been&#xD;
      identified as a high-risk group for health conditions (e.g., obesity, cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease). Also, TSW are at risk for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). According to one study,&#xD;
      approximately 36% of TSWs have OSA, a condition that exacerbates health risks and daytime&#xD;
      sleepiness. A recent report from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) showed that&#xD;
      those with untreated OSA cost on average $4,261 more than those without OSA. Also concerning,&#xD;
      workers with OSA who are non-adherent to recommended OSA treatment (i.e., continuous positive&#xD;
      airway pressure, CPAP) are at particularly high risk for motor vehicle accidents compared to&#xD;
      those who are adherent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol outlines focus groups that will aim to identify knowledge, attitudes, and&#xD;
      beliefs about OSA among TSW. Results of these focus groups will be used in future research to&#xD;
      design a tailored website for relaying OSA information to TSW.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A 2-month pre-post pilot study will be conducted. Two worksites will be selected at random then randomized to either the tailored (intervention) or non-tailored (control) groups. Participants who fit the eligibility criteria will be recruited from each worksite and assigned to the study arm corresponding to their worksite (20 per worksite for a total of 40 participants).</intervention_model_description>
