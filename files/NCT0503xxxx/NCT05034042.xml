  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for menopausal women who have hot flashes. Menopause, a normal part of life, is&#xD;
      the time after a woman's last period. Hot flashes often occur during menopause. They can&#xD;
      disrupt a woman's daily life. This study will take place in Japan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide more information on a potential new treatment, called fezolinetant.&#xD;
      The treatments in this study are fezolinetant or a placebo. In this study, a placebo is a&#xD;
      dummy treatment that looks like fezolinetant but does not have any medicine in it. The study&#xD;
      will compare fezolinetant with the placebo to find the best dose of fezolinetant to reduce&#xD;
      the number and severity of hot flashes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women that want to take part in the study will be given an electronic handheld device to&#xD;
      track their hot flashes. In the last 10 days before their next clinic visit, the women will&#xD;
      record information about their hot flashes. Women will be picked for 1 of 3 treatments (lower&#xD;
      or higher dose of fezolinetant, or placebo) by chance alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who take part in the study will take 2 tablets every day for 12 weeks. Treatment will&#xD;
      be double-blinded. That means that the women in the study and the study doctors will not know&#xD;
      who takes which of the study medicines (lower or higher dose of fezolinetant, or placebo).&#xD;
      The women will continue recording information about their hot flashes on the electronic&#xD;
      device. They will also use another device to answer questions about how hot flashes affect&#xD;
      their daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, the women will visit their study clinic several times for a check-up. This&#xD;
      will happen during weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 15. At the check-up, they will be asked if they have&#xD;
      any medical problems. Other checks will include some blood samples taken for laboratory&#xD;
      tests. At some check-ups, the women will have a physical exam, an ECG to check their heart&#xD;
      rhythm, and their vital signs checked (pulse rate, temperature and blood pressure). At the&#xD;
      first visit and in week 15, women who have a uterus will also have a test called a&#xD;
      transvaginal ultrasound. A probe is gently placed inside the vagina. Sound waves will create&#xD;
      a picture of the organs in the pelvis. This will allow the study doctor to look more closely&#xD;
      at the uterus and surrounding organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last check-up (at week 15) will be 3 weeks after they take their last tablets of study&#xD;
      medicine (lower or higher dose of fezolinetant or placebo).&#xD;
