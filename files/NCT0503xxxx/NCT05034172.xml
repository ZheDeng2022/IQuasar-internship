    <textblock>
      Inherited movement disorders are rare conditions, whose cumulative prevalence are in the&#xD;
      order of 5-10/100,000 inhabitants, in most cases progressive and can lead to a significant&#xD;
      loss of autonomy after one or more decades of evolution. They include spinocerebellar ataxias&#xD;
      and hyperkinetic disorders (dystonias, choreas, tremor, parkinsonism and myoclonus with&#xD;
      variable combination of those, or more complex alteration of movements). The existence of the&#xD;
      National Reference Centre (CMR) for Rare Diseases (CMR Neurogenetics, devoted to ataxias and&#xD;
      spastic paraparesis, dystonia and rare movement disorders and CMR Huntington, devoted to&#xD;
      Huntington Disease) has allowed a more integrated vision of these diseases. This is&#xD;
      illustrated, in the same family, by the occurrence of different clinical expressions of&#xD;
      spinocerebellar ataxias and hyperkinetic disorders that share the same genetic background.&#xD;
      Conversely, different causal mutations within the same gene may have very different ages at&#xD;
      onset and a wide range of clinical expression, and the spectrum of new phenotypes linked to a&#xD;
      single gene is still expanding . Many ataxia and dystonia genes are involved in similar&#xD;
      pathways. There are numerous arguments supporting a share pathogenesis including synaptic&#xD;
      transmission and neurodevelopment .&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIOMOV project aims to :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. establish the clinical spectrum and natural history of these diseases,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. understand the role of genetic and familial factors on the phenotype,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. elucidate the molecular basis of these disorders and evaluate diagnostic strategies&#xD;
           involving molecular tools for clinical and genetic management,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. develop multimodal biomarkers both for physiopathological studies and for accurate&#xD;
           measures of disease progression,&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. develop trial ready cohorts of well characterized genetic patients,&#xD;

      Inherited movement disorders are rare conditions, whose cumulative prevalence are in the&#xD;
      order of 5-10/100,000 inhabitants, in most cases progressive and can lead to a significant&#xD;
      loss of autonomy after one or more decades of evolution. They include spinocerebellar ataxias&#xD;
      and hyperkinetic disorders (dystonias, choreas, tremor, parkinsonism and myoclonus with&#xD;
      variable combination of those, or more complex alteration of movements). The existence of the&#xD;
      National Reference Centre (CMR) for Rare Diseases (CMR Neurogenetics, devoted to ataxias and&#xD;
      spastic paraparesis, dystonia and rare movement disorders and CMR Huntington, devoted to&#xD;
      Huntington Disease) has allowed a more integrated vision of these diseases. This is&#xD;
      illustrated, in the same family, by the occurrence of different clinical expressions of&#xD;
      spinocerebellar ataxias and hyperkinetic disorders that share the same genetic background.&#xD;
      Conversely, different causal mutations within the same gene may have very different ages at&#xD;
      onset and a wide range of clinical expression, and the spectrum of new phenotypes linked to a&#xD;
      single gene is still expanding .&#xD;
&#xD;
      any ataxia and dystonia genes are involved in similar pathways. There are numerous arguments&#xD;
      supporting a share pathogenesis including synaptic transmission and neurodevelopment .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, there are a number of arguments for a shared genetic approach and biomarkers&#xD;
      research for these inherited movement disorders:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evidence from a clinico-genetic approach: A combination of several movement disorders is&#xD;
           often observed in the same patient with causative mutation in either genetic groups of&#xD;
           spinocerebellar degenerations, dystonias or choreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evidence from neuroimaging: the current concept of networks disorders underlies the&#xD;
           pathophysiology of these hyperkinetic movement disorders. Variable combination of&#xD;
           functional and/ or structural alterations of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical,&#xD;
           cortex-basal ganglia and corticospinal networks, and their complex interactions have&#xD;
           been described in ataxias ,dystonia choreas and more complex disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genetic diagnosis: deciphering diagnosis with wide range of phenotypes Even in times of&#xD;
           next generation sequencing covering exomes and genomes, diagnosing spinocerebellar&#xD;
           degenerations, dystonia and other hyperkinetic disorders remains a challenge as: i) the&#xD;
           causative gene remains to be identified for a substantial share those disorders; the&#xD;
           pathogenicity of variants of unknown significance in known and potential novel disease&#xD;
           genes often requires time-consuming functional analyses not available on a routine&#xD;
           basis; ii) in many countries, including France, access to diagnostic whole exome and&#xD;
           whole genome sequencing is still limited; iii) the proportions of abnormal expansions&#xD;
           not seen in exome studies are frequent in spinocerebellar degenerations and need a&#xD;
           technological development to identify them. Analysis of familial forms revealed a great&#xD;
           heterogeneity of the phenotype within the same family in terms of age at onset, severity&#xD;
           and clinical presentation. Moreover, this phenotypic variability is not explained only&#xD;
           by the genetic heterogeneity but also by the underlying frequent exonic or intronic&#xD;
           expansions of triplet or more complex repeats, and more recently by the discovery of&#xD;
           genetic modifiers ; iv) for dystonia and hyperkinetic disorders, some of those disorders&#xD;
           also include nonmovement disorders neurological (e.g. intellectual deficiencies,&#xD;
           hypotonia at birth, immature motor control, deafness, visual defects) and&#xD;
           non-neurological (dysmorphological features) symptoms and the movement disorders panels&#xD;
           do not always include the genes involved in developmental disorders; v) among the&#xD;
           dominantly inherited forms such as Huntington disease, the access to genetic testing&#xD;
           procedures allows early preventive therapeutic interventions in premanifest individuals.&#xD;
           There is a lack of clinical evaluation to tackle the efficiency of treatment and the&#xD;
           need for biomarker development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Natural history and prognosis: need for quantitative, reproducible markers, sensitive to&#xD;
           evolution Biomarkers search is ongoing in those pathologies. They are valuable in&#xD;
           assisting diagnosis, have prognostic value, quantify disease progression and serve as&#xD;
           outcome parameters in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These elements demonstrate the need to develop quantitative tools that are easy to use,&#xD;
      reproducible and sensitive to disease progression in order to accurately determine the&#xD;
      natural history of the disease. This lack of systematic knowledge impedes diagnosis, patient&#xD;
      counselling and therapy development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall: Identification of the underlying gene and its pathogenic changes or variant(s)&#xD;
      contributes to precise diagnosis, genetic counselling and follow-up. Advances in molecular&#xD;
      genetics have highlighted the genotypic complexity, justifying the need for rigorous clinical&#xD;
      and para-clinical evaluation to establish relevant phenotype-genotype correlations. In&#xD;
      dystonia and in spinocerebellar degenerations attempts have been made to classify the genes&#xD;
      involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular genetic analysis will make it possible to specify the correlations between&#xD;
      phenotype and genotype in order to propose rational molecular diagnostic strategies based on&#xD;
      the frequency and nature of mutations, taking into account the phenotype. Genetic analyses&#xD;
      will have an impact in terms of public health since they will serve as a basis for guiding&#xD;
      requests for molecular analyses in these pathologies. In addition, recent advances in&#xD;
      therapeutic trials will need the careful selection of participants, mostly based on&#xD;
      biomarkers, for successful testing of new therapeutical agents. Therefore, it seems essential&#xD;
      that this cohort of patients be supplemented by a collection of biological material for&#xD;
      genetic research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIOMOV project aims to : 1) establish the clinical spectrum and natural history of these&#xD;
      diseases, 2) understand the role of genetic and familial factors on the phenotype, 3)&#xD;
      elucidate the molecular basis of these disorders and evaluate diagnostic strategies involving&#xD;
      molecular tools for clinical and genetic management, 4) develop multimodal biomarkers both&#xD;
      for physiopathological studies and for accurate measures of disease progression, 5) develop&#xD;
      trial ready cohorts of well characterized genetic patients, 6) test new therapies either&#xD;
      symptomatic or based on pathophysiological mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is crucial to be able to establish a large cohort of patients whose genotype will be&#xD;
      specified. Follow-up of patients at different stages of the disease will make it possible to&#xD;
      collect the natural history of the disease in a descriptive manner, with prospects for&#xD;
      patient management, since the prognosis in terms of loss of autonomy or disability will be&#xD;
      better specified. However, the main interest of the proposed clinical follow-up is to be able&#xD;
      to quantitatively describe the progression of the main neurological diseases. These data are&#xD;
      absolutely essential for the future implementation of therapeutic trials. The number of&#xD;
      patients likely to be recruited and followed up a unique resource for such a project&#xD;
