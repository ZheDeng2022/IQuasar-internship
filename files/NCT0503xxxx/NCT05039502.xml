  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonsurgical root canal retreatment may become essential when the initial endodontic treatment&#xD;
      fails because of the persistent intracanal or extracanal infections.The aim of this thesis&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the effect of ProTaper Universal Retreatment (PTUR), Reciproc blue and&#xD;
      XP-endo Finisher R file systems, which are used in the removal of root canal filling&#xD;
      materials during retreatment with different motion kinetics on the release of Substance P,&#xD;
      Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP), IL-6 and IL-10 inflammatory mediators in the&#xD;
      periapical region&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seventy-five individuals with asymptomatic and chronic apical periodontitis teeth with&#xD;
      retreatment indication were included in the study. Individuals were randomly divided into&#xD;
      three groups according to the file system used to remove root canal filling materials (n =&#xD;
      25): ProTaper Universal Retreatment, Reciproc blue and XP-endo Finisher R.After the removal&#xD;
      of the previous root canal filling materials, reshaping and disinfection of the root canals,&#xD;
      periapical fluid samples were taken from the root tip of the teeth in all three groups. The&#xD;
      amount of Substance P, CGRP, IL-6 and IL-10 mediators that cause pain, swelling and flare-up&#xD;
      in periapical fluid samples were measured by ELISA test.&#xD;
