      [Aim] Purpose of the study: to analyze the effect of vitamin D supplementation in reducing&#xD;
      COVID-19 morbidity and severity in healthcare workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve a minimum of 120 medical staff. All participants in the study will&#xD;
      assess twice for serum 25(OH)D level: baseline and after 3 months of Vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation. After the baseline examination, the subjects will be randomized into 2&#xD;
      groups. In the first (No. 1), vitamin D therapy will initiate at a dosage of 50,000 IU on the&#xD;
      first and second week, followed by a switch to a daily intake of 5,000 IU for 3 months. In&#xD;
      the second group (No. 2), vitamin D therapy will prescribe for 3 months at a dosage of 2,000&#xD;
      IU/day. After 3 months of vitamin D supplementation, all participants will undergo to repeat&#xD;
      testing of serum 25(OH)D level with an assessment of the effectiveness of the therapy. Body&#xD;
      mass index (BMI), height, weight, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG), 25-hydroxycalciferol (25(OH)D)&#xD;
      and presence of acute viral infection futures, parameters assessed after treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic that swept the world in 2019 radically changed not only the social&#xD;
      sphere of life, subordinating everything around to its influence, but also the healthcare&#xD;
      sector. It affected both its practical and scientific sides, globally changing the approach&#xD;
      to medicine. Numerous studies around the globe are being conducted on the prevention and&#xD;
      treatment of this infection. A significant amount of them study the role of vitamin D in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of the disease. Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D) is a fat-soluble vitamin that is&#xD;
      involved in maintaining the serum calcium-phosphorus gradient. Vitamin D supplementation&#xD;
      significantly reduces the risk of osteoporosis, and also affects the regulation of immune&#xD;
      responses by modulating innate and adaptive immune responses. It has been shown to inhibit&#xD;
      the proliferation of T cells, namely the subsequent transformation of Th1 cells to Th2 cells.&#xD;
      This effect on cell proliferation and differentiation contributes to a significant decrease&#xD;
      in the level of proinflammatory cytokines, thereby reducing the severity of immune-mediated&#xD;
      damage. It was these mechanisms that formed the basis of the theory about the ability of&#xD;
      vitamin D to prevent the severe course of coronavirus infection and even prevent it. At the&#xD;
      moment, the effect of vitamin D on reducing COVID-19 morbidity is not fully confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods: Baseline characteristics will be recorded for all patients including&#xD;
      medical history, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (IgG) and&#xD;
      25(OH)D. Serum 25(OH)D level, IgG to SARS-CoV-2 will be repeated at 12-14 weeks. Also, we&#xD;
      will check information about clinical manifestation of COVID -19 and CT results in cases&#xD;
      positive Ab. The research format is a prospective controlled single-center study. The study&#xD;
      was carried out based on the Federal State Budgetary Institution, V. A. Almazov Federal&#xD;
      North-West Medical Research Centre, of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation,&#xD;
      October 30, 2020, to August 31, 2021. During the study, medical care workers who are working&#xD;
      in an infectious hospital and who taking vitamin D in a controlled manner, having previously&#xD;
      signed informed consent, will be observed. The study will be involved minimum 120 medical&#xD;
      staff, including women and men. All subjects will be divided into three groups according to&#xD;
      the criterion of having a higher, secondary, or no medical education. All participants in the&#xD;
      study will be assessed twice for the level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], IgG to&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 in their blood: before the start of therapy with cholecalciferol and after 3&#xD;
      months of Vitamin D administration. After the screening, the subjects will be randomized into&#xD;
      2 groups. In the Group 1, vitamin D therapy will be initiated at a dosage of 50,000 IU on the&#xD;
      first and seventh week, followed by a switch to a daily intake of 5,000 IU for 12 weeks. In&#xD;
      the Group 2, vitamin D therapy will be prescribed for 12 weeks at a dosage of 2,000 IU. After&#xD;
      3 months of taking vitamin D supplementation, all participants will undergo to repeat testing&#xD;
      of the 25(OH)D level in the blood with an assessment of the effectiveness of the therapy. IgG&#xD;
      titer and PCR results will be compared in two groups of participations taking different doses&#xD;
      of vitamin D supplementation.&#xD;
