  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in the United States.&#xD;
      Endovascular intervention with mechanical thrombectomy has become the standard of care for&#xD;
      acute large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke since multiple clinical trials demonstrated&#xD;
      improved long-term clinical outcomes with treatment. However, despite high rates of&#xD;
      successful vessel recanalization and thus reperfusion of ischemic brain tissue in current&#xD;
      practice, many patients continue to suffer debilitating strokes and poor long-term functional&#xD;
      outcome. Pharmacologic neuroprotection could potentially present a means of addressing this&#xD;
      mismatch in radiologic vs. clinical outcomes by protecting and salvaging damaged brain&#xD;
      tissue. Intra-arterial delivery of a cocktail of neuroprotective therapy at the time of&#xD;
      endovascular reperfusion would provide immediate, targeted therapy directly to the damaged&#xD;
      brain territory. Hypothermia, minocycline and magnesium can target multiple facets of the&#xD;
      complex ischemic injury cascade, and have each demonstrated neuroprotection in multiple&#xD;
      preclinical models. This is a phase I trial that aims to demonstrate safety and feasibility&#xD;
      of administering cold saline, minocycline, and magnesium sulfate intra-arterially immediately&#xD;
      after thrombectomy in stroke interventions.&#xD;

      This is a phase I, single center, single arm clinical trial with dose escalation design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Location: North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, NY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Subjects aged 18-90 years undergoing mechanical thrombectomy for acute&#xD;
      ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion at North Shore University Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To demonstrate the safety and feasibility of intra-arterial administration&#xD;
      of a cocktail of neuroprotective agents at the time of reperfusion in endovascular stroke&#xD;
      intervention for acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) To describe the feasibility of delivering a combination of neuroprotective agents directly&#xD;
      into the affected internal carotid artery immediately after recanalization of an occluded&#xD;
      vessel in ischemic stroke intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) To describe the maximum tolerated dose of a combination of 4C saline at 30 ml/min for 10&#xD;
      minutes, minocycline, and magnesium sulfate directly into the affected internal carotid&#xD;
      artery immediately after recanalization of an occluded vessel in ischemic stroke&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) To describe the clinical outcomes of the patients undergoing the experimental procedure&#xD;
      and compare to historical controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: Presence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 24 hours of&#xD;
      treatment; presence of serious adverse event related to the administration of intra-arterial&#xD;
      cold saline, minocycline or MgSO4; and technical feasibility of the proposed experimental&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints: Total volume of infarct on MRI 24 hours after procedure, clinical&#xD;
      outcome as measured by the NIHSS prior to discharge and MRS at 90 day follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the available literature, the target dose of Minocycline and MgSO4 is 6 mg/kg and&#xD;
      2g, respectively. For targeted hypothermia, 4C normal saline will be infused at a rate of 30&#xD;
      ml/min to achieve an estimated drop in temperature in the ipsilateral hemisphere to 33-34C&#xD;
      within 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure adequate safety measures, a dose escalation design is employed to carefully&#xD;
      evaluate for adverse events throughout the study. The standard &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalation design&#xD;
      will be used in the 3 groups described below. Within each group, at each dosage, if none of&#xD;
      the first 3 patients experience a related adverse event, the study proceeds to the next group&#xD;
      or dose level. If one of the 3 patients experiences an adverse event, then an additional 3&#xD;
      patients will be treated at that dose level before proceeding. Escalation will continue only&#xD;
      if a maximum of 1 out of 6 patients experience an adverse event. If 2 or more patients at a&#xD;
      given dose level experience an adverse event, then the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be&#xD;
      determined as the preceding dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: IA cold saline alone 3-6 patients receive 4C at 30 ml/min over 10 min&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: IA cold saline + Minocycline 3-6 patients receive IA cold saline + 2 mg/kg&#xD;
      Minocycline; 3-6 patients receive IA cold saline + 4 mg/kg Minocycline; 3-6 patients receive&#xD;
      IA cold saline + 6 mg/kg Minocycline&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3: IA cold saline + Minocycline + Magnesium sulfate 3-6 patients receive IA cold saline&#xD;
      + MTD Minocycline + 2g MgSO4; 3-6 patients receive IA cold saline + MTD Minocycline + 4g&#xD;
      MgSO4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the Minocycline and MgSO4 will be reconstituted within the 300 ml of cold saline to be&#xD;
      administered together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-stroke intervention care will proceed as standard of care with the addition of screening&#xD;
      for adverse events related to the IA administration of cold saline, minocycline and/or&#xD;
      magnesium sulfate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1: CT or MRI within 24h of intervention, neurologic exam, routine labs, NIHSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day of discharge: neurologic exam, routine labs, NIHSS, mRS. Day 90: neurologic exam, NIHSS,&#xD;
      mRS.&#xD;
