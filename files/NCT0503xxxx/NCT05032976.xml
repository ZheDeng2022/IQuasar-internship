  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will collect information on the safety of COMIRNATY for at least 3,000 subjects&#xD;
      who have been administered in a routine clinical practice for 6 years after COMIRNATY is&#xD;
      approved for use in Korea, and will be conducted in accordance with the New Drug&#xD;
      Re-Examination Guideline of the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-comparative, non-interventional, prospective, and multi-center&#xD;
      study conducted in Korean health care centers by accredited physicians to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      of COMIRNATY in Korean subjects aged 12 or older who are scheduled for the vaccination.&#xD;
      COMIRNATY will be administered according to the &quot;Dosage and Administration&quot; of the approved&#xD;
      labeling. There is no visit or activity mandated by this study. The investigator will collect&#xD;
      data from the subject's medical records and patient (subject) report outcome (PRO), and&#xD;
      record the information on each subject's case report form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 3000 subjects will be enrolled in several centers in this study. Pfizer Pharmaceuticals&#xD;
      Korea will conclude a post-marketing surveillance agreement with an investigator site before&#xD;
      performing the study. Investigators at the institution that sign the agreement should&#xD;
      consecutively prepare the CRFs from the subjects who this vaccine was administered to first&#xD;
      after the start date of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each investigator will sequentially enroll all subjects to whom COMIRNATY is prescribed for&#xD;
      the first time according to the local product document and who agree to participate in this&#xD;
      study by signing the data privacy statement used in place of the informed consent form until&#xD;
      the total requested cases per center are collected for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An electronic diary will be used in this study to collect adverse events that occur after&#xD;
      injection. Follow-up exams will be carried out from after the first injection to before the&#xD;
      second injection, and from after the second injection to 28 days after the second injection.&#xD;
      For the follow-up adverse event CRF, either an application using the mobile phones of&#xD;
      subjects or entry on a paper questionnaire may be selected. The CRF will be filled out every&#xD;
      day after the first and second injections. If an application is used, it is automatically&#xD;
      sent as an eCRF. If a paper questionnaire is used, the questionnaire filled out after the&#xD;
      first injection is collected at the time of the visit for the second injection and 28 days&#xD;
      after the second injection by mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To promote the collection of adverse events after injection, a reminder may be given by phone&#xD;
      about entering the information and the collection of the CRF to subjects who gave consent&#xD;
      beforehand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety is the primary interest of this study, which will be assessed based on adverse events&#xD;
      (AEs) that occur during 28days from the first and the last dose of COMIRNATY.&#xD;
