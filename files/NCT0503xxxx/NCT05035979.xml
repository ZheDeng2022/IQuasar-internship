  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We designed the study as a double-blind,randomized,controlled clinical trial.The aim of this&#xD;
      trial is to clarify the treatment efficacy, safety, and recurrence control of BaiDi&#xD;
      QuZhi(BDQZ) granule combined with Ju Yin(JY) cream in the treatment of acne vulgaris.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acne is a chronic inflammatory skin disease of hair follicle and sebaceous gland, which is&#xD;
      common in adolescents and adults.Systemic drugs commonly used in the treatment of acne&#xD;
      include isotretinoin, oral antibiotics and hormone preparations. Isotretinoin is the first&#xD;
      choice for the treatment of moderate and severe acne, but its use is limited by its adverse&#xD;
      reactions such as cheilitis, elevated blood lipids and teratogenicity .The efficacy of BDQZ&#xD;
      granule in the treatment of acne is accurate. However, large-scale randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials have not been conducted on the efficacy, safety and recurrence of BDQZ granule.&#xD;
      Therefore, our aim was to conduct a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial of oral BDQZ granule combined with JY cream in the treatment of acne vulgaris.&#xD;
