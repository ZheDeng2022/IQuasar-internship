  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background：About 50% of subclinical heart failure (Sub-HF) patients might have residual lung&#xD;
      ultrasound B-lines (LU-BL). Sub-HF is insensitive to widely used imaging examinations, like&#xD;
      x-ray or echocardiography, but lung ultrasound (LU) can sufficiently detect pulmonary&#xD;
      congestion in Sub-HF patients. Previous studies showed that residual LU-BL is associated&#xD;
      worse clinical outcome among patients with chronic heart failure. In this trial, we sought to&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of LU-BL guided intensive HF management post discharge in patients with&#xD;
      residual LU-BL on outcome up to 1 year after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: IMP-OUTCOME is a prospective, single-center, observational cohort study, which is&#xD;
      designed to investigate whether LU-BL-guided intensive HF management post discharge might&#xD;
      improve the outcome of HF patients with residual B-lines at discharge up to 1 year after&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and results: After receiving the standardized treatment of HF according to current&#xD;
      guidelines, 320 HF patients with ≥ 3 B-lines (LU-BL, assessed within 48 hours before&#xD;
      discharge) will be divided into the conventional HF management group and the LU-BL-guided&#xD;
      intensive HF management group at 1:1 ratio. LU-BL-guided intensive HF management group will&#xD;
      receive optimized HF medication according to current guidelines and medication will be&#xD;
      adjusted according the status of LU-BL during the follow-up at 2-month interval.&#xD;
      Patient-relates basic, clinical data including sex, age, blood chemistry, imaging&#xD;
      examination, drug utilization, and so on will be obtained and analyzed. Following discharge&#xD;
      from the hospital, patients in the conventional HF management group will receive optimized HF&#xD;
      medication according to current guidelines and medication will be adjusted without knowing&#xD;
      the status of LU-BL during the follow-up at 2-month interval. B-lines will be assessed at&#xD;
      2-month interval post discharge in LU-BL-guided intensive HF management group, and at the 12&#xD;
      month post discharge in the conventional HF management group. Echocardiography examination&#xD;
      will be performed at 12 months for all patients and EF, E/e', LA size and systolic pulmonary&#xD;
      artery pressure will be assessed. The primary endpoint is the composite of re-hospitalization&#xD;
      for worsening HF and all-cause death during follow-up. Secondary endpoints include the change&#xD;
      in the Duke Activity Status Index (DASI) and NT-pro BNP, arrythmia and 6-minutes walk&#xD;
      distance at each follow up, EF and B-lines changes at final follow up. Up to the end of 2022,&#xD;
      approximately 233 HF patients will be enrolled. Follow up is expected to be completed around&#xD;
      the end of 2023, and primary results will be available by early 2024.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: This trial will clarify the impact of LU-BL guided intensive HF management on&#xD;
      outcome for discharged patients with residual B-lines up to 1 year after discharge.&#xD;
