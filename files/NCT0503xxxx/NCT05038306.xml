  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is one of autosomal dominant hereditary ataxias.&#xD;
      Standing imbalance, unsteady gait, dysmetria, fatigue, and depression would occur gradually.&#xD;
      There are no effective treatment or palliative methods for patients in the present days.&#xD;
      However, low-dose growth hormone, or its downstream product, insulin-like growth factor I&#xD;
      (IGF-1), may deter the progress of SCA3 in transgenic mice. The main bioactive constituent&#xD;
      among the Chinese medicine WT possesses neuroprotective function against glutamate-induced&#xD;
      toxicity, which is one major pathology of SCA3. It promotes neurogenesis, and increases the&#xD;
      protein expression of IGF-1 in ischemic brains of rats. Thus, we designed a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind trial for patients with SCA3, if WT is a possible neuroprotective medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the subjects will be recruited from Changhua Christian Hospital. Diagnosis is confirmed&#xD;
      by gene test and magnetic resonance image by a neurologist. They will be assigned in random&#xD;
      and double blind, prescribed with 3 grams concentrated powder of WT or placebo, twice a day,&#xD;
      for 12 weeks. After the washout period of 4 weeks, there will be a crossover of placebo or WT&#xD;
      for another 12 weeks. After that, another 4-week rest will be followed by the end of trial.&#xD;
      Check items in five check points include: 1. Blood examination (serum IGF-1, Neurofilament&#xD;
      light chain, mitochondria copy number, 8_OHdG, delta-Ct), 2.Neurological exam (Scale for the&#xD;
      Assessment and Rating of Ataxia), 3. Questionnaires (Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, Epworth&#xD;
      Sleepiness Scale), 4. Handgrip strength test (which is correlated to IGF-1 value in elderly),&#xD;
      and 5. serum metabolites, . All the data will be disclosed after the end of trial. Paired-T&#xD;
      test or Wilcoxon Ranked Sign Test will be operated in SPSS.&#xD;
