      This study was conducted to examine the effects of IMB model-based education and&#xD;
      telephone-based Motivational Interviewing interventions on care outcomes for adults with Type&#xD;
      2 diabetes (HbA1c, BKİ, diabetes knowledge, health belief, self-efficacy, self-management).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      IMB model-based interventions were applied to the intervention group for 12 weeks. For the&#xD;
      information component of the IMB model, diabetes education consisting of four sessions was&#xD;
      given in groups of five in the first two weeks. Each patient was given a &quot;Diabetes Management&#xD;
      Education Booklet&quot; prepared by the researchers. For the motivation component of the IMB&#xD;
      model, a 30-minute motivational interview was made with individual video calls once every two&#xD;
      weeks starting from the third week. The control group received usual care. HbA1c, BMI,&#xD;
      diabetes knowledge, health belief, diabetes self-efficacy, and diabetes self-management were&#xD;
      measured at baseline, at 12 weeks, and at 24 weeks.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The change in diabetes knowledge level of individuals with Type 2 diabetes at 12 and 24 weeks with the Diabetes Knowledge Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 week and 24 week</time_frame>
    <description>This scale was used to measure the knowledge component in the IMB model of individuals. The scale was developed by Erener Yavuz and Erol (2019) to measure the knowledge level of adults with diabetes. The scale consists of 5 sub-dimensions, including General Information on Diabetes (6 items), Blood Glucose Measurements and Values (5 items), Diabetes Risk Factors (4 items), Diabetes Symptoms (8 items), Diabetes Complications (5 items), and 28 consists of matter. Scale answers consist of two sets of items, true and false. Among the yes/no/don't know answer type questions, 1 point is given to those who give correct answers, 0 points are given to those who do not know and give wrong answers. The maximum score that can be obtained from the scale is 28, and the minimum score is 0.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The change in diabetes health belief of individuals with Type 2 diabetes at 12 and 24 weeks with the Health Belief Model Scale in Diabetes Patients.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 week and 24 week</time_frame>
    <description>This scale was used to measure the individual motivation component in the IMB model of individuals. The scale consists of 5 sub-dimensions and 33 items: perceived sensitivity (4 items), perceived seriousness (3 items), perceived benefits (7 items), perceived barriers (9 items), recommended health-related activities (10 items). The mean score of each sub-dimension is determined by dividing the total scores of all items in the sub-dimension by the total number of items. The total scale mean score is calculated by dividing the total scores of all scale items by the total number of items. The minimum score for each item is 1 and the maximum score is 5. Rating was made as strongly disagree (1), strongly agree (5). Low scores indicate negative and high scores indicate positive health beliefs. If the mean score for each item is 4 and above, it indicates high or positive health belief, and if the mean score is less than 4, it indicates low health belief.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The change in diabetes self efficacy of individuals with Type 2 diabetes at 12 and 24 weeks with the Diabetes Self-Efficacy Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 week and 24 week</time_frame>
    <description>The &quot;Self-Efficacy Scale&quot; for diabetes management in type 2 diabetes patients was developed to determine the perception of diabetes patients' own power to carry out their own care activities. The items that make up the scale are based on the following activities. Activities to be done for diabetes treatment (drug use, diet, physical exercise), self-monitoring, self-control (knowing the value of blood sugar, body weight, foot control, general health), regulating their own activities (hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia correction, preparing for vacation) change in diet, overweight, self-control in case of illness and stress). The scale consists of 20 items. The lowest score to be taken from the scale is 20, and the highest score is 100.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The change in diabetes self managament of individuals with Type 2 diabetes at 12 and 24 weeks with the Diabetes Self-Management Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 week and 24 week</time_frame>
    <description>This scale was used to measure the behavioral component of individuals in the IMB model. The validity and reliability study of the Turkish Diabetes Self-Management Perception Scale was conducted by Eroğlu and Sabuncu (2018). The scale consists of 16 items and 4 sub-dimensions and is a 4-point Likert type. Glucose Management sub-dimension: Items 4, 6, 10, 12 (items 4 and 12 are about drug use, items 1, 6 and 10 are about blood glucose monitoring). Diet Control sub-dimension: Items 2, 5, 9, 13. Physical Activity sub-dimension: Items 8, 11, 15. Use of Health Services sub-dimension: It consists of 3, 7, 14, and 16 items. The DMS scale consists of 16 items, 7 of which are straight and 9 of which are reversed. The scores of the items numbered &quot;5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16&quot; in the scale are calculated by reversing them. Diabetes self-management increases as the score gets closer to 10.</description>
