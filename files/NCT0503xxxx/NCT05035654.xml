      This study will assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of two LYR-220 designs&#xD;
      in symptomatic adult chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) subjects who have had a prior bilateral&#xD;
      total ethmoidectomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LYR-220 is a combination product comprised of a drug matrix, which contains the&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory medication mometasone furoate (MF) pre-loaded in a single use applicator.&#xD;
      LYR-220 is intended to be placed bilaterally into the sino-nasal passages by an&#xD;
      otolaryngologist. Once in place, each LYR-220 drug matrix is designed to gradually deliver&#xD;
      sustained topical doses of MF to the inflamed mucosal sinus tissue over 24 weeks.&#xD;
