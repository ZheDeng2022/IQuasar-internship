    <textblock>
      The chief aim of root canal treatment is to reduce the microbial content and prevent further&#xD;
      recontamination in the canal. Properly cleaned, shaped and obturated teeth will be having&#xD;
      fewer chances of treatment failure. Every tooth has variable, complex canal anatomy&#xD;
      consisting of ramifications and lateral canal. The instrumentation alone cannot reach all the&#xD;
      areas for cleaning. For proper cleaning and removal of all microorganisms, the canal should&#xD;
      be irrigated with any biocompatible, lubricant and antimicrobial agent. An irrigant should&#xD;
      have a high compatibility factor, with canals, with obturating material and sealer. It should&#xD;
      remove all the superficial barriers from canal tubules and allow sealer penetration, which&#xD;
      aids in better adhesion and decreases the chances for recontamination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: This study aims to compare the effect of experimental endodontic irrigant&#xD;
      Sapindus mukorossi with 17% EDTA, on the microleakage, sealer penetration and interaction&#xD;
      with sodium hypochlorite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ninety single-rooted teeth will be allocated into 2 experimental groups and a control group&#xD;
      of 30 teeth each. The endodontic procedure will be done with protaper files. The sample in&#xD;
      group 1 will be irrigated with 3.0% NaOCl after that by 17% EDTA and the sample in group 2&#xD;
      final irrigation will be given with Ethanolic extract of Sapindus mukorossi. After the&#xD;
      preparation and final irrigation of all teeth, sterile saline will be used to flush all&#xD;
      canals and dried using paper points. Obturation will be done with lateral condensation by&#xD;
      gutta-percha. Teeth will be incubated at 37ºc and 100% humidity for 7 days. Varnish will be&#xD;
      applied on the root surface except for apical 3mm. The teeth will be sectioned longitudinally&#xD;
      and examined at 2 and 5mm from the root apex. The maximum depth of sealer penetration will be&#xD;
      measured using a scanning electron microscope and microleakage will be tested through a dye&#xD;
      penetration method under a stereomicroscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing of interaction between irrigant and hypochlorite will be done by placing 1ml irrigant&#xD;
      with 1 ml sodium hypochlorite in a round bottom test tube and left for 1 week at 37ºc. An&#xD;
      independent observer will look for precipitation formation or color changes&#xD;

      Preparation of ethanolic extract of S.mukorossi:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The desiccated fruit of Sapindus mukorossi will be used for the formulation of an&#xD;
      experimental root canal irrigant. The dry pericarps of s. mukorossi (≈ 1.0 kg) which is&#xD;
      present around the seed nut, will be separated with a sharp blade. These pericarps will be&#xD;
      blended to produce fine particles in a sterilized home blender (Enviro 3 in 1 juicer blender&#xD;
      ENJ301). The resultant 10gram powder will be soaked in 100ml of absolute ethanol (99%) for&#xD;
      24hours at normal room temperature. This solvent will be filtered and removed with help of a&#xD;
      rotary evaporator, and extract will be kept in cleaned screw-capped vials (Premium Vials&#xD;
      B4702-12 Glass with Screw Cap) at -20º C until use. To form an operational concentration of 5&#xD;
      mg/ml, the extract will be re-dissolved in distilled water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All samples were prepared by a single operator using the following protocol. After extraction&#xD;
      tooth was stored in 0.1% thymol. Until further use. Specimens were randomly divided into 3&#xD;
      groups through computer-generated software. There will be 30 teeth in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chamber opening was done with # 4 diamond cutting round bur, a #10 K-type file&#xD;
      (Maillefer/Dentsply) was introduced into each root canal till it could be seen outside the&#xD;
      apical foramen. The working length will be decided by decreasing this length by 1mm. A single&#xD;
      operator using K-type files (Maillefer/Dentsply) initially than with the ProTaper Universal&#xD;
      System (Dentsply-Maillefer) up to F2 was performed. Irrigation was performed at each change&#xD;
      of file with 2.5mL of 3% NaOCl (canasol). After instrumentation the sample Group 1 would be&#xD;
      irrigated with 3ml of 17% EDTA and left in the canal for 1 minute. Group 2 will be irrigated&#xD;
      with Sapindus mukorossi finally all groups will be flushed with 5ml of 0.9% normal saline.&#xD;
      The control group's final irrigation was done with 0.9% saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afterward, the specimen was dried with F2 sterile absorbent paper points and an F2&#xD;
      gutta-percha cone was selected as the master cone. Sealapex (Sybron-Endo, Glendora, CA, USA)&#xD;
      sealer was mixed according to the manufacturer's instructions and placed in the canal via the&#xD;
      help of a 25# k file.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mastercone was inserted up to the working length and tug back was assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sealer application was performed in the manner described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The GP was inserted up to the working length after the apical 2mm of the master cone was&#xD;
           evenly coated with the sealer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The finger spreaders #25 and #20 (MANI, Japan) were placed into the canal to make room&#xD;
           for the accessory GP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The process was repeated until the #20 spreader was unable to enter the canal's coronal&#xD;
           one-third.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Excess GP was seared off using a hot condenser, and coronal GP was vertically compacted&#xD;
           to produce a good coronal seal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The access cavity was sealed with GIC restorative type(3M, ESPE) All samples were stored&#xD;
           in an incubator (binder GmbH, Germany) at 37oc under 100% humidity for 1 week, to allow&#xD;
           for the sealer to set completely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.10.1 Preparation of the sample for stereomicroscopic analysis of dye penetration: After the&#xD;
      samples were retrieved from the incubator they were allowed to air dry for 10 minutes. All&#xD;
      samples in the experimental group were coated with two layers of colored nail varnish, except&#xD;
      the apical 2mm of the root apex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After complete drying of nail varnish, the roots were then vertically placed in 1% methylene&#xD;
      blue dye (WellcoSol, TM) for 72hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3 days, the samples were washed for 5 minutes under running tap water and left to air&#xD;
      dry fully. To avoid dye introduction onto the inner root surface during sectioning, nail&#xD;
      polish and dye were scraped off the samples with a scalpel and surgical blade #15 (Bisturi&#xD;
      Ucu, Turkey). The tooth was cut in half longitudinally, parallel to its long axis. To ensure&#xD;
      that the sectioning was performed through the center of the root and to prevent damage to the&#xD;
      obturated canal space, 2mm deep longitudinal grooves were placed in the center of the buccal&#xD;
      and lingual root surface using a diamond disc in a slow-speed handpiece (Nakanishi Inc (NSK),&#xD;
      Japan), with caution not to invade the canal space. The teeth were then fractured&#xD;
      longitudinally with a double tapered chisel and a mallet, preserving the entire obturation&#xD;
      space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples were then viewed under Stereiomicroscope (Olympus VM-ILA-2) in the bioinformatics&#xD;
      and Molecular Medicine Laboratory (DRIBBS, DUHS) under 30x magnification. The images were&#xD;
      captured and uploaded to IMAGE J software (National Institute of Health, USA). The samples&#xD;
      were examined by two blinded observers (endodontists). The investigator determined apical&#xD;
      microleakage by measuring the linear depth of dye penetration, which is defined as the&#xD;
      maximum dye penetration distance from the root apex to the coronal extent. In the performa,&#xD;
      all measures were measured in millimeters (mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For dentinal tubule penetrance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another half of the tooth was left to desiccate for 24 hours in 40-100% ethyl alcohol. Then&#xD;
      specimen will be mounted on metallic stubs and gold-sputtered. Under an electron microscope,&#xD;
      a photomicrograph will be taken. Samples were studied for dentinal tubule penetration of&#xD;
      sealers at two levels - 2 and 5mm from the root apex by two independent observer's&#xD;
      reliability will be checked. Photomicrographs showing the maximum penetration at each level&#xD;
      were taken. The distance of the points was measured from the sealer-dentin interface and the&#xD;
      depth of penetration was calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For interaction with sodium hypochlorite:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the assessment of precipitate formation, solutions of 17% EDTA, S.mukorossi, and 3% NaOCl&#xD;
      will be used. Each polystyrene round-bottom tube (Falcon; Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham,&#xD;
      MA) will be filled with 2mL extract of S. mukorossi and17% EDTA respectively. Tube 3 will be&#xD;
      filled with a mixture of 1 mL of S.mukorossi and 1 mL 3% NaOCl. Tube 4 was filled with 17%&#xD;
      EDTA with NaoCl. Left on 95% humidity at 37ºC for 1 week. An unbiased observer was observing&#xD;
      every tube for precipitate formation after every 15minutes for first 2 hours and at 24-hour&#xD;
      intervals for 1 week. To avoid any error this procedure repeated 3 times&#xD;
