Plasma levodopa is summarized according to the blood sampling time point of the protocol; describe and compare the mean of the blood concentration of levodopa and carbidopa in each dose group, and calculate the fluctuation index ([Cmax-Cmin]/Cavg, Cavg= AUC0-t/t), where Cmax is Maximum Plasma Concentration, Cmin is Minimum Plasma Concentration, Cave is Average Plasma Concentration, AUC0-t is Area under the Plasma Concentration versus Time Curve Calculated from 0 to the Last Measurable Observation.</description>

    <measure>To evaluate reported adverse events (AEs) of WD-1603 in patients with Parkinson's disease.</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days-from baseline to the 28th day.</time_frame>
    <description>AEs refer to all adverse medical events in clinical research subjects, which can be manifested as symptoms and signs, diseases, or abnormal laboratory tests, but they may not have a causal relationship with the study drug. The following must be recorded as AE when at least one of the following criteria is met: 1. Accompanying symptoms and signs; 2. The results of the examination require treatment measures (such as surgical intervention); 3. The result of the inspection leads to changes in the dosing schedule of the study drug (such as dose change, dosing delay, discontinuation) of the study. The following can be referred to do AE severity classification. 1 (Mild): Asymptomatic or mild; only clinically seen; 2(Moderate): Requires minor, or non-invasive treatment; 3 (Severe): Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; 4 (Life-threatening): Urgent treatment is needed; 5 (Death): Death related to adverse events.</description>

    <time_frame>28 days-from baseline to the 28th day.</time_frame>
    <description>BDI-II scores are collected for safety assessment. BDI-II is a 21-item self-administered survey which is scored on a scale of 0-3 in a list of four statements arranged in increasing severity about a particular symptom of depression. Total score of 0-13 is considered minimal range, 14-19 is mild, 20-28 is moderate, and 29-63 is severe.</description>
