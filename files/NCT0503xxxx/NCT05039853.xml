  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised controlled trial designed to investigate the impact of a brief-cognitive&#xD;
      task based intervention on intrusive memories, mental health symptoms and daily functioning,&#xD;
      in women following an early pregnancy loss.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women who have experienced an early pregnancy loss (miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy) will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to either a brief cognitive intervention or a placebo activity.&#xD;
      Participants will be followed up at week 1, 1 month and 3 months following the intervention.&#xD;
      It is hypothesised that those allocated to receive the brief cognitive task-based&#xD;
      intervention will develop fever intrusive memories, less severe mental health symptoms and&#xD;
      better day to day functioning when compared to women allocated to the placebo activity.&#xD;
