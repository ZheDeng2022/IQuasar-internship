      To investigate the effect of VTA ablation at the time of LVAD implant to see if it can reduce&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized-controlled clinical trial&#xD;
      enrolling 100 patients who are LVAD candidates with a history of VTA who will be randomized&#xD;
      in a 1:1 ratio to intra-operative VTA ablation vs. conventional medical management.&#xD;
      Comprehensive data on arrhythmia history, medication history will be collected in all&#xD;
      randomized subjects. Antiarrhythmic medical therapy will be handled in a uniform pattern&#xD;
      between the two arms. Randomized subjects will then be followed per routine schedules for&#xD;
      post LVAD implant. Arrhythmia data, ICD therapy, additional procedures including repeat&#xD;
      surgery, ramp echocardiographic tests, right heart catheterization and catheter-based VTA&#xD;
      ablation will be collected. In addition, adverse events such as unplanned hospitalizations,&#xD;
      emergency department visits, clinic visits, and all other aspects of health care utilization&#xD;
      will be gathered. The planned average follow-up period will be 18 months.&#xD;

    <description>For surgical intra-operative ablation, efforts will be made to identify scarred myocardium based on methods such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear scans, and/or echocardiogram. Electrophysiological mapping may be obtained either pre-surgery or intra-operation. Mapping and ablation will be performed with the currently approved and updated mapping and ablation systems available at each center. Voltage mapping of the ventricle(s) to delineate scars will be carried out through electroanatomic mapping</description>
