  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our study utilizes a 3-arm placebo-controlled RCT to study the effectiveness of ketamine in&#xD;
      reducing chronic post-mastectomy pain. Participants randomized to the first arm will receive&#xD;
      a 0.35 mg/kg dose after induction, followed by a 0.3 mg/kg/hr infusion throughout surgery and&#xD;
      continued for 2 hours postoperatively. Participants in the second arm will receive a single&#xD;
      dose of 0.6 mg/kg of ketamine in the post-anesthesia care unit, and the final group will&#xD;
      serve as the control group and receive saline (no ketamine).&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>BPI pain severity subscale score</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory short form (BPI) pain severity subscale assesses pain at its worst, least, average, and current in the past 24 hours.&#xD;
The score ranges from 0 to 10 for each item. The average of the four items will be used.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>BPI pain severity and pain interference subscales score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 and 7 days and 1, 3*, 6, and 12 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>BPI assesses pain severity and interference. The interference subscale measures how much pain has interfered with general activities such as walking and working. Additionally, it inquires about interference in mood, enjoyment of life, relationships, and sleep.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of PMS: BPI average pain score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI pain severity subscale assesses pain at its worst, least, average, and current in the past 24 hours.&#xD;
We will use participant's average pain item to assess incidence of PMPS. A score greater than 3 (0-10 scale) will be considered clinically meaningful chronic pain.</description>

    <measure>Pain in the surgical site (chest wall, axilla, and/or arm): BCPQ Score</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Breast Cancer Pain Questionnaire (BCPQ) assesses pain location, frequency, and severity as well as sensory disturbance after breast surgery.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety and depressed mood: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 days and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety and depressive symptoms are prevalent in patients undergoing surgery for breast cancer and are risk factors for PMPS.</description>
