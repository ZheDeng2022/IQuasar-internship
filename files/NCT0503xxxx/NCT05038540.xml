  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical study, it was aimed to evaluate whether there is a decrease in patient&#xD;
      anxiety by applying virtual reality glasses, which are the product of new technology, during&#xD;
      scaling and root planing treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who required scaling and root planing treatment and also scored 9 or above according&#xD;
      to the Dental Anxiety Scale were included in our study. Scaling and root planing was&#xD;
      performed in a randomly selected intraoral quadrant of the patients, in the same way, with or&#xD;
      without the use of virtual reality glasses. In the virtual reality glasses application, a&#xD;
      video consisting of images of nature landscapes developed for patient rehabilitation was&#xD;
      projected onto the screen in front of the patient's eyes. The Dental Anxiety Scale was&#xD;
      reapplied after the completion of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intraoral quadrant where virtual reality glasses were used, it is expected that lower&#xD;
      Corah Dental Anxiety Scale scores may be obtained after the treatment is completed, compared&#xD;
      to the intraoral quadrant where the treatment is performed without glasses, thus reducing&#xD;
      anxiety.&#xD;
