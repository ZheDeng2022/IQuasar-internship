  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infants and children with heart conditions require treatment in children's hospitals that are&#xD;
      typically located in large cities. This creates challenges for children and families who need&#xD;
      to travel long distances to come to appointments. Providing quality care to children with&#xD;
      heart disease has further been challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a shift towards&#xD;
      decreased in-person contact and an increase in virtual visits, where assessment by doctors&#xD;
      and nurses is more limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study will look at how families of children with heart disease access care and&#xD;
      how investigators can improve care with virtual technologies. This will involve testing a new&#xD;
      home-based virtual care platform that uses Bluetooth technology to connect weight scales,&#xD;
      oxygen measuring devices and blood pressure cuffs with a smartphone app, allowing parents to&#xD;
      easily use these devices and send accurate data directly to the cardiology team.&#xD;
      Investigators will obtain feedback from families, patients, and healthcare providers about&#xD;
      how this helped or did not help them, and adjust the technology as needed to make it better.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective multi-methods observational study. Investigators will assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of the novel home-based remote physiological monitoring (RPM) system paired to a&#xD;
      smartphone app (Sphygmo™) and linked to a secure physician platform. The study team will&#xD;
      enroll caregivers of medically high- risk infants with CHD and children and caregivers with&#xD;
      heart failure or early post heart transplant. In addition, investigators will obtain feedback&#xD;
      from their healthcare providers. Qualitative analysis of semi- structured interviews will&#xD;
      determine patient and parent/caregiver and healthcare providers experience with the system&#xD;
      and allow for future modifications specific to pediatrics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purposive sampling will be used to achieve a maximum variation and will ensure a diverse&#xD;
      group of patients/caregivers that represent a variety of patient profiles. The study team aim&#xD;
      to recruit 10 participants in each group, with 50% of the patients living at least 100 km&#xD;
      drive from the Stollery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical records will be accessed to collect baseline characteristics including date of birth,&#xD;
      sex, postal code, diagnoses, surgeries and procedures. The number of pediatric cardiology&#xD;
      clinic visits, hospitalizations, ED visits, and cardiac investigations in the last 2 years&#xD;
      will be collected to describe the patients requirements for access to cardiac care. In&#xD;
      addition, the family will be asked to complete a demographic form that compiles information&#xD;
      about parents' ethnicity, education level, SES, access to Wi-FI and iOS/Android devices in&#xD;
      the home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An emerging, qualitative descriptive approach will be used to explore patient and parents'&#xD;
      experiences using the RPM devices and app in their home as part of their daily care routine.&#xD;
      Data collection and analysis will occur iteratively to allow emerging ideas. Semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews with parents/patients/healthcare providers will be conducted by a qualitatively&#xD;
      trained members of the study team. Data collection will occur until saturation (data&#xD;
      redundancy) is achieved. Interviews will be held and recorded on a secure, password protected&#xD;
      Zoom™ ECHO account and digitally captured and transcribed by Zoom auto-transcription&#xD;
      services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline and demographic characteristics will be analyzed using descriptive statistics.&#xD;
      Investigators will ascertain adherence with the protocol by determining the mean number of&#xD;
      requested assessments performed and the proportion of patients who completed &gt;80% of&#xD;
      measurements. This will contribute to our understanding of the acceptability of this&#xD;
      technology from the patient and family perspective.&#xD;
