  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if certain patterns of hormone levels during the&#xD;
      menstrual cycle are correlated with different pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Proov tests are fertility tracking tests. They are used for monitoring ovulation at home, and&#xD;
      are able to measure one or more hormones. These hormones can predict and confirm ovulation.&#xD;
      Tracking these hormones can help a woman understand if she is ovulating, and can help to&#xD;
      identify problems that could be preventing pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After giving permission to access your testing history collected in the Proov app from March&#xD;
      2020 to April 2022, you will complete an online survey about your fertility test results and&#xD;
      pregnancy status. You will also be asked information regarding your age, race, smoking&#xD;
      status, and BMI. Your test results logged in the Proov app will be shared automatically. You&#xD;
      will need 10-20 minutes to fill out the fertility survey.&#xD;
