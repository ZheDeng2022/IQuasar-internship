    <textblock>
      Use of low-voltage, direct current pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) in treating Post&#xD;
      Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), complex PTSD (cPTSD) and trauma-related injuries&#xD;
      manifesting in physical and/or mental symptoms.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PEMF devices used are the Scientific Consciousness Interface Operations (SCIO) device; it&#xD;
      is CE-marked, ISO certified and FDA classified as a Type II medical device. The device&#xD;
      measures frequencies emitted by the patient as a Biofeedback tool, and then emits frequencies&#xD;
      in square (50% duty cycle), sinus or sawtooth wave form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wave forms, frequencies (herz and kiloherz respectively), ampers and voltage are adjusted&#xD;
      automatically using the in-built Artificial Intelligence of the software employed to control&#xD;
      the SCIO machine. The maximum is 5 Direct Current volts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrodes to both read and emit signals are placed on the forehead, wrists and ankles.&#xD;
      Irregular frequencies are corrected by use of entrainment. Efficacy of entrainment is&#xD;
      displayed in the software as a percentage between 0-100. A rectification level or entrainment&#xD;
      result of 85-100% is considered successful treatment, that is, entrainment was as effective&#xD;
      as possible for that one session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PEMF therapy has already been shown to be effective in trauma, PTSD, anxiety and depression&#xD;
      treatment. The University of Denmark have recently conducted a similar clinical trial, which&#xD;
      investigated Transcranial Direct Current Electro-Magnetic Therapy for patients who were&#xD;
      treatment-resistant to depression medication. This study was also a one-arm test. This test&#xD;
      was conducted over the space of 8 weeks and involved 52 participants of mixed gender. All the&#xD;
      results indicated a reduction in depression-related symptoms in different ways, using the&#xD;
      Hamilton Depression Scale as a reference point. The baseline of the Hamilton Depression Scale&#xD;
      dropped from 20.6 to 12.6, whilst 49 participants experienced a reduction of over 50% on the&#xD;
      Hamilton Depression Scale. Their study concluded that Transcranial Electro-Magnetic Therapy&#xD;
      was a beneficial treatment for treatment-resistant depression, and further studies should be&#xD;
      conducted to highlight the potential benefits of similar treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study does not make use of a placebo, no double-blind, and no control group. The&#xD;
      aim of this pilot study is two-fold: Firstly to determine whether a lower total amount of&#xD;
      sessions would be effective (namely twice weekly rather than five days a week over the course&#xD;
      of three weeks); secondly, whether the setup and process of this pilot study can function at&#xD;
      scale (multiple locations and relatively little training time required by therapists due to&#xD;
      the artificial intelligence built into the software guiding the machine).&#xD;
