  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a prospective, non-randomized, single-arm cohort study. A total of 10 patients will be&#xD;
      included in this study. Based on standardized treatment, the treatment of bioartificial liver&#xD;
      device will be applied 24-48 hours after extensive hepatectomy. In order to evaluate the&#xD;
      security and effectiveness of the device, liver function, liver volume, the incidence of&#xD;
      liver failure and other results will be analyzed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Include large-scale hepatectomy patients who meet the Inclusion criteria into the&#xD;
      experimental group. Patient will be sent to ICU monitoring after surgery , the investigators&#xD;
      will evaluate the blood routine, liver and kidney function, blood coagulation function, and&#xD;
      immune inflammation indicators on the first day after surgery, and large veins will be&#xD;
      temporarily indwelled within 24-48 hours Hemodialysis tube, then take artificial liver&#xD;
      treatment which lasts 6-9h, follow-up test results on the 1st day, 3rd day, 7th day, 1 month&#xD;
      and 3 months about blood routine, liver and kidney function, coagulation function, blood&#xD;
      ammonia, Immune inflammation indicators, imaging examinations (CT or MR) at 7 days, 1 month&#xD;
      and 3 months after treatment, to evaluate the recovery of liver function and liver&#xD;
      regeneration after artificial liver treatment.&#xD;

    <description>HiHep cell bioartificial liver treatment was performed 24-48 hours after extensive hepatectomy. Temporary hemodialysis tube for large vein (jugular vein or femoral vein) is indwelled before treatment. Before treatment, prepare hiHeps-BAL in a biological safety cabinet that meets clinical standards, connect the corresponding tubing to the Jianfan DX-10 blood purification machine, and prefill with heparin saline. Half an hour before treatment, the patient was pre-heparinized (heparin about 600iu) and dexamethasone to prevent allergic reactions. The patient enters the ICU, the monitor is connected to the corresponding pipeline, the arterial pump 120-160ml/min, the slurry pump 30-40ml/min, the circulating pump 75-100ml/min, the duration is 6-9h.</description>
