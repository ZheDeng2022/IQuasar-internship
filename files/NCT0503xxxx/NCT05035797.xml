  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mortality of patients suffering critical illness has been dramatically improved with advanced&#xD;
      technological development of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy. However,&#xD;
      weaning rate stayed low in a majority of ECMO-supported patients. As one of several options,&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary rehabilitation serves as effective intervention in the improvement of&#xD;
      cardiovascular and respiratory function in various major critical illness. Nonetheless, its&#xD;
      roles in facilitating ECMO weaning has not yet been explored. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the effectiveness of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation on rate of ready for weaning&#xD;
      in ECMO-supported patients (CaRe-ECMO).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have documented that rate of mechanical ventilation weaning was improved in patients&#xD;
      received early rehabilitation intervention while its effectiveness in ECMO weaning remains&#xD;
      unclear. This inspires us to hypothesize that if the medical rationale is based on its&#xD;
      assumed benefits on cardiac function and oxygenation, then cardiopulmonary rehabilitation may&#xD;
      subsequently contribute to earlier weaning of ECMO. The &quot;CaRe-ECMO&quot; trial is a prospective,&#xD;
      multidisciplinary, randomized controlled, parallel group, clinical trial. Cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation program which encompasses six evidence-based components:1) positioning; 2)&#xD;
      passive range of motion (PROM) training; 3) neuromuscular electronic stimulation (NMES); 4)&#xD;
      surface electrical phrenic nerve stimulation (SEPNS); 5) respiratory PNF techniques 6) airway&#xD;
      clearance techniques; 366 ECMO-supported patients in department of emergency medicine will be&#xD;
      randomized to control and CaRe-ECMO group. CaRe-ECMO group will be treated with usual care,&#xD;
      ECMO therapy, and cardiopulmonary rehabilitation program. Usual care normally comprises&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy, mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT),&#xD;
      intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), and specific nursing for ECMO therapy and their original&#xD;
      injuries, as appropriate. Control group will be treated with usual care, ECMO therapy. The&#xD;
      primary objective of the CaRe-ECMO trial is to investigate the impact of cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation combined with usual care on rate of ready for ECMO weaning at CaRe-ECMO Day 7,&#xD;
      when compared to usual care alone. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary rehabilitation on rate of ECMO weaning, total length of ready for ECMO&#xD;
      weaning, total length of ECMO weaning, rate of mechanical ventilation weaning, total length&#xD;
      of mechanical ventilation, all-cause mortality, rate of major post-ECMO complications,&#xD;
      diaphragmatic thickness and mobility, ECMO Unit length of stay (LOS), total hospital LOS,&#xD;
      total cost for hospitalization, cerebral performance category (CPC) index, activity of daily&#xD;
      living (ADL), and health related quality of life (HRQoL). The CaRe-ECMO trial is designed to&#xD;
      test the hypothesis that early cardiopulmonary rehabilitation can accelerate weaning of&#xD;
      ECMO-supported patients. If CaRe-ECMO trial results in superior improvement in primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes, it will offer an innovative treatment option for ECMO-supported patients.&#xD;
