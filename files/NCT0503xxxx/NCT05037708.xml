  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lymphedema related to breast cancer is one of the main complications after breast cancer&#xD;
      treatment. Manual lymphatic drainage appears as a technique which could be applied in the&#xD;
      treatment of lymphedema along with other techniques. The aim of this study is to analyze the&#xD;
      effects of a physiotherapy program based on manual lymphatic drainage on the treatment of&#xD;
      lymphedema after breast cancer, during the stabilization or maintenance phase of complex&#xD;
      decongestant therapy. Therefore, a randomized, blinded, crossover clinical trial is suggested&#xD;
      to assess the effect of an intensive physiotherapy intervention on the treatment of&#xD;
      lymphedema in its maintenance phase, in comparison with a control group without physiotherapy&#xD;
      treatment. The cytometry, displaced water volume, thickness of the lymphedema with&#xD;
      ultrasound, dynamometry and sensation of heaviness, pain and tension of the upper limb will&#xD;
      be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Complex decongestant therapy is a set of techniques which seek the treatment of lymphedema in&#xD;
      a conservative way as described in the recent international consensus of the International&#xD;
      Lymphology Society, published in 2020. Complex decongestant therapy in a first phase aims to&#xD;
      reduce cutaneous edema and in a second phase it aims to preserve and optimize the results&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase consists of skin care, manual lymphatic drainage, muscle pumping exercises,&#xD;
      and compression techniques, typically applied with multilayer bandages. The second phase&#xD;
      consists of compression with low elasticity, skin care exercises, and repeated manual&#xD;
      lymphatic drainage as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frequency and intensity of components of complex decongestant therapy in phase I and II&#xD;
      should depend on the clinical findings of edema and the stage of lymphedema and could be&#xD;
      adapted to clinical changes. Note that phase II or stabilization represents long-term therapy&#xD;
      over many years and in the case of deterioration of edema, phase I of complex decongestant&#xD;
      therapy may need to be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, there is debate about the efficacy of manual lymphatic drainage. Sometimes&#xD;
      it is not prescribed, being replaced by the recommendation of a self-massage. Furthermore,&#xD;
      complex decongestant therapy was suggested to be time consuming, expensive and difficult to&#xD;
      tolerate, and does not improve lymphatic function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, researchers such as Müller et al., in 2018, state that it is a well-tolerated&#xD;
      and safe treatment technique, demonstrating benefits in reducing edema. Other research has&#xD;
      also shown that manual lymphatic drainage is effective both on a preventive level and as a&#xD;
      postoperative rehabilitation treatment, having optimal results when combined with the other&#xD;
      elements of complex decongestant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent systematic review published in 2020 highlights the need of more experimental studies&#xD;
      on the effectiveness of manual lymphatic drainage on lymphedema. Thus, the&#xD;
&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to analyze the effects of a physiotherapy program based on manual&#xD;
      lymphatic drainage in the treatment of lymphedema after breast cancer, during the&#xD;
      stabilization or maintenance phase of complex decongestant therapy. Therefore, a double-blind&#xD;
      crossover clinical trial is proposed.&#xD;
