  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      VKC is more common in males and tends to resolve with pubertal development. Clinical&#xD;
      observation was not followed by an investigation that clarified whether there is a&#xD;
      correlation between the hormonal pattern and the evolution of the disease, in particular it&#xD;
      is not defined whether there is a correlation between the hormonal pattern and the resolution&#xD;
      of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the hormonal pattern in patients with VKC and, in particular, the&#xD;
      possible role of these hormones in the resolution of this condition in puberty.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study presents a retrospective and prospective transversal observational design,&#xD;
      non-pharmacological, monocentric, non-profit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is based on the collection of clinical, laboratory and therapy data on databases of&#xD;
      patients affected by Vernal keratoconjunctivitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the study will be proposed to parents of patients with VKC over 10 years of&#xD;
      age at puberty (B2 according to Tanner for females and G2 according to Tanner for males),&#xD;
      based on endocrinological evaluation. Patients, differentiated by gender, will be divided&#xD;
      into two groups: patients with active VKC and patients with resolved VKC. Both study groups&#xD;
      will be offered a blood sample to determine the serum levels of LH, FSH, estradiol, DHEAS,&#xD;
      androstenedione, total testosterone, SHBG, DHT, 17OH-progesterone, TSH-R, albumin, ACTH and&#xD;
      cortisol. In postpuberal females, the sample must be taken in the first 5 days of the&#xD;
      menstrual cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study provides for the enrollment of patients diagnosed with VKC followed at the Allergy&#xD;
      Outpatient Clinic of the UOSD Pediatrics High Intensity of Care - IRCCS Ca 'Granda Foundation&#xD;
      Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico di Milano. The source documentation of the data will be the&#xD;
      medical record and the reports of the examinations, provided for by the study, performed at&#xD;
      the Institute. On the same day, a blood sample and a pubertal stage assessment will be&#xD;
      performed. An allergy / ophthalmological examination for VKC will be carried out only if it&#xD;
      had not been performed in the 12 months prior to the execution of the blood sample. There is&#xD;
      no follow-up.&#xD;

        The study involves the enrollment of 2 groups of subjects: pubertal patients with active&#xD;
        VKC and pubertal / postpuberal patients who have suffered from VKC in the past years, but&#xD;
        no longer in 2021. To all the subjects under examination, both males both females, a blood&#xD;
        sample is performed for the determination of hormonal levels, an allergological /&#xD;
        ophthalmological evaluation to determine the phase of activity of the VKC and an&#xD;
        endocrinological evaluation to determine the degree of pubertal development.&#xD;
