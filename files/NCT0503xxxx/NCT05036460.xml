  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early detection of esophageal intubation, one of the most common complications while&#xD;
      performing endotracheal intubation (ETI), is crucial to adequate airway management,&#xD;
      especially among patients suspected of difficult intubation (DI). Detective approaches with&#xD;
      ventilation require time, increase the risk of emesis and aspiration to patients, and&#xD;
      increase the risk of particle aerosolization to health providers under the epidemic of&#xD;
      aerosol-borne diseases. Our study will determine the effectiveness of real-time sonography&#xD;
      assisted to direct visualization to detect esophageal intubation before ventilation among DI&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single-blind, superiority, randomized controlled study. 224 eligible participants requiring&#xD;
      elective orotracheal intubation under general anesthesia with suspected DI will be randomized&#xD;
      1:1 to sonography and direct visualization versus direct visualization alone. The primary&#xD;
      objective will be to investigate, in suspected DI patients, if the real-time&#xD;
      sonography-assisted with direct visualization results in improved specificity in the&#xD;
      detection of inadvertent esophageal intubation before ventilation compared with direct&#xD;
      visualization while performing intubation. The secondary objectives will be to compare the&#xD;
      sensitivity, positive likelihood ratio (LR+), negative likelihood ratio (LR-), diagnostic&#xD;
      odds ratio (DOR), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and&#xD;
      detective self-confidence grade using sonography-assisted direct visualization vs direct&#xD;
      visualization. Test characteristics will be calculated using standard formulas for a binomial&#xD;
      proportion, and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs), by the Wilson interval&#xD;
      method.&#xD;

    <description>The detected negative/ true negative. According to the purpose of the proposed study, we will define esophageal intubation as positive, and endotracheal intubation as negative. In group direct visualization, positive and negative are defined as absent and present visualization of the tracheal tube passing through the glottis, respectively. In group ultrasonography assisted direct visualization, positive is defined as sonography detection of esophageal dilation or &quot;double-tract&quot; sign, and negative is defined as direct visualization of the tracheal tube passing through the glottis. If neither the specific US nor the clear visualization is noted, the intubator and the sonographer will discuss and reach a consistent conclusion in three seconds.</description>
