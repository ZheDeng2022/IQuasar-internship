      The trial is a feasibility study of a patient-reported outcome (PRO) monitoring for patients&#xD;
      with multiple myeloma. Patients will report weekly PROs during treatment at our outpatient&#xD;
      unit. The trial will describe the development of treatment-specific item lists to adequately&#xD;
      capture relevant symptoms during therapy, evaluate the feasibility of the weekly symptom&#xD;
      monitoring, and evaluate the healthcare professional usage of the system in clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;

      The trial is a feasibility study of a patient-reported outcome (PRO) monitoring for patients&#xD;
      with multiple myeloma. Patients will report weekly PROs during treatment at our outpatient&#xD;
      unit. The trial will describe the development of treatment-specific item lists to adequately&#xD;
      capture relevant symptoms during therapy, evaluate the feasibility of the weekly symptom&#xD;
      monitoring, and evaluate the healthcare professional usage of the system in clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The item lists will supplement an already established patient-reported outcome measure (PROM)&#xD;
      implementation for the Austrian Myeloma Registry (AMR) at the Department of Hematology in&#xD;
      Innsbruck. For the development of the treatment-specific item lists, a review of the&#xD;
      literature for symptoms reported in clinical trials of the respective treatment regimens will&#xD;
      be conducted. Then, a consensus panel of multiple stakeholders will discuss the symptoms and&#xD;
      relevant issues for each treatment group. In an iterative process, the item lists will be&#xD;
      developed to capture the most relevant and clinically important symptoms during active&#xD;
      therapy to maximize clinical usage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The observational part of the trial will then test the feasibility of the electronic symptom&#xD;
      monitoring and the treatment-specific item lists. Patients will be recruited who are already&#xD;
      participating in a routine care patient-reported outcome monitoring. They will be given&#xD;
      access to the web-based patient portal and asked to complete weekly assessments using the&#xD;
      treatment-specific item lists. In larger intervals (every 6 weeks), they will also be asked&#xD;
      to complete a larger questionnaire battery using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the treatment-specific&#xD;
      module (EORTC QLQ-MY20). In the patient portal, patients will also be able to review their&#xD;
      own results and receive feedback and self-management advice. Patients will also receive&#xD;
      reminders to remind them to use the patient portal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For healthcare professionals, the system will display the results of the PROMs and trigger&#xD;
      alerts if patients reach thresholds for clinical importance. A clinical nurse will monitor&#xD;
      the recently completed PROMs and contact patients who exceed the thresholds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will stay on the symptom monitoring as long as they receive active treatment. They&#xD;
      may be excluded if they move to stationary care, depending on their health status or if they&#xD;
      want to end the monitoring. The feasibility of the weekly monitoring and items lists will be&#xD;
      evaluated and patient feedback to the patient portal and item lists will be recorded and&#xD;
      analysed.&#xD;
