      This study was conducted to determine the effect of Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP)&#xD;
      application on post-cesarean section pain levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was carried out between March 1 and June 1, 2021 with mothers who gave birth&#xD;
      through cesarean section in the postpartum service of a maternity and children's hospital in&#xD;
      the most populated city of Turkey, which is located in the west. The study data consists of a&#xD;
      total of 76 individuals, including 38 in the experimental group and 38 in the control group.&#xD;
      In the study, the effect size was calculated as 2.22. Accordingly, the power of the study,&#xD;
      which was completed with 38 individuals in the control group and 38 in experimental group,&#xD;
      had an effect size of 2.22, and used a significance level of 0.05, was calculated as 99.9%.&#xD;
      The power analysis was conducted on the G*Power software package.&#xD;

    <description>A mean total score on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). In this assessment, users score their pain from 0 to 10. The scores are interpreted as follows: &quot;0&quot;, no pain at all; 1-4, mild pain; 5-6, moderate pain; and 7-10, severe pain.&#xD;
A mean total score on the VAS of four and above indicates postoperative pain.</description>
