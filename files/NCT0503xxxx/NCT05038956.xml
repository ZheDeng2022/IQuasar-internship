      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the serum bupivacaine concentrations over time after&#xD;
      0.125% bupivacaine is deposited every 6 hours in the erector spinae plane in patients who&#xD;
      undergo unilateral VATS.&#xD;

      Pain control is an important aspect of recovery for patients who undergo thoracic surgery.&#xD;
      Over the past several decades, thoracic surgery has shifted from open thoracotomies to&#xD;
      video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) with the result of less morbidity, fewer postoperative&#xD;
      complications and less postoperative pain compared to open thoracic procedures. However,&#xD;
      postoperative acute and chronic thoracic pain remain a main clinical issue with VATS and&#xD;
      contributes to patient suffering as well as the ability to meet early rehabilitation goals.&#xD;
      Chest wall pain has traditionally been managed with epidural analgesia and/or by narcotic&#xD;
      medication administration (such as morphine, hydromorphone and oxycodone). These modalities,&#xD;
      however, carry a high risk of serious effects such as epidural hematomas, dural puncture,&#xD;
      pneumothorax, hypotension, infection as well as cough suppression, constipation, drowsiness&#xD;
      and mental status changes. Additionally, patients who are on anticoagulants or antiplatelet&#xD;
      therapy may not be eligible for epidural analgesia. Furthermore, the short- and long-term&#xD;
      analgesic benefits of epidural analgesia has been shown to be inconsistent in the setting of&#xD;
      VATS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A relatively new technique used for post-operative pain control in thoracic surgery is the&#xD;
      use of fascial plane blocks, specifically the erector spinae plane block (ESPB). The ESPB was&#xD;
      first described in 2016 by Forero et al. in 4 case reports: 2 patients with chronic thoracic&#xD;
      neuropathic pain and 2 patients with acute postoperative chest wall pain 8. Since that time&#xD;
      the ESPB has been widely adopted as a regional technique used in thoracic, breast, abdominal&#xD;
      and lumbar surgery. This block is achieved by depositing long-acting local anesthetic&#xD;
      medication in the fascial plane deep to the erector spinae muscles and superficial to the&#xD;
      transverse process, to achieve a distribution along several vertebral rami of the spinal&#xD;
      nerves and intercostal spaces. Radiographic evidence suggests that local anesthetic injected&#xD;
      at the ESP spreads both cranially and caudally as the plane is continuous along the vertebral&#xD;
      column. These rami carry visceral motor, somatic motor and sensory information to and from&#xD;
      the skin and deep muscles of the back.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In thoracic surgery, the ESPB has shown to decrease opioid consumption and pain scores in&#xD;
      patients who undergo VATS within the first 24 hours when compared to no block and also when&#xD;
      compared to other fascial plane blocks such as the serratus plane block. In the literature&#xD;
      thus far, complications are rare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the literature has quickly grown regarding erector spinae blocks over the last four&#xD;
      years, specific information regarding dosing regimens for both single injection and&#xD;
      intermittent bolus dosing through an erector spinae catheter remains limited. Most of the&#xD;
      current information from the erector spinae block lies in case reports. In reviews of the&#xD;
      current practices, it appears that ropivacaine and bupivacaine are the most commonly used&#xD;
      local anesthetics with injection volumes ranging from 20 mL to 40 mL and concentrations&#xD;
      ranging from 0.25%-0.5%. Most case reports describe single injection, while approximately 20%&#xD;
      describe dosing either intermittently or continuously through a catheter. It is thought that&#xD;
      because this block is a fascial plane block its' success depends, in part, on the volume and&#xD;
      concentration of local anesthetic injected in the erector spinae plane to achieve maximal&#xD;
      craniocaudal dermatomal distribution. It is in these scenarios that clinicians must balance&#xD;
      achieving maximal analgesic benefit from this block with safety concerns for local anesthetic&#xD;
      systemic toxicity (LAST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no documented cases described of a patient experiencing LAST from an erector spinae&#xD;
      block or erector spinae nerve catheter, however there is some information regarding the&#xD;
      safety of similar fascial plane blocks. Convulsions following bilateral ultrasound guided&#xD;
      transversus abdominis plane blocks following cesarean analgesia have been described. Trabelsi&#xD;
      et al. describe the pharmacokinetics of bupivacaine after bilateral transversus abdominis&#xD;
      plane blocks and found that mean peak serum bupivacaine concentrations was 30 minutes from&#xD;
      the time of injection. However, during this study, three subjects had serum bupivacaine&#xD;
      concentrations above the quoted toxic threshold. Furthermore, data analyzing serum&#xD;
      concentration of local anesthetic overtime through the use of catheters is also lacking. In a&#xD;
      study of pediatric patients with continuous paravertebral infusions it was found that serum&#xD;
      concentration of bupivacaine was &gt;3 mcg/mL in several infants at 30-48 hours. These studies&#xD;
      emphasize the need for better understanding local anesthetic uptake from fascial planes&#xD;
      blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In prior studies that have attempted to illustrate the pharmacokinetics of local anesthetic&#xD;
      uptake to serum concentrations, data has been scattered to such a degree that the&#xD;
      investigators cannot accurately extrapolate trends. A previous study at our institution&#xD;
      measured serum ropivacaine levels following local infiltration in the knee joint and found&#xD;
      max serum concentrations ranging from 4 to 24 hours. In an observational study examining the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of liposomal bupivacaine placed in the intercostal space, maximal serum&#xD;
      levels ranged from 15 minutes to 48 hours. In a study analyzing the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      bupivacaine following bilateral transversus abdominis plane blocks, all individual peak&#xD;
      plasma levels were recorded between 10 and 90 minutes. With this proposed observational&#xD;
      study, the investigators expect to see scattered data which is why the need for such tight&#xD;
      time intervals of measurements and the amount of measurements. Besides looking at the maximum&#xD;
      serum concentration of bupivacaine following the boluses, an additional important aspect of&#xD;
      this observational study is to see if there is a stacking effect of plasma bupivacaine levels&#xD;
      following repeated dosing through the catheter. Taketa et al, examined serum levels following&#xD;
      continuous infusions of local anesthetic in the paravertebral and erector spinae planes and&#xD;
      found building serum levels with the continuous infusion. There have been no studies to&#xD;
      analyze if there is a stacking effect of local anesthetic in serum levels following multiple&#xD;
      intermittent bolus doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, no publication exists that report serum bupivacaine concentration over time&#xD;
      following initial bolus in the erector spinae plane or following intermittent boluses of&#xD;
      erector spinae plane catheters. This information is important to ensure that safe serum&#xD;
      bupivacaine concentrations are maintained when considering optimal bolus dosing and intervals&#xD;
      for erector spinae plane catheters. The current practice at the University of Utah is to&#xD;
      bolus 25 mg of bupivacaine hydrochloride (HCL) (20 mL of 0.125% bupivacaine) through erector&#xD;
      spinae catheters every six hours. Occasionally this regimen is ineffective and the&#xD;
      investigators consider increasing the concentration, volume or decreasing the interval of&#xD;
      bupivacaine administration in order to obtain better postoperative analgesia. However,&#xD;
      increasing bupivacaine dosing also increases the risk of local anesthetic toxicity. Striking&#xD;
      the appropriate balance between safety and maximally effective postoperative analgesia has&#xD;
      been clinically challenging for our regional anesthesiologists and for subject experts across&#xD;
      the world. There are no consensus data on the effective-safe dosing of these catheters.&#xD;
      Having this knowledge will help ensure a safe practice of local anesthetic usage for&#xD;
      unilateral thoracic surgeries.&#xD;
