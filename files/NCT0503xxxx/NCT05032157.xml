  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of&#xD;
      remibrutinib (LOU064) in adult participants suffering from chronic spontaneous urticaria&#xD;
      (CSU) inadequately controlled by H1-antihistamines in comparison to placebo.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      Phase 3 study investigating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of remibrutinib in adult&#xD;
      participants with CSU inadequately controlled by second generation H1-antihistamines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inadequate control of CSU by H1-antihistamines is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The presence of itch and hives for ≥ 6 consecutive weeks prior to screening despite the&#xD;
           use of second generation H1-antihistamines during this time period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  UAS7 score (range 0-42) ≥ 16, ISS7 score (range 0-21) ≥ 6 and HSS7 score (range 0-21) ≥&#xD;
           6 during the 7 days prior to randomization (Day 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of four periods, the total study duration is up to 60 weeks: screening&#xD;
      period of up to 4 weeks, double-blind placebo controlled treatment period of 24 weeks,&#xD;
      open-label treatment with remibrutinib period of 28 weeks, treatment free follow-up period of&#xD;
      4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to the treatment arms in a 2:1 ratio. The&#xD;
      study population will consist of approximately 450 female and male adult participants (300 in&#xD;
      the active arm and 150 in the placebo arm) with CSU inadequately controlled by second&#xD;
      generation H1-antihistamines at least at locally label approved dose.&#xD;

    <description>To demonstrate that remibrutinib is superior to placebo in CSU with respect to change from baseline in UAS7 at Week 12 by assessing absolute change from baseline in UAS7 at Week 12.&#xD;
To demonstrate that remibrutinib is superior to placebo in CSU with respect to change from baseline in UAS7 at Week 12 by assessing absolute change from baseline in weekly Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7) at week 12.&#xD;
The UAS7 is a simple scoring system to evaluate urticaria signs and symptoms. It is based on scoring wheals (hive severity score) and itch (itch severity score) separately on a scale of 0 (no signs/symptoms) to 3 (intense signs/symptoms) over 7 days. The final score is calculated by adding together the daily scores, which can range from 0 to 6, for 7 days. This results in a maximum total score of 42, and a minimum possible score of 0</description>

    <description>To demonstrate that remibrutinib is superior to placebo in CSU with respect to change from baseline in ISS7 and HSS7 at Week 12 by assessing absolute change from baseline in ISS7 an HSS7 at Week 12.&#xD;
To demonstrate that remibrutinib is superior to placebo in CSU with respect to change from baseline in ISS7 and HSS7 at Week 12 by assessing absolute change from baseline in weekly Itch Severity Score (ISS7) and weekly Hive Severity Score (HSS7) at week 12. The ISS7 and HSS7 combined together make up the UAS7 scoring system to evaluate urticaria signs and symptoms. The HSS7 score is the wheal/hives severity score for 7 days and the ISS7 is the itch severity score for 7 days, both these scores range from 0 to 21.</description>
