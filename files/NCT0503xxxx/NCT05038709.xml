  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compared to the knee and shoulder, the hip joint leaves relatively little space to maneuver&#xD;
      arthroscopic instruments and camera. To expand the potential space in the hip joint, traction&#xD;
      is commonly applied to the operative leg through a perineal post. This is an effective&#xD;
      technique to improve the working space for arthroscopy, however it has been associated with&#xD;
      complications, including perineal numbness. Traction pads, used alone or with a perineal&#xD;
      post, can reduce pressure on the perineal area, thus reducing numbness. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that positioning hip arthroscopy patients using a traction pad on a standard&#xD;
      traction table with a perineal post will reduce the incidence and duration of postoperative&#xD;
      perineal numbness.&#xD;
