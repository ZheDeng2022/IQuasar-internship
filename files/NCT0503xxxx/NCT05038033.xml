  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Project ASSET will explore the preliminary efficacy of interpersonal therapy, when compared&#xD;
      with cognitive behavioral therapy, for reducing anxiety symptoms, preventing excess weight&#xD;
      gain, and reducing cardio-metabolic risk in adolescent girls with above-average weight and&#xD;
      elevated anxiety. As a pilot for a larger multi-site study, this trial will also test&#xD;
      multi-site feasibility, acceptability, and intervention fidelity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial in which 40 adolescent girls aged 12-17 years-old&#xD;
      with weight in the 75th percentile or higher for their age and sex, and elevated anxiety&#xD;
      symptoms, will be randomly assigned to an IPT or CBT 12-week group intervention.&#xD;
      Approximately 20 adolescent girls will be enrolled at each of two sites: Uniformed Services&#xD;
      University (USU) and Colorado State University (CSU). After a screening and baseline&#xD;
      assessment, participants will attend an individual meeting with the leaders of their assigned&#xD;
      group to learn more about the group process and establish goals. They will then participate&#xD;
      in the group program for 12 consecutive weeks. Each group will be led by a PhD-level clinical&#xD;
      psychologist and a healthcare trainee. In-person and remote assessments, will be conducted at&#xD;
      baseline, in the ~two weeks post-intervention (i.e., 12-week follow-up), and at 1, 2, and 3&#xD;
      years post-intervention. These assessments will consist of body measurements, blood draws for&#xD;
      collection markers of metabolic functioning, and surveys and interviews of psychological and&#xD;
      social functioning. At baseline, two weeks, and one year post-intervention, participants will&#xD;
      also have a week-long period during which they will wear devices collecting activity and&#xD;
      physiological data, and complete phone surveys assessing disinhibited eating behaviors, food&#xD;
      craving, affect, cognitions, and avoidance behaviors.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT)</intervention_name>
    <description>The IPT group sessions follow three phases (initial, middle, and termination) and use the interpersonal inventory to identify interpersonal problems that might be contributing to or exacerbating disinhibited eating and anxiety symptoms. A framework of common problem areas is used to teach interpersonal problem-solving and communication skills and educate youth about risk factors and warning signs for excessive weight gain, such as eating in response to negative affect as opposed to hunger, or feeling a sense of loss-of-control while eating. IPT focuses on psychoeducation and general skill-building that can be applied to different relationships within the framework of four interpersonal problem areas: interpersonal role disputes, role transitions, interpersonal deficits, and grief.</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Cognitive Behavioral Theory (CBT)</intervention_name>
    <description>The CBT program will be derived from Coping Cat, a manualized intervention for children and adolescents with elevated symptoms of anxiety. The group intervention builds skills for managing anxiety, in general, but with a focus on how anxiety prompts disinhibited eating, including attention to and restructuring of negative cognitions that perpetuate anxiety and behavioral exposure, rather than avoidance, of anxiety-provoking situations.</description>
