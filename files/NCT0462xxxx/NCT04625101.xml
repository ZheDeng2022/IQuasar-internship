        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Signed informed consent by the parent(s) or legal representative(s) and, if&#xD;
             applicable, assent from developmentally capable pediatric subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosis of EECSWS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have diagnosis of EECSWS confirmed by the Diagnosis Confirmation Panel (DCP).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Stable dosage and stable time of intake of at least 1 and up to 3 antiseizure&#xD;
             medications (ASMs) excluding systemic corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin&#xD;
             (IVIG), from 4 weeks prior to screening and anticipated to be stable from screening&#xD;
             until end of study (EOS). Vagal nerve stimulator (VNS) and ketogenic diet are not&#xD;
             counted as ASMs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Treatment other than ASMs (excluding systemic corticosteroids and IVIG) must be at a&#xD;
             stable dosage from 2 weeks prior to screening and anticipated to be stable from&#xD;
             screening until EOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Doose syndrome (epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures), or&#xD;
             Dravet syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Presence of a relevant psychiatric disease interfering with cognitive or behavioral&#xD;
             functioning (eg, depression, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder) unless&#xD;
             associated with the EECSWS diagnosis as assessed by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Presence of relevant neurological disorders other than EECSWS and its underlying&#xD;
             conditions as judged by the investigator. Symptomatic conditions underlying EECSWS&#xD;
             (eg, neonatal strokes) have to be stable for at least 1 year prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Body weight &lt;10 kg at randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Clinically relevant findings in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood&#xD;
             pressure (DBP), or pulse rate at screening or Day 1 as determined by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have an average triplicate ECG corrected QT interval using Fridericia's formula (QTcF)&#xD;
             &gt;450 msec or presence of any significant cardiac abnormality at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Clinically relevant findings in clinical laboratory tests (hematology, clinical&#xD;
             chemistry including thyroid function parameters, and urinalysis) at screening as&#xD;
             determined by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Have aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or&#xD;
             gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels &gt;2 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) at&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Have mild to severe renal impairment as determined by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Have taken cannabinoids, excluding Epidiolex®/Epidyolex®, within 30 days of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Pulse therapy such as systemic corticosteroids and IVIG are prohibited for at least 8&#xD;
             weeks prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Planned surgical intervention related to structural abnormalities of the brain from&#xD;
             screening through the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Have received any other investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives (if&#xD;
             known), whichever is longer, of Day 1 or plan to use an investigational drug (other&#xD;
             than the study treatment) during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Any circumstances or conditions, which, in the opinion of the investigator, may affect&#xD;
             full participation in the study or compliance with the protocol.&#xD;
