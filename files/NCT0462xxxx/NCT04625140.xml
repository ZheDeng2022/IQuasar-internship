  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the ability of renal MRI to detect fibrosis, how this correlates&#xD;
      to renal function and how well renal MRI biomarkers can predict decline in kidney function&#xD;
      over time. We will also assess the correlation of renal MRI and kidney function to markers of&#xD;
      renal ageing in blood, urine and tissue samples.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an increasing health concern worldwide, with an estimated&#xD;
      prevalence of 11% in the Norwegian population. Progression of CKD and development of&#xD;
      end-stage kidney disease is closely related to the extent and progression of renal fibrosis.&#xD;
      Traditionally the assessment of renal fibrosis is made by renal biopsy, which in addition to&#xD;
      diagnostics also evaluates the degree of renal fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the evaluation of fibrosis from a renal biopsy is limited by the risk of&#xD;
      complications. Due to its invasive nature, clinicians often reserve a biopsy for situations&#xD;
      where the anticipated yield will have therapeutic value. This means the fibrotic burden is&#xD;
      often not assessed, and information on scar burden and kidney-prognosis is lost. Furthermore,&#xD;
      we know that fibrosis may be unequally distributed throughout the kidney. Since a biopsy only&#xD;
      samples a small portion of kidney tissue, it is inherently susceptible to sampling bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques can assess whole organ fibrotic&#xD;
      burden. Since it is a non-invasive procedure, MRI can evaluate renal fibrosis in patients not&#xD;
      eligible for renal biopsy. Moreover, it can be performed at several time-points for temporal&#xD;
      renal fibrosis assessments. Recent developments in MRI techniques have made it possible to&#xD;
      assess renal fibrosis with MRI. These techniques rely on the different biological properties&#xD;
      of fibrotic and non-fibrotic tissues, including reduced microcirculation, restriction of&#xD;
      water motion and reduced oxygenation. From several MRI biomarkers currently available, five&#xD;
      show particular promise in quantifying degree of renal fibrosis: Diffusion weighted MRI,&#xD;
      T1-mapping and T2-mapping, T1-rho and arterial-spin labelling. A recently developed MRI-patch&#xD;
      which combines these five techniques, makes it possible to perform a MRI-scan with&#xD;
      simultaneous measurements whilst not prolonging examination time for the patient. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that combining these MRI-techniques will give additional information, and thus&#xD;
      provide a better correlation to histological-assessed fibrosis than any technique alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Markers of renal ageing may also predict development of renal fibrosis as accelerated renal&#xD;
      ageing trough p16INK4a pathway activation, leading to cellular senescence, is involved in the&#xD;
      development of renal fibrosis in CKD. Senescent cells are characterized by irreversible&#xD;
      growth arrest and express a pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic senescent-associated secretory&#xD;
      phenotype (SASP). This biochemical foot print can be detected by immunohistochemistry. We aim&#xD;
      to assess the correlation between degree of renal fibrosis and markers of renal ageing, as&#xD;
      well as to what extent decline in kidney function can be predicted by change in markers of&#xD;
      renal ageing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be one of the first to evaluate correlation between multiparametric MRI and&#xD;
      morphometric estimates of renal fibrosis. We will study whether activation of pathways&#xD;
      involved in renal ageing are associated with progressive renal fibrosis and deterioration of&#xD;
      renal function. Finally, we will evaluate the utility of temporal measurements of renal&#xD;
      fibrosis for prediction of renal function deterioration with a non-invasive method.&#xD;
