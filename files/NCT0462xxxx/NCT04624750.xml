      This is an open-label, multi-centre, single arm, interventional study to describe the&#xD;
      steady-state PK, safety, and efficacy of mexiletine in paediatric patients (6 to &lt;18 years of&#xD;
      age) with myotonic disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be enrolled stepwise, sequentially in 2&#xD;
      cohorts by age groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1 - Adolescents aged 12 to &lt;18 years, will be enrolled first. If no safety concerns&#xD;
      are observed (based on data evaluation by the Data Safety Monitoring Board [DSMB]), and the&#xD;
      dose for the age group 6 to &lt;12 years is confirmed by PK model, enrolment for Cohort 2 will&#xD;
      begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2 - Children aged 6 to &lt;12 years, will be enrolled. The overall treatment duration for&#xD;
      each cohort will be approximately 56 days (8 weeks): a dose titration phase of 4 weeks and&#xD;
      the maintenance phase of 4 weeks. The overall study duration would be approximately 22&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose titration phase: In this phase, patients will receive mexiletine starting at an age&#xD;
      appropriate dose (as evaluated by the investigator and based on body weight) at a frequency&#xD;
      of once a day. Dose will be up-titrated every 14 days based on tolerability of mexiletine up&#xD;
      to a maximum of three-times a day as assessed by investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance phase: During the maintenance phase, patients will continue to receive mexiletine&#xD;
      at the best-tolerated dose from the titration phase for further 4 weeks. Following&#xD;
      completion, all participants will be offered follow-up in PIP Study 7 (MEX-NM-303) (EudraCT:&#xD;
      2019-003758-97).&#xD;
