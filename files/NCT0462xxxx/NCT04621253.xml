  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical phase I trial had 3 arms: inhibition by fluconazole, inhibition by&#xD;
      ciprofloxacin and placebo. Subjects were treated for 3 days prior to the study day. The&#xD;
      intervention was a single dose of 1 gram metamizole. We took blood samples at set time points&#xD;
      and analysed the concentration of the main metabolites of metamizole at each time point in&#xD;
      plasma.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While the clinical pharmacokinetics of metamizole have been described in detail before, the&#xD;
      enzymes responsible for the metabolism have not been identified yet (except for the&#xD;
      acetylation of 4-aminoantipyrine). Former investigations delivered mixed results and the&#xD;
      question of the participation of the hepatic cytochrome p450 enzymes could not been answered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, a double-blind randomized cross over clinical phase I study with healthy, male,&#xD;
      caucasian volunteers was conducted. After giving consent for participation and enrolment, the&#xD;
      subjects were treated for 3 days with either one inhibitor (either ciprofloxacin, CYP1A2&#xD;
      inhibitor, or fluconazole, strong CYP2C9 and moderate CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 inhibitor) or&#xD;
      placebo. The doses were 750 mg ciprofloxacin twice daily for 3 days and in the morning of the&#xD;
      study day or 400 mg fluconazole loading dose with consecutive 200 mg fluconazole once daily.&#xD;
      For the study day, the subject were invited to the study center and a venous access was&#xD;
      placed on the non-dominant arm. The last dose of either inhibitor or placebo was taken 1h&#xD;
      prior to a single dose of 1000 mg metamizole. Blood samples were drawn at t: 0h, 0.25h, 0.5h,&#xD;
      0.75h, 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 12h and 24h. The blood samples were centrifuged, the plasma&#xD;
      was isolated and frozen at -20°C. All subjects received both inhibitors and placebo&#xD;
      treatment, attending to a total of 3 study days. Furthermore, the genotype for CYP1A2,&#xD;
      CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 was assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma samples will be analyzed and the concentrations of the main metabolites of metamizole&#xD;
      and the inhibitors will be measured. Pharmacokinetic parameters such as maximal&#xD;
      concentration, half life, time to reach maximal concentration and the area under the curve&#xD;
      will be assessed and compared.&#xD;
