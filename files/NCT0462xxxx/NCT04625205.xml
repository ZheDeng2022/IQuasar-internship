  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study to investigate the safety and activity of NEO-PTC-01 in patients with unresectable or&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma. NEO-PTC-01 is an autologous personalized T cell (PTC) product for&#xD;
      adoptive cell therapy that is manufactured ex vivo and targets neoantigens displayed on the&#xD;
      patient's tumour and the tumour microenvironment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in two parts, Part 1 (Dose-Finding) and Part 2 (Dose Expansion).&#xD;
      The dose-finding part of the study will test two doses of NEO-PTC-01 and will be structured&#xD;
      according to a 3+3 dose escalation design. The dose expansion part of the study will test the&#xD;
      dose deemed to be safe in the dose-finding part of the study in an expanded cohort of&#xD;
      patients to further define the safety.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult (age 18 to 75) men and women willing and able to give written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed unresectable or metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Part 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have previously received a programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death ligand 1&#xD;
             (PD-1/PD-L1) inhibitor (either as single agent or in combination) and a Cytotoxic&#xD;
             T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) inhibitor containing regimen (single agent&#xD;
             or combination) prior to NEO-PTC-01, with disease progression following these&#xD;
             therapies or otherwise lack of clinical benefit as determined by the study&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Part 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received/are currently receiving a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor (as a single agent or in&#xD;
             combination with CTLA-4) for at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have documented SD by RECIST 1.1 or clinically asymptomatic progressive disease on the&#xD;
             most recent imaging assessment, which must have occurred within 3 months of enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are medically fit to continue with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the opinion of the investigator would benefit from the addition of a T-cell based&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For known BRAF mutant patients: patients must have also received targeted therapy&#xD;
             (B-raf inhibitor or B-raf/MEK combination therapy) prior to NEO-PTC-01, unless deemed&#xD;
             not appropriate to receive these treatments by the investigator.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  At least one site of disease must be accessible to biopsy for tumour tissue for&#xD;
             sequence and immunological analysis. The biopsy site may be the same as the measurable&#xD;
             site so long as it remains measurable. Surgical resection of the measurable site may&#xD;
             not be performed if that site is the only measurable lesion. An archival biopsy may be&#xD;
             used in place if the biopsy was taken within 6 months of enrolment.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Have a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg&#xD;
             daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days&#xD;
             prior to NEO-PTC-01 infusion. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement&#xD;
             doses (≤ 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) are permitted in the absence of active&#xD;
             autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, active chronic hepatitis B or C,&#xD;
             and/or life-threatening illnesses unrelated to cancer that could, in the&#xD;
             investigator's opinion, interfere with participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any underlying medical condition, psychiatric condition, or social situation&#xD;
             that, in the investigator's opinion, would interfere with participation in the study.&#xD;

             confound the ability to analyse study data.&#xD;

             projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days&#xD;
             after the end of the trial (EOT) visit. Nursing women are excluded from this study&#xD;
             because there is an unknown but potential risk of AEs in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with treatments to be administered in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a history of another invasive malignancy aside from melanoma, except for the&#xD;
             following circumstances:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Participant has been disease-free for at least 2 years and is deemed by the&#xD;
                  investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Participant was not treated with systemic chemotherapy for carcinoma in situ of&#xD;
                  the breast, oral cavity or cervix, basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
