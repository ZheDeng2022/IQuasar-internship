  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 safety and tolerability trial that will take place in two parts. Part one&#xD;
      of the trial will determine the tolerability of the OsciPulse device on healthy subjects who&#xD;
      wear the device for up to three hours. Healthy volunteers will answer questionnaires and&#xD;
      undergo an ultrasound test at the end of their participation in the trial. Part two of the&#xD;
      trial will determine the safety and tolerability of the OsciPulse device on subjects admitted&#xD;
      to the Neuro-ICU and Trauma Surgical ICUs at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center. Eligible&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled for 48 hours. In the first 24 hours, subjects will wear the&#xD;
      standard of care intermittent pneumatic compression device or the OsciPulse device. In the&#xD;
      second 24 hours subject's device will be switched and subjects will wear the alternate device&#xD;
      not used in the first 24 hours. Subjects will answer questionnaires and undergo an ultrasound&#xD;
      at the end of the first 24 hours and at the end of the second 24 hours (at hour 48).&#xD;
