      Moms Are Worth It is a lifestyle behavior intervention study aims to prevent excessive&#xD;
      gestational weight gain in overweight or obese pregnant women through promotion of the stress&#xD;
      management, healthy eating, and physical activity. Eligible women will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to a usual care or an intervention plus usual care group. The intervention will last 20 weeks&#xD;
      and will be delivered via weekly web and individual health coaching session (10 of them)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Current effective lifestyle behavior intervention studies aimed to prevent excessive&#xD;
      gestational weight gain (EGWG) in overweight or obese pregnant women have limited&#xD;
      practicality, scalability, and sustainability because of high participant burden and&#xD;
      excessive cost for clinical practice. Also, prior studies paid little or no attention to&#xD;
      motivation, emotion and cognition, all of which are critical to motivate and enable&#xD;
      individuals to engage in healthy lifestyle behaviors and achieve positive health outcomes. A&#xD;
      promising approach to prevent EGWG in overweight or obese pregnant women is through&#xD;
      goal-oriented episodic future thinking (GOEFT). This pilot randomized controlled trial, aims&#xD;
      to prevent EGWG in overweight or obese pregnant women. The proposed self-directed, web-based&#xD;
      GOEFT intervention will focus on increasing motivation (autonomous motivation and&#xD;
      self-efficacy) and improving emotion (emotion control and stress) and cognition (executive&#xD;
      function, ExF), thus promoting healthy lifestyle behaviors. This will lead to prevention of&#xD;
      EGWG and a reduced rate of gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, cesarean delivery&#xD;
      and fetal macrosomia. Our intervention will last 20 weeks (starting at 17 week-gestation).&#xD;
      Participants (N = 90; 50% White, 50% minority) will be recruited and enrolled from prenatal&#xD;
      care clinics at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      our GOEFT intervention (n = 45) or usual care (n = 45). All participants will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline (&lt;17 week-gestation, T1), 24-27 week-gestation (T2) and 35-37 week-gestation (T3).&#xD;
      Specific aims are (1) to determine feasibility of the GOEFT intervention: recruitment,&#xD;
      randomization, retention and intervention implementation, (2) to investigate the potential&#xD;
      efficacy of the intervention on gestational weight gain and maternal and birth outcomes, (3)&#xD;
      to investigate the potential impact of the intervention on lifestyle behaviors and (4) to&#xD;
      investigate the potential impact of the intervention on motivation, emotion and cognition.&#xD;

    <description>Will be measured using The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adults (BRIEF-A, 75 items). This survey measures an adult's executive function in her everyday environment: for example, inhibitory control, self-monitoring, plan/organization, and organization of materials.&#xD;
Values are: 0 - Never, 1 - Sometimes, 2 - Often&#xD;
The investigators will sum 75 items to create a composite score, ranging from 0 to 150.&#xD;
The higher score, the lower executive function.</description>

    <description>Investigators will ask participants to evaluate the following: the usefulness (12 items) and satisfaction (12 items) of each intervention component.&#xD;
Values are: 1 - not useful at all/not satisfy at all, 2, 3, 4 - very useful/very satisfy.&#xD;
The investigators will sum the 12 items to create a composite score, ranging from 12 to 48.&#xD;

    <description>Investigators will use 8 items to conduct process evaluation. Investigators will ask all study participants' receipt of stress or emotion management, healthy eating, and physical activity counseling from their clinicians, midwifes and dietitians (Yes = 1/No =0). If yes, they will be asked about the frequency and length. Participants will also be asked if they have joined/received other programs to manage stress better, eat healthier, and be more physically active.&#xD;
The investigators will sum 8 items to create a composite score, ranging from 0 to 8). The higher score, the more consultation received from clinicians, midwifes and dietitians.</description>
