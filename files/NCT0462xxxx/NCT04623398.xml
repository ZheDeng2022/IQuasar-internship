  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no treatment for the body symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD).&#xD;
      However, basic research suggests that some forms of ASD may be alleviated, even in the adult&#xD;
      stage. The genes involved in ASDs particularly impact synaptic homeostasis. Specific clinical&#xD;
      trials in patients with synaptic mutations need to be carried out. In this spirit, patients&#xD;
      with deleterious mutations in SHANK3 represent a paradigm. The induced pluripotent stem cells&#xD;
      (iPSc) carrying SHANK3 mutations and derived in neurons, can be used for high-throughput&#xD;
      screening of pharmacological substances and allow the identification of compounds that can&#xD;
      restore the expression level of SHANK3. The objective of this proposed project is to test one&#xD;
      of the compounds identified by research on these iPSc as a novel treatment for social&#xD;
      communication deficit in patients with deleterious mutations in SHANK3. Its effect on the&#xD;
      symptoms of the social deficit could represent a new perspective for other forms of&#xD;
      idiopathic autism.&#xD;

      Phase IIa intervention study, pilot, prospective, multicenter, randomized in 2 parallel arms,&#xD;
      Li+ versus placebo, double-blind. The main objective of the study is to evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of Li+ at 12 weeks, compared to placebo, on the social communication deficit in patients with&#xD;
      Phelan-McDermid Syndrome (SHANK3 haploinsufficiency).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Secondary Objectives are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of Li+ at 12 weeks on all cardinal and main symptoms in patients&#xD;
           suffering from Phelan-McDemid Syndrome (PMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the tolerance of Li + for 12 weeks in children suffering from PMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demonstrate the feasibility of a phase III, randomized controlled trial. The treatment&#xD;
           of the study is lithium carbonate: Li+ carbonate capsules are prepared from the raw&#xD;
           material for pharmaceutical use .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion will be ensured by the clinical genetics centers. Psychiatric evaluation will be&#xD;
      carried out by the investigative child psychiatry service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up by 2 referring physicians:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a child psychiatrist, blind of the treatment arm, who will carry out the evaluations of&#xD;
           the judgement criteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a physician from the clinical investigation center, the only one informed of the&#xD;
           attribution arm, who will ensure the adaptation of the LI dosage; an adaptation of the&#xD;
           dummy dosage will be proposed to the patients on placebo to maintain the blind in this&#xD;
           group as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the evaluation is based on hetero-evaluation (by the parents), a placebo treatment remains&#xD;
      necessary in the control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmaceutical preparations will be carried out for this pilot study: unit blister packaging&#xD;
      of the active ingredient and the placebo.&#xD;
