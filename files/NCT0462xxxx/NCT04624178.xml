    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether combining the study drugs rucaparib and&#xD;
      nivolumab may be an effective treatment for advanced and/or metastatic LMS, and whether the&#xD;
      study treatment works as well as the standard chemotherapy for this type of cancer.&#xD;

    <description>One treatment cycle will consist of 28 days. Patients will receive rucaparib at 600 mg, orally, twice daily, continuously for 28 days. They will receive 480mg of nivolumab intravenously on day 1 of every four-week cycle. This is the recommended phase II dose of the combination therapy. Re-staging scans will be performed every 8 weeks.&#xD;
Treatment will be repeated until the patient develops progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity or for a maximum duration of 26 cycles as long as patients are receiving benefit from treatment, have not had disease progression, met any criteria for study withdrawal and are tolerating therapy.</description>
