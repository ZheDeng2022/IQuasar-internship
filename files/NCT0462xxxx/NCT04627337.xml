  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-constipated irritable bowel syndrome is a common disorder that may be related to small&#xD;
      intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 is a probiotic yeast that&#xD;
      has proven efficacy for the treatment of acute gastroenteritis and antibiotic-associated&#xD;
      diarrhea. However, its efficacy for the treatment of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel&#xD;
      syndrome with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth has not been assessed. Hence, an&#xD;
      exploratory randomized, open label trial comparing the efficacy and safety of Saccharomyes&#xD;
      boulardii CNCM I-745 plus diet administration versus diet administration only for 15 days&#xD;
      among adult patients with the aforementioned condition was conducted.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in symptom severity measured by the Irritable Bowel Syndrome Symptom Severity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>15 days</time_frame>
    <description>The IBS Symptom Severity Scale (IBS-SSS) is a validated questionnaire (Francis et al. 1997) that evaluates the intensity of the following IBS symptoms: abdominal pain, distension, stool frequency and consistency, and general impact on life. The IBS-SSS calculates the sum of these 5 items (each scored on a visual analogue scale from 0 to 100) and the score values range from 0 to 500 (maximum severity). An IBS-SSS questionnaire was filled-in by each randomized patient at both visits. We compared the difference between the overall score before and after the intervention.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in hydrogen excretion measured by lactulose breath test</measure>
    <time_frame>15 days</time_frame>
    <description>Presence of bacterial overgrowth was examined by a lactulose hydrogen breath test (LHBT), which measures hydrogen concentration within the expelled breath.&#xD;
Patients ingested 10 mL lactulose, then breath samples were collected every 20 minutes over 180 min and analyzed to determine hydrogen concentration. An excreted hydrogen concentration/time area under the curve (AUC) was then calculated. A positive test corresponded to any of the following results: rise in breath hydrogen at least 20 ppm above basal levels within 100 minutes after ingestion of lactulose; rise at least 12 ppm within100 minutes with a decrease of 5 ppm (markers of SIBO) and subsequent increase; (AUC) value of more than 3000 ppm. Changes in terms of absolute hydrogen excretion measured by AUC of hydrogen excretion over time were compared before and after intervention in every patient.</description>
