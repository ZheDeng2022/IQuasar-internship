      Increased muscle tone, decreased normal range of motion, and functional impairments may&#xD;
      result in decreased load on the affected limb, deviations in gait patterns, balance and&#xD;
      coordination disorders in individuals with stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, there are many scales that evaluate balance and functional performance in&#xD;
      stroke. However there is no validity and reliability study of Dubousset Function Test&#xD;
      developed to evaluate balance and functional performance of stroke. For this reason, the aim&#xD;
      of study is to examine the validity and reliability of Dubousset Function Test in stroke&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      While the ambulation ability is completely lost in some patients after stroke, impaired&#xD;
      balance reactions and increased postural oscillations cause an increase in the fear of&#xD;
      falling and the risk of falling in stroke patients. These disturbances cause stroke patients&#xD;
      to make more effort to balance while standing. Balance assessment performed in individuals&#xD;
      with stroke determines the risk of falling and is important in preventing complications that&#xD;
      may develop due to loss of balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dubousset Functional Test (DFT); A conceptually practical four-component assessment test has&#xD;
      been proposed by Dr. Jean Dubousset to assess the functional capacity of adult individuals.&#xD;
      The validity of the test was made in individuals with spinal deformity. DFT; It consists of&#xD;
      four components: getting up from a chair without arms and walking 5 meters forward and&#xD;
      backward, descending and climbing steps, transition from standing to sitting on the ground,&#xD;
      and the dual task test in which the individual walks while counting down from 50 at the same&#xD;
      time. In the literature, there are many scales that evaluate balance and functional&#xD;
      performance in stroke. However there is no validity and reliability study of Dubousset&#xD;
      Function Test developed to evaluate balance and functional performance of stroke. For this&#xD;
      reason, the aim of study is to examine the validity and reliability of Dubousset Function&#xD;
      Test in stroke patients&#xD;

    <description>The four components of the DFT included (1) the Up Walking Test: participants rose without assistance from a and seated position in a chair that did not have arms, walked 5 meters (500 cm) forward before stopping, walked backwards 5 meters, and sat again without assistance; (2) the Steps Test: from a starting position 50 cm away, volunteers climbed three stairs, turned around on the third step (top), and walked down the three steps; (3) Down and Sitting Test: from a standing position, participants sat on the ground and stood up again, using assistance as needed; (4) Dual-Tasking Test: participants walked 5 meters forward, turned around, and walked 5 meters back to the starting position while performing a working memory test (counting down from 50 by intervals of 2).</description>

    <description>A standard chair is used for testing. First, the patient is asked to sit on the chair. The patient is then asked to stand up and walk regularly at a distance of 3 meters with a predetermined length, then return to the chair after 3 meters</description>

    <measure>3-m backwards walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>first day</time_frame>
    <description>A distance of 3 m is measured and marked with black tape. Individuals are asked to follow the heel and black band.&#xD;
With the 'start' command they are asked to walk backwards quickly. When the distance of 3 m is completed, a stop is instructed. Individuals are not allowed to run during the test. They are allowed to look back if they wish. The assessor walks behind individuals throughout the test. The test is repeated 3 times, the averages are recorded</description>
