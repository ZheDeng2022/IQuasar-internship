  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects men and women equally, but after the onset of puberty, women&#xD;
      with CF have a lower life expectancy than men with CF. Despite these known differences, the&#xD;
      link between CF symptom trends and the menstrual cycle remains critically understudied. To&#xD;
      address this gap, this study will investigate changes in CF-specific symptoms among women&#xD;
      with CF to evaluate whether and how they correlate with their menstrual cycle. Specifically,&#xD;
      the investigators hope to examine whether CF-related symptoms change throughout the menstrual&#xD;
      cycle, what the impact of those symptoms is on quality of life, and how feasible it is to use&#xD;
      a period tracking app to track CF-related symptoms throughout the menstrual cycle.&#xD;
      Investigators are asking women ages 18-45 with CF, who have regular menstrual cycles, to&#xD;
      participate. Study procedures, including online surveys, period tracking, and interview, will&#xD;
      take approximately 3 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      To better understand the connection between cyclically driven hormone fluctuations and&#xD;
      CF-related symptoms, the investigators propose an explanatory, sequential mixed methods study&#xD;
      in which 80 menstruating women with CF will be asked to track their daily CF-related symptoms&#xD;
      for three consecutive cycles. From this cohort, the investigators will ask up to 30 women&#xD;
      with CF to participate in one semi-structured interview to gather information about the&#xD;
      impact of cyclical CF symptoms upon women's daily lives and any strategies they use to manage&#xD;
      them. This study uses innovative technology to track CF-specific symptoms with a smartphone&#xD;
      app. The investigators' hypothesis is that subjective changes in clinical CF symptoms,&#xD;
      including pulmonary and sinus (primary outcome), rheumatic, and gastrointestinal (secondary&#xD;
      outcomes), will map onto the phases of the menstrual cycle and will be cyclical in nature;&#xD;
      women will report alternative ways in which they manage their cyclical CF symptoms; and the&#xD;
      period tracker app will be easy for women to use.&#xD;
