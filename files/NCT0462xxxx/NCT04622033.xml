  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4 single center, single-arm, open-label study that will evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of brodalumab in psoriasis patients as well as the impact on quality of life in&#xD;
      addition to clinical photography. Efficacy will be evaluated by a study treatment assessor.&#xD;
      The study includes a 30-day screening period with study visits at Week 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16,&#xD;
      and 24. Study drug dosing will consist of patients self-injecting according to on-label FDA&#xD;
      approved dosing of brodalumab 210mg at week 0, 1, 2 and then every 2 weeks thereafter for&#xD;
      moderate to severe psoriasis patients after adequate injection training is given at study&#xD;
      center site. Subjects will be instructed at Week 0 (pre-injection) by the site staff on how&#xD;
      to self-inject via the dosing syringe. Study drug will be dispensed through the delineated&#xD;
      REMS approved pharmacy. Baseline assessment will be performed at week 0 and efficacy&#xD;
      assessments will be performed at week 4, 8, 12, 16 and 24, then every 2 weeks thereafter for&#xD;
      palmoplantar psoriasis using approved dosing schedule for moderate to severe psoriasis.&#xD;
      Patients will self inject after adequate injection training is given at the study center&#xD;
      site.&#xD;
