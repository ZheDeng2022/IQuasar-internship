  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) disproportionally affects certain populations, including those facing&#xD;
      substance use and mental health challenges. In the past, many individuals with mental illness&#xD;
      were not treated due to the psychiatric side-effects of interferon. However, the development&#xD;
      of highly effective, direct-acting antivirals (DAA) has revolutionized HCV treatment such&#xD;
      that cure rates are &gt;95% with 8-12 weeks of simple, safe, and well-tolerated therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent systematic review reported that across 13 North American studies, HCV prevalence&#xD;
      among people admitted to psychiatric hospitals was a staggering 17.4% (13.2-22.6%). Despite&#xD;
      these concerning figures, mental health facilities have not been a focus of HCV elimination&#xD;
      efforts to date. The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in Toronto is the largest&#xD;
      mental health facility in Canada, with a psychiatric emergency department seeing ~35 patients&#xD;
      per day with many admitted to the acute psychiatric units for safety and stabilization.&#xD;
      Currently, psychiatric patients screened for HCV at CAMH have a 75% 'no show' rate at the&#xD;
      Toronto Centre for Liver Disease (TCLD), which is located less than 5km away, suggesting that&#xD;
      referral upon discharge is ineffective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be the first trial to evaluate whether it would be feasible and beneficial to&#xD;
      initiate treatment during an acute psychiatric admission rather than referring to specialty&#xD;
      upon discharge. The combination of broad HCV screening with rapid linkage to treatment has&#xD;
      led to successful elimination of HCV within defined populations, so-called micro-elimination.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that HCV treatment can be effectively delivered by providers in&#xD;
      psychiatric care facilities, which will improve treatment uptake over traditional referral&#xD;
      models.&#xD;

    <description>Acute psychiatric patients who test HCV RNA positive by OraQuick HCV Antibody Test will be referred for outpatient specialty follow-up at the Toronto Centre for Liver Disease (TCLD) where they will be assessed and offered treatment as per standard of care. TCLD referrals are triaged by clinicians unaware of the trial and prioritized based on urgency of treatment. Patients who do not attend the initial visit will be rescheduled. After 3 'no-show' visits, the person will not be scheduled again at TCLD and will be deemed a 'treatment failure' for the trial with subsequent HCV follow-up at the discretion of the CAMH provider, consistent with current practice.</description>

    <description>CAMH hospitalists covering the inpatient units will undergo a training designed for non-specialist providers, used in the ASCEND trial, which has already occurred. An algorithm-based work-up which has been used for non-specialist treaters in ECHO Liver, a Ministry-of-Health supported tele-mentoring program, will then be completed for all who test HCV RNA positive. Labs will be drawn by the hospital phlebotomist following a positive HCV RNA result from the Gene Xpert Viral Load Assay. At this time, a sample will also be obtained to send to for conventional HCV RNA quantification and genotyping.</description>
