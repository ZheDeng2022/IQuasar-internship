  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a debilitating and chronic lung syndrome that&#xD;
      causes accelerated lung function decline and death in 20% of cases. The worsening of&#xD;
      symptoms, as well as the patient's condition, strictly depends on the identified COPD&#xD;
      phenotype, severity stages, exacerbation events, selected drugs, rehabilitation cures and on&#xD;
      the adherence of patients to these therapies. Despite the efficient COPD diagnostic&#xD;
      procedure, a new fast, sensitive and easily applicable approach must be developed in order to&#xD;
      achieve the specific evaluation and monitoring of therapy adherence in COPD patients,&#xD;
      stratifying the different COPD phenotypes and foreseeing the exacerbation events in order to&#xD;
      optimize the COPD disease management. The application of Raman spectroscopy on saliva has&#xD;
      been already proposed for different infective, neurological and cancer diseases, with&#xD;
      promising results in the diagnostic and monitoring fields, representing saliva an easy&#xD;
      collectable and highly informative biofluid. In this project we propose a combined Raman&#xD;
      Spectroscopy - Machine Learning analysis of saliva collected from COPD patients and&#xD;
      non-pathological and pathological controls for the development of a multifactorial device&#xD;
      able to provide fast and sensitive information regarding COPD phenotypes, exacerbation risks,&#xD;
      adherence and effectiveness of pharmacological and rehabilitation therapies, achieving the&#xD;
      crucial target of the personalized medicine. Moreover, after the model development, we&#xD;
      propose to test the Raman approach in hospital evaluating the creation of a COPD point of&#xD;
      care, accompanying the clinicians in the disease management. Starting from FDG preliminary&#xD;
      results, the biochemical composition of saliva in patients with diagnosed COPD will be&#xD;
      evaluated and statistically compared with the one obtained from age and sex-matched healthy&#xD;
      subjects and from patients affected by other respiratory chronic diseases (Asthma). Moreover,&#xD;
      an intra-group COPD clustering will be analysed in order to verify a different Raman&#xD;
      fingerprint obtained from COPD patients with different phenotypes. The collected Raman data&#xD;
      will be processed using a multivariate analysis approach. The classification model will be&#xD;
      created using cross-validation and subset validation. Thanks to RS, the overall composition&#xD;
      of saliva will be established with minimal sample preparation, providing a comprehensive&#xD;
      biochemical fingerprint of the sample. The expected results are I) Identification of the&#xD;
      specific COPD Raman fingerprint through the comparison with healthy subjects and patients&#xD;
      affected by asthma; II) Monitoring of the therapy adherence through the drug signal and/or&#xD;
      biochemical modification in saliva; III) Stratification of the 4 COPD phenotypes on the base&#xD;
      of the provided Raman fingerprint; IV) Monitoring of the rehabilitation procedures and&#xD;
      effects; V) Association of an high exacerbation risk index to specific COPD patients; VI)&#xD;
      Creation of a classification model of the created Raman database.&#xD;

      SAMPLE COLLECTION: Saliva collection from all the selected subjects will be performed&#xD;
      following the Salivette (SARSTEDT) manufacturer's instructions. To limit variability in&#xD;
      salivary content not related to COPD, saliva will be obtained from all subjects at a fixed&#xD;
      time, after an appropriate lag time from feeding and teeth brushing. Pre-analytical&#xD;
      parameters (i.e. storage temperature and time between collection and processing), dietary and&#xD;
      smoking habit will be properly recorded. Briefly, the swab will be removed, placed in the&#xD;
      mouth and chewed for 60 seconds to stimulate salivation. Then the swab will be centrifuged&#xD;
      for 2 minutes at 1,000 g to remove cells fragments and food debris. Collected samples will be&#xD;
      stored at -80Â° C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE PROCESSING: For the Raman analysis, a drop of each sample will be casted on an&#xD;
      aluminium foil in order to achieve the Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION: SERS spectra will be acquired using an Aramis Raman microscope (Horiba&#xD;
      Jobin-Yvon, France) equipped with a laser light source operating at 785 nm with laser power&#xD;
      ranging from 25-100% (Max power 512 mW). Acquisition time between 10-30 seconds will be used.&#xD;
      The instrument will be calibrated before each analysis using the reference band of silicon at&#xD;
      520.7 cm-1. Raman spectra will be collected from 35 points following a line-map from the edge&#xD;
      to the centre of the drop. Spectra will be acquired in the region between 400 and 1600 cm-1&#xD;
      using a 50x objective (Olympus, Japan). Spectra resolution is about 1.2 cm-1. The software&#xD;
      package LabSpec 6 (Horiba Jobin-Yvon, France) will be used for map design and the acquisition&#xD;
      of spectra.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA PROCESSING: All the acquired spectra will be fit with a fourth-degree polynomial&#xD;
      baseline and normalized by unit vector using the dedicated software LabSpec 6. The&#xD;
      contribution of the substrate will be removed from each spectra. The statistical analysis to&#xD;
      validate the method, will be performed using a multivariate analysis approach. Principal&#xD;
      Component analysis (PCA) will be performed in order to reduce data dimensions and to evidence&#xD;
      major trends. The first 20 resultant Principal Components (PCs) will be used in a&#xD;
      classification model, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), to discriminate the data maximizing&#xD;
      the variance between the selected groups. The smallest number of PCs will be selected to&#xD;
      prevent data overfitting. Leave-one-out cross-validation and confusion matrix test will be&#xD;
      used to evaluate the method sensitivity, precision and accuracy of the LDA model.&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney will be performed on PCs scores to verify the differences statistically relevant&#xD;
      between the analysed groups. Correlation and partial correlation analysis will be performed&#xD;
      using the Spearman's test, assuming as valid correlation only the coefficients with a p-value&#xD;
      lower than 0.05. The statistical analysis will be performed using Origin2018 (OriginLab,&#xD;
      USA).&#xD;
