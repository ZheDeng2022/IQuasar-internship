    <textblock>
      The human immune response to bacterial blood stream infection (sepsis) and systemic viral&#xD;
      infection are fairly well understood, but we lack details on the most early phases. Better&#xD;
      knowledge of these events would be important for the prevention and treatment of severe&#xD;
      bacterial or viral disease. From models of infection, we have data showing that bacteria&#xD;
      replicate in a specific type of cells in the spleen from where the bacteria then seed to the&#xD;
      blood to cause blood stream infection. In order to gain more relevant data for humans, we&#xD;
      have developed a spleen perfusion model using pig organs. This model confirms our previous&#xD;
      work and most importantly will now allow us to study these events in human organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to move novel treatment strategies into human trials, we propose to test early&#xD;
      events during infection using human spleens and the cells and tissues derived thereof. This&#xD;
      research is expected to provide data on the relevance of the early events in bacterial and&#xD;
      viral disease, in particular on the role of immune cells. The research includes work with&#xD;
      human cells and tissue obtained from human spleens. In these settings, we will test&#xD;
      pharmacological prevention and treatment of severe bacterial or viral infection (sepsis). The&#xD;
      expected outcome of this work on human organs and tissue is expected to provide evidence that&#xD;
      allows to move new treatment options into clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a preclinical research project and does not involve any intervention on&#xD;
      patients, but it involves human tissue. The source of the human splenic tissue for our&#xD;
      research will be spleen tissue removed during radical surgery. The present application&#xD;
      relates exclusively to the ethical approval for the use of spleen tissue removed during&#xD;
      radical surgery and discarded. The utilisation of the spleen or splenic tissue for research&#xD;
      purposes does not alter in any way the surgical procedures at any stage and importantly the&#xD;
      research will involve only anonymity samples.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a preclinical research project and no patient intervention is planned. The project&#xD;
      makes use of anonymised human tissue samples discarded during radical surgery. The spleen&#xD;
      organ samples included in this project will be from patients undergoing elective surgery for&#xD;
      a lesion in the pancreas in the HPB Unit of the Leicester General Hospital. The sample size&#xD;
      of 24 spleens has been determined by power calculations and is in line with the number of&#xD;
      spleens actually removed by elective pancreas surgery over the past years. No change in the&#xD;
      surgical procedure or recruiting results from this study and the use of the samples. All the&#xD;
      experimental work carried out on the spleen samples will have no effect on the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiments include ex vivo organ perfusion and infection with bacteria or viruses. Biopsies&#xD;
      of the perfused 24 spleens are processed for in vitro tissue slice and macrophage cell&#xD;
      culture. The resulting primary cell cultures and tissue slices will be stored frozen for&#xD;
      future research. All in vitro studies on the 24 organs, and the tissues and cells derived&#xD;
      from them, will evaluate the effect of therapeutic interventions (antibodies, receptor&#xD;
      antagonists, antibiotics and other molecules) on the capacity of splenic cells to clear&#xD;
      invasive bacteria or viruses. The experiments will be carried out each time a spleen sample&#xD;
      will be available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The detailed technical description of the experimental strategy including the strategy for&#xD;
      storage and discarding of the human tissue will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Whole organ ex vivo perfusion: This work is done to stabilise the organ, infect the&#xD;
           organ and then to derive from it tissue slices and cells for primary cell culture. We&#xD;
           have successfully set up a normo-thermic ex vivo porcine spleen perfusion model. This&#xD;
           expertise allowed us to define the parameters for organ collection, transport and&#xD;
           perfusion of porcine spleens for up to six hours and importantly develop and infection&#xD;
           model. Infection showed conservation of capacity to remove bacteria from blood and good&#xD;
           filtering capacity and, essential for this application, that also in the whole organ&#xD;
           model specific subsets of macrophages are permissive to bacterial intracellular&#xD;
           replication. In this experimental series we propose to perfuse whole explanted human&#xD;
           spleens. In contrast to pigs, we will use for perfusion of the human organ synthetic&#xD;
           medium in order to neutralise or minimise acquired immunity. Histology, confocal&#xD;
           microscopy, FACS analysis and bacterial and viral enumeration will be the main&#xD;
           methodologies to analyse the perfused organ. The aim of this part of the work is to&#xD;
           demonstrate that at the whole organ level bacteria and viruses are able to replicate in&#xD;
           splenic tissue macrophages pinpointing attention of anti-infective treatments to the&#xD;
           prevention of these early steps potentially preventing invasive bacterial and viral&#xD;
           disease. Samples from the 24 whole perfused organs will be the source of tissue slice&#xD;
           cultures and primary cell cultures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Primary cell cultures: From the 24 human spleens we will derive samples for primary&#xD;
           culture of human tissue macrophages and other immune cells. Using the methodology in use&#xD;
           for cells from mice and pigs, we will set up primary cultures of human splenic immune&#xD;
           cells and in particular macrophages. Immune cells including macrophages and neutrophils&#xD;
           will be purified by different methodologies including by percoll gradient&#xD;
           centrifugation, FACS and magnetic separation and cultured for up to seven days. Cultures&#xD;
           will be tested for multiple parameters including cytokines, surface markers, anybody&#xD;
           production and gene expression. To test interaction with bacteria or viruses, the&#xD;
           cultured cells will be infected with a panel of bacterial and viral pathogens. Upon&#xD;
           other methodology, confocal microscopy, FACS and RNAseq will be used monitor behaviour&#xD;
           of bacterial and viral pathogens and host cells. Interventions with cytokines,&#xD;
           chemokines, drugs, antibiotics and other compounds will be carried out to test&#xD;
           tractability of the system. With the aim in mind to identify targets for intervention,&#xD;
           the cell culture models are intended to provide detailed quantifiable parameters of the&#xD;
           interaction of bacteria or viruses and immune cells in particular tissue macrophages in&#xD;
           a controlled in vitro culture system. This is intended to allow the design of&#xD;
           medium-throughput assays to test strategies modifying initiation of invasive disease.&#xD;
           Cells will be stored in liquid nitrogen for further research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Organotypic slice cultures: From the 24 human spleens we will derive, in addition to&#xD;
           cells, also tissue samples for organotypic slice cultures. With the methodology well set&#xD;
           up for brain slices and described for spleen, we will culture organotypic human spleen&#xD;
           slice cultures. These organ slices are superior to cell cultures, as they maintain the&#xD;
           multicellular spatial microarchitecture of the organ, which is particularly important&#xD;
           when analysing tissue macrophages. As for brain slice cultures, we will infect the&#xD;
           slices with bacterial or viral pathogens and monitor their migration within the tissue,&#xD;
           the infection of cells and the reaction of the single host cells. The use of tissue&#xD;
           slice culture should allow to specifically study the targeting and&#xD;
           replication-permissive nature of specific subsets of immune cells including macrophages.&#xD;
           A goal of the objective is to allow for detailed development of infectious foci in the&#xD;
           spleen including time laps confocal microscopy of infected spleen slices. Testing in&#xD;
           this model cytokines and other host derived molecules are expected to show the potential&#xD;
           of interventions targeting specific subsets of immune cells including macrophages.&#xD;
           Tissue slices will be stored in liquid nitrogen for further research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample transfer between units: The 24 planned organ perfusion will be performed at the&#xD;
      laboratories of the HBP unit of the Leicester General Hospital. In selected cases organ&#xD;
      perfusion might be performed at the Department of Genetics and Genome Biology of the&#xD;
      University of Leicester. The relative HBA form has been obtained (Hazardous Biological Agents&#xD;
      form GEN/45 Cell lines and primary human cell and tissue culture, date 02/10/2017). During&#xD;
      and after perfusion, tissue samples for tissue slice culture and primary cell culture will be&#xD;
      taken. These tissue samples will be transferred to the Department of Genetics and Genome&#xD;
      Biology or Dept. of Infection and Immunity and Inflammation for the scheduled research work&#xD;
      and will be stored there in accordance with regulations relative to the Human Tissue Act.&#xD;
      Stored tissue slices and primary cell cultures may then be transferred for immunological&#xD;
      studies to the University of Nottingham for experimental work detailed above for cell&#xD;
      cultures. Conditions for handling, storage and transport are defined by the HBA form GEN45&#xD;
      and transfer will be regulated by an MTA.&#xD;
