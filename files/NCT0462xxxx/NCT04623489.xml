  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: By the year 2050, the number of older adults in the US will more than double.&#xD;
      Because older adults are more likely to develop chronic conditions such as cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease and arthritis, society is facing a healthcare crisis if effective ways to prevent&#xD;
      such diseases is not found. This is especially urgent for Latinos because they are the&#xD;
      nation's fastest growing ethnic group and they are in many cases at greater risk for chronic&#xD;
      disease. Objectives: ln this proposed pilot project, the goal is to understand if a lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention - iVivir Mi Vida! (iVMV!) - is feasible, acceptable, and shows preliminary&#xD;
      promise in helping late middle-aged Latinos experience better health. The investigators will&#xD;
      accomplish this goal by pilot testing the implementation of iVMV! in collaboration with&#xD;
      community health service partners in Antelope Valley. Methods: ln this study, 40 patients,&#xD;
      aged 50-65 years who are enrolled in Antelope Valley health centers will receive the iVMV!&#xD;
      lifestyle-based health program. This program lasts four months and will be delivered by&#xD;
      promotores (respected lay heath workers from the Latino community). Intervening promotores&#xD;
      will be supervised by an occupational therapist and a senior promotora. Within the program,&#xD;
      patients will participate in small group sessions at their local community healthcare&#xD;
      facilities and will also receive numerous visits from the promotores in their homes. The&#xD;
      program will involve weekly sessions in which the participants will be taught how to practice&#xD;
      healthy lifestyle choices, such as exercising, eating healthy food, and reducing stress.&#xD;
      Initially and at the end of the four-month program, the investigators will measure health&#xD;
      outcomes such as self-rated quality of life, diet and exercise, cholesterol and glucose&#xD;
      levels, blood pressure, and weight. The investigators will also ask participants, promotores,&#xD;
      and other research staff about their overall experiences during the study so that the&#xD;
      investigators can improve our program for the future. Mixed-methods procedures will be used&#xD;
      to analyze qualitative data (e.g., interview transcripts) and quantitative data (e.g.,&#xD;
      pre-post intervention health outcomes and 12-month follow-up). Anticipated lmpact: The study&#xD;
      will provide critical information about the feasibility and acceptability and preliminary&#xD;
      data on the health impact of the iVMV! intervention on late middle-aged Latino adults who are&#xD;
      at risk for disease. Information collected from this study will inform the design of a&#xD;
      larger-scale implementation study.&#xD;

    <description>Comprised of an overall profile score and four symptom/well-being subscales. Individuals identified one to two currently bothersome symptoms. They rated each symptom's severity and how much it interfered with daily activities. They also rated their overall well-being.&#xD;
MYMOP Profile Scores can be calculated as a mean of the ratings. These have values between 0 and 6; the higher the score, the worse the outcome. A decrease in scores is considered improvement.</description>

The 19 self-rated items are combined to form seven component scores, each of which has a range of 0-3 points. In all cases, a score of 0 indicates no difficulty, whereas a score of 3 indicates severe difficulty. The seven component scores are then added to yield one global score, with a range of 0-21 points, 0 indicating no difficulty and 21 indicating severe difficulties in all areas.</description>
