  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eating disorders (ED) are serious mental health illnesses interfering psychological, physical&#xD;
      and social well-being. Besides the severity of ED, most of the individuals presenting&#xD;
      symptoms are either not detected or treated. Among ones undergoing treatment, full recovery&#xD;
      and remission are also not very likely. Given many negative consequences of ED and personal,&#xD;
      sociocultural and financial barriers for ED treatment and low rates of full recovery, any&#xD;
      intervention for preventing the development and/or chronicization of ED would be a useful&#xD;
      step for the improvement of public health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature has established that Turkish people represent unhealthy eating attitudes and&#xD;
      behaviours as similar to Western societies. Evidence shows that the prevalence of disordered&#xD;
      eating attitudes and behaviours in Turkey changed between 2.2% to 12.8%. Prevalence of ED&#xD;
      particularly among university students and these problems are also likely to negatively&#xD;
      influence students' psychological, social and physical well-being, relationships with pairs,&#xD;
      educational attainment and academic success. However, awareness regarding ED, help-seeking&#xD;
      and receiving treatment appears to be less likely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since there is no ED prevention program available for university students in Turkey, it was&#xD;
      aimed to develop a Cognitive Behaviour Therapy oriented 6 session ED prevention program&#xD;
      (Healthy Eating Attitudes and Behaviours Group Program) for female university students&#xD;
      presenting a high risk for ED. A further aim was to examine feasibility, acceptability and&#xD;
      efficacy of this program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence-based clinical guidelines for ED have indicated that CBT is consistently recommended&#xD;
      for all subtypes of ED, and CBT oriented prevention programs have been shown to result in a&#xD;
      better outcome for university students. Therefore, it was expected that university students&#xD;
      who participated in 6 session Healthy Eating Attitudes and Behaviours Group Program would&#xD;
      present significantly greater reductions in ED related psychopathology, body dissatisfaction,&#xD;
      emotion regulation difficulties and internalization and pressure of sociocultural attitudes&#xD;
      towards appearance compared to participants in active control group condition (single session&#xD;
      Eating Disorders and Body Dissatisfaction: A Group Work) and wait-list control condition.&#xD;
      Also, it was expected that the level of acceptability and feasibility of 6 session Healthy&#xD;
      Eating Attitudes and Behaviours Group Program would be good.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Participants were informed that they are invited to attend a group intervention aiming to improve healthy eating attitudes and behaviours. However, they were not informed that they were invited because they had higher levels of disordered eating attitudes and behaviours than the others who were not invited.

    <time_frame>Arm1: Enrollment; Arm2: Baseline(first day of the group intervention), post-treatment (6 weeks after baseline measurement), 1 month follow up (10 weeks after te baseline measurement)</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire was used for measuring restraint eating, shape concern, weight concern, eating concern and general eating disorders related psychopathology. There are four subscales named Restraint, Eating Concern, Shape Concern and Weight Concern, and a total score. The minimum score for this scale is 0, while the maximum score is 6. Higher scores indicate greater levels of disordered eating attitudes and behaviours. This questionnaire was used to assess the level of change from baseline to post-treatment and from baseline to 1 month follow up.</description>

    <description>This questionnaire was used for measuring preoccupation with body weight and shape. Scores can range from 34 (minimum) to 204 (maximum). Higher scores indicate greater levels of body dissatisfaction. This questionnaire was used to assess the level of change from baseline to post-treatment and from baseline to 1 month follow up.</description>

    <description>This questionnaire was used for measuring different aspects of emotion regulation difficulties. The minimum score for this scale is 0, while the maximum score is 64. Higher scores indicate greater levels of difficulty in emotion regulation. This questionnaire was used to assess the level of change from baseline to post-treatment and from baseline to 1 month follow up.</description>

    <description>This questionnaire was used for measuring the influence of societal and interpersonal influences on body image and disturbances in eating behaviour. There are 7 subscales of this questionnaires: (1) Internalization: Thin/Low Body Fat, (2) Internalization: Muscular, (3) Internalization: General Attractiveness, (4) Pressures: Family, (5) Pressures: Media, (6) Pressures: Peers, and (7) Pressures: Significant Others. For each subscale, scores can range from 1 (minimum) to 5 (maximum). Higher scores indicate greater levels of internalization or pressures.&#xD;

    <description>Participants were recruited by using a convenience sampling method. Potential participants were reached through lecturers and professors who are teaching classes at different universities in Istanbul, Turkey.&#xD;
Participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire package covering Demographic Information Form, Eating Disorders Examination Questionnaire (EDEQ), Eating Attitudes Test - 40 (EAT-40), Body Image Satisfaction Questionnaire (BISQ), and Sociocultural Attitudes towards Appearance Questionnaire-4-Revised (SATAQ-4R). Filling out the questionnaire package took approximately 25-minutes.</description>

    <description>The program has been developed by Clinical Psychologist Başak İnce and Psychiatrist Prof. Dr Başak Yücel. The session topics and contents of this program were based on the Fairburn (2008)'s book titled Cognitive- Behavior Treatment and Eating Disorders and 10-week online version of StudentBodies program designed by Saekow and her colleagues (2015). Program protocol was written based on Fairburn (2008)'s book titled Cognitive- Behavior Treatment and Eating Disorders and Fursland and her colleagues (2007)'s book titled Overcoming Disordered Eating.&#xD;
This program aimed to inform participants about the causes and consequences of eating disorders, teach cognitive and behavioural techniques to change their unhealthy eating attitudes and behaviours, and provide support during their attitudinal and behavioural changes. Each week, participants were asked to complete homework activities which were related to topics covered in each session.</description>

    <description>This single-session group program was designed as an active control group for the purpose of this study. The content of the program was prepared based on Stice and his colleagues (2013)'s four - sessions Body Project eating disorders prevention program. This single-session program aimed to inform participants about causes and consequences of eating disorders, and discuss &quot;thin ideal&quot; messages created by media and the negative impact of these messages on women's body images, and address possible ways of countering these messages. Detailed information regarding the covered topics and video presentations in the group session is provided below.</description>
