      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of the procedure (sleeve gastrectomy&#xD;
      technique with a Nissen fundoplication (N-Sleeve) vs conventional sleeve gastrectomy&#xD;
      technique&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery is recognized as the only effective therapeutic weapon for morbidly obese&#xD;
      patients. Gastro-Oesophageal Reflux Disease is very common (30-45% of cases) with serious&#xD;
      consequences on the oesophageal mucosa. It could be an exacerbation of preoperative GERD&#xD;
      symptoms or a &quot;de novo&quot; postoperative GERD. Medical treatment is usually effective but&#xD;
      reoperation may be required to treat refractory GERD.GERD can lead to serious consequences on&#xD;
      the oesophageal mucosa (esophagitis, Barrett's oesophagus, cancer). The conventional surgical&#xD;
      treatment of GERD is fundoplication, which can be partial or total. The gastric fundus is&#xD;
      wrapped around the oesophagus to strengthen the tone of the oesophageal sphincter. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that the creation of a total anti-reflux fundoplication before performing LSG&#xD;
      (Nissen + Sleeve = N-sleeve) could significantly reduce the postoperative GERD complication&#xD;
      as compared with the standard LSG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the impact of the procedure N-Sleeve vs conventional sleeve gastrectomy technique&#xD;
      on the rate of patient with GERD at 1, 6 and 12 months postoperatively. To evaluate the&#xD;
      impact of the procedure (sleeve gastrectomy technique with a Nissen fundoplication (N-Sleeve)&#xD;
      vs conventional sleeve gastrectomy technique during all the follow-up on the gastric fistula&#xD;
      on the staple line, on the postoperative morbidity and mortality , on the evolution of weight&#xD;
      loss, the excess weight loss, the BMI and the excess BMI loss during the follow-up. Evaluate&#xD;
      the impact of these procedures on the quality of life of patients at baseline and 1, 6 and 12&#xD;
      months postoperatively. Evaluate the safety during all the follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢Methods: Monocentric, randomized, single-blind controlled trial, with 2 parallel arms. 144&#xD;
      patients. The target population is all adult patients with severe or morbid obesity, who&#xD;
      underwent multidisciplinary care and having the criteria of 2009 HAS recommendations for&#xD;
      bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presence of gastro-oesophageal reflux will be assessed by a composite criteria: consumption&#xD;
      of Proton Pump Inhibitor and gastroscopy at baseline and 12-month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The N-SLEEVE technique consists of creating a gastric total fundoplication before to perform&#xD;
      the removal of 2/3 of the stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study may really lead to a change in terms of choice of first intention bariatric&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
