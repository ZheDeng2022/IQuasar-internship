  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study, the investigators aim to test the usability and efficacy of the&#xD;
      GaitBetter system for gait rehabilitation after stroke.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of 3 distinct aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Aim 1, the investigators will evaluate clinical acceptance of the GaitBetter solution by&#xD;
      subjects and therapists. To do so, the investigators will run a pilot study to gather&#xD;
      feedback from stakeholders (not reported here).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Aim 2, the investigators will evaluate the efficacy of using the GaitBetter solution to&#xD;
      improve motor-cognitive function of chronic stroke survivors. To do so, the investigators&#xD;
      will run a single-arm, non-randomized study to test the hypothesis that the GaitBetter&#xD;
      training is effective in improving gait and cognition in individuals with chronic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Aim 3, the investigators will explore the efficacy of using the GaitBetter solution for&#xD;
      improving rehabilitation outcomes in sub-acute stroke survivors. To do so, the investigators&#xD;
      will run a randomized, controlled study to evaluate the effects of using the GaitBetter&#xD;
      system in patients with subacute stroke on recovery trajectory.&#xD;
