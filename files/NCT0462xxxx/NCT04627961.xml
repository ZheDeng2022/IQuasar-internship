  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, non-randomised study including patients with EBER positive&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma with recurrent or metastatic disease not amenable to curative&#xD;
      treatment, who have received at least 1 regimen of platinum containing chemotherapy.&#xD;

      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the favourable activity of fluoropyrimidines (5Fluorouracil) which inhibit thymidylate&#xD;
      synthase (TS) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, the investigators hypothesized that TAS-102 may&#xD;
      demonstrate efficacy in NPC through targeting TS as well as an additional mechanism of&#xD;
      incorporating trifluridine triphosphate into DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES OF TRIAL&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the clinical efficacy of TAS-102 in recurrent and metastatic NPC&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the safety and tolerability of TAS-102 in the study population of R/M NPC&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study the pharmacokinetics of TAS-102 in the study population of R/M NPC&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To study potential predictive biomarkers for clinical benefit from TAS-102&#xD;

             consent for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants who are at least 21 years of age on the day of signing informed consent&#xD;
             with histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of non-keratinizing&#xD;
             nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) that has recurred at loco regional and/or distant sites&#xD;
             will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. A WOCBP who has a positive urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to&#xD;
             randomization/allocation (see Appendix 3). If the urine test is positive or cannot be&#xD;

&#xD;
        Note: In the event that 72 hours have elapsed between the screening pregnancy test and the&#xD;
        first dose of study treatment, another pregnancy test (urine or serum) must be performed&#xD;
