  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seawater is rich in minerals which may help confer good palatability to foods, favouring the&#xD;
      use of smaller amounts of salt, a recognized measure of cardiovascular prevention. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to investigate the nutritional properties, sensory characteristics and&#xD;
      metabolic effects of a typical Neapolitan pizza prepared with seawater (SWP) in place of&#xD;
      common salt, in comparison with Standard traditional Pizza (StP). Methods: The nutritional&#xD;
      characteristics and the chemical profile of the SWP and StP were assessed by chemical&#xD;
      analyses and the use of Food Composition Tables. Twelve healthy volunteers will be recruited&#xD;
      for a Randomized Controlled Trial, with the consumption of one StP and one SWP using a&#xD;
      balanced crossover design. The satiating power and palatability of the two pizzas will be&#xD;
      tested by the administration of Visual Analogue Scales. Serum glucose, insulin and sodium&#xD;
      will be measured every 30 minutes and 3-hour urines will be collected after each meal.&#xD;

      The aim of the present study is testing the nutritional properties, the sensory&#xD;
      characteristics and the metabolic effects of a novel recipe of Neapolitan pizza featuring the&#xD;
      substitution of common salt with commercial seawater in such proportion as to reduce the&#xD;
      total amount of sodium chloride in the otherwise traditional dough by approximately 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dough for both StP and SWP will be prepared from 170 g of organic flour (Agguggiaro and&#xD;
      Figna 5 stagioni, 80% type 00/20% type 1, Curatolo, Padova, Italy) with the addition of 110&#xD;
      mL of tap water or commercial seawater respectively. To the StP 0.05 g of brewer's yeast and&#xD;
      5 g of unrefined salt (Sale Vero, Oro di Sicilia Srl, Nubia di Paceno, Trapani, Italy) will&#xD;
      be added, while only 0.02 g of yeast and no salt were added to the SWP. Because salt is known&#xD;
      to reduce the fermentation rate, based on the calculation that the amount of sodium chloride&#xD;
      in SWP would be approximately one half of the StP content, it was decided to use&#xD;
      approximately half the amount of yeast while maintaining constant the fermentation time,&#xD;
      which was 15 h for both doughs. Commercial seawater is supplied by Steralmar Srl (Bisceglie,&#xD;
      BT, Italia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is conceived as a double blind balanced randomised crossover trial, where each&#xD;
      subject acted as his/her own control by consuming the two different pizzas at one week&#xD;
      elapsed time from one another according to a balanced randomised sequence. The trial was&#xD;
      approved by the Ethical Committee of the University of Naples Federico II (n. 403.20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will sign an informed consent to participate and receive detailed written&#xD;
      instructions by a trained researcher about the study protocol: avoid any intense physical&#xD;
      activity and complete the evening meal by 9 pm on the day before the test; have a standard&#xD;
      breakfast (explained in detail) before 8.30 on the morning of the test; drink at least 300 mL&#xD;
      of water between breakfast and the meal test, to guarantee normal hydration, not eating&#xD;
      between breakfast and the meal test to guarantee a standard hunger level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight, height and blood pressure (BP) will be measured just before the test, systolic and&#xD;
      diastolic blood pressure and heart rate will be measured 3 times and the participants will be&#xD;
      requested to void just before being weighted and the urines produced thereafter during the 3&#xD;
      h of the test will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The meals will be consumed in groups of 4 volunteers at a time under standard conditions in&#xD;
      the metabolic kitchen at Federico II University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteers will be requested to drink 300 mL of water during the meal, which will have a&#xD;
      maximum duration of 20 min. An additional volume of 300 mL has to be drunk in the 3 h after&#xD;
      the meal. In both meals, at intervals of 30 min for a total of 3 h, a battery of Visual&#xD;
      Analogue Scales (VAS) will be administered to assess possible differences in the satiating&#xD;
      power of the two pizzas and their sensory characteristics, as described in the dedicated&#xD;
      session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be drawn from an indwelling antecubital venous cannula for the measurement&#xD;
      of glucose, insulin and sodium concentration in the fasting state and every 30 min thereafter&#xD;
      for 3 h after eating was begun and the Area Under the Curve will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volume of the 3 h urine collection will be measured, and the sodium and creatinine&#xD;
      concentrations measured by ISE and by an enzymatic colorimetric method.&#xD;
