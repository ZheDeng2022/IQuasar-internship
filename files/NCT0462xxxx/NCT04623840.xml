  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the persistent inability to attain and maintain a sufficient&#xD;
      erection to permit satisfactory sexual performance. ED, a condition closely related to&#xD;
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, is frequently associated with obesity. The importance&#xD;
      of reducing cardiovascular risk factors remains fundamental to the overall vascular good&#xD;
      health of the man, and that includes sexual vascular health. ED shares similar modifiable&#xD;
      risks factors with coronary artery disease (CAD). Lifestyle modification that targets CAD&#xD;
      risk factors may also lead to improvement in ED.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty obese men with ED complaints will be divided to two groups, exercised and non-exercised&#xD;
      groups; n= 30 patients in every group. Both groups will receive five milligrams of tadalafil&#xD;
      one time per day for 8 weeks but the exercised group only will receive - in addition to&#xD;
      tadalafil - combined continuous and interval aerobic training, 3 session weekly for 8 weeks&#xD;
      after detecting their target heart rate via the cardiopulmonary exercise test.&#xD;
