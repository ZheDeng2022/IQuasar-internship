  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cryoglobulinemia vasculitis (CV) is a systemic immune-mediated small vessel vasculitis.&#xD;
      Rituximab proved effective on main vasculitis signs, with a complete clinical response of&#xD;
      65%. However, CV relapse is noted in up to 40% of patients. Following rituximab, serum Blys&#xD;
      concentration significantly increased and may favor relapses. Tribeca is a multicentre&#xD;
      randomized controled study comparing safety and efficacy of belimumab to placebo in non&#xD;
      infectious cryoglobulinemia vasculitis.&#xD;

    <description>The complete clinical response is defined by the remission of all affected organs involved at baseline and the absence of clinical relapse.&#xD;
The skin and articular remissions are evaluated clinically.&#xD;
Renal remission is evaluated biologically (proteinuria &lt;0.5g/24h or proteinuria/creatinuria &lt;50 mg/mmol, ).&#xD;
Neurological remission is evaluated clinically and electrophysiologically.&#xD;
Digestive remission is evaluated clinically, by endoscopy and/or by Xray. Complete remission of all baseline abnormalities is required to define digestive remission.&#xD;
Cardiac remission is evaluated clinically (improvement of chest pains and other cardiac events), electrically (disappearance of abnormalities indicating acute myocardial suffering on EKG) and biologically (normalization of muscular enzymes). Complete remission of all baseline abnormalities is required to define cardiac remission.</description>

    <description>Quality of life score SF-36. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability. To calculate the scores it is necessary to purchase special software for the commercial version, but no special software is needed for the RAND-36 version. Pricing depends on the number of scores that the researcher needs to calculate.&#xD;
