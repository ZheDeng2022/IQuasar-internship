      This study seeks to determine if watching a preoperative educational video influences opioid&#xD;
      consumption and proper disposal following elective hand surgery. Patients undergoing elective&#xD;
      hand surgery are randomized to either watch a preoperative educational video or not. Patients&#xD;
      are asked to record their pain medication usage postoperatively, as well as their daily pain&#xD;
      levels and satisfaction with their pain control after surgery.&#xD;

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Average daily Visual Analog Scaled pain score recorded after surgery. Pain will be recorded on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain possible).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>7-10 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction with pain control after surgery. Satisfaction will be measured on a Likert scale with the following question: &quot;How satisfied have you been with your pain management after surgery?&quot;. Answer choices are: Very unsatisfied, unsatisfied, neutral, satisfied, very satisfied.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proper disposal</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported proper disposal of unused opioids after surgery. Patients will be asked in a postoperative survey if they used all of the pills in their initial postoperative prescription. If they did not, they will be asked &quot;Have you disposed of your unused opioids via a DEA-approved method (I.e. at a pharmacy or other safe location?)&quot; as a yes or no question.</description>
