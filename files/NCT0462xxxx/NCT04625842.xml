      In order to improve quality of care at the department, the investigators will perform a focus&#xD;
      group interview study with patients and family members. They will perform 6 (3 in the French,&#xD;
      and 3 in the Dutch language) focus group interviews with patients and 6 (3 in the French, and&#xD;

      In order to improve quality of care at the department, the investigators will perform a focus&#xD;
      group interview study with patients and family members. They will perform 6 (3 in the French,&#xD;
      and 3 in the Dutch language) focus group interviews with patients and 6 (3 in the French, and&#xD;
      3 in the Dutch language) with family members. Following research questions will be answered:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What elements of care (ie infrastructure, interpersonal contact, information,&#xD;
           communication) are good to the opinion of patients and family members?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What elements of care can be improved?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What are priorities in improvement of the care for patients and families?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What actions could possibly be taken in order to improve the care for future patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the radiotherapy ward exists of 3 clusters, one per type of treatment conducted, the&#xD;
      investigators will perform 6 focus group interviews with patients (3 in the French, and 3 in&#xD;
      the Dutch language) and 6 focus group interviews with family members (3 in the French, and 3&#xD;
      in the Dutch language).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will collect sex, main diagnosis (of patients), age and nationality of all&#xD;
      participants at the beginning of each focus group interview. They will transcribe all&#xD;
      interviews verbatim and analyze them in Nvivo software as provided by the VUB. Participant&#xD;
      characteristics will be analyzed by descriptive statistics.&#xD;
