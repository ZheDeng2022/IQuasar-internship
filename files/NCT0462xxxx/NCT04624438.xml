  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to examine the effects of 6-week unilateral isometric&#xD;
      training interventions over quadriceps femoris on maximal strength and RFD-SF parameters and&#xD;
      cortical excitability. Isometric strength training involved either electromyostimulation,&#xD;
      voluntary activation, or the combination of both. The second aim is to investigate the&#xD;
      potential cross-over effect on a non-trained leg.&#xD;

      A longitudinal pre-post design with random assignment of the participants to one of three&#xD;
      experimental groups or the control group was used. Quadriceps femoris (QF) function and&#xD;
      cortical excitability were assessed on four occasions: prior to the intervention (pre-test),&#xD;
      after 3 weeks of training (served for the adjustment of exercise intensity), after 6 weeks of&#xD;
      training (post-test), and three weeks after the competition of training intervention&#xD;
      (detraining) (Figure 1). Isometric strength training involves activation of QF applying EMS,&#xD;
      VOLUNTARY, or the combination of both EMS and VOLUNTARY (COMBINED). The pre-test also served&#xD;
      to familiarize participants with the training protocols and to determine the intensity of EMS&#xD;
      needed to achieve 60%MVC. Quadriceps femoris (QF) function was assessed by MVC and RFD-SF.&#xD;
      Cortical excitability was assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation applied over the M1&#xD;
      region. Prior to the pretest, body mass and percent of body fat were assessed using a&#xD;
      bioelectric impedance method (In Body 720; USA) and body height with a standard stadiometer.&#xD;
      After the pretest, the participants were randomly assigned to either one of the experimental&#xD;
      groups (EMS, VOLUNTARY, or COMBINED) and the control group (CONTROL). Experimental groups&#xD;
      performed unilateral isometric strength training three times per week for 6 weeks. All&#xD;
      participants were advised to refrain from all resistance training targeting the legs between&#xD;
      pre-test and post-test.&#xD;

    <description>Each training session (18 in total) consisted of forty 4-s contractions separated by 20 s inter-contraction intervals. The exercise intensity was close-to-identical among the sessions (60 %MVC). The force intensity was determined individually during pretest where EMS was delivered at maximal tolerable dose. Electrical stimulation was 6.25-second long and was followed by a rest period of 20-second (duty cycle 15%). Stimulation characteristics were selected among the &quot;Compex&quot; commercially available strength programs. The stimulation intensity was monitored on-line and determined by the subject at the start of each EMS session according to his/her pain threshold to produce a force corresponding to at least 60% of the pretest MVC score.</description>

    <description>Each training session (18 in total) consisted of forty 4-s contractions separated by 20 s inter-contraction intervals. The exercise intensity was close-to-identical among the sessions (60 %MVC). Participants were required to reach the proscribed force level only through voluntary activation of QF. To attain the same contraction/rest ratio as in EMS, automated audible signals were delivered in accordance with the contraction-rest pattern produced by the muscle stimulation device. To ensure participants produced 60% of individual MVC during each contraction the force level was measured with a force transducer and real-time feedback was provided on a computer screen.</description>

The exercise intensity was close-to-identical among the sessions (60 %MVC). The proscribed force level was reached by the simultaneous action of EMS and VOLUNTARY. Each contraction was 6.25-second long and was followed by a rest period of 20-second (duty cycle 15%). Electrical stimulation corresponded to 30% of MVC, while the remaining 30% was achieved through voluntary muscle activation.
