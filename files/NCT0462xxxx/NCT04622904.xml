      The aim of this study will be to investigate the effect of a combination of intravenous&#xD;
      infusions of lidocaine and magnesium versus a combination of intravenous infusions of&#xD;
      lidocaine and ketamine versus an intravenous infusion of lidocaine alone on recovery profile,&#xD;
      quality of recovery and postoperative pain after elective gynecological surgery&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inadequately treated postoperative pain after gynecological surgery may untowardly affect&#xD;
      early recovery and also lead to the development of chronic pain. Opioid-based analgesia is&#xD;
      associated with side-effects, such as respiratory depression, postoperative nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting and occasional induction of tolerance and hyperalgesia. Therefore, in recent years&#xD;
      research has focused on the quest for non-opioid-based regimens for perioperative analgesia&#xD;
      in the context of multimodal analgesic techniques. These techniques have been shown to&#xD;
      possess significant advantages, such as allowing earlier mobilization after surgery, early&#xD;
      resumption of enteral feeding and reduced hospital length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the intraoperative intravenous injection of lidocaine has been reported to&#xD;
      improve postoperative pain control, reduce opioid consumption and improve the quality of&#xD;
      postoperative functional recovery after general anesthesia. Intraoperative infusions of&#xD;
      ketamine (an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor inhibitor) have also been correlated with reduced&#xD;
      pain scores and a decrease in analgesic requirements postoperatively. Lastly, magnesium&#xD;
      (acting through modification of the action of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors) is another&#xD;
      agent, which, as an adjuvant to general anesthesia may improve postoperative recovery and&#xD;
      pain control through inhibition of cardiovascular response, reduction in general anesthetic&#xD;
      needs, enhanced analgesia and anti-inflammatory response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is insufficient data in literature investigating the effect of combinations of these&#xD;
      agents intraoperatively. It would be of interest to demonstrate whether the administration of&#xD;
      combinations of infusions can lead to enhanced postoperative recovery, an improved&#xD;
      opioid-sparing effect and a decrease in the development of chronic pain as compared to the&#xD;
      administration of a sole agent alone. Therefore, the aim of this study will be to investigate&#xD;
      the effect of a combination of intravenous infusions of lidocaine and magnesium versus a&#xD;
      combination of intravenous infusions of lidocaine and ketamine versus an intravenous infusion&#xD;
      of lidocaine alone on recovery profile, quality of recovery and postoperative pain after&#xD;
      elective gynecological surgery.&#xD;
