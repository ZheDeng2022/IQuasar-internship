  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 28% of undergraduate college students report a suspected history of traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury. Following traumatic brain injury, college students fail and repeat more courses and&#xD;
      have lower grade point averages. Further complicating this problem may be the fact that&#xD;
      college students lack knowledge of traumatic brain injury definition, its associated&#xD;
      symptoms, and individuals involved in post-injury management. In this project, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to compare the use of an established treatment model (i.e., the Dynamic&#xD;
      Coaching Model) to a novel protocol (i.e., the Apprenticeship Approach) that includes&#xD;
      explicit instruction about traumatic brain injury in college students with this population.&#xD;
      The investigators will use a group comparison design to examine the efficacy of this&#xD;
      instructional component. This work incorporates findings from educational psychology and&#xD;
      speech-language pathology (e.g., the included instructional materials adhere to the&#xD;
      principles of adult learning). As such, this work will advance the field's basic&#xD;
      understanding of currently recommended treatment components and will systematically examine&#xD;
      the effects of incorporating explicit instruction into an existing treatment model.&#xD;

    <description>The Dynamic Coaching Model is an established treatment approach that entails training college students with executive function impairments (e.g., those with a history of traumatic brain injury) to rely on their own executive functions in order to problem solve and reason in real-life situations requiring them to do so (e.g., taking college classes).</description>
