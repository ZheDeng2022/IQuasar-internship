  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Small connected devices monitoring vital signs do not exist in children although they could&#xD;
      be very useful to monitor patients once they have left the pediatric intensive care unit&#xD;
      (PICU) in order to early identify patients at risk of PICU readmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to assess the accuracy of a connected thoracic patch&#xD;
      (VTPatch) for the continuous monitoring of vital signs in PICU patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This monitoring device will be used to monitor children in PICU for 24 hours and results will&#xD;
      be compared to the standard of care in the unit that is the Philips monitoring system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will assess the accuracy of the device for the monitoring of 4 vital signs&#xD;
      (SpO2, heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature) and perform exploratory assessment of&#xD;
      three additional parameters (EKG, blood pressure and movement capture).&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients readmission to PICU is a major point of concern for physician because, although&#xD;
      being a rare event, it has been strongly associated to more morbidity and death. Patients&#xD;
      monitoring once they have left the PICU is drastically modified and small connected devices&#xD;
      could be an option to early identify patients at risk of PICU readmission. Such devices have&#xD;
      been manufactured for the monitoring of adults but they do not exist for children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess the accuracy of VTPatch versus standard of care (Philips monitoring system) for the&#xD;
      continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation (SpO2) in PICU patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess the accuracy of VTPatch monitoring for 3 additional physiologic parameters (heart rate&#xD;
      (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and temperature). Exploratory assessment of blood pressure (BP)&#xD;
      monitoring, ECG signal and movement capture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective validation study of VTPatch device for the monitoring of 4 physiologic parameters&#xD;
      and exploratory assessment of three additional parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed in two successive phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Run-in phase: testing the device on four children to assess the feasibility of the&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Main study: validation phase of the device on 10 children per age groups to assess its&#xD;
           accuracy. The patients of the run-in phase will be included in the main study if no&#xD;
           modification of the protocol is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5 physiologic parameters (HR, SpO2, RR, temperature and BP) and ECG will be&#xD;
           prospectively recorded during a 24 hours period with VTPatch and the regular monitoring&#xD;
           system implemented in the unit High-resolution database that will be the Gold standard&#xD;
           for evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating center: 1 center (St. Justine's Hospital).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives: This validation step of the collected data is necessary to validate that&#xD;
      VTPatch is suitable for pediatric patient monitoring.&#xD;
