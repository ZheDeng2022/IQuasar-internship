  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A fibula free flap can be used for the reconstruction of a mandible or a maxillar when the&#xD;
      lack of bonne exceeds 3cm. This flap is made of the fibula bone, some muscle around, the&#xD;
      fibular vascular pedicle and a skin paddle to reconstruct the gum. Once this flap has been&#xD;
      taken and transposed on the face, the leg is closed with a split thickness skin graft to&#xD;
      replace the skin paddle. But the healing on this site is often a problem: this is partly due&#xD;
      to the high rate of early graft's loss due to local devascularization (3 to 55% of loss). The&#xD;
      skin grafting is generally improved by the application of a dressing sewn and left in place&#xD;
      during 5 to 7 days postoperative (standard method). This study will evaluate the efficiency&#xD;
      of a portative miniature negative pressure dressing system named PICO® on the split-thickness&#xD;
      skin graft of fibula free flap donor sites, compared to the standard method. A prospective&#xD;
      randomized evaluation will be done, comparing the PICO® to a conventional dressing. The main&#xD;
      aim of the study is the evaluation of the impact of this portative system on the healing of&#xD;
      the skin grafted donor site, in terms of rate of skin take, time of healing, complications&#xD;
      and medical costs. The patients will be seen preoperatively to decide on their inclusion in&#xD;
      the protocol. They will be reviewed at day 10 to evaluate the engraftment and possible local&#xD;
      complications on the donor site. They will then be reviewed at day 20 and day 30 and until&#xD;
      complete healing. The follow up will be of 12 months maximum. A medical cost evaluation will&#xD;
      be done comparing the costs generated by the care on the donor site in the 2 groups.&#xD;
