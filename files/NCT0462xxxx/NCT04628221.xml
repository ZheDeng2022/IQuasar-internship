    <time_frame>Post-procedure, 1-day, 7-day and 30-day follow up visits</time_frame>
    <description>The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) is a continuous scale comprised of a line, with an eleven point numeric range (0 to 10) anchored by 2 verbal descriptors, one for each symptom extreme. The 0 mark corresponds to 'no pain', while the 10 mark corresponds to 'worse pain possible'. Therefore, higher scores indicate greater pain intensity. At all follow-up time points (post-procedure, Day 1, Day 7 , and Day 30), average was taken compared to baseline (Pre-Procedure).</description>

        <description>The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) is a continuous scale comprised of a line, with an eleven point numeric range (0 to 10) anchored by 2 verbal descriptors, one for each symptom extreme. The 0 mark corresponds to 'no pain', while the 10 mark corresponds to 'worse pain possible'. Therefore, higher scores indicate greater pain intensity. At all follow-up time points (post-procedure, Day 1, Day 7 , and Day 30), average was taken compared to baseline (Pre-Procedure).</description>
