  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to see how safe and effective the use of the study drug&#xD;
      Ado-trastuzumab (T) emtansine (DM1), T-DM1, and standard of care chemoradiation are when used&#xD;
      together in treating HER2-positive salivary gland cancer. It will also examine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of study drug Ado-trastuzumab (T) emtansine (DM1) on cancer recurrence.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, open-label, non-randomized, multi-institutional study investigating&#xD;
      postoperative or adjuvant human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2)-directed therapy with&#xD;
      adjuvant ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in HER2-positive salivary gland carcinomas (SGC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Studying the use of T-DM1 in combination with radiation and chemotherapy; and the use of&#xD;
           maintenance T-DM1 alone for up to a year after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluating the effectiveness, safety, and toxicity of T-DM1&#xD;
&#xD;
      T-DM1 is a specialized antibody targeting HER-2 (a protein that is expressed in some breast&#xD;
      and salivary gland cancers). The drug is a HER-2 antibody that is bound to a chemotherapy&#xD;
      agent (DM1) and delivered intravenously. T-DM1 then binds cancer cells that express HER-2 and&#xD;
      is taken up into the cell to allow DM1 to kill cancer cells in a more targeted way. This&#xD;
      allows the use of a targeted treatment along with chemoradiation to treat HER-2 expressing&#xD;
      salivary cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved T-DM1 for HER2-positive salivary&#xD;
      gland cancer but it has been approved for other uses (for breast cancers that express HER2&#xD;
      protein).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include: screening for eligibility and study treatment&#xD;
      including evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study involves radiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy given after&#xD;
      surgery for up to 1-year, and participants will be followed for 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 55 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genentech is supporting this research study by providing the research study drug, T-DM1.&#xD;
