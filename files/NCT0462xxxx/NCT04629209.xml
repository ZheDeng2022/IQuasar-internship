  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, two arm study. The trial will enroll a total of up to 36 patients. Arm&#xD;
      A will enroll up to a total of 6 evaluable patients and Arm B will enroll up to a total of 30&#xD;
      evaluable patients. Arm A will explore the intra-tumoral ONC201 concentrations and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic activity in adult EGFR-low glioblastoma patients. Arm B will determine the&#xD;
      radiographic efficacy of ONC201 in adult recurrent EGFR-low glioblastoma patients. All&#xD;
      patients will be treated with oral ONC201 (625 mg) twice weekly, 2 consecutive days on and 5&#xD;
      days off per week schedule.&#xD;
