      The main purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of whey protein with&#xD;
      collagen hydrolyzed following resistance training on body composition, muscular strength,&#xD;
      functional capacity, and plasma-metabolism biomarkers in older women&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      his two-arm randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design was carried out over a period&#xD;
      of 17 weeks. At the beginning of the experiment, two weeks and at the end three weeks were&#xD;
      allocated for evaluations consisting of anthropometric (weeks 2 and 16), body composition&#xD;
      (weeks 2 and 16), one repetition maximum tests (weeks 1 and 15), functional capacity tests&#xD;
      (weeks 1 and 15), blood samples (weeks 2 and 16), magnetic ressonance imaging (weeks 2 and&#xD;
      17) and dietary intake measurements (weeks 1 and 15). The anthropometric, body composition,&#xD;
      blood samples and dietary intake measurements were carried out in a temperature-controlled&#xD;
      room (22-24 °C), and the RT sessions were conducted at the university training facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment was carried out through newspapers, radio advertising, and home delivery of&#xD;
      leaflets in the central area and residential neighborhoods. All participants completed health&#xD;
      history and physical activity questionnaires and were included in the study if they met the&#xD;
      following inclusion criteria: 60 years old or more, physically independent, free from cardiac&#xD;
      or orthopedic dysfunction that would prevent them from performing the prescribed exercise or&#xD;
      exercise testing associated with the study, not receiving hormonal replacement therapy, and&#xD;
      completed a previous 8-week RT programParticipants underwent a diagnostic graded exercise&#xD;
      stress test with a 12-lead electrocardiogram reviewed by a cardiologist and were released&#xD;
      with no restrictions for participation in this investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blinded researcher was responsible for generating random numbers for participant&#xD;
      allocation. Both groups were submitted to the same RT program and all participants completed&#xD;
      the experiment. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants after a detailed&#xD;
      description of investigation procedures was provided. This investigation was conducted&#xD;
      according to the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local University Ethics&#xD;
      Committee The Shapiro Wilk test will be used to test data distribution. Data will be&#xD;
      presented as means, standard deviation, and z-score. The student's independent t-test and&#xD;
      chi-square test were will be used to compare groups regarding the general characteristics and&#xD;
      clinical/medical history (categorical variables). Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for&#xD;
      repeated measures will be used to assess between group comparisons. The effect size (ES) will&#xD;
      be calculated to verify the magnitude of the differences by Cohen's d, where an ES of&#xD;
      0.20-0.49 will be considered as small, 0.50-0.79 as moderate, and ≥ 0.80 as large(41). The&#xD;
      Z-score of the percentage changes (from pre- to post-training) of the raw data for each&#xD;
      parameter will be calculated, as well as a total Z-score, derived from all the components. To&#xD;
      verify the differences between groups in total Z-scores, an independent T test will be also&#xD;
      applied. For all statistical analyses, significance was accepted at P &lt; 0.05. The data will&#xD;
      be analyzed using SPSS software version 20.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).&#xD;

    <description>Whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (Lunar Prodigy) was used to assess lean mass and fat mass and its segments.

    <description>Maximal dynamic strength was evaluated using the 1RM test assessed on chest press, knee extension, and preacher curl exercises performed in this exact order. Testing for each exercise was preceded by a warm-up set (6-10 repetitions), with approximately 50% of the estimated load used in the first attempt of the 1RM. This warm-up was also used to familiarize the subjects with the testing equipment and lifting technique. The testing procedure was initiated 2 minutes after the warm-up. The subjects were instructed to try to accomplish two repetitions with the imposed load in three attempts in both exercises. The rest period was 3 to 5 min between each attempt, and 5 min between exercises. The 1RM was recorded as the last resistance lifted in which the subject was able to complete only one single maximal execution</description>
