  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study, A3921210 is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics (PK)&#xD;
      of tofacitinib in pediatric participants with moderately to severely active UC. In the US&#xD;
      patients with prior TNFi failure or intolerance will be enrolled. Outside of the US, TNFi&#xD;
      na√Øve and TNFi experienced patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible participants will initially receive open label tofacitinib at a dose expected to&#xD;
      produce equivalent systemic exposure to that observed in adults receiving 5 mg BID with the&#xD;
      option for individual dose increase to 10 mg BID adult dose equivalent if dose escalation&#xD;
      criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of tofacitinib based on&#xD;
      remission in pediatric participants with moderately to severely active UC. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint is remission by central read Mayo score following 44 weeks in the maintenance phase.&#xD;
      Remission is defined by a Mayo score of 2 points or lower, with no individual subscore&#xD;
      exceeding 1 point and a rectal bleeding subscore of 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study Design is an open-label Phase 3 study that includes a screening period of up to&#xD;
      4-weeks duration, an 8-week or 16-week induction phase, a 44-week maintenance phase, and a&#xD;
      24-month extension phase for pediatric participants with moderately to severely active UC.&#xD;
      Participants will have a follow-up visit 4 weeks after the last dose of study intervention&#xD;
      and a telephone contact 8 weeks later to assess for any adverse events (AEs)/serious adverse&#xD;
      events (SAEs). The total maximum duration of this study will be up to 180 weeks.&#xD;
