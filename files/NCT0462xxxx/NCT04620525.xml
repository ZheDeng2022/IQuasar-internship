      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis and for 4 in 10 people pain from OA&#xD;
      is not adequately controlled. The pain experience of people suffering from chronic pain&#xD;
      largely depends on their individual perception of pain and on brain functions, in particular&#xD;
      what is called &quot;cognitive&quot; functions. Cognitive functions include memory, attention,&#xD;
      organisation and planning, task initiation, regulation of emotions and reflection of oneself&#xD;
      and are important for everyday tasks, such as following a conversation or a story in a book&#xD;
      or on TV, learning new things, remembering old and new information and making decisions. Good&#xD;
      cognition predicts the risk of developing chronic pain after a painful event, such as&#xD;
      surgery. Chronic pain patients report numerous cognitive impairments, with attention and&#xD;
      memory being the two most prominent that can persist even after the original cause of pain&#xD;
      has been treated. Little evidence exists regarding the nature and magnitude of these deficits&#xD;
      and their underlying brain and psychological mechanisms in chronic knee OA. The investigators&#xD;
      want to understand which cognitive functions and to what extent are associated with pain in&#xD;
      patients with knee OA.&#xD;

      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis and for 4 in 10 people pain from OA&#xD;
      is not adequately controlled. The pain experience of people suffering from chronic pain&#xD;
      largely depends on their individual perception of pain and on brain functions, in particular&#xD;
      what is called &quot;cognitive&quot; functions. Cognitive functions include memory, attention,&#xD;
      organisation and planning, task initiation, regulation of emotions and reflection of oneself&#xD;
      and are important for everyday tasks, such as following a conversation or a story in a book&#xD;
      or on TV, learning new things, remembering old and new information and making decisions. Good&#xD;
      cognition predicts the risk of developing chronic pain after a painful event, such as&#xD;
      surgery. Chronic pain patients report numerous cognitive impairments, with attention and&#xD;
      memory being the two most prominent that can persist even after the original cause of pain&#xD;
      has been treated. Little evidence exists regarding the nature and magnitude of these deficits&#xD;
      and their underlying brain and psychological mechanisms in chronic knee OA. The investigators&#xD;
      want to understand which cognitive functions and to what extent are associated with pain in&#xD;
      patients with knee OA. Identifying specific domains of cognitive function affected by chronic&#xD;
      pain has a clinical utility; specific domains regulate certain aspects of activities of daily&#xD;
      living, such as managing personal finances, grocery shopping, remembering to take medications&#xD;
      and, thus, dealing with pain early in the disease course could prevent subsequent cognitive&#xD;
      loss and long-term pain. To do this the investigators will examine the link between measures&#xD;
      of pain and measures of cognition in people with knee OA. The investigators propose to&#xD;
      measure knee pain, physical function, sleep quality and overall wellbeing with questionnaires&#xD;
      and pain sensitivity measures. The investigators will measure cognition with questionnaires&#xD;
      and computer-based tasks testing aspects of cognitive function, including memory and&#xD;
      attention. The investigators will compare the questionnaire and pain sensitivity measures&#xD;
      with questionnaire and measures of cognitive function in the same participants. The&#xD;
      investigators will include tests of various aspects of a person's memory that will facilitate&#xD;
      the establishment of which aspects are related to chronic pain. The investigators hypothesise&#xD;
      that chronic pain is linked to specific cognitive deficits in patients with knee OA and&#xD;
      managing pain, for example, with mild to moderate targeted exercise and healthy diet, may&#xD;
      limit the risk of memory loss and dementia and, in turn, predict better treatment outcomes.&#xD;

    <measure>Pain sensitivity measures</measure>
    <time_frame>Conducted once, at assessment visit approximately 10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Quantitative sensory testing (QST) will be used to assess pain sensitivity with measures, such as pressure pain threshold (PPT). PPT is a valid measure of tenderness around the knee. QST is used to quantify pain perception and it is an objective measure of peripheral sensitisation (increased tenderness around the knee) and central sensitisation (increased pain perception in areas away from the knee). QST will be used to identify different pain phenotypes among participants and it will enable us to quantify peripheral and central sensitisation components of pain. Pain phenotypes will be then correlated to cognitive measures.</description>

    <description>Quantitative sensory testing (QST) will be used to assess pain sensitivity with measures, such as temporal summation (TS), TS is a measure of central sensitization. QST is used to quantify pain perception and it is an objective measure of peripheral sensitisation (increased tenderness around the knee) and central sensitisation (increased pain perception in areas away from the knee). QST will be used to identify different pain phenotypes among participants and it will enable us to quantify peripheral and central sensitisation components of pain. Pain phenotypes will be then correlated to cognitive measures.</description>

    <description>Quantitative sensory testing (QST) will be used to assess pain sensitivity with measures, such as conditioned pain modulation (CPM). CPM assesses the function of endogenous pain inhibitory pathways. QST is used to quantify pain perception and it is an objective measure of peripheral sensitisation (increased tenderness around the knee) and central sensitisation (increased pain perception in areas away from the knee). QST will be used to identify different pain phenotypes among participants and it will enable us to quantify peripheral and central sensitisation components of pain. Pain phenotypes will be then correlated to cognitive measures.</description>

    <measure>Neuropathic pain quality: PD-Q</measure>
    <time_frame>Conducted once, at assessment visit : approximately 5-10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The PainDETECT Questionnaire (PD-Q) is a self-report questionnaire developed to discriminate between nociceptive and neuropathic pain. It has been further modified (mPDQ) for use among specific pain groups, for example, knee pain. Neuropathic pain symptoms as identified with the mPDQ have been found to correlate with signs of central sensitisation in OA, as identified with QST.</description>
