  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prevalence of functional constipation (FC) was first determined with 15.2% reported. Next, a&#xD;
      16-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted to assess the&#xD;
      improvement in functional constipation among the respective individuals by using synbiotic&#xD;
      supplement. Throughout the intervention, it was reported that significant improvements for&#xD;
      defecation frequency, Bristol Stool Form (BSF) scale, and Patients Assessment of Constipation&#xD;
      Symptoms (PAC-SYM) scores were reported within synbiotic group (p &lt; 0.001). However, no&#xD;
      significant different was reported when compared both groups as placebo group was found to&#xD;
      have significant within-group difference too. Placebo effect was suspected in this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Digestive system disease is the top ten principal causes of morbidity and mortality among&#xD;
      Malaysians whereby functional constipation (FC) is the commonest functional gastrointestinal&#xD;
      disorders (FGIDs) reported. Although numerous treatments are available, but over-the-counter&#xD;
      drugs which have low product safety and possible toxicity were always given as the treatment&#xD;
      option. Synbiotic have been well-studied to improve digestive health includes constipation.&#xD;
      Thus, the objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of FC and to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of synbiotic supplement on improving FC symptoms and contributing factors among&#xD;
      constipated individuals in Serdang, Selangor. This study comprised of two parts which were&#xD;
      screening and intervention part. The prevalence of functional constipation was relatively&#xD;
      high in the study community. Synbiotic supplement was effective in the improvement of&#xD;
      functional constipation symptoms, quality of life, and psychological factors. However, the&#xD;
      positive improvement in placebo group indicated the existence of placebo effects which led to&#xD;
      the improvement in quality of life and changes in psychological factors. Therefore, the&#xD;
      current findings are useful information for future intervention in improving functional&#xD;
      constipation symptoms.&#xD;

    <measure>Stool types - Bristol Stool Form (BSF) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BSF scale was used to characterise human stools to seven classifications using seven pictorial presentation of stool types.Type 1 stool shows the very slow transit time with longest time spent in the colon whereas Type 7 indicates the least time spent in the colon and has fast bowel transit time. Meanwhile, Type 4 is the most ideal stool type optimal colonic transit time.</description>

    <measure>Constipation symptoms - Patients Assessment of Constipation Symptoms (PAC-SYM)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PAC-SYM consists of a total of 12 questions includes abdominal symptoms, rectal symptoms, and stool symptoms. It comprised with a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (Absent) to 4 (Very severe). The values of subscales and total scores for PAC-SYM were then computed as average item response within the scales and for the global score. Lower score obtained indicates less symptom severity.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life - Patients Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life (PAC-QOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life was measured using Patients Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life (PAC-QOL). PAC-QOL consists of a total of 28 questions which was grouped into four domains include physical discomfort, psychological discomfort, worries and concerns, and satisfaction.

Lower score point indicates a better quality of life of the respective participant.</description>

    <measure>Psychological factor - Depression, Anxiety, and Stress scale (DASS)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Psychological factor was measured using Depression, Anxiety, and Stress scale (DASS). DASS was used to self-report the severity of depression, anxiety and stress level. The questionnaire based on 4-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (Did not apply to me at all) to 3 (Applied to me very much, or most of the time). The scores of depression, anxiety, and stress were summated for the relevant items followed by categorised to the severity of the condition. Lower score point indicates a less severity of the respective participant.</description>
