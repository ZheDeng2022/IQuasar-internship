      BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal side effects related to isotretinoin are frequently reported.&#xD;
      This study aimed to investigate the effect of oral isotretinoin treatment on muscle strength.&#xD;
      Our second aim was to evaluate whether there was a correlation between the serum creatine&#xD;
      phosphokinase (CPK) level, a specific marker of muscle breakdown, and muscle strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: This study included 30 patients who presented to our hospital and were started on&#xD;
      oral isotretinoin treatment for acne vulgaris and 30 patients in the control group who were&#xD;
      given local treatment. Age, gender, height and weight of the patients were recorded, and the&#xD;
      body mass index (BMI) was calculated. The hamstring and quadriceps muscle strengths of the&#xD;
      non-dominant side were evaluated in all patients using an isokinetic dynamometer, and the&#xD;
      peak torque (PT) values were recorded. In the isotretinoin group, isokinetic measurements&#xD;
      were performed again in those that completed six-month drug treatment and compared with the&#xD;
      initial PT values.&#xD;
