      The purpose of this study is to establish if concomitant renal and vascularized urinary&#xD;
      bladder allograft transplantation is feasible.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, prospective, single-group unblinded phase I study that will enroll&#xD;
      subjects with chronic kidney disease secondary to bladder dysfunction or bladder absence that&#xD;
      is refractory to medical treatment and requires surgical intervention to prevent long-term&#xD;
      sequelae. The primary inclusion criteria will be patients who are diagnosed with chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease secondary to disorders involving the urinary bladder or absence of a urinary&#xD;
      bladder. Patients exhibiting &quot;hostile bladders&quot; defined as end filling pressure or detrusor&#xD;
      leak point pressure (DLPP) of 40 cm H2O or greater as measured by urodynamic studies or&#xD;
      detrusor overactivity with detrusor sphincter dyssynergia will be included. Candidates for&#xD;
      renal transplantation will be vetted and approved by the Mayo Clinic multidisciplinary&#xD;
      transplant team (MDC). Subjects meeting these primary inclusion criteria can be referred to&#xD;
      the PI, co-investigators, or study coordinator to approach for possible participation in this&#xD;
      research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject still meets all the inclusion and exclusion criteria after the baseline&#xD;
      evaluations are completed, the subject will undergo concomitant renal and vascularized&#xD;
      urinary bladder allograft transplantation.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint will be bladder compliance and/or the end fill pressure at bladder capacity as assessed by standardized urodynamic measures at 12 months and yearly until year 4 Urodynamic measures assessed multiple times in each subject over the follow up period will be modeled with linear mixed effects models. A discrete time relationship will estimate the mean bladder compliance or end fill pressure at 12 months and yearly until year 4. Models will adjust for baseline value, and random intercepts and slopes will be considered using model fit criteria. From this linear mixed effects model, we estimate the expected change from baseline to 12 months (and yearly until year 4), adjusting for baseline value. Results will be reported as estimated 12 month mean with confidence interval.</description>
