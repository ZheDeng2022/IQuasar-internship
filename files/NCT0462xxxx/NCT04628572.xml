  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this non-interventional (retrospective) study is to describe the&#xD;
      general treatment patterns, effectiveness, and safety of ceftazidime-avibactam in real-world&#xD;
      settings in India. Eligible patients would be adults who have been treated with ≥ 48 hours of&#xD;
      ceftazidime-avibactam in routine practice from 01 June 2019 to 01 April 2020. Data of 500&#xD;
      patients will be collected through the abstraction of hospital medical records (electronic)&#xD;
      if available or through the individual patient medical record in case electronic records are&#xD;
      not available.&#xD;
