  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of computer-assisted TBI&#xD;
      (toothbrushing instruction) using a smart toothbrush and smart mirror (STM system) in plaque&#xD;
      control to that of conventional TBI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The STM system comprises a smart mirror, which is integrated into a computer monitor, and a&#xD;
      3D motion-capture device inside of a modified toothbrush holder. The computer program&#xD;
      displays a toothbrushing animation in the mirror. Toothbrush motions detected by sensors&#xD;
      embedded inside the holder are captured and sent to the server for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators evaluated the efficacy of TBI with a STM system by analyzing the reductions&#xD;
      of the modified Quigley-Hein plaque index in&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. st study - 60 volunteers (adults) - The data for which have been published (reference)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. nd study - 42 volunteers (schoolchildren) - manuscript prepared&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. rd study - 60 volunteers (adults and children)&#xD;
&#xD;
      These participants were separated randomly into two groups: conventional TBI (control group)&#xD;
      and STM system TBI (experimental group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The changes in the plaque indexes were recorded immediately, 1 week, 1 month, and 10 months&#xD;
      (1st study only) after TBI.&#xD;

    <description>The effects of smart toothbrush and smart mirror (STM) system TBI and conventional TBI on dental plaque in adults were compared in this study.&#xD;
Plaque examination was scored on the buccal and lingual surface of all teeth. The Turesky Modification of the Quigley-Hein index was scored between 0 (no plaque) and 5 (plaque covering ≥ two-thirds of the tooth crown) The percentages of plaque removal at each surfaces and whole mouth were determined with the formula: percentage plaque reduction = pre-post / pre X100 (pre=prebrushing plaque value; post=postbrushing plaque value).</description>

    <description>The effects of smart toothbrush and smart mirror (STM) system TBI and conventional TBI on dental plaque in schoolchildren were compared in this study.&#xD;
Plaque examination was scored on the buccal and lingual surface of all teeth (if a permanent tooth had not erupted yet, the primary tooth in the corresponding area was tested).&#xD;
