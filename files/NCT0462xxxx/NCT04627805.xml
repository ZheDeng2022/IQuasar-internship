  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of incorporating a&#xD;
      patient-facing reproductive decision support tool, MyPath, into existing clinical pathways in&#xD;
      a SUD treatment program. This study will be conducted virtually in partnership with a single&#xD;
      substance use treatment program within the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Assess the feasibility and acceptability of incorporating a patient-facing&#xD;
      reproductive decision support tool (MyPath) into existing clinical pathways in a substance&#xD;
      use treatment program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Assess preliminary efficacy of MyPath on reproductive health knowledge, self-efficacy,&#xD;
      and decisional conflict as compared to usual care, as well comparisons between receipt of&#xD;
      reproductive health services during the usual care period versus after implementing the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the MyPath tool is acceptable and feasible for&#xD;
      participants and their providers within a SUD treatment program. They also anticipate that&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy data will show a positive correlation between the MyPath intervention&#xD;
      and receipt of reproductive services, as well as increased knowledge and self-efficacy with&#xD;
      decreased decision conflict. This pilot study will lay the groundwork for future larger&#xD;
      trials in order to measure efficacy of this tool in substance use treatment settings.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be completed in four phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 (Preparation): First, a sample of women with SUDs (n=5) will be recruited through a&#xD;
      separate MAT program in the UPMC system to pre-test the surveys for patient participants to&#xD;
      ensure clarity and understandability of these assessments. A sample of substance use&#xD;
      treatment providers (n=3) will also be recruited to pre-test the surveys for provider&#xD;
      participants. To ensure that participants who want contraceptive services can receive them,&#xD;
      the investigators will create a referral pathway that can be used to link participants&#xD;
      interested in receiving reproductive health services to an appropriate provider. Through the&#xD;
      electronic medical record system of UPMC, providers at NATP will be able to place referrals&#xD;
      for reproductive health services for interested participants. Additionally, given the recent&#xD;
      increase in use of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic, participants will have the&#xD;
      option of attending a telemedicine video visit with a family planning provider through UPMC&#xD;
      Magee-Womens Hospital's Family Planning clinic. These various options will allow participants&#xD;
      to choose the route that is easiest for them and therefore will further decrease barriers to&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 (Usual Care): Thirty three women with SUDs will be recruited from the NATP to&#xD;
      evaluate baseline family planning discussions and referrals to women's health providers in&#xD;
      SUD treatment settings. To establish usual care practice patterns, MyPath will not be&#xD;
      administered to this group of participants. Participants will first complete a pre-visit&#xD;
      survey. This will include demographics, substance use history, and current reproductive&#xD;
      health goals, as well as questions about knowledge, self-efficacy, and decision conflict. The&#xD;
      participants will then attend their scheduled visit with the substance use treatment&#xD;
      provider, whether virtual or in-person. Following the provider visit, they will complete the&#xD;
      post-visit survey, which will include the same knowledge, efficacy, and decision conflict&#xD;
      survey questions as the pre-visit survey. Occurrence of reproductive health discussions,&#xD;
      prescriptions or referrals, and satisfaction with reproductive health services will be&#xD;
      measured following the visit as well. All surveys will be administered online through REDCap.&#xD;
      Patient participants will be compensated for their time with a gift card after they complete&#xD;
      the post-visit survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 (MyPath Pilot): Following completion of the usual care arm, a second group of 33&#xD;
      women with SUDs will be recruited from the NATP to participate in the MyPath intervention&#xD;
      arm. Participants will complete the same pre-visit survey as the usual care group. In&#xD;
      addition, they will be provided a website link to navigate through the online MyPath tool.&#xD;
      Following completion of MyPath, participants will receive a summary page (see Appendix A for&#xD;
      a sample summary) that they will be encouraged to share with their substance use treatment&#xD;
      provider at their next scheduled visit, whether virtual or in-person. After the visit, they&#xD;
      will complete the post-visit survey. In addition to satisfaction with reproductive health&#xD;
      services, the intervention group will be asked specific questions about their perception of&#xD;
      the MyPath tool. All surveys will be administered online through REDCap. Patient participants&#xD;
      will be compensated for their time with a gift card after they complete the post-visit&#xD;
      survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 4 (Provider Assessment): Following study completion for patient participants, provider&#xD;
      participants will be asked to complete an exit survey to assess feasibility of incorporating&#xD;
      MyPath into their clinical work flow and their comfort with reproductive counseling and&#xD;
      referring. This will be an anonymous survey administered online and will be sent to all&#xD;
      providers identified as engaging with at least one patient participant during the MyPath&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 5 (Follow-up): Three months following study completion, a chart review will be&#xD;
      performed for each patient participant through UPMC's electronic medical record. This will&#xD;
      allow for the collection of information for completion of placed referrals and receipt of&#xD;
      desired reproductive services.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>MyPath tool</intervention_name>
    <description>MyPath is a reproductive decision support tool that utilizes a patient-centered approach to help women frame their reproductive decisions in the context of their goals, preferences, and health needs. This tool was developed by Dr. Lisa Callegari with funding from the Veterans Administration (VA) Health Services Research &amp; Development to be used in primary care settings with women veterans. It is conceptually grounded in Self-Determination Theory, which postulates that health care that meets patients' psychological needs in three key domains - autonomy, competence, and relatedness - will result in improved health behaviors and health outcomes. This is particularly relevant in reproductive health care, given the highly individualized and personal nature of these decisions, and the importance of centering a woman's aspirations and goals in her health care decision making.</description>
