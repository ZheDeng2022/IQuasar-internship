  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Variation of morphine requirements are seen considerably. Studies showed that&#xD;
      pharmacogenetics (PGx) could possibly be used to tailor pain medication according to an&#xD;
      individual's genetic background. While prior studies demonstrated the association of genetic&#xD;
      polymorphism with opioid requirements in various types of surgeries in Asian and European&#xD;
      populations, there are no published data in Middle East populations especially Arabs.&#xD;
      However, in our area we have a lot of theincity that may give us an answer for this research&#xD;
      question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary Objective of this study is to investigate whether the genetic&#xD;
      polymorphism of human μ-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1), ATP binding cassette gene (ABCB1) and&#xD;
      rs2952768 are contributing to the variation of morphine consumption in women undergoing&#xD;
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The secondary objective is to assess the effect of these&#xD;
      genetic polymorphisms on pain score, analgesic dosage requirements, and complications of&#xD;
      morphine use in these patients within the first 24 hours.&#xD;

      morphine use in these patients within the first 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a pilot prospective cohort study to be conducted at Al-Wakrah Hospital, HMC&#xD;
      after receiving IRB approval from MRC. The aim is to recruit 100 adult female Arab patients&#xD;
      with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status of I or II in whom planned&#xD;
      postoperative pain management by morphine will be requested after laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecyctectomy Baseline demographic information will be collected at baseline along with 4ml&#xD;
      blood sample for genotyping. Morphine will be administered repeatedly for postoperative pain&#xD;
      relief and the total dose administered within the first 24 hours will be collected. The&#xD;
      analgesic effect will be evaluated using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Multiple linear&#xD;
      regression will be used to evaluate the association of the genetic variant groups with the&#xD;
      morphine dose and the pain score after adjusting for different confounders. Logistic&#xD;
      regression will be used to evaluate the association of side effect of vomiting and&#xD;
      respiratory depression with the genetic variants. Baseline characteristic values will be&#xD;
      reported as mean ± SD for continuous variables or frequency and percentage for categorical&#xD;
      variables. A priori P value of ≤ 0.05 will be considered significant. All analyses will be&#xD;
      done using the Statistical version 25 of SPSS software.&#xD;

        After the approval of the our institutional review board committee IRB at HAMAD MEDICAL&#xD;
        CORPORATION (HMC), Doha, Qatar, and written, informed consent, 100 adult female patients&#xD;
        with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status of I or II in whom planned&#xD;
        postoperative pain management by morphine will be requested after laparoscopic&#xD;
        cholecystectomy can will be included in this study; at the Wakrah Hospital, HMC. We planned&#xD;
        to study 300 patients. If a genetic abnormality was found in 15% of patients and the&#xD;
        average total morphine use in this subgroup was 40% lower than in the remainder of the&#xD;
        patients, then there was 80% chance that a t test comparing average log-total morphine&#xD;
        would be significant at P ≤ 0.05.&#xD;
