      Background: shoulder-hand syndrome is considered a significant reason for the reduction of&#xD;
      upper limb functions after stroke. Purpose: To investigate the influence of Myofascial&#xD;
      Trigger Points (MTrPs) release and shockwave therapy on pain and functions of the upper&#xD;
      extremity in stroke patients with diabetic neuropathy.&#xD;

      Methods: two equal groups of thirty stroke patients, divided into, study group: which treated&#xD;
      with MTrPs release combined with shockwave therapy and conventional program, while control&#xD;
      group: treated with a conventional selected exercise program.&#xD;
