    <textblock>
      To date, no consensus exists on which anterior surgical technique is more cost-effective to&#xD;
      treat cervical degenerative disc disease (CDDD). The most commonly used surgical treatment&#xD;
      for patients with single- or multilevel symptomatic CDDD is anterior cervical discectomy with&#xD;
      fusion (ACDF). However, new complaints of radiculopathy and/or myelopathy commonly develop at&#xD;
      adjacent levels, also known as clinical adjacent segment pathology (CASP). It remains unknown&#xD;
      to what extent kinematics, surgery-induced fusion and natural history of disease play a role&#xD;
      in its development. Anterior cervical discectomy with arthroplasty (ACDA) is thought to&#xD;
      reduce the incidence of CASP by preserving motion in the operated segment. ACDA is often&#xD;
      discouraged as the implant costs are higher whilst the clinical outcomes are similar to ACDF.&#xD;
      However, preventing CASP might be a reason for ACDA to be a more cost-effective technique in&#xD;
      the long-term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized controlled trial patients will be randomized to receive ACDF or ACDA in a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio. Adult patients with single- or multi-level CDDD and symptoms of radiculopathy&#xD;
      and/or myelopathy will be included. The primary outcome is cost-effectiveness and&#xD;
      cost-utility of both techniques from a societal perspective. Secondary objectives are the&#xD;
      differences in clinical and radiological outcomes between the two techniques, as well as the&#xD;
      qualitative process surrounding anterior decompression surgery. All outcomes will be measured&#xD;
      at baseline and every 6 months till 4 years postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High quality evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of both ACDA and ACDF is lacking, to&#xD;
      date no prospective trials from a societal perspective exist. Considering the ageing of the&#xD;
      population and the rising healthcare costs, the need for a solid clinical cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      trial addressing this question is high.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cervical degenerative disc disease (CDDD) is the degeneration of a cervical intervertebral&#xD;
      disc and/or the adjoining vertebral bodies, resulting in clinical symptoms of cervical&#xD;
      radiculopathy, myelopathy, myeloradiculopathy, and axial pain. The incidence of degenerative&#xD;
      pathologies is significantly increasing as the population of elderly is rising. Currently,&#xD;
      generalized spinal disc degeneration occurs in more than 90% of adults past the 5th decade of&#xD;
      life.This age group now represents 32.8% of the population in Europe and is projected to&#xD;
      reach 40.6% by 2050. In the next 20 years a significant increase in anterior cervical&#xD;
      decompression surgeries is predicted in those aged 45-54, mainly affecting the working&#xD;
      population. Complaints of radiculopathy and/or myelopathy lead to restrictions in daily life&#xD;
      and loss of professional capability, resulting in absenteeism. Societal healthcare costs are&#xD;
      therefore significantly affected by CDDD. The healthcare costs are driven up further when&#xD;
      patients require surgical treatment, in combination with associated hospitalization and&#xD;
      rehabilitation. To date, no consensus exists on which anterior surgical technique is more&#xD;
      cost-effective to treat CDDD with radiculopathy and/or myelopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most common procedures for treating patients with single- or multilevel CDDD is&#xD;
      anterior cervical discectomy with fusion (ACDF). ACDF results in fusion in 95-100%. The&#xD;
      primary goal of ACD(F) is the relief of symptoms of radiculopathy and/or myelopathy through&#xD;
      decompression of neural structures. Fusion in itself is not a requisite to reach this goal.&#xD;
      In our center, ACDF with stand-alone cages is the standard procedure for CDDD.&#xD;
      Plate-constructs are only used on indication. A common concern regarding ACDF with&#xD;
      stand-alone cages is the occurrence of cage subsidence. In our retrospective cohort of 673&#xD;
      patients, only 1 patient required additional surgery due to subsidence (0.15%) [unpublished&#xD;
      data]. Axial pain alone is not considered an indication for surgical treatment. Good&#xD;
      short-term clinical results are achieved for both radiculopathy and myelopathy. Clinical&#xD;
      results are independent from the technique used, and independent from occurrence of fusion.&#xD;
      However, patient-reported satisfaction gradually decreases in the years following surgery.&#xD;
      This is thought to be the consequence of the development of new complaints due to&#xD;
      degenerative changes at a segment adjacent to the site of the index surgery, also known as&#xD;
      adjacent segment pathology (ASP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent consensus proposes a distinct definition of radiologic adjacent segment pathology&#xD;
      (RASP) and clinical adjacent segment pathology (CASP). CASP occurs at an estimated cumulative&#xD;
      rate of 1.6% to 4.2% per year after ACDF, however, a wide variety in incidence is reported in&#xD;
      literature. About 50-75% of the patients that develop CASP require additional adjacent&#xD;
      segment surgery. In our retrospective cohort, we observed a rate of 2.1% CASP per year, with&#xD;
      an additional adjacent segment surgery rate of 1.5% per year. Moreover, we found that half of&#xD;
      these patients undergo additional surgery for CASP within 2.5 years, which suggests a peak&#xD;
      incidence in the first years following index surgery. The underlying mechanism of ASP remains&#xD;
      a matter of debate. Besides natural degeneration, compensation for the loss of motion in the&#xD;
      fused segment is thought to cause overstraining of the adjacent segments. Altered cervical&#xD;
      sagittal alignment is also thought to be of importance in the accelerated development of&#xD;
      CASP. Higher rates of CASP are observed after ACD, concomitant with an increased segmental&#xD;
      kyphosis at the index level. Unlike ACD, ACDF with plate-constructs restore cervical sagittal&#xD;
      lordosis. However, a higher rate of ASP is observed in those with plate-constructs in&#xD;
      comparison to ACDF with stand-alone cages. The higher rate of ASP after ACDF with&#xD;
      plate-constructs might be explained by strain on the adjacent segments by the plate, or more&#xD;
      extensive surgical preparation for installing the plate increasing the chance on destruction&#xD;
      of the adjacent level. Another contributing factor might be the occurrence of subsidence of&#xD;
      the plate-construct into the adjacent segment. Disc height at the adjacent segments is found&#xD;
      to be significantly decreased in those with plate-constructs, which supports this theory. It&#xD;
      remains unknown to what extent altered cervical motion influences the development of ASP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anterior cervical discectomy with arthroplasty (ACDA) was developed to reduce the incidence&#xD;
      of CASP by preserving motion in the operated segment. Previously conducted research in&#xD;
      patients with radiculopathy and/or myelopathy has shown no significant differences in&#xD;
      clinical or radiological outcomes amongst ACDA and ACD(F). A meta-analysis found better&#xD;
      neurological outcomes in patients with myelopathy after ACDA, in contrast to the pre-existing&#xD;
      notion that ACDA leads to less favorable outcomes in myelopathy due to micro-trauma caused by&#xD;
      preserved mobility. Moreover, additional adjacent segment surgery rates are significantly&#xD;
      lower for ACDA, both for single- and multilevel surgeries. The difference in additional&#xD;
      adjacent segment surgery rates between ACDA and ACDF expands exponentially with a&#xD;
      longer-follow-up time. ACDA is often discouraged as the implant costs are higher than those&#xD;
      for ACDF whilst clinical outcomes are similar. However, preventing new complaints and&#xD;
      additional surgeries due to CASP might be a reason for ACDA to be a more cost-effective&#xD;
      technique in the long-term. A systematic review of economic evaluations in anterior cervical&#xD;
      decompression surgery was conducted by our research group. The majority of studies report&#xD;
      ACDA to be the most cost-effective technique despite higher implant costs. Literature was&#xD;
      however strongly heterogeneous and of low quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, there is increasing evidence suggesting that ACDA might be the more&#xD;
      cost-effective technique because of a reduced risk on CASP and associated additional surgery&#xD;
      rates, compared to ACD(F). High quality evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of both&#xD;
      ACDA and ACDF is lacking, especially in Europe. Therefore, the need for a solid clinical&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness trial addressing this question is high.&#xD;

    <description>In the CUA, the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) will be expressed as the incremental costs per QALY.&#xD;
Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) will be determined by Generic Quality of Life assessed based on the EuroQol utility scores (EQ-5D-5L). The EQ-5D-5L essentially consists of 2 pages: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS).&#xD;
The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.</description>
