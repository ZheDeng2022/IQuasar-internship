  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of elderly patients requiring general anesthesia for major surgical procedures is&#xD;
      increasing dramatically. It is estimated that 20% of these patients will develop major&#xD;
      complications after surgery. Monitoring brain oxygen saturation may be helpful in reducing&#xD;
      the postoperative complication rates. A decrease in brain oxygen is a sign that all other&#xD;
      vital organs such as kidneys, heart, liver, and intestines have reduced blood supply and are&#xD;
      starved from oxygen. This happens in 1 out of 5 patients undergoing major complex surgeries.&#xD;
      Brain oxygen saturation monitor at this time is not used routinely during surgery, primarily&#xD;
      due to the added cost, as well as, insufficient evidence that restoring the brain oxygen&#xD;
      saturation to baseline would result in better outcomes. Patients will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      either study or control groups. In the study group, a special algorithm will be used to&#xD;
      restore brain oxygen saturation. In the control group, the brain oxygen saturation will be&#xD;
      monitored continuously, but the monitor screen will be electronically blinded, and standard&#xD;
      clinical care applied. The objective of this study is to see if restoring the brain oxygen&#xD;
      saturation to baseline results in less complication rates after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to reduce the incidence of postoperative morbidity due to end&#xD;
      organ dysfunction after major non-cardiac surgery in elderly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to determine if restoration of rSO2 to baseline levels results in reduced&#xD;
      incidence of major organ morbidity and mortality (MOMM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim is to determine a cost-effectiveness of this monitoring modality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the increase in life expectancy observed in the last decades, the number of aged&#xD;
      patients requiring general anesthesia for major non-cardiac surgery, such as abdominal,&#xD;
      pelvic, and thoracic surgeries has increased dramatically. This patient population is at&#xD;
      increased risk of postoperative complications due to the presence of multiple comorbidities&#xD;
      and reduced physiological reserve. One of the largest prospective studies of over 4000&#xD;
      patients aged 70 years and over undergoing major non-cardiac surgery identified that 68% of&#xD;
      these patients had pre-existing comorbidities. Furthermore, the 30-day postoperative&#xD;
      mortality was 5% and major postoperative complications were present in 20% of patients. The&#xD;
      authors concluded that strategies are needed to reduce complications and mortality in older&#xD;
      surgical patients. The primary goal of hemodynamic management during the surgical procedure&#xD;
      is to ensure adequate perfusion and oxygen delivery to the vital organs. In the last decade,&#xD;
      technological research has expanded the application of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to&#xD;
      allow continuous non-invasive monitoring of cerebral oxygen saturation, providing information&#xD;
      on the real time status on the balance between brain oxygen supply and demand. Furthermore,&#xD;
      NIRS provides extra assurance of the adequacy of global oxygen balance, particularly focusing&#xD;
      on the venous side of the circulation. Moreover several studies have demonstrated that&#xD;
      changes in cerebral tissue oxygenation may correlate with changes in cerebral blood flow when&#xD;
      cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen and arterial blood oxygen content remain constant. With the&#xD;
      current standards of monitoring that primarily focus on the left heart, i.e., oxygen supply,&#xD;
      and not the imbalance between oxygen supply/demand, the vital organ ischemia may go unnoticed&#xD;
      until functional organ damage becomes evident. Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2)&#xD;
      provides a non-invasive alternative of adequacy of systemic oxygen balance that correlates&#xD;
      well with a gold standard of mixed venous oxygen saturation. Cerebral desaturations have been&#xD;
      reported in more than 20% of cases when monitoring regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2)&#xD;
      in elderly patients undergoing non-cardiac abdominal surgery. Low rSO2 values have been&#xD;
      associated with postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), perioperative stroke, increased&#xD;
      incidence of major organ morbidity, and even 30-day and 1-year mortality after cardiac&#xD;
      surgery. Furthermore, low preoperative rSO2 measurements have been associated with higher&#xD;
      risk of postoperative delirium in both cardiac and non-cardiac surgical populations. The&#xD;
      proposed trial will be the first large prospective randomized controlled clinical trial&#xD;
      assessing the effectiveness of rSO2 restoration in reducing postoperative morbidity&#xD;
      associated with end organ dysfunction after major non-cardiac surgery.&#xD;
