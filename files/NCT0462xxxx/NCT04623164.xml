      A randomized controlled clinical trial was done to assess the periodontal status of the&#xD;
      individuals baseline followed by by including chronotherapy with complex phytoadaptogens&#xD;
      (CFA) into the non-surgical periodontal treatment (NSPT). The periodontal parameters were&#xD;
      again assessed after and compared with the control group (participants with healthy&#xD;
      periodontium) and group with non-surgical periodontal treatment (NSPT).&#xD;

      The aim of this study was to increase the effectiveness of treatment and prevention of&#xD;
      chronic generalized periodontitis and increase remission periods by including chronotherapy&#xD;
      with complex phytoadaptogens (CFA) into the non-surgical periodontal treatment (NSPT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Thirty systemically healthy patients, who had generalized chronic periodontitis with&#xD;
      probing pocket depth (PPD) â‰¥5 mm, plaque index score &lt;1,5 and the ability to maintain optimum&#xD;
      oral hygiene after the initial phase of treatment, were included in the present&#xD;
      investigation. Patients were divided into 3 groups: 1 Group - control (10 students with&#xD;
      healthy periodontium); 2 Group - 10 patients receiving standard non-surgical periodontal&#xD;
      treatment (NSPT); 3 Group - CFA application (10 patients receiving NSPT + 28-day&#xD;
      chronotherapy with complex phytoadaptogens (CFA)). Control examinations were carried out in&#xD;
      the following periods: before, after and 6 months after treatment. After each study time&#xD;
      point the patients were able to visit the dental office to assess the periodontal status. The&#xD;
      examination included the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Estberg questionnaire to determine the chronotype once before treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Simplified Oral Hygiene Index John C. Greene Jack R. Vermillion (1964) (OHI-S);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sulcus Bleeding Index Muhleman. H.R (1975) (SBI);&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Periodontal Index Rusell. A.L (1956) (PI);&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Doppler ultrasound. Patients of 2 and 3 groups received oral hygiene instructions&#xD;
           (including brushing technique, the use of interdentally flosses, and/or brushes), NSPT&#xD;
           (mouth scaling and root planing using an ultrasonic scaler UDS-L LED (Woodpecker, China)&#xD;
           and Graceys curettes (Hu Friedy, Chicago, USA)). The treated periodontal pockets were&#xD;
           irrigated with 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate. Patients were given recommendation to&#xD;
           rinse their mouth three times daily for 14 days using 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate&#xD;
           Statistical Analysis: Statistical analyses were performed using Statistica 10,0 software&#xD;
           (&quot;StatSoft, Inc&quot;, Russia). Data were investigated by nonparametric method with&#xD;
           determination of median (Md) and interquantile ranges (25th and 75th percentile) due to&#xD;
           the small number of variants in the sample (Wilcoxon test). Data were compared before,&#xD;
           after and 6 months after treatment. Statistically significant differences in all&#xD;
           statistical tests was set to P&lt;0.05.&#xD;

Index shows severity of gingivitis, the presence of periodontal pockets, tooth mobility and alveolar bone loss. Evaluation of results: 0.1 - 1.5 points - I stage; 1.5 - 4.0 points - stage II; 4.0 - 8.0 points - stage III.</description>

Index is used for assessment of gingival bleeding. Evaluation of results: score 0 - gingival of normal texture and color, no bleeding; score 1 - gingival apparently normal, bleeding on probing; score 2 - bleeding on probing, change in color, no oedema; score 3 - bleeding on probing change in color, slight oedema; score 4 - either: (a) bleeding on probing, change in color, obvious oedema; or (b) bleeding on probing, obvious oedema; score 5 - bleeding on probing and spontaneous bleeding, change in color, marked oedema.</description>

    <description>Cocktail from complex phytoadaptogens (CFA) is composed from 70% alcohol extracts of Glycyrrhiza glabra, Rhodiola rosea, Acantopanax senticosus in the ratio 2:1:1. Application of CFA in 3 group was carried out after non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT). After NSPT the patient filled out an Estberg questionnaire to determine the chronotype. After processing the questionnaire, a chronotype was identified and the patient was prescribed CFA dosage. Application of CFA was carried out in the periods of exacerbation of chronic periodontitis within 28 days with a dosage of CFA depending on the chronotype of the person - morning chronotype at 45 drops in the morning before 10.00 o'clock; independent chronotype 20 drops 3 times a day; evening chronotype 30 drops at 14.00 o'clock and 20 drops at 19.00 o'clock.</description>
