  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this observational study, the feasibility of an at home administration program for&#xD;
      carfilzomib will be evaluated in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma&#xD;
      having already received a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 6 full cycles of KRd (carfilzomib -&#xD;
      lenalidomide - dexamethasone) in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One treatment cycle of KRd consists of a 28-day period. Carfilzomib is administered&#xD;
      intravenously as a 10 minute infusion, on two consecutive days, each week for three weeks&#xD;
      (days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16), followed by a 12-day rest period (days 17 - 28). In combination&#xD;
      with carfilzomib, lenalidomide is administered orally on days 1-21 and dexamethasone is&#xD;
      administered orally on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of the 28-day cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple myeloma is characterized by a recurring pattern of remission and relapse. Given the&#xD;
      need for chronic treatment and good adherence, convenience and quality of life of the&#xD;
      patients become important factors as well. As the majority of the multiple myeloma patients&#xD;
      are elderly and the treatment schedule requires many hospital visits, this treatment schedule&#xD;
      may impact the social and familial life of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient accepts to participate in the home administration program:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration of carfilzomib during cycle 1 and 2 will be performed in the hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During cycle 3 until 6, carfilzomib will be administered on day 1 and15 in the hospital,&#xD;
           while there will be home administration on days 2, 8, 9 and 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On day 1 of each cycle, there will be asked to the patient to complete a short&#xD;
           questionnaire about the quality of life and patients satisfaction during the home&#xD;
           administration program of carfilzomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient doesn't accept to participate in the home administration program:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The patient can agree on one-time collection of data: patient characteristics (date of&#xD;
      birth+gender) and reason for refusal to the home administration program.&#xD;
