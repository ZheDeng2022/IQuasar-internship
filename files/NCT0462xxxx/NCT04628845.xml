  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontal marginal and periapical diseases cause a huge destruction of tissues surrounding&#xD;
      the tooth with periodontal patients. Treatment consists on elimination of pathogens, which&#xD;
      are presented in periodontal pockets and also in root canals. To increase efficiency of&#xD;
      endo-perio treatment there is used diode laser wavelength 940nm. Laser disinfection is done&#xD;
      in periodontal pockets and root canals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment of endo-perio lesions with&#xD;
      use of medicaments and diode laser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will present cases of endo-perio lesions around molars in investigated and control&#xD;
      group. Teeth were subjected to endodontic and periodontological treatment. The roots and&#xD;
      pockets have been disinfected with a diode laser only in investigated group. In the both&#xD;
      groups between the visits into root canals there were applied alkaline paste. The treatment&#xD;
      was completed after 6 months. Before the beginning and after the end of treatment there were&#xD;
      made a two-dimensional image and CBCT. CBCT was subjected to manual segmentation. The&#xD;
      resulting streolitographic models were allowed to check the change of bone volume.&#xD;

      This study will presented the cases of two groups of patients, in which the endo-perio&#xD;
      lesions were reported. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Commission&#xD;
      of Pomeranian University (No: KB-0012/29/17). Each subject provided informed consent after&#xD;
      explanation of the protocol, risk and benefits of study.The both groups counted the same&#xD;
      amount of molar teeth - ten molars in investigated (n=10) and in control group (n=10). In the&#xD;
      study there were 9 men and 11 women aged between 35 and 58 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was performed according to split-teeth design, computerized randomly allocated to&#xD;
      the control or the investigated group. At first group (investigated group) there were&#xD;
      implemented periodontal and endodontic treatment with additional using diode laser wavelength&#xD;
      940 nm. The same steps were made in control group, however without using diode laser in&#xD;
      medical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first step was to do the clinical measurements (PD,CAL, tooth mobility, vitality test,&#xD;
      occlusal condition) and analysis of pantomographic picture, the patients were diagnosed with&#xD;
      third grade periodontitis The depth of periodontal pockets (PD) were checked by using manual&#xD;
      periodontal probe (UNC 15, Hu-Friedy) on six sites. The classified teeth, which were&#xD;
      diagnosed perio-endo lesions, were showed any vitality during testing faradic and ethyl&#xD;
      chloride. The teeth did not respond properly. Also the tested teeth were checked with using&#xD;
      Periotest M (Medizintechnik Gulden) in both groups before and after the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every enrolled patients were checked by using the T-scan Novus (Tekscan). T-scan system&#xD;
      records patients bite force, dynamics, including occlusal force, location and timing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment in EPL should be carried out in two ways- periodontal and endodontic. One of&#xD;
      these ways there is mechanical non-surgical treatment of periodontium and endodontic way is&#xD;
      eliminated the bacteria, which inside in root canals.&#xD;
