  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study were firstly, to evaluate the changes in the anxiety level after deep&#xD;
      sedation with various intravenous sedative agents using salivary cortisol level in pediatric&#xD;
      dental patients and secondly, to compare clinical effectiveness of this sedative agents,&#xD;
      perioperative complications, recovery time and adverse effects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This clinical study was included 69 healthy pediatric patients aged 3 to 7 years with high&#xD;
      anxiety. The patients were divided into 3 groups according to the sedative agents: Group 1&#xD;
      (n=23) was received Propofol, Group 2 (n=23) was receieved Ketofol 1:3, and Group 3 (n=23)&#xD;
      was received Ketofol 1:4. The anxiety levels were assessed using Facial Image Scale (FIS)&#xD;
      anxiety scale and changes in salivary cortisol levels were assessed using ELISA before and&#xD;
      after the drug administration. Perioperative vital signs, depth of sedation were recorded at&#xD;
      intervals of 5 minutes. Preoperative and postoperative complications, operation and recovery&#xD;
      time were recorded in the follow-up form.&#xD;
