  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Focal therapy (FT) for prostate cancer (PCa) is an interesting therapeutic option for&#xD;
      localized disease with a favorable low- to intermediate-risk profile. The aim of this&#xD;
      approach is to offer a personalized and less aggressive treatment as compared to radical&#xD;
      treatments such as radical prostatectomy (RP) or primary radiation therapy, reducing&#xD;
      functional morbidity while maintaining oncologic efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FT is based on the treatment of a part of the prostate, containing the index lesion. The&#xD;
      index lesion is identified as a single visible lesion up to 12 mm at multiparametric MRI&#xD;
      (mpMRI), which is biopsied with a fusion biopsy obtaining a Gleason score inferior or equal&#xD;
      to 3+4. These features allow a focal treatment aimed to ablate the area containing the tumor.&#xD;
      In case of a concomitant presence of 1 or 2 cores of Gleason score 3+3 found at systematic&#xD;
      biopsy and invisible to mpMRI, a strategy of surveillance will be adopted, focusing the&#xD;
      treatment only on the index lesion (only in patients older than 70 years old). Different&#xD;
      sources of energy have been used to date for focal therapy. Among these, has emerged a very&#xD;
      low loss (VLL) microwave ablation system, called TATO3®, specifically developed to work with&#xD;
      the fusion biopsy platform Koelis Trinity® that allows an accurate 3D reconstruction of the&#xD;
      prostate, with the goal to offer a targeted treatment after a targeted biopsy. Aim of this&#xD;
      experimental trial is to evaluate the efficacy of the Trinity®-guided TATO3® treatment in the&#xD;
      ablation of the index lesion, together with the safety of the procedure and the short-term&#xD;
      oncologic outcomes.&#xD;

      Focal therapy (FT) for prostate cancer (PCa) is an interesting therapeutic option for&#xD;
      localized disease with a favorable low- to intermediate-risk profile. The aim of this&#xD;
      approach is to offer a personalized and less aggressive treatment as compared to radical&#xD;
      treatments such as radical prostatectomy (RP) or primary radiation therapy, reducing&#xD;
      functional morbidity while maintaining oncologic efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FT is based on the treatment of a part of the prostate, containing the index lesion. Over 90%&#xD;
      of PCa are multifocal, and unilateral disease is estimated to be present in only 20-40% of&#xD;
      patients. Despite the multifocal nature of PCa, many affected men have just a single&#xD;
      substantial lesion, which is called index lesion. Ohori et al determined that up to 80% of&#xD;
      PCa volume arises through the index lesion. Clinically, vast evidence indicates that the&#xD;
      index lesion features predict the behavior of the disease. Indeed, risk stratification of the&#xD;
      index lesion predicts PCa outcomes, irrespectively from the presence of unilateral or&#xD;
      bilateral disease, and most metastatic PCa arise from the cell clone of the index lesion. FT&#xD;
      relies on the concept that residual PCa in the untreated area does not compromise long-term&#xD;
      disease control, given that it falls into the criteria of active surveillance. The success of&#xD;
      focal therapy strongly depends on the ability to detect the foci of PCa through&#xD;
      multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), which has gained a paramount role in PCa&#xD;
      diagnosis. Clinically significant prostatic lesions have features detectable at mpMRI and can&#xD;
      be targeted with fusion biopsies, which combine the data coming from mpMRI and transrectal&#xD;
      ultrasound (TRUS) imaging. Data from PROMIS trial demonstrated MRI sensitivity of 93% for&#xD;
      clinically significant cancer, and a meta-analysis by Moldovan et al showed a negative&#xD;
      predictive value of mpMRI of 88.1%. A European consensus meeting suggested that mpMRI in&#xD;
      combination of a systematic sampling achieves a negative predictive value of 90-95%. Bearing&#xD;
      in mind the limitations of the mpMRI, however, to-date systematic biopsies are mandatory, to&#xD;
      ensure the most accurate sampling possible, and any FT performed should consider a reasonable&#xD;
      security margin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a successful treatment, patient selection is essential. Currently, the ideal candidates&#xD;
      for FT should be patients harboring intermediate-risk PCa with favorable features and a&#xD;
      limited component of Gleason score pattern 4. A 2015 consensus meeting stated that providing&#xD;
      FT to patients with low-risk prostate cancer would represent overtreatment in men suitable&#xD;
      for active surveillance. Furthermore, candidates for FT must have a life expectancy of more&#xD;
      than 5 years and a WHO performance status of 0 or 1. In the last years, FT has solidly&#xD;
      evolved from low-risk to intermediate-risk disease: since the first FT trials, more than 2700&#xD;
      patients have been treated, and this approach is now at the level of exploration of&#xD;
      indications, quality control measures, and reproducibility in larger trials. In 2017, a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) has shown the potential benefits of FT versus active&#xD;
      surveillance in low-risk PCa in terms of cancer progression, secondary treatments, and&#xD;
      negative biopsies at 2-yrs follow-up. In intermediate-risk PCa, another RCT of partial&#xD;
      prostate ablation versus RP has completed the feasibility phase: the main study is set up,&#xD;
      with the goal to prove the benefit of FT versus RP in terms of PCa mortality. In line with&#xD;
      the recommendations of the 2015 consensus meeting, the investigators believe that suitable&#xD;
      candidates for FT are those with a single small focus of Gleason score 7 (3+4) PCa, with&#xD;
      possible limited adjunctive presence of clinically insignificant foci of Gleason score 6&#xD;
      (3+3) invisible to mpMRI. When speaking of FT for PCa, several energy modalities have been&#xD;
      developed, including high-frequency ultrasound (HIFU), cryotherapy, laser interstitial&#xD;
      thermotherapy, photodynamic therapy, irreversible electroporation, brachytherapy, and&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation. To date, studies were able to prove the feasibility, low morbidity&#xD;
      profile, and satisfying short- and medium-term oncologic results of FT, mainly based on&#xD;
      imaging and rebiopsy. Nevertheless, according to the last European Association of Urology&#xD;
      (EAU) guidelines, FT is still considered experimental, to be offered within a clinical trial.&#xD;
      Recently, among energy modalities has emerged also a very low loss (VLL) microwave ablation&#xD;
      system, called TATO3®, specifically developed to work with the fusion biopsy platform Koelis&#xD;
      Trinity® that allows an accurate 3D reconstruction of the prostate, with the goal to offer a&#xD;
      targeted treatment after a targeted biopsy. Aim of this experimental trial is to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of the Trinity®-guided TATO3® treatment in the ablation of the index lesion,&#xD;
      together with the safety of the procedure and the short-term oncologic outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the 1980s, microwaves have been widely used for the treatment of Benign Prostatic&#xD;
      Hyperplasia (BPH). Low intensity energy is applied to the entire organ to reduce the volume&#xD;
      of the gland. Several studies have shown the safety of microwaves propagation through the&#xD;
      prostate with transurethral, transperineal and transrectal accesses, while variable results&#xD;
      have been achieved in terms of prostate volume reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of PCa by microwaves requires the use of higher energy as compared to BPH&#xD;
      treatment, in order to irreversibly denature tumor cells. A phase I/II clinical has been led&#xD;
      since 1998 to investigate the safety and efficacy of transperineal microwave therapy for&#xD;
      recurrent PCa following external beam radiation therapy. A preliminary result on 25 patients&#xD;
      has shown a very low complication rate following the treatment, and good oncological results.&#xD;
      Six months after the treatment, 64% of the biopsy result were negative. On the last update of&#xD;
      2004 with 41 patients enrolled, no serious complications were observed as a result of the&#xD;
      procedure and, although mild continence problems were encountered, these were generally&#xD;
      temporary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TATO3® VLL microwave ablation system represents the last evolution in the field of microwave&#xD;
      treatment for PCa. Following dry lab testing, it has been experimented in the animal setting&#xD;
      on dogs. More recently, it has been used at Hôpital Cochin, Paris in the setting of clinical&#xD;
      study, where preliminary results on 10 patients with low risk PCa showed an excellent safety&#xD;
      profile of targeted focal microwave treatment for the ablation of index tumor. Final results&#xD;
      are awaited this summer. Another study is ongoing in at Erasme Hospital, Brussels, treating&#xD;
      patients already scheduled for radical prostatectomy, with the aim of examining the extension&#xD;
      of the treated area and confirming the absence of cancerous cells. To-date, the treatment is&#xD;
      well tolerated and efficacious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2015, the investigators have acquired a significant expertise in the field of prostate&#xD;
      fusion biopsies, achieving outstanding cancer detection rates and improving the risk&#xD;
      stratification of newly diagnosed PCa. This expertise has been gained using different&#xD;
      platforms in commerce, from the Koelis Urostation® to the most recent Koelis Trinity®, and&#xD;
      the investigators have reported the outcomes of these fusion biopsies on a multicentric&#xD;
      series of more than 2.000 patients, the largest series of fusion biopsies ever published in&#xD;
      the literature. The natural step forward would be the implementation of the Koelis bioptic&#xD;
      platform with the possibility of delivering a focal treatment to the foci of PCa, which can&#xD;
      be achieved with TATO3® microwave ablation system, minimizing side effects while maintaining&#xD;
      cancer control.&#xD;
