  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the way people can address their health needs. One&#xD;
      such way related to physical exercise is AI-enabled exercise mobile application (digital&#xD;
      coach), which uses motion tracking technology to monitor and provide real-time audio feedback&#xD;
      on a person's exercise form. However, this AI technology has yet to be independently tested&#xD;
      against an in-person evaluator (human coach) for its ability to improve exercise form. This&#xD;
      study is a blinded randomized controlled trial comparing the ability of the digital coach&#xD;
      (n=15) and a Physical Therapist (PT) human coach (n=15) to improve bodyweight squat form in&#xD;
      30 able-bodied volunteers age 20 - 35. Each volunteer performs 10 unassisted control squats,&#xD;
      then 10 squats with assistive vocal feedback from either coach after each repetition, and&#xD;
      finally 10 more unassisted test squats, all squats video-recorded. Three independent video&#xD;
      evaluators count the number of correct squat repetitions completed by volunteers before and&#xD;
      after intervention by the different coaches. This project is important to validate the&#xD;
      digital coach compared to a PT human coach in a small population using a bodyweight squat for&#xD;
      its wide applicability to daily movement patterns.&#xD;

    <description>To determine baseline ability and serve as their own control, participants in both groups performed 10 bodyweight squat &quot;control&quot; repetitions without feedback followed by one minute of rest. Those in the AI group then performed 10 more &quot;practice&quot; repetitions with real-time audiovisual feedback from the app followed by one minute of rest. The AI's design provided one piece of feedback, if necessary, with a vocal statement and on-screen video per repetition (e.g. when a participant performed a squat repetition with their neck flexed downward, AI suggested keeping their head up with on-screen instruction). Participants in both groups then performed 10 &quot;test&quot; repetitions without feedback followed by one minute of rest.</description>
