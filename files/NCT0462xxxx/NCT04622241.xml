  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To explore housing modification as a malaria control intervention, and to assess the degree&#xD;
      to which it may offer protection in moderate to high malaria endemicity settings, we propose&#xD;
      a two-phase study evaluating epidemiological and entomological effectiveness,&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of housing modification in Uganda. The&#xD;
      first phase will be a pilot implementation assessing the feasibility of candidate housing&#xD;
      modification interventions, followed by a cluster randomised control trial of the most&#xD;
      effective, scalable, and cost-effective interventions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in two phases, beginning with a pilot (Phase I). The aim of the&#xD;
      pilot will be to develop and test four types of housing modifications in both modern houses&#xD;
      (those with brick or stone walls) and traditionally constructed houses (those with mud&#xD;
      walls). The housing modifications will include: (1) full house screening (eaves and windows),&#xD;
      (2) partial house screening (eaves or ceiling), (3) eave tubes, and (4) eave ribbons.&#xD;
      Community input will be sought during the development of the housing prototypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pilot, all 4 interventions will be implemented in both modern and traditional houses,&#xD;
      plus a control arm in each group. All households will have access to PBO LLINs. Community&#xD;
      input will be sought during the development of the housing prototypes. The pilot will include&#xD;
      10 arms in total, each consisting of 20 households, equal to 200 households (160 in the&#xD;
      intervention and 40 in the control arm) in total. The feasibility and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      interventions will be assessed through a qualitative study (FGDs and interviews), evaluation&#xD;
      of the costs and implementation of the interventions, and entomology surveys (using CDC light&#xD;
      traps). One to two housing interventions will be selected for Phase II following the review&#xD;
      and discussion of the pilot results with the trial steering committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II will include a cluster-randomised trial. A cluster will be defined as a village (or&#xD;
      segment of a village consisting of ~100 households). In the cluster-randomised trial, up to 2&#xD;
      interventions vs 1 control arm will be assessed in 20 clusters per arm (60 clusters total).&#xD;
      The clusters will be non-contiguous, with a buffer zone of 300-500m. All households in the&#xD;
      selected clusters will have PBO LLINs; households in intervention clusters will also receive&#xD;
      the specified housing modifications. The impact of the interventions will be assessed through&#xD;
      a cohort study, cross-sectional community surveys, entomology surveillance, a qualitative&#xD;
      study, and an economic evaluation. The primary outcome of the trial will be clinical malaria&#xD;
      incidence in children aged &lt; 60 months as measured in the cohort study.&#xD;
