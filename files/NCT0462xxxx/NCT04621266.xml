  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A home-based breastfeeding peer support programme is proposed to support mothers who are&#xD;
      giving birth to their first-born. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of this&#xD;
      programme in improving breastfeeding practices among women with low breastfeeding&#xD;
      self-efficacy. It is hypothesized that participants who received home-based peer support will&#xD;
      exclusively breastfeed for longer duration, have higher breastfeeding self-efficacy, and&#xD;
      lower post-partum depression symptoms when compared to those receiving only standard care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primiparous mothers who plan to breastfeed but did not go on to breastfeed often face high&#xD;
      levels of emotional and psychological challenges in their transition to parenthood. This can&#xD;
      adversely affect their breastfeeding experiences and general well-being, and is associated&#xD;
      with stress, anxiety, and postnatal depression. While family psycho-education and other&#xD;
      supportive group programmes are available in health services, they require face-to-face&#xD;
      education sessions over a long interval, high engagement, and trusting relationships, and&#xD;
      thus often result in low attendance and high drop outs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers have expressed the need for psychological support of peer counsellors, which would&#xD;
      allow them to support each other. The first month postpartum is a critical period for&#xD;
      sustaining exclusive breastfeeding and the time when mothers are at high risk of postpartum&#xD;
      depression. For Chinese mothers in Hong Kong, however, they are often housebound during this&#xD;
      period due to the tradition of &quot;doing the month&quot;, and thus often find it difficult to attend&#xD;
      support groups or seek help. In view of these challenges faced by primiparous mothers, a&#xD;
      home-based peer support programme is proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized control trial adopts a two-arm design to examine the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      home-based peer support programme for women with low breastfeeding self-efficacy. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that those receiving the intervention, when compared to the controls, will have&#xD;
      (1) longer period of exclusive breastfeeding, (2) higher postnatal breastfeeding&#xD;
      self-efficacy, and (3) lower post-partum depressive symptoms.&#xD;
