  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine the physiological evidence of how muscular and cerebral&#xD;
      oxygenation changes link to fatigue, physical, and cognitive performance after&#xD;
      moderate-intensity exercise in sedentary older adults with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an experimental design. One intervention group will do exercise for 2 months and be&#xD;
      measured twice, at baseline, and after 2 months. The other 2 control groups will be assessed&#xD;
      just once without exercise intervention. Our primary objective is to clarify physiological&#xD;
      evidence of how muscular and cerebral oxygenation changes in sedentary older adults with&#xD;
      diabetes after low-to-moderate intensity exercise. The secondary objective is to determine&#xD;
      fatigue, physical, cognitive performance changes, blood glucose level among sedentary older&#xD;
      adults with diabetes after low-to-moderate intensity exercise.&#xD;

    <description>The 2-month exercise will be conducted at the participants' homes. Participants will be recommended to perform the combined exercise, which consists of the resistance exercise and walking at a faster speed than leisure walking at a moderate-intensity, for 6 days/week. They can decide which day they won't perform the exercise. Participants will be encouraged to do progressive resistance exercise and walking twice a day, once in the morning and the other time in the afternoon. Resistance exercise will be suggested to perform every other day for three days/week and walking as the aerobic exercise will be on alternate days for three days/week.</description>
