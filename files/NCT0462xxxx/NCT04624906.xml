      This is a multi-centre, open label, single-arm, phase II clinical trial in untreated patients&#xD;
      with Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia. Symptomatic, previously untreated patients will receive&#xD;
      SOC bendamustine and rituximab for 6 28-day cycles. Bendamustine will be given intravenously&#xD;
      at 90 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2 of each cycle. Rituximab will be given on day 1 of each cycle&#xD;
      (375 mg/m2 intravenously for the first cycle and 1400 mg subcutaneously OR 375 mg/m2&#xD;
      intravenously for subsequent cycles (as per institutional procedures)). Concomitantly,&#xD;
      participants will receive 100 mg of the investigational product, Acalabrutinib, orally for 1&#xD;
      year (365 days) at 100 mg BID.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, open label, single-arm, phase II clinical trial in untreated patients&#xD;
      with WM. Patients will require a biopsy to confirm the pathology and molecular testing for&#xD;
      MYD88, CXCR4 and P53 mutations. A bone marrow aspiration and biopsy will be performed to&#xD;
      document WM and MRD. Participants will be classified into clinical risk categories based on&#xD;
      the International Prognostic Scoring (IPS) System for WM. Symptomatic, previously untreated&#xD;
      patients will receive SOC bendamustine and rituximab for 6 28-day cycles. Bendamustine will&#xD;
      be given intravenously at 90 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2 of each cycle. Rituximab will be given on&#xD;
      day 1 of each cycle (375 mg/m2 intravenously for the first cycle and 1400 mg subcutaneously&#xD;
      OR 375 mg/m2 intravenously for subsequent cycles (as per institutional procedures)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitantly, participants will receive 100 mg of the investigational product,&#xD;
      Acalabrutinib, orally for 1 year (365 days) at 100 mg BID. Patients will have pre-treatment&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) scans, and CT scans at 7, 12 and 18 months. Best objective response&#xD;
      will be documented using the criteria from the Sixth International Workshop on Waldenstrom's&#xD;
      Macroglobulinemia. Assessment of metabolic uptake by positron emission tomography (PET) scan&#xD;
      is not considered appropriate for WM as WM usually do not take up fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG).&#xD;
      Patients with WM will also have disease assessed using measurements of serum IgM, serum&#xD;
      protein electrophoresis (SPE), immunofixation (IFA), and viscosity assessments measured&#xD;
      serially. A bone marrow aspiration and biopsy will be done before treatment and at response&#xD;
      assessment at cycle 6 and will be repeated if positive. Durability of response will also be&#xD;
      assessed at 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed by extended follow-up by telephone for up to 6 years to obtain&#xD;
      data on the secondary endpoints.&#xD;

    <description>To document the best combined CR and VGPR rate of first line treatment with bendamustine &amp; rituximab plus Acalabrutinib in patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia using the criteria from the Sixth International Workshop on Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia. Best response will be recorded within the first twelve months of treatment. These include assessments at the beginning treatment cycles; 2,3,4,5,6 , 7,10, and 12. For each participant, the best response will be selected at any of these timepoints to be used as the best objective response for that participant. The results from each participant will be pooled and participants whose best response at any of these time points is either CR or VGPR will be added together to derive the overall best CR/VGPR rate for the study population.</description>
