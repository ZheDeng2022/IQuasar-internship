  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether psilocybin, a hallucinogenic drug, is&#xD;
      effective in reducing depressive symptoms and amount of drinking in patients with&#xD;
      co-occurring Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this double-blind, placebo-controlled study are to test the hypotheses that&#xD;
      a single high (25 mg) oral dose of psilocybin will lead to enduring reductions in depressive&#xD;
      symptoms (as measured by the clinician-rated grid version of the Hamilton Depression Rating&#xD;
      Scale, or GRID-HAMD) and amount of drinking (as measured using the Time Line Follow Back, or&#xD;
      TLFB, procedure) compared to placebo in patients with co-occurring MDD and AUD. 90 male and&#xD;
      female volunteers who are between the ages of 21 and 65 years old and who meet Diagnostic and&#xD;
      Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria for MDD and AUD will be recruited from the&#xD;
      community and complete all study procedures. Volunteers will be randomized to one of two&#xD;
      study arms (psilocybin [N=45] or placebo [N=45]), and will complete a drug administration&#xD;
      session paired with a brief Motivational Interviewing intervention for alcohol use.&#xD;
      Volunteers will undergo assessments of depression and alcohol use before and after treatment.&#xD;
      After primary endpoints are measured, all volunteers will receive a second, unblinded&#xD;
      intervention with a single high dose of psilocybin (25 mg) to test a secondary hypothesis&#xD;
      that two doses of psilocybin are more effective in treating MDD with co-occurring AUD than a&#xD;
      single dose.&#xD;
