  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study to investigate short-term safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity of UB-421 SC with 4 weekly doses in treatment naive&#xD;
      HIV-1 infected patients. Eligible (n=6 per dose cohort) subjects will be sequentially&#xD;
      enrolled into 3 escalating-dose cohorts to receive 4 weekly fixed doses of UB-421 SC at&#xD;
      either 250 mg (Cohort A), 500 mg (Cohort B) or 700 mg (Cohort C). Subjects should be followed&#xD;
      for safety for additional 4 weeks after the last UB-421 SC dosing. In order to control viral&#xD;
      load while minimizing confounding in safety assessment, subjects can initiate standard&#xD;
      anti-retroviral therapy (ART) two weeks after the last UB-421 SC dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Escalation to the next higher dose cohort will be determined based on dose limited toxicity&#xD;
      (DLT) evaluation. The dose escalation will be stopped if ≥ 2/6 subjects experience DLT or&#xD;
      when clinical trial steering committee (CTSC) determines it is not suitable to escalate the&#xD;
      dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, DLT is defined as any ≥ grade 3 AE occurred within 21 days from prior UB-421&#xD;
      SC dosing and is considered drug related.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When there is any ≥grade 3 AE(s) occurred within 21 days from prior UB-421 SC dosing in any&#xD;
      subject out of the current dose cohort (n=6), the duty of the CTSC will be initiated. The&#xD;
      CTSC will be responsible for DLT evaluation. The committee members will evaluate the safety&#xD;
      data of all subjects in each cohort through baseline to at least 21 days following the last&#xD;
      UB-421 SC dosing. The administration of the next higher dose level at TV1 will be conducted&#xD;
      after the committee grants the dose escalation. However, dose escalation will be proceeded if&#xD;
      there is no ≥ grade 3 AE and upon agreement from all investigators without holding the&#xD;
      steering committee meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be assessed at Screening, weekly during Treatment Period and Follow-up Period.&#xD;
      The assessment includes physical examination, vital sign, laboratory parameters, HIV-1 viral&#xD;
      load, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts. Samples for the drug concentration measurement will be&#xD;
      collected at weekly intervals throughout the study, immediately before UB-421 SC dosing.&#xD;
      Additional intensive PK sampling will be scheduled during the first dosing interval (from TV1&#xD;
      to TV2) at 1, 3, 6, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post first UB-421 SC dosing for PK subgroup (at&#xD;
      least 3 subjects per dose cohort). The immunogenicity of UB-421 SC will be monitored by&#xD;
      measuring anti-UB-421 antibodies in pre-dose serum samples at day 0 and post-dose serum at&#xD;
      day 14, 28, 35, 42 and 49. Viral reservoir, immunophenotyping and CD4+ (D1) receptor&#xD;
      occupancy will also be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects should discontinue from UB-421 SC treatment if they experience a sustained decrease&#xD;
      from baseline in CD4+ (D2) T cell counts of ≧50% at two consecutive visits or drug-related&#xD;
      AE(s) with severity grade 3 or 4 (according to the Division of AIDS, National Institute of&#xD;
      Allergy and Infectious Diseases (DAIDS) AE grading).&#xD;
