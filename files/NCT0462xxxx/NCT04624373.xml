  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The wide uptake of &quot;liquid biopsy&quot; diagnostics in the care of advanced cancer patients&#xD;
      highlights the desire for improved access to tumor allowing accurate tumor genotyping (1).&#xD;
      Genotyping of plasma cfDNA is now routine for detection of EGFR driver mutations at diagnosis&#xD;
      of NSCLC, or for detection of the EGFR T790M mutation after TKI resistance, and is an&#xD;
      emerging approach for the detection of other drivers (HER2 or BRAF mutations, ALK or ROS1&#xD;
      fusions…) (2) or the estimation of tumor mutation burden (TMB) (3). However, the most&#xD;
      sensitive plasma genotyping platforms still have a sensitivity of only 70%-80%, such that a&#xD;
      negative result requires tissue biopsy confirmation.&#xD;

      The wide uptake of &quot;liquid biopsy&quot; diagnostics in the care of advanced cancer patients&#xD;
      highlights the desire for improved access to tumor allowing accurate tumor genotyping (1).&#xD;
      Genotyping of plasma cfDNA is now routine for detection of EGFR driver mutations at diagnosis&#xD;
      of NSCLC, or for detection of the EGFR T790M mutation after TKI resistance, and is an&#xD;
      emerging approach for the detection of other drivers (HER2 or BRAF mutations, ALK or ROS1&#xD;
      fusions…) (2) or the estimation of tumor mutation burden (TMB) (3). However, the most&#xD;
      sensitive plasma genotyping platforms still have a sensitivity of only 70%-80%, such that a&#xD;
      negative result requires tissue biopsy confirmation. This poses a clinical challenge because&#xD;
      negative plasma genotyping is correlated with more limited metastatic spread and lower tumor&#xD;
      burden, such that biopsy of these patients may be even more challenging. Because invasive&#xD;
      biopsy remains an integral part of the diagnostic strategy, methods are needed for maximizing&#xD;
      the yield from these biopsy procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a current paradox between the need for large amounts of tissue for multiplex&#xD;
      analysis of an increasing number of targetable drivers and markers of response to immune&#xD;
      therapy (PD-L1, TMB) and the development of minimally invasive biopsy procedures that results&#xD;
      in limited specimens. Up to 25% of patients are thus treated without knowledge of the&#xD;
      molecular profile of their tumor (4). In particular, 20% of endobronchial ultrasonography&#xD;
      transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) are rejected from genotyping due to lack of&#xD;
      tissue (5) after time and tissue consuming diagnostics steps that are sometimes not required&#xD;
      (resistance setting). Circulating tumor DNA is an emerging approach for cancer genotyping but&#xD;
      sensitivity is limited to 70-80% (6) by inconsistent tumor shed and low DNA concentrations,&#xD;
      so that tissue biopsy is still routine. Also, feasibility of TMB assessment on tissue is only&#xD;
      60% (likely much less on EBUS-TBNA specimens) (7) and approximately 80% in plasma (blood TMB,&#xD;
      bTMB) (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of cfDNA in several biological fluids and the feasibility of detecting mutations&#xD;
      of interest (usually targeting only EGFR) in these fluids (urine, pleural fluid, CSF) have&#xD;
      been clearly demonstrated (8-12), while blood is the most widely studied liquid biopsy&#xD;
      substrate in advanced NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, we showed in a proof of concept study, investigating various FNA specimens in a&#xD;
      limited numbers of patients that cytology samples' supernatant (usually discarded) is a rich&#xD;
      source of DNA. Our results suggest that supernatant free DNA (sfDNA) can be used for baseline&#xD;
      and resistance genotyping (13).&#xD;

    <description>The interventional pulmonologist selects the most suspect node. The corresponding TBNA is placed in Cytolyt and tagged using a sticker to indicate the specimen from which supernatant must be saved after the initial spin.&#xD;
The supernatant is transferred to the &quot;Laboratoire de Biologie Médicale Oncologique&quot; where it undergoes a further hard spin. The remaining supernatant is stored at -80°C before to send it to Foundation One for DNA extraction from 3 ml of supernatant and genotyping.&#xD;
Two 7,5 mL blood tubes are transferred to the laboratory to extract plasma. Plasma was stored at -80°C and then sent to Foundation One for DNA extraction from 2 mL of plasma and genotyping.&#xD;
10 slides from the cell block are shipped to Foundation One. These specimens are tested by FoundationOne®CDX (tissue), and FoundationOne®Liquid (supernatant and plasma) for genomic and TMB analyses (hybrid-capture based next generation sequencing).</description>
