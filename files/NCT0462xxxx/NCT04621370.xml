  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PRIME-RT is an open label, multi-centre phase II randomised trial with 1:1 allocation between&#xD;
      arm A and arm B. The principal research question is whether the addition of durvalumab to&#xD;
      FOLFOX chemotherapy and radiation treatment (either SCRT or LCRT) in the neoadjuvant setting&#xD;
      for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) improves rates of complete response.&#xD;
      The working hypothesis is that the use of radiation and cytotoxic chemotherapy may prime the&#xD;
      tumour immune microenvironment for treatment with immune checkpoint blockade. The main trial&#xD;
      will commence after completion of a safety run-in which will enrol at least three patients&#xD;
      per arm to test the safety and tolerability of the treatment combinations in each.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In rectal cancer, strategies to enhance local treatment responses by expanding neoadjuvant&#xD;
      regimens are sought to enable organ preservation in more patients. The addition of systemic&#xD;
      FOLFOX post long course chemoradiotherapy (LCRT) and post short course radiotherapy (SCRT)&#xD;
      has been reported with encouraging results demonstrating higher rates of complete response&#xD;
      than with radiotherapy based treatment alone. Immunotherapy using PD-1/ PD-L1 inhibition is&#xD;
      recognised to be effective in mismatch repair deficient colorectal cancer (dMMR). Generally,&#xD;
      dMMR tumours are characterised by a higher mutational burden, a higher neoantigen load with&#xD;
      high density T cell infiltrates and increased expression of PD-1/ PD-L1 in the tumour&#xD;
      microenvironment (TME). Mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) colorectal cancer is not thought to&#xD;
      be responsive to immunotherapies partly due to the fact they exhibit low levels of tumour&#xD;
      infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and PD-1/PD-L1 within the TME. Attempts to expand the role of&#xD;
      anti-PD-L1 treatment to pMMR CRC is likely to rely on provision of conventional DNA damaging&#xD;
      treatments to increase tumour immunogenicity/ T cell infiltration. At baseline few rectal&#xD;
      tumours (10-20%) demonstrate moderate-high grade CD3+ responses within the TME, but there is&#xD;
      evidence that radiotherapy (e.g. SCRT or LCRT) and systemic chemotherapy (FOLFOX) induce&#xD;
      favourable immune responses. In this phase II trial, the investigators plan to evaluate the&#xD;
      potential treatment efficacy of anti-PD-L1 systemic anticancer treatment, durvalumab,&#xD;
      alongside either SCRT or LCRT with FOLFOX in the gap up to post treatment assessment. This&#xD;
      trial will evaluate rates of complete response in each arm as its primary endpoint in&#xD;
      addition to safety and toxicity as secondary endpoints. It is a translationally rich trial&#xD;
      which involves the collection of biospecimens prior to, during and following treatment in&#xD;
      order to understand the molecular and immunological factors underpinning treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial 6 patient safety run-in (3 patients in each arm) will be performed treating&#xD;
      patients with metastatic disease with a locally advanced rectal cancer in situ or patients&#xD;
      with locally advanced rectal cancer who will never undergo radical surgery due to patient&#xD;
      choice, in order to establish safety and lack of significant local toxicity due to the&#xD;
      combination (for example colo-proctitis). Depending on the toxicity observed in the first 3&#xD;
      evaluable patients in each of the arm, an additional 3 patients may be add to that arm for&#xD;
      the safety run-in cohort. Following an independent safety review and approval by an&#xD;
      Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), the main trial will commence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the safety run-in, 42 patients with non-metastatic, biopsy confirmed rectal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma (cT3b+, N+, EMVI+ based on MRI staging or low rectal tumours requiring&#xD;
      abdominoperineal resection) will be recruited to the main trial and randomised to one of two&#xD;
      treatment arms. These patients must have adequate physical fitness and no previous pelvic&#xD;
      radiotherapy or immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment to the Safety Run-in period is expected to take 6 months (based on 6 patients in&#xD;
      this cohort) with the main trial taking a further 12 months. Recruitment should therefore&#xD;
      take place over a total period of 18 months. If the safety run-in requires more than 6&#xD;
      patients, these timelines will be revised. Patients will be followed up for 36 months from&#xD;
      date of randomisation.&#xD;
