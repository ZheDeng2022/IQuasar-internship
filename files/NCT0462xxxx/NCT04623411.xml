  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal death is one of the important indicators showing the development level of countries.&#xD;
      Many newborn deaths are preventable. Preventable neonatal deaths arise from events such as&#xD;
      birth asphyxia at the time of delivery. Nursing students receive neonatal resuscitation&#xD;
      training with classical training methods and graduate without the opportunity to experience&#xD;
      it in a clinical setting. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of web-based&#xD;
      serious game simulation method in neonatal resuscitation training given to nursing students.&#xD;

      The study was planned as a randomized controlled trial with a single blind, pretest-posttest&#xD;
      design. This study will be conducted in the Fall Semester of the 2020-2021 Academic Year with&#xD;
      nursing students studying in the 3rd grade of Akdeniz University Faculty of Nursing between&#xD;
      October and December 2020. An intervention and control group (intervention group: 50, control&#xD;
      group: 50) will be formed from 100 students who accepted to participate in the study.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly allocated to one of the two groups. Pre-test and post-test will&#xD;
      be applied to both groups before and after the training. Neonatal resuscitation training will&#xD;
      be given online to the intervention and control group. After the theoretical training,&#xD;
      web-based neonatal resuscitation serious game simulation will be applied to the intervention&#xD;
      group. Ethics Committee and Institutional Permission was obtained for the study. In addition,&#xD;
      written consent will be obtained from the participants. Statistical analysis will be done&#xD;
      using SPSS 23.0 and significance will be evaluated at p &lt;0.05. Support will be received in&#xD;
      the analysis phase of the Statistical Information Unit of Akdeniz Universit It is predicted&#xD;
      that the new information obtained from the data of the research will guide the methods used&#xD;
      in education and new researches.&#xD;

    <measure>Neonatal resuscitation knowledge level assessment questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before training and one week after training completion</time_frame>
    <description>This 15-item multiple-choice questionnaire was developed by the researchers to evaluate the knowledge level of the participants. Each question will be evaluated as correct answer = 1 point, wrong answer = 0 points. Participants will fill in online before and after the training.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of Newborn Resuscitation Practice Skills</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before training and one week after training completion</time_frame>
    <description>Serious game simulation software will be used to Assess Newborn Resuscitation Practice Skill. Participants will be expected to practice web-based neonatal resuscitation with serious game simulation and their skills will be evaluated. Each correct practice will be evaluated as sufficient 1 point and incorrect practice will be evaluated as 0 points.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Student Satisfaction and Self-Confidence in Learning Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>One week after training completion</time_frame>
    <description>The scale consists of two sub-dimensions, &quot;satisfaction with learning&quot; and &quot;self-confidence&quot;, in five-point Likert type, and a total of 13 items. There are five items in the satisfaction with learning sub-dimension and eight items in the self-confidence sub-dimension. Internal consistency coefficient of the scale: 0,90 The internal consistency coefficient of student satisfaction is 0.89, and the self-confidence in learning sub-dimension is 0.83.</description>
