    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide insight on investigate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      vestibular stimulation on gait pattern by using spring gravity bar , when you bounce up and&#xD;
      down it stimulate vestibular system that is considered straight line vestibular stimulation&#xD;
      and strength extensor muscle of lower limb by pressure on spring during stance phase all that&#xD;
      change gait stability and stride length so can improve gait pattern .&#xD;

    <description>Two-dimensional (2D) video analysis may provide an accessible and affordable means of quantifying postural control deficits that can be implemented across a spectrum of care settings. Angular joint measures during weight lifting obtained using 2D motion analysis software have been shown to be highly correlated to goniometric measures . This system has also been shown to be reliable in quantifying range of motion during reaching and walking/running tasks</description>

    <measure>Dynamic gait index</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minute</time_frame>
    <description>The Dynamic Gait Index is a sensitive and efficient tool for adults and therefore may be a useful tool for children. Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) is a performance-based tool that quantifiesthe dynamic balance instability developed by Shumway-Cook and Woollacott, evaluates the ability of the individual to modify gait in response to changing functions during walking</description>
