      The main purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of intermittent&#xD;
      Theta Burst (iTBS) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), its effectiveness in&#xD;
      alleviating depressive symptoms as well as its effects on cognition. Although iTBS rTMS is&#xD;
      approved for use, there have been no safety and tolerability evaluations of this form of rTMS&#xD;
      in Multiple Sclerosis (MS).&#xD;

      The main purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of intermittent&#xD;
      Theta Burst (iTBS), its effectiveness in alleviating depressive symptoms, concomitant&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and fatigue in people with MS, as well as its&#xD;
      effects on cognition. Although iTBS repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is&#xD;
      approved for use in major depressive disorder (MDD), there have been no safety and&#xD;
      tolerability evaluations of this form of rTMS in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patient with MDD.&#xD;
      Although iTBS rTMS has previously been found safe and effective for treating spasticity in&#xD;
      people with MS, this will be the first study to investigate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      Left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (L-DLPFC) iTBS rTMS for MDD in MS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as an open-label pilot study. Participants will undergo baseline&#xD;
      evaluations to confirm a diagnosis of MDD and to assess your eligibility for rTMS treatment.&#xD;
      If deemed eligible, participants will receive iTBS treatment. iTBS is a form of rTMS approved&#xD;
      by Health Canada for treatment of MDD. iTBS rTMS treatment involves 3 minutes of non-invasive&#xD;
      brain stimulation, 5 days a week, for 4 weeks, for a total of 20 treatments. While receiving&#xD;
      iTBS rTMS, participants will be seen daily by the rTMS operator who is a mental health nurse.&#xD;
      While receiving iTBS rTMS, participants will see the research coordinator and study&#xD;
      psychiatrist on a weekly basis, to complete clinical assessments to evaluate their&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric symptoms and assess any side effects from the rTMS procedure. As part of the&#xD;
      suggested pathophysiological profile of depression the levels of inflammatory cytokines tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor ⍺ (TNF-⍺) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) have shown elevated concentration levels&#xD;
      in plasma of depressed compared to non-depressed individuals. In this study, we aim to&#xD;
      investigate the levels of these inflammatory cytokine markers and their change with iTBS.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome measure will be the reduction in depressive symptoms as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 at the end of the 4-week trial of iTBS rTMS. This will be measured as both a continuous variable (score on HAMD-17 at week 4 - score on HAMD-17 at week 0 pre-treatment) and a categorical one (i.e. the response rates of &gt;50% reduction from baseline HAMD-17 and remission rates defined as HAMD-17 &lt;7).</description>
