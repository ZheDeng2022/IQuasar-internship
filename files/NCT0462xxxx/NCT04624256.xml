      This trial studies the changes in long-term physician-scored genitourinary toxicity achieved&#xD;
      in prostate cancer patients eligible for stereotactic radiation therapy when both patients&#xD;
      and physicians have access to convincing but non-validated germline signature that can&#xD;
      characterize patients as having a low or high risk of developing toxicity after radiation&#xD;
      therapy. The information learned from this study may guide patients' and physicians'&#xD;
      decisions on radiotherapy fractionation.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the impact on the 5-year cumulative incidence of late grade &gt;= 2&#xD;
      genitourinary (GU) physician-scored toxicity, as assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria&#xD;
      for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 scale, caused by presenting both the physicians and&#xD;
      patients with the results of a non-prospectively validated biomarker panel that dichotomizes&#xD;
      any given patient into having a high versus a low risk of late grade &gt;= 2 GU physician-scored&#xD;
      toxicity following stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the late grade &gt;= 2 genitourinary (GU) physician-scored toxicity, as assessed&#xD;
      by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 scale, in patients&#xD;
      who test positive for the biomarker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the late grade &gt;= 2 genitourinary (GU) physician-scored toxicity, as&#xD;
      assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 scale, in&#xD;
      patients who test negative for the biomarker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To observe the proportions of patients who choose to receive conventionally fractionated&#xD;
      radiotherapy, moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy, and SBRT, based on being positive or&#xD;
      negative for the biomarker thought to predict for late grade &gt;= 2 GU toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the 5-year cumulative incidence of late grade &gt;= 2 gastrointestinal (GI)&#xD;
      physician-reported toxicity, as assessed by the CTCAE version 4.03 scale, following the same&#xD;
      intervention as for the primary objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine the incidence of acute grade &gt;= 2 GU and GI toxicity as assessed by the CTCAE&#xD;
      version 4.03 scale, following the same intervention as for the primary objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To quantify the temporal changes in patient-reported quality of life (QOL) outcomes, as&#xD;
      assessed by the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index-26 (EPIC-26), International Prostate Symptom&#xD;
      Scores (IPSS), and Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) QOL indices, following the same&#xD;
      intervention as for the primary objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients planning to undergo SBRT per standard of care undergo collection of cheek swab and&#xD;
      blood samples for the analysis of germline biomarkers. Afterwards, patients and their&#xD;
      physicians engage in discussion about which form of radiotherapy to proceed with. Based on&#xD;
      the decision, patients predicted to be at low risk of toxicity with SBRT continue to receive&#xD;
      SBRT over 14 days while patients predicted to be at high risk of toxicity with SBRT will be&#xD;
      counseled to undergo either conventionally fractionated radiotherapy over 63-70 days,&#xD;
      moderate hypofractionated radiotherapy over 28-35 days, or may opt to still receive SBRT over&#xD;
      14 days per standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of radiotherapy treatment, patients are followed up at 1 ,3, 6, 9, 12, 18,&#xD;
      and 24 months, and then every 6 months for 4 years.&#xD;
