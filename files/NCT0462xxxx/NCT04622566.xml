    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized ,single center clinical study which is designed to investigate&#xD;
      whether combination of Pembrolizumab with Lenvatinib could improve pCR rate and consequent&#xD;
      survival in resectable mucosal melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the eligible patients were assigned to receive Lenvatinib once a day (QD) for 6 weeks&#xD;
      plus pembrolizumab on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle (Q3W) concurrently on days 1 and 22,&#xD;
      followed by surgery and 18 cycles of Pembrolizumab 200mg q3w of adjuvant phase.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mucosal melanoma is a rare type of melanoma in Caucasian population and a dominate subtype in&#xD;
      Asia, which generally carries a worse prognosis than cutaneous melanoma. Surgery remains the&#xD;
      primary therapeutic intervention for mucosal melanoma, and neoadjuvant therapy is still&#xD;
      needed which can lead to improvements in outcomes by surgical resectability, local control&#xD;
      and organ preservation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunotherapy has showed promising activity in advanced melanoma. However, PD-1 antibodies,&#xD;
      both Pembrolizumab and Nivolumab, showed much poorer response to mucosal melanoma than to&#xD;
      cutaneous melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab showed modest objective response rate (ORR, 13%) in advanced mucosal melanoma&#xD;
      in Chinese population (NCT02628067). Recent study also demonstrated that neoadjuvant therapy&#xD;
      with one dose of Pembrolizumab could lead to pathological complete response (pCR) or major&#xD;
      response in nearly 30% of resectable advanced melanoma and pCR was associated with reduced&#xD;
      risk of recurrence and improved survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenvatinib is also a kinase inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activities of VEGFR1,2, 3&#xD;
      which has been approved by FDA for differentiated thyroid cancer, advanced renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that neoadjuvant Pembrolizumab in combination with Lenvatinib could result&#xD;
      in higher anti-tumor activity with lower toxicity and prolong RFS and OS in high-risk&#xD;
      resectable mucosal melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will assess the efficacy and safety of the combination Pembrolizumab and Lenvatinib&#xD;
      as neoadjuvant treatment in resectable mucosal melanoma.&#xD;

&#xD;
        17. Has radiographic evidence of major blood vessel invasion/infiltration. The degree of&#xD;

        determined by multi-gated acquisition scan (MUGA) or echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;

        duration of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        24. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
        cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        25. Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive children within the projected&#xD;
        duration of the trial, starting with the screening visit through 6 months after the last&#xD;
