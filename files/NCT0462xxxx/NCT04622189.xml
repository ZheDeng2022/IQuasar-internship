      The purpose of this study is to assess the changes in physiological parameters and clinical&#xD;
      scales resulting from treatment with AOT (action observation training) in subjects with&#xD;
      subacute stroke. Furthermore, this study assess the perception of applicability and&#xD;
      satisfaction degree for this kind of treatments.&#xD;

      After being informed about the study, all patients give written informed consent and will&#xD;
      undergo a 1-week screening period to determine eligibility for study entry. Patient who meet&#xD;
      the eligibility requirements will be given clinical and instrumental assessments before the&#xD;
      start of treatment (T0) after 3 weeks (T1), at the end of the treatment (T2) and after 6&#xD;
      months (T3). A training program of 4 weeks including 250 videos of every day actions has been&#xD;
      developed. Videos includes transitive and intransitive actions. Each week has a five day&#xD;
      program, each day is divided in three sessions, in each session there are observation and&#xD;
      imitation and attentional questions. AOT is always performed in conjunction with the&#xD;
      conventional rehabilitation program.&#xD;

    <description>To measure spasticity. It consists of a 5-point nominal scale using subjective clinical assessments of tone ranging from 0 - 'No increases in tone' to 4 - 'Limb rigid in flexion or extension [abduction/adduction]'. An additional grade is added (1+) for the MAS to indicate resistance in the movement.</description>

    <description>Scale that consists of a straight line with the endpoints defining extreme limits such as 'no pain at all' and 'pain as bad as it could be'. The length of the line is 10-cm. Measurements from the starting point (left end) of the scale to the patients' marks are recorded in centimeters and are interpreted as their pain.</description>

    <description>Neurorehabilitation training for the upper limb using AOT consists of watching videos related to every day actions. The subjects will be asked to reproduce, as accurately as possible, the actions proposed by the system, that will record their execution. In order to keep high motivation and participation in activities, simple games of skill will also be created that will involve the patient on both the motor and cognitive side. The training program includes 250 videos of every day transitive and intransitive actions: 20 consecutive sessions of 1 hour, five times a week over four weeks.</description>

PATIENT INTERFACE, which has been implemented to present stimuli with a user friendly interface, with personalized menu and with the possibility to manage the training program; user personal page containing user information and history of activities with daily performance are stored too.&#xD;
MOCAP during action imitation will be recorded using MindMotion infrared camera to capture the trunk movement while an electromagnetic system (Trackstar from NDI) will be used to record fingers fine movements.&#xD;
EEG data will be collected during video observation using an Enobio wireless system integrated with the platform.</description>
