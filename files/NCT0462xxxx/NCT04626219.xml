      The purpose of this study is to investigate areas of the brain responsible for appetite&#xD;
      regulation. More specifically, the investigators would like to study changes in brain&#xD;
      activation, e.g., changes in blood flow and oxygen use of the brain, during two different&#xD;
      states: Once when the participants are hungry, and once when the participants are not hungry.&#xD;
      The aim is to find out more about the neurobiology of Anorexia and Bulimia Nervosa by&#xD;
      comparing women who never had an eating disorder with women who have recovered from Anorexia&#xD;
      or Bulimia Nervosa.&#xD;

      The main goal of this study is to explore the effects of hunger and satiety on regions in our&#xD;
      brain in order to better understand the pathophysiology underlying restricted eating in&#xD;
      anorexics, and overeating in women with Bulimia Nervosa. The investigators will adopt a&#xD;
      paradigm that will model, in the laboratory, the naturalistic extremes of dietary intake&#xD;
      practiced by women recovered from Anorexia or Bulimia Nervosa by comparing a hungry state&#xD;
      (21-hour fast) to a satiated state (21-hour when fed). They may share an inability to&#xD;
      precisely modulate emotionality and reward in response to salient stimuli, such as food.&#xD;
      However, they may differ in terms of function of other pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incentive motivational drive to seek and consume food is a complex process, deriving from&#xD;
      interrelated psychobiological factors including food's rewarding properties, an individual's&#xD;
      homeostatic needs and cognitive ability to favor alternative behaviors. In order to examine&#xD;
      how these factors may contribute to dysregulated feeding behavior in women recovered from&#xD;
      Anorexia or Bulimia Nervosa, the investigators will explore measures of 1) anxiety; 2)&#xD;
      cognitive inhibition and dysinhibition; and 3) reward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will also be asked to undergo a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan of their head.&#xD;
      This scan uses powerful magnetic fields. The magnetic fields temporarily magnetize some of&#xD;
      the chemicals in our brain and this allows a scanner and a computer to take a very detailed&#xD;
      picture of the structure of our brain. During the MRI, the participants will be asked to lie&#xD;
      quietly inside the center of a large, doughnut shaped magnet for approximately 30 minutes.&#xD;
      The participant's head will be placed in a special, helmet-like &quot;head-holder&quot; to help them to&#xD;
      keep their head still. This part of the study will take place on the same day prior to the&#xD;
      first PET scan. In this protocol, only one MRI will be done. In subjects with a questionable&#xD;
      history of metallic fragments, an x-ray of the suspected body area will be performed before&#xD;
      the MRI to make sure the participants have no metal fragments in their body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to fMRI scanning there are a few other tests that will be administered. This&#xD;
      includes a Pre Study Taste Test, in order to prepare them for the fMRI taste task.&#xD;
      Participants will be presented five solutions of sucrose (2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 weight by&#xD;
      volume) and will then be asked to rate the pleasantness of each solution using a standard&#xD;
      seven-point preference scale (i.e., 1=extremely dislike; 7= extremely like). They will also&#xD;
      rate perceived sweetness of each solution using a seven-point category scale (i.e., 1=absent;&#xD;
      7=extreme). In addition, they will be presented variants of a tasteless solution Study&#xD;
      participants will be asked to choose the solution that has the least taste and this solution&#xD;
      will then be used during fMRI scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study takes place over the span of 4 consecutive days on location at the General Clinical&#xD;
      Research Center (GCRC) at the University of California in San Diego. During day 1 of the&#xD;
      study, lab work would be completed in the morning and several computerized and paper and&#xD;
      pencil tasks in the afternoon. Starting at noon of Day 2 and Day 3 of the study, subject&#xD;
      participants will undergo two identical 21-hour cycles. In one cycle, study participants will&#xD;
      refrain from eating after lunch at 12 noon until 9 a.m. the next morning and they will engage&#xD;
      in fMRI studies from 9 to 10:30 a.m. In the other cycle they will be given a standardized&#xD;
      diet from noon until 9 a.m. the next day and engage in fMRI studies from 9 to10:30 a.m. The&#xD;
      sequence of the two cycles will be randomized across subjects. Caloric consumption will also&#xD;
      be regulated. All subjects will receive exactly the same menu over the 4 days of the study.&#xD;
      They will eat only when at the GCRC and only when monitored by the GCRC staff. The total&#xD;
      daily energy requirement will be calculated as 30 kcal/kg body weight per day with a 53%&#xD;
      carbohydrate, 32% fat, 15% protein diet. Water will be provided with the amount consumed&#xD;
      recorded. Subjects will be allowed to consume their usual amounts of caffeinated beverages&#xD;
      but not allowed to use artificial or natural sweeteners or cream.&#xD;
