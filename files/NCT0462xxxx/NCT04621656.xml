  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a longitudinal study involving use of the January App which collects multiple data&#xD;
      streams and employs machine learning techniques to offer personalized lifestyle&#xD;
      recommendations and structured food and activity challenges.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Sugar Challenge Study is a real-world, longitudinal study aimed at understanding the&#xD;
      impact of lifestyle (i.e. food choices, physical activity and sleep patterns), genetics and&#xD;
      personalized lifestyle recommendations on blood glucose levels, blood pressure, immune system&#xD;
      status, stress hormone levels and microbiome composition. The purpose of this 10-day&#xD;
      observational study was to primarily elucidate the impact of food choices, physical activity,&#xD;
      and sleep patterns on an individual's blood glucose. In addition, we probed if continuous and&#xD;
      personalized feedback to participants would improve glycemic control acutely through better&#xD;
      decision making. Multiple investigations may be performed over an indefinite period of time&#xD;
      to improve the understanding of these interconnected relationships. For example, we will&#xD;
      perform studies to understand an individual's blood glucose response to an oral glucose load&#xD;
      or mixed meal. We will also perform studies to determine the phenotype (clinical, metabolic,&#xD;
      or immunologic) associated with a particular genotype. The data collected will be analyzed&#xD;
      using proprietary machine learning methods.&#xD;
