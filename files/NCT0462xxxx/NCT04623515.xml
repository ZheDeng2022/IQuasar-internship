  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators propose a retrospective cohort study to examine the impact of radiation therapy&#xD;
      on the global pelvic floor function of women who have completed the immediate surveillance&#xD;
      period for colorectal cancer&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objective: To characterize the impact of radiation therapy on the lower urinary and&#xD;
      bowel tract symptoms, (featuring urinary incontinence, irritative voiding symptoms, voiding&#xD;
      dysfunction, bowel incontinence, and defecatory dysfunction) of female survivors of&#xD;
      colorectal cancer 2-5 years after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize sexual dysfunctions present in female colorectal cancer survivors 2-5&#xD;
           years after treatment and to determine the impact of radiation therapy compared to&#xD;
           surgical treatment alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the impact of radiation therapy on the sexual function of the partner of&#xD;
           female survivors of colorectal cancer treated with radiation treatment.&#xD;

The instrument is based on 5 questions, with possible answers on a 5-point scale (ranging from &quot;never&quot; to &quot;all of the time&quot;). Scoring is 0-48 with higher scores equaling to a greater bother with urinary dysfunction in participants.</description>
