  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is being done to determine if metformin, a drug which is normally used in&#xD;
      diabetes, can reduce atrial fibrillation in patients who are having an ablation for atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation (AF). Atrial fibrillation is an abnormal heart rhythm which research has shown&#xD;
      is related in part to obesity and diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that the participants treated in the metformin arm will have greater&#xD;
      freedom from recurrent atrial arrhythmias after ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants enrolled in the trial will be assigned to one of the treatment arms (no&#xD;
      treatment or metformin) and have follow-up visits up to approximately 1 year after the&#xD;
      ablation. Additionally, all patients will also receive education on lifestyle changes and&#xD;
      exercise which are standard of care.&#xD;

It includes seven questions for subjects to report severity of symptoms (i.e. palpitations, shortness of breath at rest/physical activity, exercise intolerance, fatigue at rest, and lightheadedness/dizziness, chest pain or pressure) on a Likert scale from 0 (subject did not have this symptom) to 5 (symptom bothers subject a great deal).</description>

    <description>Metformin immediate release will be initiated at 250 milligrams (mg) daily (orally), and increased as tolerated to 2000 mg daily over a four week period. If a patient is unable to tolerate a dose increase they will return to their last tolerated dose after omitting one days dosing. Six weeks after the initiation of drug the patient will undergo (standard of care) ablation with the intent of achieving rhythm control.&#xD;
Participants will stay on the metformin 12 months after the ablation. In addition, all participants will receive education on lifestyle changes and exercise which are standard of care as well as have a discussion with their treating electrophysiologist and receive a handout.</description>
