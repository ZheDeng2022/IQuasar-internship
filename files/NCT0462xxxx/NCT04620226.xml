  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is a lack of literature on programs evaluating rapid screening methods to&#xD;
      traditional venipuncture methods for sample collection during screening for viral hepatitis.&#xD;
      Due to the relatively low diagnosis and linkage to care rate, screening programs that provide&#xD;
      same day results for viral hepatitis infection may improve both diagnosis and enable&#xD;
      providers to engage patients shortly after diagnosis. This stands in contrast to the&#xD;
      multi-visit, weeks long process that normally accompanies serum testing for hepatitis C virus&#xD;
      (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV). A few American studies have examined the implementation of&#xD;
      HCV inpatient screening programs; however, they are focused specifically on high-risk patient&#xD;
      populations, the barriers to accessing care experienced by study participants are not&#xD;
      relevant to the Canadian healthcare system context, and do not use rapid testing.&#xD;
      Furthermore, there are few, if any, data on HBV inpatient screening programs and the&#xD;
      diagnosis rate remains low. This project will provide key data on a rapid inpatient screening&#xD;
      and linkage to care strategy as well as the prevalence of these viruses across different age&#xD;
      bands within the population. Finally, the study will help determine whether rapid inpatient&#xD;
      screening is a feasible and acceptable approach for screening and linkage to care.&#xD;

    <description>Rapid Point-of-Care testing will provide participants with a HCV antibody and RNA result within 2 hours. If the participant is HCV RNA+, they will receive an inpatient consultation from a liver specialist prior to discharge. We hypothesize that this model will minimize losses in the continuum-of-care and improve linkages to care.</description>
