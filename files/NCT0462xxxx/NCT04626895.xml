  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will measure the efficacy of scalp cooling with the Paxman Scalp Cooling (PSC)&#xD;
      device in a diverse patient population with success measured as prevention of more than 50%&#xD;
      hair loss during chemotherapy. We propose that scalp cooling has distinct efficacy in&#xD;
      participants with black or ethnic-minority hair types due to differences in textures, hair&#xD;
      thickness. This study will examine the success rate of scalp cooling in black patients&#xD;
      receiving chemotherapy for breast or gynecological cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to measure the efficacy of the PSC device in preventing CIA in this&#xD;
      diverse patient population with success measured as prevention of &gt;grade 2 alopecia by&#xD;
      self-report using the modified Dean scale or the VAS scale in &gt;50% of participants using the&#xD;
      intervention. We propose that scalp cooling has distinct efficacy in participants with black&#xD;
      or ethnic-minority hair types due to differences in textures, hair thickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims include delivery of scalp cooling at each chemotherapy cycle with measurements&#xD;
      of CIA at assigned intervals using patient self-report measured by the modified Dean scale&#xD;
      and the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims are provider assessments of alopecia as measured by the NCI grading scale&#xD;
      of alopecia, adverse effects of scalp cooling procedures such as headaches, dizziness, and&#xD;
      pain, reasons for refusal or drop-out of study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychosocial and quality-of- life (QOL) effects of CIA in study participants will be measured&#xD;
      using patient reported outcomes. The EORTC QLQ-B45 and Chemotherapy-Induced-Alopecia-Distress&#xD;
      Scale (CADS) will be administered at designated time intervals.&#xD;

    <description>Psychosocial assessments of chemotherapy-induced alopecia will be measured by validated CADS (Chemotherapy-induced Alopecia Distress Scale) at designated time intervals. The questionnaire is composed of a 4-point likert Scale and 4 multi-items distress domain that include Physical (2 questions), Emotional (6 questions), Activity (6 questions) and Relationship (1 question). A score of 4 for each domain indicates greater distress. A score of 1 represents no distress.</description>
