  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the combined effects of hypoxia and a short bout of&#xD;
      subconcussive head impacts on neurocognitive and ocular-motor function and plasma expression&#xD;
      of brain-derived blood biomarkers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of the pilot study is to observe preliminary trends in neural response to&#xD;
      subconcussive head impacts in hypoxic condition. This work will provide a critical un-tested&#xD;
      knowledge regarding the combined effects of subconcussion and hypoxic condition (mimicking&#xD;
      high altitude), which will be used in our upcoming grant proposal to the Department of&#xD;
      Defense (DoD). Military personnel, particularly those who are deployed to Afghanistan, are&#xD;
      constantly subjected to hypoxic condition, given that the majority of military land&#xD;
      operations in Afghanistan occur at 2000-3000 meters (6500-10,000 feet). This level of&#xD;
      altitude does not elicit major side effects, yet neural functions may experience some degree&#xD;
      of perturbation (i.e., slowed reaction time, altered night vision). Concurrently, these&#xD;
      military personnel, who operate at high altitudes, often incur subconcussive forces to the&#xD;
      head. These subconcussive head impacts can be induced by exposure to, for example, flash-bang&#xD;
      grenades, artillery fire, recoilless rifle, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and head&#xD;
      collision. The combined effects of these two stressors have the potential to attenuate one's&#xD;
      readiness, operational efficiency, and overall brain function, but the combined effects have&#xD;
      never been studied to date. As a result, one of four study topics that the Defense Centers of&#xD;
      Excellence deems urgent is: Document the effects of altitude exposure on mild traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury (mTBI) and blast-induced neurotrauma (BINT). To answer the question, we hypothesized&#xD;
      that there will be an exponential worsening in neurocognitive function and in ocular-motor&#xD;
      system functioning, and increased plasma expression of brain-derived biomarkers, after&#xD;
      subconcussive head impacts under hypoxic conditions.&#xD;

    <description>Large weather balloons will be filled with a normobaric hypoxic inspirate (FiO2 = 0.15) produced by a nitrogen generator (CAT 12; Colorado Altitude Training, Boulder, CO) to simulate an altitude of 2600 m (8500 ft). Participants breathed this inspirate through a two-way non-rebreathing valve (2700; Hans Rudolph, Kansas City, KS) and an oronasal mask (7450 V2; Hans Rudolph, Kansas City, KS).&#xD;
Participants breathed this inspirate from 15 minutes before the pre-heading time point until the conclusion of the 0h post-heading time point.</description>

    <intervention_name>Soccer heading</intervention_name>
    <description>A standardized and reliable soccer heading protocol will be used to induce subconcussive impacts for the experiment. A triaxial accelerometer (Triax Technologies, Norwalk, CT) embedded in a head-band pocket and positioned back of the head to monitor linear and rotational head accelerations. A JUGS soccer machine (JUGS Sports, Tualatin, OR) will be used to simulate a soccer throw-in with a standardized ball speed of 25 mph across all groups. The ball speed is similar to when soccer players make a long throw-in from the sideline to mid-field. Soccer players frequently perform this maneuver during practices and games. Participants will stand approximately 40ft away from the machine to perform the heading. Participants will perform a total of 10 headers at a rate of 1 header per minute and will be instructed to direct the ball back towards the JUGS machine. Previous uses of this soccer heading model have reported an average peak linear acceleration per header of 14.5 to 33.5 g.</description>
