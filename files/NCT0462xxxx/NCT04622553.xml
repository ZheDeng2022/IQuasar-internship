      Open-label Extension Study to Evaluate the Long-term Safety and Efficacy of Mexiletine in&#xD;
      Paediatric Patients with Myotonic Disorders Who Have Completed the MEX-NM-301 study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label extension study evaluating the long-term efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      mexiletine in paediatric patients with myotonic disorders who have completed the initial&#xD;
      parent paediatric study with mexiletine (Protocol No. MEX-NM-301 (PIP Study 4) for children&#xD;
      and adolescents aged 6 to &lt; 18 years and who continue to meet the eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet the eligibility criteria and provide consent for this study will be&#xD;
      enrolled sequentially by decreasing age groups. Patients aged 12 to &lt; 18 years will enter&#xD;
      first as this is the first cohort expected to complete the parent study PIP Study 4 based on&#xD;
      top down recruiting. Once initial pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and efficacy are confirmed in&#xD;
      this population, patients aged 6 to &lt;12 years will be first enrolled in PIP Study 4 and&#xD;
      subsequently this study (PIP Study 7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will receive mexiletine at a dose determined in the parent study. Dosing is&#xD;
      determined according to body weight and tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes 9 clinic visits - V1 (baseline), and V2 to V9 every 3 months,&#xD;
      approximately, thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of study will be 24 months per patient. End-of-treatment (EOT) visit will&#xD;
      occur at 24 months or in accordance with the availability of product. The overall study&#xD;
      duration would be approximately 5 years.&#xD;
