  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study conducts a preliminary test of an intervention program delivered in the home to&#xD;
      assist families of preschool-age children with social, emotional, and behavioral development,&#xD;
      and the acquisition of healthy lifestyle behaviors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Utilizing referrals from community-based organizations serving high-risk families, this study&#xD;
      addresses both health and behavioral domains through a family-based intervention. The&#xD;
      home-delivered prevention intervention includes content on strengthening positive behaviors&#xD;
      in children, managing misbehavior, and addressing healthy lifestyle choices. Families engage&#xD;
      in practical skill building and have the opportunity to practice these skills and receive&#xD;
      feedback.&#xD;

    <description>The Child Behavior Inventory will be utilized to measure parent report of child behavior problems. It is a 36-item measure that records the parent's perception of intensity of the child's disruptive behaviors and whether or not the parent believes this behavior is a problem. Intensity of the child's behavior problem is continuous, ranging from 1 (i.e., child never engages in the behavior) to 7 (i.e., child always engages in the behavior). For behaviors the child engages in, parents respond whether or not this a problem for them.</description>

    <measure>Parental stress</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, pre-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Parental stress will be measured with the Parenting Daily Hassles Scale (PDHS). Parenting stress is associated with parenting behaviors and child behavior problems. The PDHS is a 20-item instrument that measures the extent to which parents feel daily stress from routine events that can make life difficult for families with young children. Frequency scores range from 0-80 with higher scores indicating more frequent child behavior problems. Intensity scores range from 0-100 with higher scores indicating a higher intensity of parenting hassles.</description>
