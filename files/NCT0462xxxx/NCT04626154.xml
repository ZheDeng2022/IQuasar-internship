  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that a simple 3-point tracking device that uses motion sensors&#xD;
      attached to the abdomen and chest of a child will provide information regarding&#xD;
      thoracoabdominal asynchrony (TAA), a major component of respiratory distress, and ultimately&#xD;
      help guide a clinician to initiate, escalate, de-escalate, or stop respiratory support&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS To determine if the TAA-monitoring device can be used to detect differences in&#xD;
      respiratory synchrony in a manner that is clinically applicable. The investigators hope that&#xD;
      the device will detect 1) major asynchrony events in a timely manner so as to prompt&#xD;
      clinician intervention during future use; and 2) asynchrony events that may be less visible&#xD;
      to the naked eye that may be precursors to more severe events.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Respiratory diseases are a major global cause of morbidity and mortality in children. Of&#xD;
      patients admitted into a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), respiratory illnesses have&#xD;
      been identified as the leading principal admission diagnosis in every age group, accounting&#xD;
      for 37.9% of patients under 12 months of age and 28.5% of PICU patients across all age&#xD;
      groups. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status is important for the guidance of&#xD;
      respiratory support escalation and de-escalation decisions in the PICU. A clinical metric&#xD;
      that has been suggested as a signature of breathing effort is thoracoabdominal asynchrony&#xD;
      (TAA), the non-coincident motion of the rib cage and abdomen during breathing. A reliable,&#xD;
      objective assessment tool for continuous monitoring of respiratory effort could allow for a&#xD;
      more complete understanding of patients' real-time respiratory status and provide an&#xD;
      additional indication or contraindication for the utilization of various levels of&#xD;
      respiratory support. Limiting the use of invasive ventilatory support by early detection of&#xD;
      respiratory distress would decrease clinical risk to patients and has the potential to&#xD;
      decrease the cost of patient stays in the PICU. The investigators have developed a&#xD;
      non-invasive TAA-sensing device designed for use by clinicians to indirectly quantify&#xD;
      respiratory effort among pediatric patients (henceforth referred to as the &quot;TAA-monitoring&#xD;
      device&quot;). The device utilizes motion-tracking sensors that capture data that is then&#xD;
      processed to provide a quantitative indication of a patient's respiratory status. Given the&#xD;
      promising yet inconclusive nature of the evidence supporting the use of TAA as an indicator&#xD;
      of respiratory effort, clinical validation of this device is a necessary step to take to&#xD;
      support its continued development.&#xD;
