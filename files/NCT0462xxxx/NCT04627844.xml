      Trauma patients who require Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement for&#xD;
      feeding and who consent to be in the study will be randomized to receive feeding at either 6&#xD;
      hours after PEG placement as is routinely done or at 0 hours after PEG placement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill patients share a common hypermetabolic response to injury, deterioration in&#xD;
      lean body mass, and a high rate of septic complications. Route of nutrition administration&#xD;
      influences the response to injury. A well-fed intestine absorbs nutrients while maintaining&#xD;
      an effective barrier against pathogens, added by adequate peristalsis, mucin production, and&#xD;
      immunoglobulin A secretion. In critical care patients, enteral nutritional therapy (EN)&#xD;
      feeding has been shown to restores normal gut architecture and microflora, improve the immune&#xD;
      system response, and aid the mucosa in withstanding insult to the system. Studies have shown&#xD;
      that those on EN feeding have reduced morbidity and mortality rates as well as fewer&#xD;
      infections and have less line-associated sepsis when compared to parenteral nutritional&#xD;
      therapy (PN) feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are multiple EN feeding methods. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) was first&#xD;
      introduced in 1980, and due to PEG being low cost, minimally invasive, and having no need for&#xD;
      Bernal anesthetic in most cases, it is considered a better choice for the introduction of&#xD;
      feeding than other methods. PEG tubes are usually entered for periods of tube feeding lasting&#xD;
      more than 30 days, as well as when a nasogastric tube cannot but used for nutritional&#xD;
      support. However, compared to naso-enteric tubes, PEG tubes are associated with fewer&#xD;
      complications, greater patient comfort, better aesthetic appearance, and improved patient&#xD;
      quality of life. For this reason, PEG is currently the method of choice for medium- and long-&#xD;
      term enteral feeding. Previous studies have found complication rates within 30 days of PEG&#xD;
      tube placement to be 10-15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, post-PEG insertion, feeding was delayed until the next day for fear of&#xD;
      peritoneal leakage risk after feeding. However, multiple studies have shown that feeding&#xD;
      after PEG can be started early, within hours without a significant increase in the&#xD;
      procedure-related morbidity or mortality and thereby reducing the healthier costs. There is&#xD;
      currently no standard of practice for the timing of enteral feeding following PEG placement.&#xD;
      Each group has different practice guidelines, and no national consensus has been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have indicated that the initiation of tube feeding three to four hours after an&#xD;
      uncomplicated PEG was safe, well-tolerated, and helped to reduce the hospital stay. A&#xD;
      systematic analysis of five studies found that there were no significant differences between&#xD;
      enteral feeds beginning at 3 hours versus feeds beginning at later times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's current institution does not have a standard of practice for time to begin&#xD;
      feeding after PEG tube placement; that decision is currently provider dependent. A survey of&#xD;
      providers at the investigator's institutions indicated that the most common time to begin&#xD;
      feeds is 6 hours, however, providers at the institution use varied times to beginning feeds&#xD;
      between 0 and 24 hours after placement. The current literature supports a reduction in&#xD;
      complications at feeds beginning under four hours. In fact, all studies investigating shorter&#xD;
      time to feeds have found no associated increase in complications. No study to date has&#xD;
      investigated immediately beginning tube feeds. There is no national consensus regarding&#xD;
      feeding time after placement. Given the shown benefits of early enteral nutrition on reducing&#xD;
      mortality and complications across a variety of conditions, the investigators believe early&#xD;
      feeding has the strong potential to improve patient morbidity and mortality following PEG&#xD;
      tube placement. This study aims to investigate whether beginning feeds immediately is a safe&#xD;
      and effective management option for patients.&#xD;
