  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament) ruptures is relatively high, primarily due&#xD;
      to sports and military training injuries. With the advancements of ACL reconstruction&#xD;
      therapies, there exist two ways to reconstruct ACL: single-bundle ACL reconstruction (SBACLR)&#xD;
      and double-bundle ACL reconstruction (DBACLR). Previous research studies claimed that DBACLR&#xD;
      techniques are superior to that of SBACLR, while others stated no notable differences between&#xD;
      the two. The variables assessed in previous studies are findings related to the clinical&#xD;
      instabilities of the knees (both subjective nor objectives views) and standard radiology&#xD;
      examination, such as Xray or MRI. Knee instabilities are the primary goal of ACL&#xD;
      reconstructions. Hence this study focuses on finding the dissimilarities between the two&#xD;
      previously mentioned techniques by observing the early consequences (subclinically) of knee&#xD;
      instabilities towards cartilage damage. The dissimilarities assessments utilize biomolecular&#xD;
      tests (ELISA) of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) on synovial joint fluid of the&#xD;
      knee and knee joint cartilage examination using MRI T2 mapping. Furthermore, there will be a&#xD;
      stability (biomechanical) check of the knee joint in the form of a Lachman test, a pivot&#xD;
      shift test, and a Rolimeter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study requires around 47-52 subjects divided into two operation techniques of SBACLR and&#xD;
      DBACLR. To evaluate the results from COMP, MRI T2 mapping, Lachman test, pivot shift test,&#xD;
      and Rolimeter, this study is divided into three timeframes: before an operation, three months&#xD;
      after post-operation, and six months post-operations. The differences between the test&#xD;
      variables are then used as an indicator to assess the cartilage conditions from two operation&#xD;
      techniques: SBACLR and DBACLR. Subsequently, the study also examines the possible correlation&#xD;
      of each of the resulting variables.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study utilizes a single-blind randomized clinical trial to evaluate whether the DBACL&#xD;
      reconstruction surgery is more suitable than SBACL reconstruction in the subclinical aspect&#xD;
      of cartilage damage through a biomolecular examination from the synovial joint fluid COMP and&#xD;
      MRI T2 mapping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study's estimated time is between two to three years ranging from January 2018 until the&#xD;
      end of June 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples are randomly divided into two groups: the SBACLR group and the DBACLR group. The&#xD;
      sample size for each group was 26 subjects. For the subjects, the accepted inclusion criteria&#xD;
      were male, age 18-40 years, total primary AC rupture, injury time 1-12 months, willingness to&#xD;
      attend the study, and signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria include subjects having other ligament injuries in the knee, history of&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis, severe osteoarthritis Kellgren-Lawrence grading&gt; 2, Body Mass Index&#xD;
      (BMI) ≥ 25, fracture around the knee joint or osteochondral avulsion, history of injury with&#xD;
      either or both semitendinosus or gracilis muscle, patellofemoral instability,&#xD;
      contraindication of anesthesia, and partial ACL rupture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drop Out criteria includes: subjects not returning to control, undergoing treatment outside&#xD;
      the program, not complying with study protocols, re-injury to the studied knee causing&#xD;
      ligament, meniscus or cartilage injury, and postoperative knee infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective subjects have been diagnosed with the total loss of ACL and meet the research&#xD;
      criteria are explained about the aims and objectives of the study and sign a consent form to&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject was assigned to one of the study groups through a simple randomization method:&#xD;
      the SBACL reconstruction surgery action group or the DBACL reconstruction surgery action&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects were examined the Lachman test, pivot test, Rolimeter measurement, MRI T2&#xD;
      mapping, and knee joint fluid for ELISA examination of sfCOMP (synovial fluid COMP) at the&#xD;
      time before surgery, the third month, and the sixth month postoperatively.&#xD;
