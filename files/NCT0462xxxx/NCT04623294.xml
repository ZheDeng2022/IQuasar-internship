  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess brain death and deep coma with the self-made near infrared&#xD;
      spectroscopy (NIRS) instrument. The investigators used the noninvasive method to monitor the&#xD;
      Δ[HbO2] (the concentration changes in oxy-hemoglobin) and Δ[Hb] (the concentration changes in&#xD;
      deoxy-hemoglobin) in the region around the forehead of medically evaluated participating&#xD;
      patients and healthy subjects. A multiple-phase protocol at varied fraction of inspired O2&#xD;
      were utilized during the assessment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brain death is an irreversible loss of all brain functions, while deep coma is a profound&#xD;
      state of unconsciousness associated with depressed cerebral activity. Timely distinguishing&#xD;
      the two states is crucial for saving patients. The noninvasive, sensitive, universally&#xD;
      available, and timely ancillary method to assess brain death and deep coma has not been&#xD;
      established. This study aims to explore a noninvasive and straightforward way in brain death&#xD;
      and deep coma online assessment. The changes of hemodynamic parameters including&#xD;
      oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) and deoxyhemoglobin (Hb) were detected by near infrared spectroscopy&#xD;
      instrument attached on the forehead of participators. A multiple-phase protocol at varied&#xD;
      fraction of inspired O2(FIO2) were utilized during the assessment. Then the investigators&#xD;
      compared the multiple physiological parameters changes among different groups at different&#xD;
      FIO2.&#xD;
