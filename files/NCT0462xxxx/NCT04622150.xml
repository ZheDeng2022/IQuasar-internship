      Approximately one in two individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) are non-adherent with&#xD;
      medication, often leading to severe and negative consequences. Unfortunately, there is no&#xD;
      widely used evidence-based approach to target poor adherence among individuals with BD.&#xD;
      Building upon positive efficacy trial results, the proposed project will test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of technology-facilitated Customized Adherence Enhancement (CAE) vs. enhanced&#xD;
      treatment as usual (eTAU) using a prospective randomized controlled design in public mental&#xD;
      health care settings and preferentially enrolling poorly adherent/high-risk individuals with&#xD;
      BD. Deliverables include a curriculum-driven adherence enhancement approach that can be&#xD;
      implemented in public healthcare settings and which can improve outcomes for the most&#xD;
      vulnerable groups of people with BD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A cornerstone of treatment uniformly recommended for individuals with bipolar disorder (BD)&#xD;
      is mood stabilizing medication. However, approximately one in two individuals with BD are&#xD;
      non-adherent with medication, often leading to severe and negative consequences.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, there is no widely used evidence-based approach to target poor adherence in&#xD;
      BD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Customized Adherence Enhancement (CAE), developed by this study team, is a brief, practical&#xD;
      BD-specific approach that identifies individual adherence barriers and then targets these&#xD;
      areas for intervention using a flexibly-administered modular format. A prospective, 6-month,&#xD;
      randomized controlled efficacy trial (RCT) of CAE vs. a rigorous control, BD-specific&#xD;
      education (EDU) found that medication adherence and functional status were improved in CAE&#xD;
      vs. EDU for poorly-adherent patients. Remarkably, the benefits of CAE occurred in individuals&#xD;
      who had been living with BD, on average, for over 2 decades. While promising, the original&#xD;
      efficacy RCT was limited by the fact that it was performed in an academic medical center, did&#xD;
      not make use of existing web/text messaging technology, and did not address potential&#xD;
      challenges to scale-up in standard clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In response to PA-18-722 &quot;Improving Patient Adherence to Treatment and Prevention Regimens to&#xD;
      Promote Health&quot;, this Type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation project will adapt CAE for&#xD;
      use in community/public-sector care settings, test effectiveness in high-risk, poorly&#xD;
      adherent individuals in these settings, and gather evidence on barriers and facilitators to&#xD;
      implementation of the intervention in order to inform subsequent scale-up. The project will&#xD;
      examine putative mechanistic engagement targets suggested by previous work and include&#xD;
      implementation elements that will inform future dissemination should findings be positive.&#xD;
      The project will be implemented in 4 specific aims: 1) Refine the CAE intervention guided by&#xD;
      stakeholders at a community mental health clinic (CMHC) and a safety-net county healthcare&#xD;
      system, 2) Test the effectiveness of technology-facilitated CAE vs. enhanced treatment as&#xD;
      usual (eTAU) using a prospective, 2-site RCT, 3) Test the effects of CAE vs. eTAU on&#xD;
      functional status in poorly adherent individuals with BD, and 4) Identify barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators to CAE implementation in order to inform subsequent scale-up and spread using&#xD;
      qualitative methods and guided by implementation conceptual models. Additional exploratory&#xD;
      analysis will assess whether changes in patient-level adherence barriers and facilitators&#xD;
      mediate the treatment effects on adherence. Finally, the project will evaluate on-site&#xD;
      (outpatient visits, no-show rates) and off-site (emergency department visits,&#xD;
      hospitalizations) health resource use to help characterize relative value and inform future&#xD;
      sustainability efforts. An over-arching goal of this project will be to provide a&#xD;
      curriculum-driven adherence enhancement approach that can be implemented in public-sector&#xD;
      care settings and which can improve outcomes for the most vulnerable groups of people with&#xD;
      BD.&#xD;

    <description>CAE is comprised of a series of up to four treatment modules whose inclusion is determined based upon an individuals reasons for nonadherence (adherence barriers).The standardized modules are Psychoeducation, Modified Motivational Interviewing, Communication with Providers, Medication Routines. CAE participants will have a core series of approximately four sessions spaced about one week apart over a period of 4-6 weeks, and one booster in-person session 4 weeks after the completion of the four core sessions (total of approximately 5 sessions). Sessions 2-4 will be delivered remotely by the study interventionist. All participants will have the first session in-person. The final booster session will be conducted at the sites and will review all previously introduced materials. There will be a follow-up phone call with the study interventionist that will occur in the four-week time period between completion of four CAE core sessions and prior to initiation of the booster CAE session.</description>

We will work with NIMH to transform the data we collect into relevant information using the suggested consent form language, NIMH software that will create global unique identifiers and a useful data dictionary as much as we are able in order to deposit data into the National Database allowing other researchers and NIMH to use available data.&#xD;
In line with accepted data sharing practices and ethical principles, we will share de-identified raw data with other researchers attempting to replicate our findings or including our findings in subsequent projects.</ipd_description>
