      To show that maintenance therapy with Tislelizumab plus Anlotinib will prolong Progression&#xD;
      Free Survival in subjects with extensive stage disease small cell lung cancer who have&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most patients with extensive disease small cell lung cancer (ED-SCLC) respond to first&#xD;
      line（1L） platinum-based chemotherapy; however, responses are not durable and prognosis is&#xD;
      poor. Currently no maintenance treatments are approved in SCLC to prolong the durability of&#xD;
      efficacy achieved with 1L chemotherapy. Immuno-oncology agents have demonstrated efficacy in&#xD;
      the treatment of ED-SCLC when administered across different lines of therapy. Tislelizumab&#xD;
      (Anti-PD-1 antibody) Combine Etoposide+ platinum （EP） had improved median Overall survival&#xD;
      （mOS ） to 15.6m of 1L ED-SCLC in the Rationale 206 study. Anlotinib ( RTKi ) had&#xD;
      significantly improved PFS &amp; OS of 3L(third line) ED-SCLC in the ALTER 1202. This phase II&#xD;
      study is designed to explore the effect and safety of the combination as maintenance therapy&#xD;
      for ED-SCLC after 1L chemotherapy&#xD;
