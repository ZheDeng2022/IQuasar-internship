  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PYCC is a system for parents of young children (2-5 years old) with Disruptive Behavior&#xD;
      Problems (DBPs). The program is designed with the intentions of being used a pediatric&#xD;
      primary care visit. Parents that report elevated child behavior problems go through a three&#xD;
      part program. First, they go through a brief intervention on a tablet (i.e., the initial&#xD;
      check-up) to receive feedback and learn about the PYCC; the aim is to build motivation to&#xD;
      make parenting changes and engage in the parenting young children check-up. Next, parents&#xD;
      receive text messages to connect them to further parent training content. Finally, parent&#xD;
      training content is delivered via a web-based resource (i.e., the PYCC website), which&#xD;
      includes videos to teach parenting skills. In this pilot RCT, the investigators will focus on&#xD;
      examining the impact of the brief intervention (i.e., the initial check-up). Secondarily, the&#xD;
      investigators will examine overall impact of the whole PYCC program and use of the parenting&#xD;
      training website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will learn about the research opportunity through select community-based&#xD;
      organizations in Detroit, Michigan, local posting, and a local participant registry. Through&#xD;
      a phone call, parents will complete a demographics questionnaire and the DBP screener. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to screen 200 parents in order to enroll 40 parents in the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If parents report elevated DBPs and do not meet any exclusion criteria, then they will be&#xD;
      eligible to further participate. Parents that are eligible will complete a consent form&#xD;
      (i.e., an online information sheet) and then be randomly assigned to intervention (n = 20) or&#xD;
      control (n = 20). Both groups will complete a brief baseline. Both groups will also learn&#xD;
      about the Parenting Young Children Check-up (PYCC). However, the way in which they learn&#xD;
      about the program will differ. The control group will see a brief description about the&#xD;
      program (i.e., an online flier) and will receive a brochure for the program through the mail.&#xD;
      The intervention group will go through the full PYCC initial check-up and also receive a&#xD;
      brochure through the mail. Both groups will receive text messages prompting them to engage in&#xD;
      the PYCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After initial participation, parents will be free to use, or not use, the Parenting Young&#xD;
      Children Check-up web-based resource as much as they want. Parents will enter their phone&#xD;
      number and first name when accessing the web-based content in order for use to track their&#xD;
      engagement. All use of the web-based resource will start with &quot;Session 1. In this, they will&#xD;
      choose what parenting skills they want to learn. If parents go through session 1, they will&#xD;
      be further connected to PYCC content through tailored text messages. Texts contain links to&#xD;
      all PYCC web-based content. Parents will be able to learn content related to &quot;Special Time,&quot;&#xD;
      &quot;Labeled Praise,&quot; &quot;Family Rules,&quot; &quot;Effective Commands,&quot; &quot;Offering Choices,&quot; &quot;Routines,&quot;&#xD;
      &quot;Removing Attention,&quot; &quot;Logical Consequences,&quot; and &quot;Time out.&quot; All content of the PYCC is&#xD;
      based on evidence-based parent training program content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this project is evaluate the Parenting Young Children Check-up. In particular,&#xD;
      the investigators are interested in if the initial check-up leads parents to engage in the&#xD;
      PYCC (i.e., completing session 1 and using the parent training content on the PYCC website).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis: The intervention group (i.e. those randomized to complete the full&#xD;
      initial check-up) will visit the parent training website more than the control group. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that, compared to the control group, more parents in the control&#xD;
      group with complete &quot;session 1,&quot; and use the PYCC web-based content to learn parenting skills&#xD;
      (i.e., more parents will use any of this content and parents will use it more frequently).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis (a): Participants assigned to the intervention group, as compared to&#xD;
      those in the control group, will have higher scores for all domains consistent with the&#xD;
      Theory of Planned Behavior at follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis (b). Participants in the intervention group will report high levels of&#xD;
      satisfaction (i.e., &gt;=4 on a 5-point scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also explore the impact of the PYCC on reported parenting and child&#xD;
      behavior problems. Furthermore, the investigators will explore the impact of the initial&#xD;
      check-up on intentions to use the parent training website.&#xD;
