  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In response to large numbers of senior center clients who suffer untreated depression and the&#xD;
      dearth of geriatric mental health providers, the investigators have simplified Behavioral&#xD;
      Activation to be delivered by lay volunteers (&quot;Do More, Feel Better&quot;; DMFB). The focus of&#xD;
      Behavioral Activation is to guide clients to reengage in daily pleasant and rewarding&#xD;
      activities, and reduce depressive symptoms. If the investigators can show that the lay&#xD;
      delivery model has positive impact in comparison to MSW-delivered Behavioral Activation, the&#xD;
      investigators will have identified an effective intervention that can be used by a large&#xD;
      untapped workforce of older adult volunteers across the nation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Collaborative R01 application (UW, Cornell, USF) proposes to conduct an effectiveness&#xD;
      trial of lay-delivered Behavioral Activation (&quot;Do More, Feel Better&quot;; DMFB), in comparison to&#xD;
      MSW-delivered Behavioral Activation (MSW BA), for depressed (PHQ-9&gt;10 and Ham-D&gt;14) older&#xD;
      (60+) senior center clients. The primary aim tests the effectiveness of DMFB, in comparison&#xD;
      to MSW BA, on increasing overall activity level (target) and reducing depression symptoms.&#xD;
      The investigators will test whether increased activity level predicts greater reduction in&#xD;
      depression severity and whether increased activity's impact on depression is non-inferior&#xD;
      across conditions. Secondarily, the investigators will test hypotheses associated with&#xD;
      overall functioning, satisfaction with treatment, and client-level moderators. Lastly the&#xD;
      investigators will explore longer-term client outcomes, delivery cost, and preparing for&#xD;
      sustainability by exploring client, provider, and center factors related to intervention&#xD;
      fidelity.&#xD;

    <measure>Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline HAM-D at 3, 6, 9, 24, and 36 weeks after treatment starts</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-D will be used as measure of depressive symptom severity. The HAM-D is a clinically administered measure and has been validated in a variety of psychiatric populations.</description>

    <measure>Behavioral Activation Scale (BADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline BADS at 3, 6, 9, 24, and 36 weeks after treatment starts</time_frame>
    <description>The BADS will be used as the primary target measure, and yields a total score reflecting level of engagement in reinforcing activities. The BADS has shown good psychometric properties; studies have validated the BADS as a mechanism by which behavioral activation interventions reduces depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline WHODAS-II at 3, 6, 9, 24, and 36 weeks after treatment starts</time_frame>
    <description>The World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule II (WHODAS II)-12 item form will be used to assess overall functioning. This instrument is cross-culturally applicable and treats all disorders at parity when determining level of functioning. The WHODAS II assesses 6 domains: a. understanding and communicating; b.&#xD;
getting around; c. self-care; d. getting along with others; e. household and work activities; and f. participation in society. Each domain has factor loading of at least 0.70 and the items also load on a general disability factor which will be used in this proposal.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Client Satisfaction with Treatment (CSQ)- 3 Item</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at 3, 6, and 9 weeks after treatment starts</time_frame>
    <description>The 3-item version of the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ) will be used as a patient self-report measure of satisfaction with study interventions. The CSQ has high internal consistency and successfully distinguishes degrees of satisfaction even at the high end.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Intervention Fidelity</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly for 9 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The &quot;Do More, Feel Better&quot; and BADT-R fidelity forms will be used by external raters to assess each interventionist's fidelity to the respective treatment modality. Global scores range from 0-6, with scores &gt;3 indicating satisfactory levels of fidelity.</description>
