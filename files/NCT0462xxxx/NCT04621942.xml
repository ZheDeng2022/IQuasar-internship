      The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of inertial rehabilitation on: shoulder&#xD;
      flexors, extensors and shoulder abductors and adductors strength, breast cancer-related&#xD;
      lymphedema (BCRL) and quality of life in women after mastectomy. Twenty-four women after&#xD;
      mastectomy were randomized to a training (T; n = 12) or control group (C; n = 12). The T&#xD;
      group performed inertial training twice a week for 6 weeks using a Cyklotren inertial device.&#xD;
      Each training session included warm-up and 4 sets of shoulder ﬂexors, extensors, abductors,&#xD;
      and adductors, with the right and left arms worked. The training loads for all exercises was&#xD;
      equal 5 kg. Before and after training the maximum force of trained muscles was tested under&#xD;
      training conditions. Body composition, BCRL, disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand&#xD;
      (DASH) were also evaluated. Inertial rehabilitation caused significant improvement in&#xD;
      strength in all tested muscles in T whereas changes in C were insignificant. Quality of life&#xD;
      evaluated by DASH score decreased significantly in T and and did not change in C. Moreover,&#xD;
      BCRL and body composition did not change significantly following intervention in both groups.&#xD;
      Inertial exercises can be useful rehabilitation method in women treated for breast cancer.&#xD;

      A group of 30 women who underwent mastectomy procedure attended an initial meeting and all of&#xD;
      them agreed to participate in the study. The participants were members of an association of&#xD;
      people after mastectomy (Amazons Association) and regularly participated in rehabilitation&#xD;
      gymnastics twice a week for at least 3 years. All women met the including criteria:&#xD;
      mastectomy was performed at least 6 months before the study, lack of: fractures in the prior&#xD;
      3 months, tendon and ligament injuries in the prior 2 months, serious heart disease, cerebral&#xD;
      palsy, and limb amputations. All subjects received permission from their physician to&#xD;
      participate in the experiment. Therefore, the study finally included 24 women after&#xD;
      mastectomy (age, 66.2 ± 10.6 years, range 43-82 years; body mass, 72.7 ± 10.6 kg; height, 159&#xD;
      ± 5.2 cm), 17 after simple mastectomy and 7 after breast conserving therapy. The participants&#xD;
      were randomly allocated into two groups: a training group (T; n = 12) and a control group (C;&#xD;
      n = 12) using chit method. The T group participated in 6 weeks of inertial training while the&#xD;
      control group maintain their normal daily activity. All women still participated in&#xD;
      rehabilitation gymnastics twice a week. All participants gave written informed consent to&#xD;
      take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after training participants were evaluated using the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  strength of shoulder muscles measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  body composition measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand test (DASH)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strength of shoulder muscles measurement. Strength of shoulder flexors and extensors and&#xD;
      strength of shoulder abductors and adductors were tested in the standing position using&#xD;
      Cyklotren inertial device (Naczk 2015). After warm-up, each participant performed a 10-second&#xD;
      maximal test of the right and left arm separately, with a 2-minute break between&#xD;
      measurements. Participants position during strength testing and inertial training is showed&#xD;
      on Figure1. For all measurement 5 kg load was applied. It should be noted here that the same&#xD;
      load during inertial training doesn't mean the working muscles develop the same force. During&#xD;
      inertial exercise force developed by muscle strongly depend on movement velocity, greater&#xD;
      movement velocity results greater muscle load and greater force is developed (the force value&#xD;
      is presented on-line on the Cyklotren's screen). The range of motion was approximately 90&#xD;
      degree (where 0 degrees corresponded to the arm along the trunk). Data collection was&#xD;
      preceded by a familiarization session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body composition measurements Bioelectric impedance were used to evaluate the body&#xD;
      composition of participants (Tanita 980 MC, Japan). The participants were asked to maintain a&#xD;
      normal state of hydration, and they were not allowed to exercise, eat, or drink alcohol or&#xD;
      caffeine for 12 h preceding the measurements. Measurements were conducted in the morning&#xD;
      according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Fat mass, muscle mass, amount of water were used&#xD;
      in future analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast cancer-related lymphedema evaluation To evaluate the influence of inertial&#xD;
      rehabilitation on breast cancer-related lymphedema bioimpedance spectroscopy was used. This&#xD;
      technique allows to detect small changes in extracellular fluid (ECF) and subclinical BCRL,&#xD;
      therefore allows for the subclinical detection of BCRL when visible swelling is not apparent.&#xD;
      Measurements were done using L-Dex U400 unit (ImpediMed Limited, Australia). The feasibility&#xD;
      and clinical utility of implementing L-Dex measurements in routine breast cancer care was&#xD;
      confirmed in previous studies (Laidley and Anglin 2016, Kilgore et al 2018). During the&#xD;
      measurements patients were lying supine on a non-metallic surface a standardized technique&#xD;
      according to Laidley and Anglin (2016) methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand test (DASH) To evaluate ability of the&#xD;
      participants do the different daily activities DASH questionnaire was completed. DASH&#xD;
      questionnaire is a standardized measure which captures the patients' own perspective of their&#xD;
      upper extremity health status (Jester et. al 2005). During the questionnaire completing&#xD;
      subjects were provided with conditions that allowed them to mark the answers freely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Workout Inertial rehabilitation was performed twice a week (Monday and Thursday, between 5:00&#xD;
      and 8:00 PM) for 6 weeks using Cyklotren device (Inerion, Poland). Exercises were conducted&#xD;
      by the same 2 researchers. Each training session included warm-up and 4 sets of shoulder&#xD;
      ﬂexors, extensors, abductors, and adductors, with the right and left arms worked separately&#xD;
      (16 sets for left and 16 sets for right arm). Each set lasted 15 seconds, a 2-minute break&#xD;
      occurred between consecutive sets (without rest period between right and left arm). For all&#xD;
      trained muscles 5 kg load was applied. During the training participants developed 70% of&#xD;
      their maximal force achieved during the strength measurement. Participants observed developed&#xD;
      during training force value displayed on-line on the screen. Cyklotren software allows to set&#xD;
      the upper and lower limit of force; when developed strength was to low or to high a beep&#xD;
      signal was emitted to correct participant force.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Normality of distribution of the data was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk&#xD;
      method. Descriptive statistics, including means and standard deviations, were calculated. For&#xD;
      testing significance of changes analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used. The simple effect of&#xD;
      training for each participant was defined as a relative increase in an analyzed variable&#xD;
      after training compared with the before-training value.Lower and upper borders of 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals for relative increase were calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences in relative increases between groups were tested with one-way ANOVA. If&#xD;
      differences were detected, the Scheffé post hoc procedure was used to determine where the&#xD;
      differences occurred. The level of significance was set at P ≤ 0.05. The effect size (ES) of&#xD;
      the training was calculated using the paired two-sample t-test, and according to&#xD;
      Goulet-Pelletiera and Cousineaua (2018) Cohen's d with Hedges g correction was determined.&#xD;
      The scale presented by Cohen indicates that d &lt; 0.41 represents a small ES, 0.41-0.70 a&#xD;
      moderate ES, and higher than 0.70 a large ES.&#xD;
