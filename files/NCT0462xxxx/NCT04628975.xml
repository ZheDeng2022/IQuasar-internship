  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When taking care of an emergency patient (Emergency Reception Service: UAS and Urgent Medical&#xD;
      Assistance Service: SAMU), the installation of a peripheral venous route (VVP) is an&#xD;
      important step. The benchmark method is the most widely used technique. This vascular access&#xD;
      will allow the necessary therapy to be delivered quickly and efficiently. This can be&#xD;
      difficult and sometimes doomed to failure for reasons related both to the patient (venous&#xD;
      capital not very visible / felt or limited due to the profile of the patient), or sometimes&#xD;
      also for reasons related to the patient. environment (limited lighting, difficult patient&#xD;
      access). The only current alternatives lie in the use of a device such as the Intra-Bone&#xD;
      Device (IID) or the installation of a central venous line. On the other hand, these&#xD;
      alternatives are particularly invasive and / or very algogenic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are other techniques, which are more affordable and &quot;transportable&quot; outside the&#xD;
      hospital. Indeed, trans-illumination with a very short training seems to be a particularly&#xD;
      interesting alternative. It allows, thanks to LEDs in contact with the skin, to backlight the&#xD;
      superficial veins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is proposed through this project to evaluate this tool for a category of patients&#xD;
      considered &quot;difficult&quot; to infuse, both within hospital and outside hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to assess the effectiveness of the transillumination&#xD;
      device, compared to the absence of such a device, on the placement of a peripheral venous&#xD;
      line (PVP) in patients with a difficult vascular approach and managed in the emergency room&#xD;
      and whose clinical condition does not require the installation of an intraosseous device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter, prospective, controlled, randomized and open clinical study, according&#xD;
      to a cross-over design. The intervention evaluated is the placement of a PVR using the&#xD;
      trans-illumination device. The control intervention is the placement of a PVR without this&#xD;
      device, according to the reference method, which is the benchmark method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      400 patients presenting to the emergency room will be included in the centers of Nancy, Toul&#xD;
      and Pont-à-Mousson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on their randomization group, nurses will perform peripheral venous insertion by&#xD;
      the transillumination method or by the control method.&#xD;
