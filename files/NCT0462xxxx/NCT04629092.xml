      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of upper limbs motion on lower limb&#xD;
      biomechanics and muscle activity during single-leg jump landing after anterior cruciate&#xD;
      ligament reconstruction.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      More and more people join in different sports in recent years. But the incidence of sports&#xD;
      injury also increases. And the most frequently occurring and debilitating knee injury in&#xD;
      sports is rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Patients who aim to return to&#xD;
      their preinjury sports should undergo anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) in&#xD;
      order to maximize knee stability. The overall incidence rate of a second ACL injury within 24&#xD;
      months after ACLR was nearly 6 times greater than that in healthy participants. Although many&#xD;
      studies have showed about biomechanical and neuromuscular risk factors during jump landing&#xD;
      which were thought to associate with the secondary injury after ACLR, these studies all&#xD;
      focused on the motion of lower extremity. But actually, people often use their upper limbs to&#xD;
      catch or throw a ball during jump landing in playground. Whether the upper limbs motion will&#xD;
      affect the muscle coordination of lower extremity during jump landing is still unknown.&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of our study is to investigate the effect of upper limbs motion during&#xD;
      single-leg jump landing after ACLR.&#xD;
