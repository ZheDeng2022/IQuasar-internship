      In this project,the investigators aim to establish a Collaborative Care Model of TCM and&#xD;
      Western Medicine to improve the quality of life and symptoms of AR with OSA children and&#xD;
      educate care-givers diet and massage information to improve self-care ability and alleviate&#xD;
      anxiety for parents. In addition, the investigators will use portable oxymeter to detect the&#xD;
      change of SpO2 and respiratory arousal index daily at home and evaluate sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of portable oxymeter device applied in OSA. The investigators want to give&#xD;
      holistic health care for participants and care-givers by this project. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators will build a training environment to provide medical education and training&#xD;
      opportunity to teach medical students and clinician the knowledge of pediatric allergic&#xD;
      rhinitis and obstructive sleep apnea by caring patients and learning from clinical cases.&#xD;

      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects 1-6% among children and has negative influence on&#xD;
      day-time school performance and quality of sleep. It also cause failure to&#xD;
      thrive，cardiovascular disease，and metabolic disease, which need early intervention. About 6%&#xD;
      allergic rhinitis (AR) children would combine with OSA and refractory to treatment and need&#xD;
      long-term intra-nasal corticosteroid or surgery if have moderate-severe OSA with&#xD;
      adenoid-tonsillar hypertrophy. Some parents considering the side effect of steroid and risk&#xD;
      of surgery will search Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TCM is one kind of preventive medicine by educating people how to keep health by diet and&#xD;
      massage. The breathing technique and &quot;Teeth-Buckling and Salivary-Swallowing motion&quot; noted in&#xD;
      Inner Canon of the Yellow Emperor, one of the most important ancient Chinese medical text are&#xD;
      compatible with myofunctional therapy for OSA. There are several studies revealed improve&#xD;
      immune response in allergic rhinitis by TCM and severity of OSA by acupuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, the investigators aim to establish a Collaborative Care Model of TCM and&#xD;
      Western Medicine to improve the quality of life and symptoms of AR with OSA children and&#xD;
      educate care-givers diet and massage information to improve self-care ability and alleviate&#xD;
      anxiety for parents. In addition, the investigators will use portable oxymeter to detect the&#xD;
      change of SpO2 and respiratory arousal index daily at home and evaluate sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of portable oxymeter device applied in OSA. The investigators want to give&#xD;
