  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is open to adults with advanced bowel cancer (colorectal cancer) with a KRAS&#xD;
      mutation. This is a study in people for whom previous treatment was not successful and&#xD;
      surgery is not a treatment option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find the highest dose of BI 1701963 that people with bowel&#xD;
      cancer can tolerate when taken together with a medicine called irinotecan. The study also&#xD;
      tests whether BI 1701963 in combination with irinotecan is able to make tumours shrink. BI&#xD;
      1701963 may help to turn off KRAS. Activating KRAS mutations make tumours grow. Irinotecan is&#xD;
      a medicine to treat bowel cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can stay in the study as long as they benefit from treatment and can tolerate&#xD;
      it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this time, participants take BI 1701963 as tablet once a day and get irinotecan as&#xD;
      infusion every two weeks. The doctors regularly monitor the size of the tumour. The doctors&#xD;
      also collect information on any health problems of the participants.&#xD;
