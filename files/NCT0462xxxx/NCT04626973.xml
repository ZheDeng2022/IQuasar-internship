  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the clinical efficacy of LDL-cholesterol lowering therapy has been proven with&#xD;
      strong evidences and emphasized, there are also growing concerns that intensive&#xD;
      lipid-lowering therapy would be related to increased risk of adverse effects. In addition,&#xD;
      statin potency from recent guidelines was set from the studies composed of mainly Caucasian&#xD;
      population, although there is an inconsistency of statin effect according to ethnicity. Asian&#xD;
      population showed more profound LDL reduction not only from high potent statin but also from&#xD;
      moderate to low potent statin. Conventional strategies for lowering LDL-cholesterol focused&#xD;
      on statins, therefore doubling of previously described dose of statin would be common way in&#xD;
      patients with inadequate LDL-cholesterol levels. Adding ezetimibe will be an alternative&#xD;
      strategy not only to lower LDL-cholesterol level and also to reduce the need of dosage of&#xD;
      high-intensity statin to achieve sufficient LDL-cholesterol lowering effect. However, studies&#xD;
      regarding the effect of intensive-targeting of lipid-lowering therapy and therapy regimens&#xD;
      are lacking. Thus, on these basis, we sought to evaluate whether intensive-targeting of&#xD;
      lipid-lowering therapy will have more prominent beneficial effect compared to&#xD;
      conventional-targeting in patients with documented ASCVD with either an ezetimibe/statin&#xD;
      combination therapy or a statin monotherapy.&#xD;

      All eligible patients who have documented ASCVD will be enrolled according to&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria after voluntary agreement with informed consent. At the time of&#xD;
      enrollment, we will stratify all patients according to LDL-cholesterol &lt;100mg/dL, DM, and&#xD;
      acute coronary syndrome, and randomly assign them in two groups according to LDL-cholesterol&#xD;
      targeting level with a 1:1 ratio: &quot;Intensive-targeting group&quot; vs. &quot;Conventional-targeting&#xD;
      group&quot;. In addition, patients in each group will be randomly assigned to receive two&#xD;
      lipid-lowering therapy regimen with a 1:1 ratio: &quot;Ezetimibe/Statin combination therapy&quot; vs.&#xD;
      &quot;Statin monotherapy&quot;. Patients allocated to each treatment group will receive lipid-lowering&#xD;
      therapy with following protocols.&#xD;
