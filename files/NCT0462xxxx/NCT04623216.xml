  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that preemptive treatment with&#xD;
      sabatolimab, alone or in combination with azacitidine, when administered to participants with&#xD;
      AML/secondary AML who are in complete remission with positive measurable residual disease&#xD;
      post-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (MRD+ post-aHSCT), can enhance the&#xD;
      graft versus leukemia (GvL) response and prevent or delay hematologic relapse without an&#xD;
      unacceptable level of treatment-emergent toxicities, including clinically significant acute&#xD;
      and/or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and immune-related adverse events&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib/II, open label, multi-center study of sabatolimab as monotherapy and in&#xD;
      combination with azacitidine, in participants with AML/secondary AML who have received one&#xD;
      aHSCT and achieved complete remission but MRD+, by local assessment, anytime between day 100&#xD;
      and day 365 post-aHSCT and at least 2 weeks after immunosuppressive medications have been&#xD;
      tapered off.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 59 participants and will be conducted in two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 is a Safety Run-in of approximately 20 participants, to assess whether sabatolimab as&#xD;
      monotherapy at the two tested dose levels (400 mg and 800 mg intravenously Q4W) is safe when&#xD;
      administered in the post-aHSCT setting. For each dose level, once the required number of&#xD;
      evaluable participants has been confirmed, enrollment will be halted until participants have&#xD;
      completed the DLT observation period (≥ 8 weeks following the first dose). Following the&#xD;
      observation period for DLTs, a Safety Review Meeting will be conducted after each dose level&#xD;
      to assess safety and determine the recommended dose for expansion to proceed with enrollment&#xD;
      of additional cohorts in Part 2 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 consists of sabatolimab monotherapy expansion cohort of approximately 13 participants,&#xD;
      sabatolimab in combination with azacitidine cohort of approximately 20 participants, and an&#xD;
      adolescent cohort of approximately 6 participants (≥ 12 years but &lt; 18 years of age) with&#xD;
      sabatolimab as monotherapy. Sabatolimab will be administered at the recommended dose for&#xD;
      expansion determined in Part 1.&#xD;
