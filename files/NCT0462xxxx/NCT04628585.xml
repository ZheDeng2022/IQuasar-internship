  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, long-term safety and efficacy follow-up study for subjects with&#xD;
      sickle cell disease who have been treated with ex vivo gene therapy drug product in bluebird&#xD;
      bio-sponsored clinical studies. After completing the parent clinical study (approximately 2&#xD;
      years), eligible subjects will be followed for an additional 13 years for a total of 15 years&#xD;
      post-drug product infusion. No investigational drug product will be administered in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
