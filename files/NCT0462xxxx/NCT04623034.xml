    <textblock>
      This study was a pharmacokinetic and safety evaluation of the S-adenosylmethionine&#xD;
      formulation MSI-195, and a commercial comparator. The study was broken into two stages. The&#xD;
      first stage was an exploratory single ascending dose design of MSI-195 in 8 healthy normal&#xD;
      male volunteers. The second stage was a single dose evaluation, targeting 26 male and female&#xD;
      volunteers at set doses of MSI-195 and commercial comparator in a cross-over design followed&#xD;
      by a food effect study on MSI-195. Plasma samples were collected and assayed for&#xD;
      S-adenosylmethionine. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using that data.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was focussed on the safety and pharmacokinetic evaluation of MSI-195; a novel&#xD;
      patented formulation of S-adenosylmethionine. MSI-195 is a 400 mg dosage strength, tablet&#xD;
      formulation comprising a core tablet, a seal coat and an enteric coat. The commercial&#xD;
      comparator is SAM-e CompleteTM, manufactured by Pharmavite under the NatureMadeTM brand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consisting of two stages. The first stage was an exploratory single ascending dose&#xD;
      design of MSI-195 in 8 healthy normal male volunteers. The second stage was a more&#xD;
      comprehensive single dose evaluation, targeting 26 male and female volunteers at set doses of&#xD;
      MSI-195 and commercial comparator in a cross-over design followed by a food effect study on&#xD;
      MSI-195.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 design In each period of this stage of the study, ascending single doses of 400 mg,&#xD;
      800 mg and 1600 mg of MSI-195 was orally administered under fasted conditions, followed by 24&#xD;
      hours of blood draws at periodic intervals for the determination of plasma concentration of&#xD;
      S-adenosylmethionine in a repeated-measure design. The drug administrations were separated by&#xD;
      a wash-out of 7 calendar days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 design In the first 2 periods of this stage of the study, a single 800 mg dose of&#xD;
      MSI-195 and a single 1600 mg dose of commercial comparator were orally administered under&#xD;
      fasted conditions, in a 2-way crossover design. During the 3rd period, a single 800 mg dose&#xD;
      of MSI-195 was administered under fed conditions to all subjects. The drug administrations&#xD;
      were separated by a wash-out of 7 calendar days. For each dosing, subjects had periodic blood&#xD;
      draws over a 24 hour period to determine the plasma concentration of S-adenosylmethionine as&#xD;
      a function of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male and female volunteers were included in the study. Subjects were in good health as&#xD;
      determined by a medical history, complete physical examination (including vital signs),&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG), neurological examination and a panel of clinical laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples were collected and stored frozen until assayed. The samples were assayed for&#xD;
      S-adenosylmethionine using a validated HPLC method with MS/MS detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For pharmacokinetic assessments, the main absorption and disposition parameters were&#xD;
      calculated using a non-compartmental approach with a log-linear terminal phase assumption.&#xD;
      The pharmacokinetic parameters of this trial were Cmax, Tmax, AUCT, AUC∞, AUCT/∞, Kel and&#xD;
      T½el.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety parameters assessed included the occurrence of adverse events, the measurement of&#xD;
      clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs, neurological function tests, physical&#xD;
      examination and ECG&#xD;
