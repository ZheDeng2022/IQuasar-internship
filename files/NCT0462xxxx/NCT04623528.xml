      Although liver biopsy is the current standard for histological characterization of the liver&#xD;
      parenchyma, this invasive procedure has a significant risk of - potentially lethal -bleeding.&#xD;
      Moreover, as liver disease may focally or heterogeneously affect the liver, histological&#xD;
      findings may be false negative or not be representative. Non-invasive imaging modalities&#xD;
      (e.g. ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), on the&#xD;
      other hand, provide valuable information with regard to global and regional tissue&#xD;
      characterization, and may be of help in guiding/targeting liver biopsy. Moreover, in recent&#xD;
      years new developments have opened the door towards a better, more comprehensive appreciation&#xD;
      of the status of the liver. One of these is elastography assessing the mechanical,&#xD;
      viscoelastic properties of the liver, thus providing valuable information with regard to the&#xD;
      liver stiffness (or elasticity), and be used for accurate staging of liver fibrosis (1,2).&#xD;
      Another approach is tissue characterization using the relaxation behaviour of liver tissue in&#xD;
      a high-field magnetic environment ('relaxometry'). As relaxation times are tissue specific,&#xD;
      focal or diffuse pathology may alter (i.e. shorten or prolong) relaxation times. These&#xD;
      alterations can be used to depict and to quantify disease severity. In the field of cardiac&#xD;
      imaging relaxometry has caused a paradigm shift, but for liver imaging this has received&#xD;
      relatively limited interest so far. Best known is T2* relaxometry allowing to diagnose and&#xD;
      follow-up patients with haemochromatosis. Recently, a few papers have described the use of T1&#xD;
      and T1-rho relaxometry to diagnosis liver congestion in Fontan patients, and to depict liver&#xD;
      fibrosis, respectively (3,4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of a comprehensive cardiac MRI exam, we started performing routinely T1 and T2&#xD;
      relaxometry of the heart in 2014. The technique was validated against a standardized,&#xD;
      commercially-available phantom in an inter-national study (5). Practically, T1 and T2 mapping&#xD;
      includes measurements in both cardiac short-axis and horizontal long-axis before and after&#xD;
      the administration of intravenous commercially available gadolinium chelates. As in cardiac&#xD;
      short-axis direction the liver is partially encompassed, we will use these images to measure&#xD;
      T1 and T2 relaxation times of the liver. As all data are stored on PACS, it is our aim to&#xD;
      re-use these T1 and T2 mapping studies to determine the T1 and T2 relaxation of the liver in&#xD;
      normal conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, we will derive from our cardiac MRI database a representative group of studies&#xD;
      labelled as normal (i.e. normal cardiac MRI findings). In the medical patient file the serum&#xD;
      biomarkers for liver disease will be checked (see below), as well as findings at&#xD;
      echocardiography (exclusion of right heart failure, exclusion of severe tricuspid&#xD;
      insufficiency), abdominal ultrasound / computed tomography (exclusion of liver disease, i.e.&#xD;
      hemochromatosis, steatosis, hepatic congestion, and liver cirrhosis). Only MRI studies will&#xD;
      be included if liver disease is excluded. In a next step, a representative region of interest&#xD;
      will be manually drawn (&gt; 100 pixels) in a region not including the liver vessels. These&#xD;
      analyses will be performed on the pre- and post-contrast T1 map, and on the T2 map. The goal&#xD;
      is to determine normal values in at least 100 subjects, allowing to assess the impact of&#xD;
      aging and gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, we will measure liver T1 and T2 values in patients with different forms of right&#xD;
      heart failure, and assess the relation between liver T1 and T2 values and findings at&#xD;
      echocardiography, serum biomarkers, and right heart catheterization indicative of right heart&#xD;
      failure. The latter information will be retrieved from the medical patient file. As in right&#xD;
      heart failure, the filling pressure increases in the caval and hepatic veins, hereby causing&#xD;
      hepatic congestion. It is the hypothesis that in these circumstances T1 and T2 liver values&#xD;
      are increased. Also, in latter stages when liver fibrosis initiates and evolves towards&#xD;
      cardiac cirrhotic liver, we hypothesize increased T1 values. The aim is to evaluate whether&#xD;
      mean T1 and/or T2 of the liver parenchyma obtained at MRI can be used as imaging biomarker of&#xD;
      right heart decompensation. As concomitant liver disease (see above) may hamper correct&#xD;
      interpretation of our findings, pre-existing liver disease needs to be excluded. For this, a&#xD;
      similar approach as in the normal population will be used. The target patient population is&#xD;
      three-fold. First, patients with pulmonary hypertension with/without evidence of right heart&#xD;
      failure, who underwent a right heart catheterization with invasive pressure measurements (if&#xD;
      not available, pulmonary artery pressure estimations at transthoracic echocardiography will&#xD;
      be used), and signs of right heart failure at transthoracic echocardiography can be used.&#xD;
      Second, patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, defined as LV ejection fraction &lt; 35% with and&#xD;
      without concomitant right ventricular (RV) dysfunction (i.e. RV EF &lt; 35%). Third, patients&#xD;
      with constrictive pericarditis or inflammatory pericarditis with constrictive physiology&#xD;
      (i.e. increased respiratory-related ventricular coupling/interdependence). This group will be&#xD;
      compared to a group of patients with inflammatory pericarditis without constrictive&#xD;
      physiology (i.e., preserved ventricular coupling).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirdly, to assess the inter- and intra-observed reproducibility of liver T1 / T2 values,&#xD;
      measurements will be performed by two readers independently performing the measurements. One&#xD;
      reader will repeat the measurements respecting one week interval between the analyses. This&#xD;
      group involves 10 randomly selected studies in the normal group and 10 studies in the patient&#xD;
      group. Analysis include assessment of the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and&#xD;
      coefficient of variation (CoV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, as step towards a more automated approach, we will evaluate/develop texture&#xD;
      analysis. This mathematical approach looks at patterns between pixels not visible by the&#xD;
      human eye and results in image 'features' that go beyond the typical mean (or median) and&#xD;
      deviations. It has shown to be a robust technique in many applications in the field of&#xD;
      medical imaging, and most likely will be useful for liver imaging as well. The large group of&#xD;
      derived image features needs to be further analysed using machine learning approaches&#xD;
      (with/without other clinical readouts). Machine learning of features coupled to a diagnosis&#xD;
      ('target') has the potential to augment traditional risk scores with novel imaging&#xD;
      biomarkers. Regularization approaches based on e.g. support vector machines, random forests&#xD;
      or convolutional neural networks (CNNs) will be implemented.&#xD;
