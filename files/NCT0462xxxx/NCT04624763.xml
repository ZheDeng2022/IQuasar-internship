    <textblock>
      OptimPacing study has been designed as a prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled&#xD;
      trial. A total of 11 medical centers across China will enroll 683 patients over an estimated&#xD;
      recruitment period of 2 years. An LBBP group will be compared with a group of conventional&#xD;
      RVP in the follow-up of at least 3 years. The study aimed to demonstrate (1) the superiority&#xD;
      of LBBP in preserving LV systolic function over RVP and (2) the feasibility and long-term&#xD;
      safety of LBBP in patients with AV block.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Right ventricular pacing (RVP) has been the standard-of-care therapy for patients with&#xD;
      bradycardia for sixty years. However, the selection of optimal pacing site is still&#xD;
      controversial. Right ventricular septal or outflow tract pacing has not resulted in improved&#xD;
      outcomes. RVP is considered to result in electrical and mechanical dyssynchrony and an&#xD;
      increased risk of pacing-induced cardiomyopathy (PICM), heart failure and mortality. Biopace&#xD;
      (Biventricular Pacing for Atrioventricular Block to Prevent Cardiac Desynchronization) study&#xD;
      is a randomized controlled trial with a large population evaluating biventricular pacing&#xD;
      versus RVP in patients with atrioventricular (AV) block. But biventricular pacing was not&#xD;
      shown superiority in clinical outcomes compared with RVP. As biventricular pacing is&#xD;
      delivered at two non-physiological sites, it actually creates ventricular dyssynchrony in&#xD;
      patients with narrow QRS durations. Thus, seeking for the optimal pacing site has been the&#xD;
      ultimate goal of doctors who specialize in cardiac pacing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      His-bundle pacing (HBP) is thought to be the most physiological pacing modality, which was&#xD;
      initial applied by Deshmukh et al in 2000. HBP activates native His-Purkinje system and&#xD;
      produces favorable electrical and mechanical synchrony. Clinical observations have shown HBP&#xD;
      could reduce the incidence of PICM and improve combined clinical outcomes. However, HBP is&#xD;
      not widely applied because of challenging operating techniques, unstable long-term pacing&#xD;
      parameters and risk of loss of ventricular capture in a significant number of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Left bundle branch pacing (LBBP) was first introduced by Huang et al in 2017. Since then,&#xD;
      LBBP has been carried out boomingly in China. Similar with HBP, LBBP could activate left&#xD;
      bundle branch (LBB) fibers and provide narrower paced QRS duration and better left&#xD;
      ventricular (LV) mechanical synchrony than RVP. Animal studies also confirmed the&#xD;
      physiological characteristics and anatomical lead locations of LBBP. Several clinical studies&#xD;
      showed that LBBP could produce significantly narrower paced QRS duration and better&#xD;
      echocardiographic response than biventricular pacing in patients with heart failure and LBB&#xD;
      block. Furthermore, the implantation procedure appears easier and capture threshold is lower&#xD;
      when compared with HBP. LBBP has appeared to be a promising approach in the clinical&#xD;
      practice. However, no randomized controlled studies have been reported to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy of LBBP and other pacing modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aimed to demonstrate (1) the superiority of LBBP in preserving LV systolic function&#xD;
      over RVP and (2) the feasibility and long-term safety of LBBP in patients with AV block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratified randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      A balanced randomization is applied according to the following stratifying criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. AF with slow ventricular rate: present or absent;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. LVEF: ≤ 50% or &gt; 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lead implantation of LBBP&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lead implantation of LBBP has been well described previously. The implantation was&#xD;
      performed using the Select Secure (3830) pacing lead delivered through a fixed-curve sheath.&#xD;
      The 3830 lead was introduced transvenously into the right ventricle and screwed into the&#xD;
      interventricular septum (IVS) until LV septum was reached, without protruding into the LV&#xD;
      cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous access was obtained via the left axillary vein or subclavian vein. The 3830 lead was&#xD;
      inserted through the C315 HIS sheath. An intracardiac electrogram was recorded from the lead&#xD;
      tip using the electrophysiological recording system. His-bundle electrogram was identified at&#xD;
      the right anterior oblique 25° position and fluoroscopic image of the lead position was&#xD;
      recorded as a reference. The sheath and lead tip were first advanced to the anterior lower&#xD;
      site of the His-bundle position, and subsequently rotated in a counterclockwise fashion to&#xD;
      place the lead tip in a perpendicular orientation to the IVS. A paced morphology of QS&#xD;
      complex with a north in the nadir (&quot;W&quot;-shaped morphology) in surface lead V1 was usually&#xD;
      observed at this location. As the lead tip was gradually screwed into the IVS, a rightward&#xD;
      shift of the second notch in the &quot;W&quot;-shaped pacing morphology can be observed. The lead tip&#xD;
      was considered to be in the final position once a paced morphology of right bundle branch&#xD;
      delay (RBBD) in surface lead V1 was achieved. Moreover, a discrete potential before the QRS&#xD;
      complex could be often recorded from the lead tip, and we defined this potential as the LBB&#xD;
      potential. Left ventricular activation time (LVAT) was measured from the intracardiac pacing&#xD;
      spike to the R-wave peak of QRS complex in lead V5 or V6. The penetration depth in the IVS&#xD;
      was finally assessed by injecting a small amount of contrast medium through the sheath in&#xD;
      left anterior oblique 45°. Echocardiography was routinely performed to evaluate the lead&#xD;
      depth in the IVS before discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device programming&#xD;
&#xD;
      The devices are routinely programmed with a lower rate limit of 60 ppm. For DDD devices, the&#xD;
      paced and sensed AV intervals are set as 150 and 120 ms, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study organization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiographic core lab Echocardiographic examinations are performed at each study center&#xD;
      before pacemaker implantation and at follow-up. All images are stored on DVD disks and sent&#xD;
      to the core lab (Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University) for central analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Steering Committee&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study steering committee is composed of three experts who are not the investigators of&#xD;
      this study. The committee is responsible for the academic issues including the judgment of&#xD;
      LBBP or LVSP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The iDMC is composed of three experts including at least one statistical expert. The&#xD;
      committee is responsible for the data examination including mid-term evaluation during the&#xD;
      study and also the patient privacy protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Review Committee&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety review committee is composed of three experts who are not the investigators of&#xD;
      this study. In case of severe adverse events, including all-cause death, acute cardiovascular&#xD;
      or cerebrovascular events and other lethal or disabling diseases, the committee will be&#xD;
      responsible for the investigation of the events. The physicians should report the events to&#xD;
      the principal investigator of each center and the committee within 2 hours. The committee&#xD;
      should report the events to the hospital ethics committee in 24 hours. The committee may&#xD;
      recommend the early termination of the study if an excessive rate of adverse events is&#xD;
      suspected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intention-to-treat principle&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analyses are performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. If LBBP or LVSP&#xD;
      fails, RVP will be performed and the patient will not be crossed over to the other group. If&#xD;
      LBBP fails but LVSP succeeds, the sub-group analysis for these patients with LVSP will be&#xD;
      done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to previous publications of HBP and RVP, we supposed that the rate of 5-year&#xD;
      composite endpoints in RVP group was 25% and the rate in LBBP group was 15%. With a&#xD;
      recruitment period of 2 years and follow-up time of at least 3 years, at least 100 events are&#xD;
      required to achieve a power of 80%. With alpha as 0.05, rate of lost-of-follow-up rate as&#xD;
      10%, the final sample size was estimated as 683 by using PASS Version 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare the rate of endpoints between the two groups over&#xD;
      time. Cox proportional risk model will be applied to calculate the hazard ratio. A p-value&#xD;
      less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mid-term analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mid-term analysis is performed by iDMC when the rate of events reaches 50% (at least 50&#xD;
      events of primary endpoint). If LBBP group exhibits statistically significant superiority&#xD;
      over RVP group with the significant level of 0.003, the study could be effectively early&#xD;
      terminated. Otherwise, the sample size will be re-evaluated. The iDMC may determine if the&#xD;
      study will continue according to the re-evaluation of the sample size. Eventually, the data&#xD;
      prior to and after the mid-term analysis are put together for final analysis with the&#xD;
      significant level of 0.047.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical software&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyses were performed using SAS Version 9.4 or R Software Version 3.6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study timeframe&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will start in October 2020 and the complete enrollment will be expected by the end&#xD;
      of 2022. At least 11 medical centers across China will participate in the study. With a&#xD;
      period of at least 3-year follow-up, the study is expected to finish at the end of 2025. The&#xD;
      recruitment might be slower if the mid-term analysis does not reach the statistical&#xD;
      significance and a larger population is required.&#xD;
