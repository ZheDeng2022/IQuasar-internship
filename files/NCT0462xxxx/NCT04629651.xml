    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of captopril and&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness captopril as measured by changes in the grade of bone marrow scar&#xD;
      tissue. The change in spleen size by ultrasound will also be measured.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Captopril is an investigational (experimental) drug that works by inhibiting the production&#xD;
      of angiotensin II by blocking angiotensin converting enzyme. Reducing angiotensin II may&#xD;
      reduce the bone marrow scar tissue in myelofibrosis. It is not approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) for this indication. Participants in this study will be asked to have 2&#xD;
      bone marrow biopsies, a total of 3 blood samples, and fill out questionnaires asking about&#xD;
      how you feel.&#xD;

    <description>Change in symptom burden assessed using MPN-SAF TSS The MPN-SAF TSS is assessed by the patients themselves and this includes fatigue, concentration, early satiety, inactivity, night sweats, itching, bone pain, abdominal discomfort, weight loss, and fevers. Scoring is from 0 (absent/as good as it can be) to 10 (worst imaginable/as bad as it can be) for each item. The MPN-SAF TSS is the summation of all the individual scores (0-100 scale). Symptoms response requires ≥50% reduction in the MPN-SAF TSS.</description>

             the view of the treating physician, would place the participant at an unacceptable&#xD;
             risk if he or she were to participate in the study or would prevent that person from&#xD;
