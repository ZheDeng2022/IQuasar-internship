  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by complete or partial upper-airway collapse&#xD;
      during sleep associated with sleepiness. OSA causes severe impairments in quality of life&#xD;
      (sleepiness, tiredness, concentration difficulties). Moreover, OSA has adverse consequences&#xD;
      on the cardiovascular system by causing intermittent hypoxia, increased sympathetic nervous&#xD;
      system activation and vascular endothelial dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) and mandibular advanced devices (MAD) remain the&#xD;
      two first-line therapies for OSA. However, not all patients are eligible for these treatments&#xD;
      or are not able to follow for a lifelong therapy and therefore do not use it consistently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent meta-analysis has confirmed that regular physical activity reduces OSA by&#xD;
      approximately 28% (Mendelson et al. 2018). However, an important inter-individual variability&#xD;
      exists and no study to date has identified characteristics of patients who respond to these&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this Prospective study, single-site, non-randomized 4-week trial is to evaluate&#xD;
      the impact of a 4-week physical activity intervention on the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) in&#xD;
      OSA patients based on their baseline fluid shift level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants included in the present study will benefit from a 4-week physical activity&#xD;
      intervention. Upon the initial visit, a physical activity prescription will be defined and&#xD;
      they will be equipped with a physical activity monitor that allows feedback. Participants&#xD;
      will then exercise one day per week on-site and 4 days/week on their own. Weekly physical&#xD;
      activity will be reviewed weekly with the participant during their on-site visit.&#xD;
