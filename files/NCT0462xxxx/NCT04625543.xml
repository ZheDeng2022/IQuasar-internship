  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, surgery after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment for patients&#xD;
      with locally advanced esophageal cancer, but the recurrence rate is high and the 5-year&#xD;
      survival rate is low. Immunotherapy shows a potential treatment for esophageal cancer.&#xD;
      Immunocheckpoint (PD-1/PD-L1) inhibitors can activate tumor immunity. The guidelines have&#xD;
      recommended it as a sencond-line therapy. However, there is still lack of the evidence for&#xD;
      its efficacy as a neoadjuvant therapy. This study is to conduct a randomized controlled, open&#xD;
      label, phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant&#xD;
      immnotherapy combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced esophageal squamous&#xD;
      cell carcinoma (ESCC) patient with PD-L1 (CPS&gt;=10%) positive.&#xD;
