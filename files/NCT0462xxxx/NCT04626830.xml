  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of oral anticancer agents (OAAs) in cancer treatment has increased especially in the&#xD;
      last two decades. The use of mobile health technologies in the management of OAA can be&#xD;
      beneficial in terms of treatment adherence and symptom management.The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      explore how a Smartphone mobile application can help improve the cancer treatment process in&#xD;
      people who are used oral anticancer agents. This study will be done a randomized-controlled&#xD;
      trial to test the intervention.&#xD;

      Background: The use of mobile health technologies in the management of OAA can be beneficial&#xD;
      in terms of treatment adherence and symptom management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective/Hipothesis: The purpose of this study is to explore the effectiveness of a mobile&#xD;
      application on treatment adherence and symptom management in patients using OAA. The&#xD;
      following hypotheses (H) will teste in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0a: A mobile application developed for patients using OAA has not increased treatment&#xD;
      adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1a: A mobile application developed for patients using OAA has increased treatment adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0b: A mobile application developed for patients using OAA has not decreased the frequency&#xD;
      and severity of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1b: A mobile application developed for patients using OAA has decreased the frequency and&#xD;
      severity of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: The investigators will recruit and randomly assign 100 patients from the two&#xD;
      cancer care sites who have recently been prescribed oral anticancer agents to receive either&#xD;
      the mobile app intervention or standard care. Participants will be stratified by age and&#xD;
      anticancer treatment ( i.e. simple and complex) regimen. Patients will be follow 6 months.&#xD;
      Medication adherence, symptom severity will serve as primary outcomes.&#xD;

    <time_frame>baseline, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The patients' adherence levels will be assess using the Oral Chemotherapy Adherence Scale (OCAS). The OCAS was developed by Bagcivan and Akbayrak (2015), and its Cronbach α coefficient was found to be 0.738. The scale (19 items, 5-point Likert-type) is a valid and reliable scale for adult patients who use OAAs. A total score of 84 and above is interpreted as &quot;good adherence;&quot; a total score of 83 and below is interpreted as &quot;poor adherence&quot;.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) is a multidimensional tool developed to evaluate the prevalence, characteristics, and distress levels of common cancer-related symptoms over seven days (Cronbach α=0.84). The MSAS is a reliable and valid instrument in the Turkish population. The scale has 32 items and three sub-dimensions: The Global Distress Index, The Physical Symptom Distress Scores, and The Psychologic Symptom Distress Scores. The total MSAS score is the average of the symptom scores of all 32 items. Twenty-four symptoms are evaluated in terms of severity, frequency and distress, and eight symptoms are evaluated in terms of severity and distress. If a symptom was experienced, the patient describes its severity on a 4-point categorical scale; its frequency, if appropriate, on a 4-point categorical scale; and its associated distress on a 5-point categorical scale. Each symptom score is the average of the dimensions (frequency, severity, distress dimensions).</description>

    <description>Participants in the intervention group will receive 6 months the mobile application (OKTED) for improving symptoms and adherence to oral anticancer agents. The mobile application will consist of three modules. The first module will include OAA-specific information, a calendar in which start/end dates can be record, and a medication reminder. The second module will include information about common and urgent symptoms and recommendations for the management of these symptoms. The last module will comprise a question and answer section.</description>
