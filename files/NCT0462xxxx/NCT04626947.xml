  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will compare the effectiveness of Bezlotoxumab in individuals with active C. diff (&#xD;
      Clostridium difficile) infection who are diagnosed with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bezlotoxumab is administered during a course of antibiotic therapy. The dose is administered&#xD;
      as one time treatment. Patients will receive 10 mg/kg IV over 60 minutes as a single dose via&#xD;
      central line.&#xD;
