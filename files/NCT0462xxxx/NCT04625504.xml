      This multi-modal methods study will investigate neurophysiological, endocrinological,&#xD;
      cognitive, psycho-social-emotional markers of chronic pain, and therapeutic targets using&#xD;
      integrative health treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that 50 million adults in the USA suffer from chronic pain. Chronic pain is&#xD;
      one of the most common reasons adults seek medical care, causing undue burden on primary care&#xD;
      channels and treatment costs. Chronic pain is associated with (1) restrictions in mobility&#xD;
      and daily activity, (2) dependence on opioids, (3) anxiety and depression, and (4) poor&#xD;
      perceived health and reduced quality of life. Developing robust and specific&#xD;
      non-pharmacologic intervention programs, on par with pharmacological clinical outcomes&#xD;
      without harmful side-effects, addictive risk, and toxicity, is a crucial unmet clinical need&#xD;
      and a research priority for the NCCIH. Understanding the mechanistic pathways of these&#xD;
      interventions is key to their clinical development and implementation for treating chronic&#xD;
      pain in primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs) show similar clinical efficacy for mood disorders as&#xD;
      pharmacology, and co-morbid symptoms of depression and anxiety. Meta-analysis including 183&#xD;
      patients with Multiple Sclerosis showed efficacy in psychosocial outcomes, quality of life,&#xD;
      anxiety, depression, and select physical symptoms including fatigue, pain, and vestibular&#xD;
      symptoms. The clinical efficacy of MBIs appears to extend mood disorders, as a systematic&#xD;
      review including 13 studies in fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, and irritable bowel syndrome&#xD;
      showed significant effect sizes, reported as standardized mean difference (SMD), compared to&#xD;
      control conditions in reducing symptom severity (SMD= -.40), and pain (SMD= -.21).&#xD;
      Cognitively, MBIs appear to enhance executive control and self-regulatory processing, that&#xD;
      has a beneficial effect upon emotion regulation, pain perception, and has shown to reduce&#xD;
      ruminative ideation. Previous research has also suggested that mindfulness meditation&#xD;
      training improves chronic pain symptomology through certain mechanisms such as disengagement&#xD;
      from pain-related threats. While previous research has shown MBIs to be effective in treating&#xD;
      certain health conditions, the mechanisms by which MBIs lead to clinical changes remain&#xD;
      unclear. No study has adequately investigated biological or neurophysiological markers in&#xD;
      chronic pain that may correlate with reduction in clinical symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This overarching study aims to identify key phenotypic markers and treatment targets of&#xD;
      chronic pain, and further understand MBI mechanism in its treatment.&#xD;
