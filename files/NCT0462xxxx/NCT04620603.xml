    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of combination low dose rate brachytherapy (LDR) added to standard of&#xD;
      care (SOC) immunotherapy with Nivolumab in stage III and IV melanoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of combining LDR with immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibition in stage III and IV melanoma. This involves the addition of a treatment called&#xD;
      brachytherapy to planned immunotherapy with nivolumab (also known as Opdivo®). Brachytherapy&#xD;
      is a form of radiation therapy where radioactive pellets are placed within a tumor to&#xD;
      temporarily irradiate the tumor at a low level. This is the first time that this combination&#xD;
      (immunotherapy and brachytherapy) has been used in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the effect of combining LDR with immunotherapy,&#xD;
      determine safety and feasibility, generate a toxicity profile, and evaluate response.&#xD;
