  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Very premature birth and the necessary hospitalization expose to a risk of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality which impacts the neurodevelopmental prognosis. Sleep and behavior monitoring have&#xD;
      not been developed in the neonatal units. This has to be improved since it is known from&#xD;
      clinical and animal studies that the quality, organization and quantity of sleep in very&#xD;
      preterm infants impact neurological development and brain plasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collection system provide neonatal care nurse with access to motion curves (evaluated by&#xD;
      signal processing of live video) and real-time infrared video (also available in low-light&#xD;
      conditions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This new non-invasive technology allows an evaluation of the activity cycles of the newborn&#xD;
      by the caregivers which until now was only accessible occasionally by short recordings of&#xD;
      actigraphy or polysomnography. The investigators wish to demonstrate that this can contribute&#xD;
      to an organization of care that respects the sleep patterns of the newborn, which they know&#xD;
      to condition the neurodevelopmental prognosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the EuroPeristat 2014 report, 1% of births are very preterm infants. Very&#xD;
      premature birth and the necessary hospitalization expose to a risk of morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      which impacts the neurodevelopmental prognosis. Sleep and behavior monitoring have not been&#xD;
      developed in the neonatal units. This has to be improved since it is known from clinical and&#xD;
      animal studies that the quality, organization and quantity of sleep in very preterm infants&#xD;
      impact neurological development and brain plasticity. The publications suggest that&#xD;
      alterations in sleep could have a significant impact on acquisitions in the areas of&#xD;
      learning, memory, sensory development and behavior, as well as in the area of&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory regulation. It has been shown that the implementation of developmental care&#xD;
      practices (taking into account lighting, noise, the position of newborns and their rhythms)&#xD;
      could have short-term beneficial effects on the sleep of very preterm infants. However,&#xD;
      studies remain very limited in number. The investigators propose to build on the&#xD;
      infrastructure developed as part of the H2020 DigiNewB project (http://www.digi-newb.eu/),&#xD;
      which can provide neonatal care providers with access to motion curves (evaluated by signal&#xD;
      processing of live video) and real-time infrared video (also available in low-light&#xD;
      conditions).The collection system is functional, allows continuous analysis of videos to&#xD;
      quantify movement and is suitable for incubators and neonatal beds. This new non-invasive&#xD;
      technology allows an evaluation of the activity cycles of the newborn by the caregivers which&#xD;
      until now was only accessible occasionally by short recordings of actigraphy or&#xD;
      polysomnography. The investigators wish to demonstrate that this can contribute to an&#xD;
      organization of care that respects the sleep patterns of the newborn, which they know to&#xD;
      condition the neurodevelopmental prognosis.&#xD;
