  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An important part of recovery for shoulder injuries, is sticking to the exercise regimen that&#xD;
      is prescribed by a physiotherapist. Currently, there is no proper way to measure whether&#xD;
      patients are correcting doing their prescribed exercises at home. Researchers at Sunnybrook&#xD;
      have tested out a Smart Physiotherapy Recognition System (SPARS), which consists of a watch&#xD;
      that patients can wear while they are performing their physiotherapy exercises. The watch&#xD;
      aims to learn how the exercises are done correctly when worn during supervised physiotherapy&#xD;
      sessions, and then to record and compare whether those same exercises are being done&#xD;
      correctly in a home setting. The main objectives of this study aims to test whether the SPARS&#xD;
      system can effectively measure whether physiotherapy exercises are being done properly when&#xD;
      they are done without physiotherapist supervision. Secondly, to examine whether the recovery&#xD;
      process after shoulder injuries is improved if patients perform the physiotherapy exercises&#xD;
      correctly.&#xD;

      A research assistant will conduct in-person data collection on 120 patients, by recording&#xD;
      patients' exercises during their supervised physiotherapy sessions each week using the SPARS&#xD;
      smart watch. Each patient will wear smart watch on their affected arm only when performing&#xD;
      prescribed exercises, and the watch will start recording inertial sensor data once the&#xD;
      patient puts the watch on. The injured worker population will be recruited from referrals&#xD;
      made to the Sunnybrook Working Condition Program (WCP) at the Holland Centre for a&#xD;
      work-related shoulder injury. The patient population that is being funded by OHIP, will be&#xD;
      recruited from referrals Sunnybrook Shoulder and Upper Extremity Program. Data collection&#xD;
      will be collected at baseline (at time of informed consent), and at each supervised&#xD;
      physiotherapy session during the course of a patient's treatment. A research assistant will&#xD;
      be required to attend a minimum of one supervised physiotherapy session for each patient&#xD;
      every two weeks, and record exercise type and technique, alongside the inertial data&#xD;
      collection, based on feedback from the treating physiotherapist. Follow-up outcomes such as&#xD;
      surveys and shoulder testing will be done at 6 weeks, monthly at a maximum of 3 months&#xD;
      (OHIP-patients) and 5 months (WSIB) patients, final treatment session (if different than&#xD;
      maximum amount), and 1 year after.&#xD;
