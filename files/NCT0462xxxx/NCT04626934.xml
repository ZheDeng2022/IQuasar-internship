      The objective of the present study is to assess whether specific cognitive intervention will&#xD;
      influence rehabilitation outcomes of post-acute hip fracture patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hip fracture often occurs in frail older people and is a major concern for the health care&#xD;
      systems because it is associated with an up to 36% excess mortality within 1 year. Hip&#xD;
      fracture also represents a risk factor for further falls and fractures, functional decline&#xD;
      and institutionalization, with &lt;40% of hip fractured patients regaining their pre-injury&#xD;
      level of ambulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most challenging tasks of today's post-acute geriatric rehabilitation wards is&#xD;
      improving the functional abilities of fragile hip-fractured patients and discharging most of&#xD;
      them to their homes. Yet, the rising incidence of hip fractures in the elderly has created an&#xD;
      overwhelming workload on those departments and has significantly increased the burden on&#xD;
      healthcare resources. Previous studies have found that cognitive decline is an important&#xD;
      negative predictor in rehabilitation. Several studies have shown that cognitive interventions&#xD;
      can improve functional abilities of older people. Yet, these studies were conducted in&#xD;
      community dwelling older people. Our study will assess this issue amongst post-acute&#xD;
      rehabilitation hip fracture patients. Our hypotyhesis is that those patients recieving&#xD;
      specific cognitive intervention will show significantly better rehabilitation outcomes and&#xD;
      cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the present study is to assess whether specific cognitive intervention will&#xD;
      influence rehabilitation outcomes of post-acute hip fracture patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized double blinded study. We will compare two groups: one will recieve&#xD;
      specific cognitive intervention and a control group will recieve conventional occupational&#xD;
      therapy treatment. Both groups will recieve the same amount of interventions.The&#xD;
      interventions will include all together 12 sessions, each being 45 minutes, for a total of 3&#xD;
      weeks. The intervention will include: 4 treatments in the area of memory and attention, 4&#xD;
      treatments in the area of problem solving, 4 treatments in the area of planning and&#xD;
      analysing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the control group will recieve conventional occupational therapy treatment: 3&#xD;
      weeks of all together 12 sessions, 45 minutes each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measures are: a disability measure, the Functional Independence Measure (FIM),&#xD;
      the motor FIM, the Montebello Rehabilitation Factor Score (MRFS), also called motor FIM&#xD;
      effectiveness. In addition 4 cognitive functional measures: the Color Trail Test, the Kettle&#xD;
      Test, the Groningen Activity Restriction Skill (GARS), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment&#xD;
      (MOCA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization process will be carried out by withdrawing a piece of paper written either&#xD;
      A (intervention) (n=10) or B (control) (n=10) from an envelope. The subjects will not be&#xD;
      informed as to which group they will be assigned. Patient recruitment and the randomization&#xD;
      process will be supervised by the clinical staff. The assessors will be blinded to the type&#xD;
      of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (Version&#xD;
      25.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study sample size was estimated using the mean and the standard deviation of the motor&#xD;
      FIM measure (calculated for this population), with improvement assumption by 7 points, with&#xD;
      power of 0.8 and significance level of 0.05.&#xD;

    <time_frame>The change in the measure from randomization until the date of discharge, assessed up 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The FIM is a disability measure, administered on admission and upon discharge to assess change in functional abilities. The FIM comprises 18 parameters, each rated on a scale of 1 to 7 according to the degree of assistance required to perform a specific activity in 3 domains: activities of daily living (ADL) (8 parameters), mobility level (5 parameters) and cognitive function (5 parameters). The maximal total score for the FIM is 126. The patient's FIM score will be assessed during multi-disciplinary team meeting</description>

    <time_frame>The change in the measure from randomization until the date of discharge, assessed up 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The motor FIM (mFIM) includes 13 parameters of ADL and mobility. maximal total score for the mFIM is 91. The patient's motor FIM score was assessed during multi-disciplinary team meeting</description>

    <measure>The Montebello Rehabilitation Factor Score (MRFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>The score will be calculated at discharge, assessed up to 3 months from randomization.</time_frame>
    <description>The MRFS achieved on the mFIM score is calculated by the Montebello Rehabilitation Factor Score (MRFS), designed to overcome the floor and ceiling effect problem and calculate each patient's specific potential for improvement. The MRFS also known as mFIM effectiveness, will be calculated as the mFIM score change (discharge mFIM score-admission mFIM score) divided by the mFIM maximum score (91) minus the mFIM admission score.</description>

    <description>EQ-5D is a standardised measure of health status developed by the EuroQol Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. It ia applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, it provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status that can be used in the clinical and economic evaluation of health care as well as in population health surveys. EQ-5D is designed for self-completion by respondents and is ideally suited for use in postal surveys, in clinics, and in face-to-face interviews. It is cognitively undemanding, taking only a few minutes to complete.</description>
