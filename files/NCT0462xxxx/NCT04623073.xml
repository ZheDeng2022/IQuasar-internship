  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the goals of Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) is to reconstruct leg length as adequately&#xD;
      as possible. In order to achieve this one needs landmarks that are visible both on the&#xD;
      templating X ray as well as during surgery. The classical posterior and lateral approaches&#xD;
      often rely on the distance from the greater trochanter (GT) to the shoulder of the femoral&#xD;
      stem or the distance from the lesser trochanter (LT) to the side of the neck osteotomy. If&#xD;
      the surgeon finds out on the digital template that the distance from the GT to the shoulder&#xD;
      of the implant should be X mm to achieve equal leg length, than the surgeon can try to&#xD;
      reconstruct this during surgery. During the Direct Anterior Approach (DAA) these landmarks&#xD;
      usually are not visible or require additional dissection injuring important soft tissue&#xD;
      structures along the way. One anatomical structure that appears to be always visible during&#xD;
      the DAA is the External Obturator tendon (EO). It was recently confirmed that the level of&#xD;
      insertion of the EO onto the proximal femur can also always be determined on pre-operative X&#xD;
      rays. It therefore represents one of the few landmarks that is visible both on the templating&#xD;
      X ray as well as during DAA THA. Indeed, many hip surgeons, including ourselves, believe that&#xD;
      if the shoulder of the femoral stem is near the insertion of the EO leg length cannot be far&#xD;
      off. However, there is no clinical data to support this. The investigators would therefore&#xD;
      like to the correlate the distance observed intra-operatively to the actual established&#xD;
      distance on the post-operative X ray.&#xD;
