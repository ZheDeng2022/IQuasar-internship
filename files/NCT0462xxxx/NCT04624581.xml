  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia syndrome (FS) is characterized by widespread pain and affect 0.5 to 5 % of the&#xD;
      general population, with a higher prevalence in women. Recognized as disease by World Health&#xD;
      Organization since 1992, FS concern 1.2 to 2 million of French people and his etiology need&#xD;
      to be clarified. This affection is characterized by a higher sensitivity to nociceptive&#xD;
      stimulus, articular and muscular pain and associated to: fatigue, headache, sleep disorders,&#xD;
      depression and irritated bowel syndrome. The presentation of this symptoms varied according&#xD;
      to the patient with a heterogeneity of the clinical, physical, social and psychologic&#xD;
      conditions and of the therapeutic responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Faced to the heterogeneity of FS, various hypotheses about the development mechanisms exist.&#xD;
      Central sensitization could be one of the key mechanisms of FS, it is described as a loss of&#xD;
      the natural balance between the transmission of a painful stimulus to the central nervous&#xD;
      system and pain-inhibiting mechanisms, which results in permanent or chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, work on the familial character of FS suggests that a genetic component may be&#xD;
      involved in its development, but the identification of a genetic determinant is difficult&#xD;
      given the multifactorial nature and complexity of FS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to characterize the predispositions of central sensitization&#xD;
      and genetics in patients with FS compared to a control group, matched in age, sex and&#xD;
      menopausal status.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Patient rested comfortably in a supine position in order to obtain muscular relaxation. Cutaneous electrodes will be applied, and the sural nerve will be stimulated in its retromaleolar track. Electromyographic responses will recorded using the Nicolet Vicking device with a pair of surface electrodes placed over the tendon of the ipsilateral biceps femoris.&#xD;
The R-III reflex (objective threshold) will be identified as a multiphasic signal appearing at least 90 ms but less than 250 ms after each stimulation and will be considered to be present when the corrected computed surface was &gt;0.5 mV/ms (positive response).</description>

    <time_frame>day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Genome-wide association studies highlight that genetic factors are possibly responsible for up to 50% of the disease susceptibility, and several potential candidate genes have been found to be associated to fibromyalgia, including catecholaminergic (COMT), serotoninergic (HTR2A, SLC6A4), dopaminergic (GCH1, TAAR1) and glutamatergic (GRIA4) pathways. The participants will be genotyped for selected SNPs (120 SNPs- OpenArray technology) that have been previously investigated in relation to FM susceptibility, symptoms or potential mechanisms (Algynomics and international publications).&#xD;
A single blood sample will be obtained on visit 1 day 1 and 4 aliquotes will be frozen at -80°C and kept frozen until the Open Array Technology analysis</description>

    <description>This self-assessment scale allows the patient to characterize the pain in relation to its psychosocial intensity and impact. The patient is asked to answer 9 graduated questions by circling a number from 0 (no pain) to 10 (the most horrible pain you can imagine). Among these questions the patient is asked to blacken the painful areas on a diagram and to put an S if the pain is on the surface or a P if it is deep</description>

    <description>The experimenter makes a palpate-roll (by slightly lifting the skin) between the thumb and the other 4 fingers of the hand by following an axis on each side of the patient's spine. The palpate roll begins at the lumbar level and rises to the level of the shoulder blades on each side of the spine. The test is performed on one side of the spine and then on the other. The palpate roll should be performed 5 times on each side of the spine alternately. The investigator should rate for each side and at each pass whether the patient is experiencing pain or not. If the patient does not feel pain after 5 passes, the test is considered negative.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of sensitivity to light by led panel</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>

The light intensity will be progressive (by step of 1 seconds flash light every 20 seconds) and the participant will stop the test when the intensity of the light will be uncomfortable. The light sensitivity is the level at which the participant feels uncomfortable</description>

    <intervention_name>Electrophysiological measurement of reflex nociceptive flexion threshold (RIII reflex) using Nicolet Vicking device</intervention_name>
    <description>This intervention measures the response to electrical stimulation of the sural nerve using a pair of percutaneous electrodes placed at the external malleolar retro passage of the nerve (2 cm apart) and connected to the stimulation device (Nicolet Vicking). Reflex muscle responses will be collected using surface electrodes placed on the femoral biceps muscle of the participant and connected to an Electromyogram recording device.&#xD;
The RIII will be determined twice (rest period between each 10-minute). In order to induce the reflex nociceptive flexion response, repeated cutaneous electrical stimulations (30 to 40) will be applied at the level of the sural nerve following a variable interval of 6 to 10 seconds in order to overcome the phenomena of habituation and predictability. Each stimulus test will consist of a single rectangular pulse of 0.5 ms, of variable intensity (0-100mA) until a reflex nociceptive flexion threshold is detected or a maximum current of 100 mA is reached</description>
