  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, retrospective and prospective, observational, no profit study&#xD;
      including adult patients with LCH, diagnosed starting from January 2001 to two years after&#xD;
      the first enrolled patient. Each patient will be followed up to one year after the last&#xD;
      enrolled patient. Each patient will be followed up to one year after the last enrolled&#xD;
      patient.This study plans to collect clinical information at the time of diagnosis and at&#xD;
      various follow-ups to evaluate the efficacy of first-line therapies. Diagnostic and&#xD;
      therapeutic data will be collected from routine clinical evaluations and laboratory and&#xD;
      instrumental investigations carried out during clinical practice&#xD;

      This is a multicenter, retrospective and prospective, observational, no profit study&#xD;
      including adult patients with LCH, diagnosed starting from January 2001 to two years after&#xD;
      the first enrolled patient. Data from patients, diagnosed from January 2001 to the date of&#xD;
      patient enrolment, is considered retrospective, while data collected after patient enrolment,&#xD;
      and up to two years after the first enrolled patient, is considered prospective. At least one&#xD;
      year of follow-up is expected for each patient. Each patient will be followed up to one year&#xD;
      after the last enrolled patient. This study plans to collect clinical information at the time&#xD;
      of diagnosis and at various follow-ups to evaluate the efficacy of first-line therapies.&#xD;
      Diagnostic and therapeutic data will be collected from routine clinical evaluations and&#xD;
      laboratory and instrumental investigations carried out during clinical practice. A sub-cohort&#xD;
      of patients with available biological data on somatic mutations of the RAF-MEK-ERK genes will&#xD;
      also be evaluated.&#xD;
