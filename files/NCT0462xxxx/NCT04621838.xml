      This PMCF study has been set up to investigate and assess residual risks in relation to the&#xD;
      CE-marked AMS ActivHeal Silicone Foam and Silicone Foam Lite dressing . The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is primarily to collect clinical follow-up data on the AMS ActivHeal Silicone Foam and&#xD;
      Silicone Foam Lite dressing , as CE-marking was based on equivalence. The data and&#xD;
      conclusions obtained from this study will be used to provide clinical evidence of safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness for the clinical evaluation process.&#xD;

    <measure>Primary 1 Effectiveness of both Silicone Foam and Silicone Lite dressing will assessed in regards to the management of wound exudate.</measure>
    <time_frame>After each dressing change up to 6 weeks following application of dressing</time_frame>
    <description>Success will be determined by no deterioration of the wound or peri wound skin. A relative score will be used to score maceration of zero (no maceration), one (minimal maceration), two (moderate maceration), and three (excessive maceration and need to withdraw patient from study.</description>

    <measure>Effectiveness of both Silicone Foam and Silicone Lite dressing will assessed in regards to the per wound skin conditions.</measure>
    <time_frame>After each dressing change up to 6 weeks following application of dressing</time_frame>
    <description>Success will be determined by no deterioration of peri wound skin. The peri wound skin will be assessed for maceration and signs of inflammation. A relative score will be used to score maceration of zero (no maceration), one (minimal maceration), two (moderate maceration), and three (excessive maceration and need to withdraw patient from study). Success will be determined that over the evaluation an increased score would represent peri wound deterioration. This will be measured using VAS value (0= no erythema, redness and skin erosion and 10 = extensive erythema, redness and skin erosion).</description>

    <description>The assessor will be required to record the pain score chosen by the patient pre removal of the dressing and record the pain score chosen by the patient during removal. Success will be determined by no increased in pain score and this will be measured using VAS value (0= no pain to 10= most pain imaginable).</description>
