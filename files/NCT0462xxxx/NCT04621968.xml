  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An inclusion consultation carried out by Professor Gamé at the CHU of Toulouse (Rangueil&#xD;
      site) will make it possible to provide the subject with a urinary self-test which&#xD;
      automatically carries out and sends the measurement of 10 urinary parameters: pH, density,&#xD;
      creatinine, magnesium, calcium, sodium, urea, uric aid, oxalate, citrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No samples are taken and therefore stored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be processed by IRIT in order to investigate :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the correlation of the analyses with the context of nutrition and sports activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the best recommendation on use (the best time)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis We assume that frequent occasional urinary analyses carried out independently by&#xD;
      the subject allow us to identify changes in diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would like to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a strong correlation between the different markers and the nutritional context&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the impact of physical activity on this correlation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the most relevant moment of analysis (optimising correlation) in order to define&#xD;
           recommendations for use&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the inclusion consultation, Professor Gamé will provide the subject's self-test,&#xD;
      mobile application and user account. The correspondence table between the user account and&#xD;
      the data identifying the subject will only be accessible and kept by Professor Gamé and his&#xD;
      team. During this consultation, will be exposed :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the context and objectives of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the use of the self-test and its recommendations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, no samples will be taken and therefore retained. The cartridges are single-use&#xD;
      cartridges and will therefore be thrown away by the subject. The reader will be returned to&#xD;
      the partner who developed it (Innopsys) at the end of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will have recommendations on the frequency of use which will not be binding and&#xD;
      will not have any impact on his participation in the trial. These recommendations will be&#xD;
      composed of 2 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: frequency of use: 3X/day for 1 month. Phase 2: Frequency of free use. This phase&#xD;
      will make it possible to observe the level of acceptability of the technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will provide information on his diet by sending a photo of his meals via the&#xD;
      mobile application provided. This will then be analysed by algorithms (or operators if the&#xD;
      accuracy of the algorithms is insufficient) to extract the type and quantity of food&#xD;
      ingested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the protocol, the subject will be able to send summary data of his or her sporting&#xD;
      activities via the web application linked to the project. These data will be :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of steps taken&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Average heart rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The duration of the effort&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The theoretical energy expended&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject may request a consultation with Professor Gamé during the study in order to have&#xD;
      a medical opinion on these results.&#xD;
