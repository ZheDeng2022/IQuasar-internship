      Background: Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor (LUM-IVA), a CFTR corrector-potentiator combination, was&#xD;
      found to improve lung function and reduce pulmonary exacerbations (PEx). However, cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis (CF) is a multi-organ disease and therefore there is a need for more information on&#xD;
      the systemic effects of CFTR modulators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To evaluate pancreatic function, bone metabolism and respiratory changes through a year&#xD;
      of LUM-IVA treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A prospective real world, one-year study on F508del homozygous adult CF patients who&#xD;
      commenced treatment with LUM-IVA. Visits were scheduled on the first day of treatment and&#xD;
      every 3 months evaluating: symptoms, Body Mass Index (BMI), spirometry, laboratory tests and&#xD;
      Quality of life. At baseline and at 12 months, the patients underwent sweat test, oral&#xD;
      glucose tolerance test (OGTT), chest CT and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic multisystem disease that is characterized by&#xD;
      pancreatic insufficiency (PI) and chronic airway infections associated with loss of lung&#xD;
      function, repeated pulmonary exacerbations (PEx), and ultimately, respiratory failure.&#xD;
      F508del, the deletion of a single amino acid, is the most common mutation that causes CF. In&#xD;
      July 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the combination&#xD;
      Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor (Orkambi®, Vertex pharmaceuticals) for use in patients with CF&#xD;
      homozygous for the F508del mutation. Briefly, this combination of a corrector (Lumacaftor)&#xD;
      and potentiator (Ivacaftor) partially restores the activity of the membranous CF&#xD;
      transmembrane regulator (CFTR) protein. Lumacaftor improves the processing of F508del CFTR&#xD;
      and its transport to the cell surface, while Ivacaftor increases the probability for the&#xD;
      channel to be open and its transport of chloride. In clinical trials, treatment with&#xD;
      Lumacaftor-Ivacaftor (LUM-IVA) in individuals homozygous for F508del led to an increase in&#xD;
      lung function, weight, and a significant reduction in the frequency of PEx and CF-related&#xD;
      hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extra-pulmonary complications are common in CF. Of these, CF-related diabetes (CFRD) is one&#xD;
      of the worst prognostic factors. In people with gating mutations responsive to Ivacaftor,&#xD;
      treatment was associated with an improvement in insulin secretion after glucose challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another important extra-pulmonary complication is CF bone disease (CFBD), characterized by&#xD;
      low bone mineral density. Osteopenia and fractures are noted among 50-75% of patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with CF. The reasons for those pathologies are malabsorption of fat soluble&#xD;
      vitamins, a complex abnormality of sex hormone composition, primary CFTR dysfunction, chronic&#xD;
      infection and inflammation, and low levels of bone-building exercise resulting from advanced&#xD;
      respiratory compromise. It is well known that growth and sexual development is delayed in CF&#xD;
      patients, due in part to nutritional deficiencies and the severity of their chronic lung&#xD;
      disease. These delays are accompanied by low levels of sex hormones: luteinizing hormone (LH)&#xD;
      and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current study was to evaluate endocrine pancreatic function, bone metabolism&#xD;
      and respiratory changes through the first year of LUM-IVA treatment in adult patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods Study design and participants The study was a prospective, single&#xD;
      center, observational real-world study on F508del homozygous adult CF patients, who commenced&#xD;
      treatment with LUM-IVA and were followed for a year. Pregnant and nursing females; solid&#xD;
      organ or hematological transplant recipients; alcohol or drug abusers; patients with an acute&#xD;
      upper or lower respiratory infection, and those with PEx or changes in therapy for pulmonary&#xD;
      disease within 28 days before Day 1 (first dose of study drug) were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects received 400 mg Lumacaftor /250 mg Ivacaftor (LUM-IVA) fixed-dose combination&#xD;
      film coated tablets for oral administration every12 hours. All participants remained on their&#xD;
      pre-study stable CF medication regimen through the year. They were followed in the CF Center&#xD;
      at Carmel Medical Center, Haifa, Israel between 2016 and 2019. The institutional board&#xD;
      reviewed and approved the study protocol. All patients provided written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period Screening period was from day -28 through day -1. Treatment period was from day&#xD;
      1 (first dose of study drug) through 12 months ± 7 days. Five clinic visits were carried out&#xD;
      on day 1 and at weeks 12, 24, 36 and 48 (± 7 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At screening (V0) and at 12 months (V5) the patients underwent a sweat test, Oral glucose&#xD;
      tolerance test (OGTT) in patients without CF related diabetes (CFRD), chest computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) and a bone density evaluation using Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).&#xD;
      Evaluations performed during each visit included: recording of CF-related symptoms,&#xD;
      treatments, physical examination, vital signs, body mass index (BMI) measurements, pulmonary&#xD;
      function tests (PFT), laboratory tests, sputum culture and disease-specific quality of life&#xD;
      evaluation using the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study assessments The primary endpoint was the absolute change from baseline through 12&#xD;
      months in the percentage of predicted Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced&#xD;
      vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory flow between 25-75 (FEF25-75). Spirometry was&#xD;
      performed in accordance with the American Thoracic Society/ European Respiratory Society&#xD;
      (ATS/ERS ) Task Force, using a KoKo® spirometer (n-Spire Healthcare, Inc., Longmont CO, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key secondary endpoints included the absolute and relative change from baseline through 12&#xD;
      months in (1) metabolic factors, including BMI, OGTT (75g of glucose were ingested orally,&#xD;
      and glucose, insulin &amp; c-peptide were examined at the time of ingestion, 1 hour and 2 hours&#xD;
      later), Albumin and HbA1C; (2) bone health factors including parathyroid hormone (PTH),&#xD;
      Alkaline phosphatase, , Phosphor, and Calcium levels; A, D, E vitamin levels, Urine Ca/Cr&#xD;
      ratio; and DEXA scans (3) Hormonal factors including; luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle&#xD;
      stimulating hormone (FSH), Testosterone and Estradiol levels; and (4) evaluation of CFTR&#xD;
      function through concentration of sweat chloride Additional evaluations included (1) chest CT&#xD;
      scans that were performed and scored using the Bhalla scoring method by a&#xD;
      radiologist-investigator (the total score ranges from 9 to 25, with a higher score indicating&#xD;
      more severe structural lung changes); (2) The patient-reported CFQ-R respiratory domain score&#xD;
      (scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a better quality of life and 4&#xD;
      points considered to be a minimal clinically important difference) (3) safety parameters&#xD;
      (electrolytes, liver and kidney function test, coagulation function) and (3) pulmonary&#xD;
      exacerbations (PEx). A PEx was defined as a deterioration in respiratory symptoms that led to&#xD;
      a change in treatment. Each PEx was counted as a separate event, and the number of PEx in the&#xD;
      year prior to commencing treatment with LUM-IVA was compared to PEx in the year on the&#xD;
      treatment. We documented: number of exacerbations, oral vs. intravenous antibiotic treatment,&#xD;
      hospitalizations, presence of fever &gt;38°C, laboratory parameters (white blood cells count&#xD;
      [WBC], absolute neutrophil count [ANC], C-reactive protein [CRP] at PEx start in hospitalized&#xD;
      patients), sputum culture results and time to next PEx.&#xD;
