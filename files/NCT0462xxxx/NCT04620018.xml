  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who underwent a dental implant surgery were studied.Subjects randomly were aligned&#xD;
      into three groups:In group 1, subjects received prophylactic antibiotic orally (Amoxicillin&#xD;
      2mg ,1 hour before surgery) and post-surgical antibiotic (Amoxicillin 500 mg , q8h for five&#xD;
      days), subjects received only prophylactic antibiotic (Amoxicillin 2mg ,1 hour before&#xD;
      surgery) in group 2 ,and in group 3, subjects received post-surgical antibiotic (Amoxicillin&#xD;
      500 mg , q8h for five days). The sign and symptom of infection were studied and the incidence&#xD;
      of infection in each group was determined.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects eligible for study inclusion had an edentulous area in the mandible or maxilla and&#xD;
      underwent a dental implant surgery. Subjects were excluded from study enrollment if they had&#xD;
      systemic diseases which affect bone metabolism, history of allergy to amoxicillin, refused&#xD;
      study enrollment or failed to return for follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were randomly divided into three groups : In group 1, subjects received prophylactic&#xD;
      antibiotic orally (Amoxicillin 2mg ,1 hour before surgery) and post-surgical antibiotic&#xD;
      (Amoxicillin 500 mg , q8h for five days), subjects received only prophylactic antibiotic&#xD;
      (Amoxicillin 2mg ,1 hour before surgery) in group 2 ,and in group 3, subjects received&#xD;
      post-surgical antibiotic (Amoxicillin 500 mg , q8h for five days) . An independent researcher&#xD;
      made random allocation cards using computer-generated random. Then, allocated cases were&#xD;
      placed in a sealed envelope. All subjects used 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash in the treatment&#xD;
      period. All implants were placed with a two-stage protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects were followed up for 3 months to assess any infection signs and symptoms.&#xD;
      Infection was diagnosed based on clinical findings such as pain, redness of the area, and&#xD;
      discharge around the fixture.An independent dentist who was blind the study groups, evaluated&#xD;
      all subjects.&#xD;
