    <textblock>
      One of the most common infections acquired in hospital, also known as nosocomial infections,&#xD;
      is intestinal infections. These infections can lead to the development of nosocomial diarrhea&#xD;
      which can have serious consequences in young / very young children. These infections tend to&#xD;
      prolong the average length of hospital stay of this fragile population. Conventional&#xD;
      treatment of these infections, in the absence of knowledge of the infectious agent, is purely&#xD;
      symptomatic. It is therefore necessary to develop new prevention strategies for this type of&#xD;
      disease. In this sense, the administration of probiotic strains in order to prevent the onset&#xD;
      of nosocomial diarrhea is a promising avenue and the present study aims to validate the&#xD;
      preventive effect of this supplement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to assess the effect of Babybiane® Imedia or the microbiotic&#xD;
      strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG LA801 in the preventive nutritional management of&#xD;
      nosocomial diarrhea in children aged 1 to 24 months. This evaluation will be made in&#xD;
      comparison with a placebo. The tolerance of the product under study will also be assessed.&#xD;

      Diarrhea in children According to the World Health Organization, diarrhea is defined by the&#xD;
      release of at least three loose or watery stools per day or with an abnormal frequency for a&#xD;
      single individual. It is generally a symptom of gastrointestinal infection who might be of&#xD;
      bacterial or viral, parasite origin. Acute diarrhea is a frequent pathology, with an&#xD;
      infectious origin in most of the cases, especially viruses and bacteria in industrialized&#xD;
      countries. It leads to a risk of acute dehydration, in particular in high-risk populations as&#xD;
      newborns, infants and toddlers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute diarrhea is still the second leading cause of infection-associated death of children&#xD;
      under five worldwide and in 2011 it was estimated to account for almost 10 % of the 7 million&#xD;
      deaths in that population. In European countries, most cases show only mild or moderate&#xD;
      symptoms and fatal outcomes are very uncommon. However gastroenteritis is still one of the&#xD;
      main reasons for hospitalization of children in this region. In Europe, the incidence or&#xD;
      diarrhea ranges from 0.5 to 2 episodes per year in children under 3 years old. Dehydration&#xD;
      secondary to an acute diarrhea is still one of the main cause of death in young children that&#xD;
      could be prevented in industrialized countries. Acute diarrhea is mostly associated with&#xD;
      acute gastroenteritis, which is one of the main reason for hospitalization of children under&#xD;
      3 but it is also associated with antibiotics therapy (Antibiotics Associated Diarrhea or AAD)&#xD;
      or hospital-acquired infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospital-acquired or nosocomial diarrhea (ND) Infections occurring more than 48 hours after&#xD;
      hospital admission are usually considered as nosocomial infections. The incidence of this&#xD;
      kind of infections among children in the industrialized countries remains very high, ranging&#xD;
      from 5.1% to 11.6% depending on the time of the year and the type of hospital. In children,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal infections account for the majority of the hospital-acquired infections and&#xD;
      rotavirus is the main pathogenic agent. Those infections can lead to nosocomial diarrhea and&#xD;
      therefore have numerous health and economic consequences as they tend to prolong hospital&#xD;
      stay and mortality. Moreover nosocomial infections are usually treated with broad spectrum&#xD;
      antibiotics without knowing the type of bacteria responsible for the infection or its&#xD;
      antibiogram. This results in the selection of resistant microorganisms leading to increased&#xD;
      antimicrobial resistance. All these factors combine for an increase of the financial burden&#xD;
      of the healthcare system due to nosocomial infections. Nosocomial infections are more&#xD;
      prevalent in the pediatric population than in the adult population and predominantly occur in&#xD;
      intensive care units (ICU). In settings other than the ICU, the most common pediatric&#xD;
      nosocomial infection is gastroenteritis. Rotavirus and norovirus account for the vast&#xD;
      majority of the hospital-acquired gastroenteritis. Although, regular precautions such as hand&#xD;
      hygiene or isolation of sick patients can prevent the spread of the infections, there is a&#xD;
      clear need for new prevention strategies, and among those the use of probiotics is a&#xD;
      promising one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probiotics and nosocomial diarrhea It is important to consider that no broad consensus exists&#xD;
      to recommend the use of probiotics in the prevention of diarrhea, mainly because of the&#xD;
      different design of the studies done so far. Therefore, there is a need for more&#xD;
      well-designed studies before recommendations can be proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, three systematic reviews have assessed the efficacy of probiotics supplementation in&#xD;
      the prevention of nosocomial diarrhea for a total of eight randomized clinical trials (RCT)&#xD;
      involving a grand total of 2 254 children for the age of 1 month to 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The characteristics and results of these RCTs are summarized in the following tables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of the results of these clinical trials revealed that among all the probiotics&#xD;
      strains tested, only Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) was proved to be efficient in reducing&#xD;
      the risk for nosocomial rotavirus-associated diarrhea. Differential effects have been&#xD;
      observed depending on the intestinal pathogen, thus it would be interesting to analyze the&#xD;
      pathogenic agent responsible for the diarrhea observed in the study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the aforementioned meta-analysis, and although it is not a formal recommendation,&#xD;
      the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN)&#xD;
      working group strongly suggests the use of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (≥109 CFU/day over the&#xD;
      course of the hospital stay) to prevent nosocomial diarrhea in children. It is important to&#xD;
      consider that LGG is the only probiotic strain for which available data were deemed&#xD;
      sufficient to lead to a recommendation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanism of action of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG Multiple studies have shown that&#xD;
      Lactobacilli increase mucin secretion by intestinal epithelial cell lines in vitro, increase&#xD;
      tight junction protein expression, thus preventing damaging action from pathogenic bacteria.&#xD;
      Probiotics such as lactobacillus spp. can also exert an antimicrobial activity by producing&#xD;
      short chain fatty acids. In addition, probiotics can inhibit virus adsorption by competing&#xD;
      with viral receptors on intestinal cells and can also have a beneficial effect on parasitic&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, several studies have previously shown that LGG increases mucosal secretory&#xD;
      immunoglobulin A and inhibits viral adhesion on intestinal epithelial cell surface, inhibits&#xD;
      virion secretion, and reduces viral replication in the mucosa. LGG also enhances immune&#xD;
      response targeted against rotavirus by stimulating rotavirus-specific interferon&#xD;
      (IFN)-γ-production from T-Cells. In addition, LGG reduces the rotavirus-induced release of&#xD;
      reactive oxygen species in vitro and suppresses the rotavirus-induced interleukin (IL)-6&#xD;
      response in a non-transformed porcine intestinal epithelial cell line. Finally LGG has been&#xD;
      shown to increase Nitric oxide production in epithelial intestinal cells in vitro, hence&#xD;
      increasing antimicrobial activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, in light of all the available data on the potential beneficial effect of LGG&#xD;
      on intestinal infections, dietary supplementation with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG to a dose&#xD;
      of ≥1.1010 CFU/day and in addition to an oral rehydration solution, in line with the&#xD;
      recommendations of the international institutions (American Academy of Pediatrics, ESPGHAN,&#xD;
      European Society for Paediatric Infectious Diseases, GFHGNP, World Gastroenterology&#xD;
      Organization) in regards to the nutritional care of acute diarrhea in children seems&#xD;
      promising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is designed to assess the effect of Laboratoires PiLeJe own Lactobacillus&#xD;
      rhamnosus GG LA801 formula in reducing the incidence of nosocomial diarrhea in children under&#xD;
      24 months who stayed in an emergency department for whatever medical reason and for over 6&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product indications and contra-indications BABYBIANE® Imedia is a food for special medical&#xD;
      purposes containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus intended for nutritional care of newborns and&#xD;
      young children suffering from acute diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a regulatory standpoint, this product is within the following context:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regulation (UE) No 609/2013 of the European parliament and of the 12/06/2013 council&#xD;
           related to the dietary products destined for newborns and infants, food for special&#xD;
           medical purposes and substitutes of the total daily intake for weight control;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regulation (EU) 2016/128 supplementing Regulation (EU) No 609/2013 of the European&#xD;
           Parliament and of the Council as regards the specific compositional and information&#xD;
           requirements for food for special medical purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regulation (UE) No 609/2013 does not significantly modify the former definition of a food for&#xD;
      special medical purposes (FSMP) defined as being a &quot;dietary product specifically treated and&#xD;
      formulated and destined to satisfy dietary needs of patients, including newborns, and that&#xD;
      can only be used under medical supervision and destined to be the exclusive or partial diet&#xD;
      of the patients whose capabilities of absorption, digestion, assimilation, metabolization or&#xD;
      excretion of regular food products or some of their ingredients or metabolites are&#xD;
      diminished, limited or altered or whose health status determine other specific dietary&#xD;
      demands that cannot be satisfied only by a modification of the regular diet&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FSMPs are ranked into three different categories. BABYBIANE® Imedia falls into the third&#xD;
      category: &quot;nutritionally incomplete food product, whose composition is adapted to fulfill the&#xD;
      specific needs of newborns and young children with acute diarrhea and which cannot be the&#xD;
      only food source.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indications BABYBIANE® Imedia contains ≥1.1010 Colony Forming Units (CFU) of Lactobacillus&#xD;
      rhamnosus GG LA801 per pack and is strongly recommended for nutritional care of acute&#xD;
      diarrhea (associated with acute gastro enteritis, antibiotics therapy or hospital-acquired)&#xD;
      in newborns or young children.&#xD;
