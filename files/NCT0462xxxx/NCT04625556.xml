  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genitourinary malignancies such as prostate cancer, renal cell cancer, and bladder cancer in&#xD;
      Korean population have been increased due to the aged population and the westernized&#xD;
      lifestyles. With the advancement of technologies, studies have found that microbiome not only&#xD;
      affects human physiological functions, such as metabolism, immunity, and haematopoiesis, but&#xD;
      also plays a significant role in the development and progression of malignancies. However,&#xD;
      the investigation of microbiome in urological malignances have been limited and few studies&#xD;
      have been reported. Therefore, the investigator tried to evaluate the usefulness of&#xD;
      microbiome in detection and monitoring of urological malignancies in Korean population. This&#xD;
      study aims to use microbiome in tissue, plasma, stool and urine for the diagnosis, disease&#xD;
      progression monitoring and therapeutic response evaluation. This study plan includes building&#xD;
      big databases for microbiome of urological malignancies in Korean population.&#xD;
