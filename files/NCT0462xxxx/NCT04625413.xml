      This is a pilot study to evaluate the usability and feasibility of a patient-centered&#xD;
      communication tool (University of Rochester-Geriatric Oncology Assessment for acute myeloid&#xD;
      Leukemia or UR-GOAL) among 15 older patients with AML, their caregivers, and oncologists.&#xD;

      Older adults with AML and their caregivers may benefit from help and support in understanding&#xD;
      their treatment options. This pilot study seeks to evaluate the usability and feasibility of&#xD;
      the UR-GOAL communication tool. The UR-GOAL tool will incorporate conjoint analysis to elicit&#xD;
      patient preferences as well as assessments of fitness and prognostic awareness.&#xD;
