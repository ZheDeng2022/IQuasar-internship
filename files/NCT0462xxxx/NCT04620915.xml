    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed research is to conduct a longitudinal experiment on the&#xD;
      neurocognitive pathways and individual differences in high-level construal for affect&#xD;
      regulation and smoking cessation. The population is adult smokers aged 25-55 who have tried&#xD;
      and failed to quit multiple times and who are experiencing poverty. The primary endpoints are&#xD;
      (a) the similarity in neural representation of high-level construal to one of two candidate&#xD;
      pathways, (b) the presence of meaningful individual differences in the neural representation&#xD;
      of high-level construal, and (c) as a secondary endpoint, the effect size of the high-level&#xD;
      construal condition (relative to treatment-as-usual) on smoking as measured by cigarettes per&#xD;
      day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of these endpoints corresponds to a specific null hypothesis. The null hypothesis for&#xD;
      the first endpoint is that high-level construal is not significantly different in its neural&#xD;
      representation from down-regulation of craving, which would suggest that high-level construal&#xD;
      does not operate through distinct mechanisms from traditional treatments. The null hypothesis&#xD;
      for the second endpoint is that the between-subjects variability in the neural representation&#xD;
      of construal level does not significantly relate to relevant individual differences measures&#xD;
      (e.g., traits, task behavior), which would suggest that individual differences are not&#xD;
      meaningfully related to outcomes. Finally, the null hypothesis for the secondary endpoint is&#xD;
      that the magnitude of the effect of high-level construal on smoking as measured by reductions&#xD;
      in average cigarettes per day is not significantly greater than in TAU, which would suggest&#xD;
      that the efficacy of the high-level construal condition is not significantly greater than a&#xD;
      standard text-messaging intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoints will be assessed at baseline and change from pre-to-post training (8&#xD;
      weeks).&#xD;

      OVERVIEW:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed work will achieve the three specific aims (two confirmatory, one exploratory) in&#xD;
      the context of a 4-arm translational experiment. Assessments of neurocognitive mechanisms of&#xD;
      high-level construal, as well as of two candidate pathways and treatment-as-usual control,&#xD;
      will be completed at baseline and endpoint sessions. The 240 participants enrolled in the&#xD;
      study will complete a multimodal battery that will assess neural, behavioral, and self-report&#xD;
      indices relating to the three processes of interest - construal level, down-regulation of&#xD;
      craving, and up-regulation of goal energization - and then are randomized to one of three&#xD;
      experimental conditions related to those processes or a control condition. This design is&#xD;
      highly advantageous because it allows for the establishment of the mechanisms of the&#xD;
      construal-level intervention, to compare them with the mechanisms of the other two processes,&#xD;
      and to test whether, and to what extent, our potentially novel affect regulation strategy&#xD;
      engages and alters those mechanisms (Aim 1); and to identify individual differences in the&#xD;
      effects of that novel strategy (high-level construal) on patterns of brain activation, affect&#xD;
      regulation, and cessation outcomes (Aim 2). Though the translational experiment design is not&#xD;
      intended to be an intervention per se (because the evidence base does not yet support a&#xD;
      full-scale trial and materials for such an intervention still need to be developed), the&#xD;
      investigators will nonetheless quantify the effect size of high-level construal on changes in&#xD;
      smoking so future RCTs have that information and can be adequately powered to detect an&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASSIGNMENT OF PARTICIPANTS TO CONDITION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to a condition using the randomizer function in the&#xD;
      RedCap participant tracking and management software. This assignment will happen only after&#xD;
      participants are screened, consented, enrolled, and complete the baseline session. In other&#xD;
      words, all 240 participants will be treated in exactly the same way through the end of the&#xD;
      baseline session, and only at that point will RedCap be used to assign participants to their&#xD;
      condition. All participants will have equal probability of being assigned to the conditions&#xD;
      (i.e., 25% chance of assignment to each). The study coordinator will know which participant&#xD;
      is enrolled in each condition, but researchers involved in data analysis (i.e., Drs. Berkman,&#xD;
      Fujita, Chavez, and Weston, as well as the graduate students) as well as the research&#xD;
      assistants who interact with the participants will be blind to condition during data&#xD;
      gathering and analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS FOR SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION AND DATA ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The method for selecting the sample size was based on a power analysis of the least sensitive&#xD;
      test - Aim 2. The key statistical tests for the three aims are as follows. For Aim 1, the&#xD;
      test of neural similarity between conditions is essentially a paired-samples t-test on&#xD;
      similarity scores (e.g., pattern correlations calculated within subjects). This is a&#xD;
      high-powered comparison because the covariance within subjects of the scores is high. For Aim&#xD;
      2, the individual difference analyses are between-subjects correlations and regression (or&#xD;
      partial regression or logistic regression) coefficients relating neural similarity to affect&#xD;
      regulation scores, responses to trait and individual difference surveys, and smoking behavior&#xD;
      as measured by cigarettes per day. This family of test has relatively low power because it is&#xD;
      entirely between subjects. For Exploratory Aim 3, the key test is the condition-by-time&#xD;
      interaction (i.e., difference of the high-level construal vs. the TAU group in change in&#xD;
      smoking behavior from pre-to-post training). This test is a within-between (sometimes called&#xD;
      &quot;mixed&quot;) ANOVA analysis that is more powerful that the individual difference analyses for Aim&#xD;
      2 but less powerful than the fully within-subjects tests for Aim 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION CONTENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The content for all four training arms is a set of brief (&lt;160 character) messages designed&#xD;
      to enable participants to practice one specific affect regulation strategy (experimental&#xD;
      arms) or receive information and motivational messages that are already in use as part of the&#xD;
      NCI's SmokefreeTXT program (treatment-as-usual control). In brief, all messages in the&#xD;
      experimental arms are generated by a large group of mTurk workers who are smokers; the&#xD;
      process of message generation and validation has already begun. During the award period the&#xD;
      investigators will add even more messages to the corpus and validate them. In the high-level&#xD;
      construal condition, workers compose messages that encourage thinking about purpose of&#xD;
      quitting and future goals (e.g., &quot;What would quitting mean to you and your future?&quot;). In the&#xD;
      down-regulation of craving condition, workers compose messages that encourage effortful&#xD;
      inhibitory or attentional control of cravings (e.g., &quot;When you feel an urge to smoke, think&#xD;
      about the health consequences&quot;). And in the up-regulation of goal energization condition,&#xD;
      workers compose messages that tie one specific core value (which the mTurk worker ranked as&#xD;
      within his or her top three core values) to the goal of quitting (e.g., for the core value of&#xD;
      &quot;family&quot;, a message might be, &quot;Quitting will help you model a healthy lifestyle for your&#xD;
      family&quot;). The content for the up-regulation of goal energization condition is matched to&#xD;
      participants' own top three core values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION DELIVERY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants receive text messages and complete biweekly online &quot;booster&quot; sessions for 8&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning on their quit date, participants will be sent messages via SMS text messaging 5-6&#xD;
      times each day for 14 consecutive days, then 3-4 times each day for the following 42 days.&#xD;
      The investigators chose to increase the messaging frequency in the first month of cessation&#xD;
      given the higher likelihood of relapse during this period. The order of the messages will be&#xD;
      pseudo-randomized such that each message will be seen no more than three times across the&#xD;
      8-week training period, separated by at least 10 days. The timing of the messages will be&#xD;
      adjusted for each participant to be evenly spaced starting at wake-up and ending 15 minutes&#xD;
      before bedtime and adjusting for weekday/weekend differences. Participants will reply to each&#xD;
      message and use a 5-point scale to rate its perceived helpfulness. Participants can also text&#xD;
      &quot;SOS&quot; to the system at any point to initiate support via text if they feel tempted to smoke.&#xD;
      Daily text messaging is an ideal delivery format for this training because it allows for in&#xD;
      vivo participant contact at moments when smoking decisions are being made. Text messaging has&#xD;
      very high adoption rates in the United States even among underserved communities that are&#xD;
      typically difficult to sample densely for extended durations, and low SES users are&#xD;
      comfortable receiving texts throughout the day. The investigators have used text messaging&#xD;
      for experience sampling and for theory-based intervention in a community sample (see&#xD;
      Preliminary Studies 5 and 6). Participants will provide their mobile phone number at the&#xD;
      baseline session; those without a text message-enabled phone or those who do not wish to use&#xD;
      their own, will be provided a prepaid phone at the end of the baseline session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the text messaging, participants will complete biweekly online &quot;booster&quot;&#xD;
      sessions using Qualtrics with a custom, personalized link sent to the participant via email&#xD;
      and text. The booster sessions are designed to reinforce the active interventions (high-level&#xD;
      construal, goal energization, down-regulation of craving) and provide opportunities to&#xD;
      practice the assigned affect regulation strategy. In the sessions, participants will be&#xD;
      reminded of their assigned strategy and write brief responses to specific prompts (e.g.,&#xD;
      &quot;What are two specific ways that quitting now will change your future life?&quot;, &quot;Why is&#xD;
      quitting important to you today?&quot;, and &quot;What are two ways you can change how you think to&#xD;
      reduce your craving for cigarettes?&quot;). Participants will also generate triggers to smoking&#xD;
      (situations or cues) and practice using down-regulation of craving when they see those&#xD;
      triggers. This exercise helps form the habit of deploying the strategy in everyday life.&#xD;
      Participants in the control arm will visit a website with information about the dangers of&#xD;
      smoking and benefits of quitting. Not all participants have computer access, so, as in&#xD;
      previous studies, participants will be provided access in the lab and the research team will&#xD;
      work with the local library system to ensure all study sites are accessible from their&#xD;
      computers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BOOSTER COMPLETION AND RETENTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Berkman is currently using similar &quot;booster&quot; sessions, which are programmed in and are&#xD;
      delivered via Qualtrics, in a current translational experiment on healthy eating (R01&#xD;
      CA211224). The automated reminders and links, which can be sent via email and text messaging&#xD;
      depending on participant preference, greatly increase completion of the boosters. Together&#xD;
      with the reminders, graded incentives (e.g., a monetary bonus for completing &gt;90% of the&#xD;
      boosters during the study) have greatly increased completion of the at-home booster sessions.&#xD;

The corpus for this condition is 100 messages composed by a large independent sample of mTurk workers who are smokers and validated by a team of RAs trained to 0.8 reliability on ratings of high-level construal. To meet criteria for inclusion, a message must be rated as significantly closer to high-level (vs. low-level) on a rating scale of construal level.&#xD;

    <description>In the up-regulation of goal energization condition, participants will be sent messages that encourage them to consider the core values that drive their desire to quit smoking. These messages will name a specific core value that the participant rated in the top three (of 19) during the baseline session, and will draw a connection between quitting and the core value. For example, a message for a person who nominated &quot;family&quot; as one of her top three core values might read, &quot;Quitting will help you model a healthy lifestyle for your family.&quot; This intervention is grounded in robust theory and evidence supporting Self-Affirmation Theory. The corpus for this condition is 100 messages composed by a large, independent sample of mTurk smokers and validated by a team of RAs trained to 0.8 reliability in correctly identifying to which core value the message is tied.&#xD;

In addition to the text messaging, participants in the TAU condition will be invited to visit a website with information about the dangers of smoking and benefits of quitting. Twice per week, they will be sent a custom, personalized, and trackable link to the website via email and text messaging.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Low-SES&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Persistent smokers: cigarette smokers (at least 10 cigarettes/day for at least 2&#xD;
             years)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Want to quit but have tried and failed at least three times&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Income-to-needs ratio (INR) is less than 1.0, meaning that their household income&#xD;
             adjusted for household size is below the federal poverty line&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Ages 25-55&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Metal implants (e.g., braces, permanent retainers, pins)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Metal fragments, pacemakers or other electronic medical implants&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Claustrophobia&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Weight ˃ 550 lbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Women who are pregnant or believe they might be pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Screen for handedness&#xD;
&#xD;
        People in this population are likely to have some comorbid psychiatric, substance use,&#xD;
        and/or other health disorders that might pose a challenge to retention and intervention&#xD;
        compliance. Such comorbidities are inherent to the population of interest (persistent&#xD;
        smokers) so they will not be exclusionary criteria; instead, we will gather information&#xD;
        about psychiatric, substance use, and medical comorbidities on intake so that we can&#xD;
        monitor and report any associations with attrition, compliance, and effects of the&#xD;
        experimental conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        E-cigarette use is acceptable - it is not an exclusionary criterion - but it will be&#xD;
        recorded and covaried as appropriate in the analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        To increase the homogeneity of the sample in terms of cessation aids, we require that all&#xD;
        participants use pharmacological cessation aids such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT).&#xD;
        This inclusion criterion also more realistically models how cessation happens in vivo, as&#xD;
        medical care providers often recommend adding pharmacological assistance such as NRT to&#xD;
        quit programs. We will provide name-brand patch or gum (e.g., Nicoderm) to participants who&#xD;
        cannot afford. Participants who want or are able to provide their own NRT will be included&#xD;
        as long as they agree to continue using NRT for the duration of the training period. We&#xD;
        will monitor NRT use weekly to ensure compliance with this inclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No exclusions will be made on gender, race, or ethnicity, so the sample will reflect the&#xD;
        demographic profile of the Lane County, Oregon. Eligible participants will be scheduled for&#xD;
