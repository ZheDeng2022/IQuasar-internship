  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging Proof of Biology (POB)&#xD;
      study to determine whether CC 90011 reverses, by the induction of androgen receptor (AR)&#xD;
      expression, the castration resistance, due to lineage switch, in participants with mCRPC that&#xD;
      have failed enzalutamide as last prior therapy. This study aims to assess whether CC-90011&#xD;
      can induce AR expression and, consequently, re-sensitize tumors to anti-hormonal therapy.&#xD;
