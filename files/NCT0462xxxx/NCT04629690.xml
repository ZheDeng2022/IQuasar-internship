  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SOLAR is a randomised control trial exploring the role of Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment&#xD;
      (CGA) in older adults who screen positive for frailty based on the Identification of Seniors&#xD;
      at Risk (ISAR) tool the the Emergency Department and Acute Medical Assessment Unit of a&#xD;
      University Teaching Hospital.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients who are over seventy-five will be screened for frailty using the widely used&#xD;
      ISAR tool. Those with a score of 2 or above in the ISAR will be randomised. The treatment arm&#xD;
      will undergo geriatric medicine team-directed CGA from admission to Emergency Department (ED)&#xD;
      or Acute Medical Assessment Unit (AMAU) whereby the non-treatment arm will undergo usual&#xD;
      patient care. A dedicated multidisciplinary team of a geriatric medicine trainee,&#xD;
      physiotherapist, occupational therapist and medical social worker will carry out the&#xD;
      assessment, as well as interventions that arise from that assessment. Primary outcomes will&#xD;
      be time from triage to decision to admit or discharge. Secondary Outcomes will be subsequent&#xD;
      Emergency Department reattendance, rehospitalisation, functional decline and mortality at 30&#xD;
      days and 180 days. This will be recorded by telephone consultation and electronic records.&#xD;
