  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Headache is an important health problem. It is the commonest type of all signs of illness in&#xD;
      the people worldwide. Cervicogenic Headache is commonest musculoskeletal condition in&#xD;
      physiotherapy practice. This study's main objective was to evaluate effectiveness of Dry&#xD;
      Needle with exercise in decreasing pain and improving function in patients with Cervicogenic&#xD;
      Headache.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      50 patients were included and assigned randomly to group A and B. Group-A received Dry Needle&#xD;
      plus exercise and group-B received Dry Needle alone. Baseline assessment was taken before and&#xD;
      after treatment; treatment was given for four weeks twice a week. Outcome indicators were&#xD;
      measured by Visual analog scale, Neck Disability Index and Cervical Range Of Motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study findings indicate that both groups improve the symptoms of a headache. Clinically&#xD;
      better improvement was indicated by Dry Needle plus exercise group than Dry Needle alone&#xD;
      group. As per our results, Dry Needle plus exercise should be preferred for the management of&#xD;
      cervicogenic headache over Dry Needle alone.&#xD;

    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>four weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analogue scale is a subjective outcome measurement where patients judge the intensity of their pain on a scale of 0-10, which is in the form of a 10cm straight line . On this 0-10 scale, zero denotes no pain and ten denotes severe pain intensity</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Neck Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>four weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Neck Disability index contains 10 items, seven related to activities of daily living, two related to pain, and one item related to concentration. Each item is scored ranging from 0 (no pain or disability) to 5 (severe pain and disability); and the total score is expressed as a percentage, with higher scores corresponding to greater disability.</description>

    <description>A 0.25 X 15 mm acupuncture needle was used for sub occipital muscle and 0.25 X 40 mm needle was used for paraspinal and trapezius muscle. All the necessary precautions were maintained before inserting the needle. Therapists wore hand gloves for all purposes.&#xD;
The exercise for the muscles of cervical group, for group A was carried out by elevating head from lying in supine position repeating 20 times in three sets and pressing a theraband forward in one set of 15 repetitions, to right side and to left side and back side</description>
