  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a trend that breast surgery can be done with peripheral nerve blockade and&#xD;
      intravenous sedation, which reduces the side effects of general anesthesia such as nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting, intubation discomfort and postoperative pain. The distribution of breast nerves is&#xD;
      complex. Common nerve block methods are paravertebral blocks and pectoral nerve blocks. By&#xD;
      monitoring the patient's heart rate variability change and measuring the patient's&#xD;
      parasympathetic tone, the analgesic drug can be administered according to the patient's&#xD;
      individual differences to avoid insufficient or excessive analgesic dose. The aim of this&#xD;
      proposal is a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial is designed to evaluate&#xD;
      changes in analgesia nociception index (ANI), surgical pleth index (SPI), postoperative&#xD;
      opioid demand, and pain scores between patients who received regional anesthesia and those&#xD;
      without in breast surgery patients under non-intubated surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anesthesia has three elements: immobility, painlessness, and amnesia. To achieve these three&#xD;
      factors depends on the balance between multiple factors, so multiple parameters need to be&#xD;
      used for evaluation. In terms of subcortical function, pain indexes such as analgesia&#xD;
      nociception index, surgical pleth index, etc. can be used to evaluate. By monitoring the&#xD;
      parameters and comprehensive evaluation during the operation, the patient's condition can be&#xD;
      fully understood. Opioids act on the central nervous system, making the nerve response slow&#xD;
      and analgesic The effect is good, but there are many side effects, such as nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting, drowsiness, respiratory depression, constipation, endocrine disorders, etc., and&#xD;
      the central nervous system is suppressed by opioids, but the surrounding tissues are still&#xD;
      damaged, releasing inflammatory mediators, causing immune dysfunction. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      necessary to suppress inflammation and reduce the use of opioids, but also to effectively&#xD;
      relieve pain. Nerve blockade is a powerful tool for this purpose. Local anesthetics are&#xD;
      applied next to the nerves of the wound so that the pain signal cannot be transmitted to the&#xD;
      central nervous system, reduce inflammatory mediators, reduce acute and chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast surgery can be completed by peripheral nerve blockade and intravenous sedation, which&#xD;
      can reduce the side effects of general anesthesia such as nausea and vomiting, intubation&#xD;
      discomfort and postoperative pain. The distribution of breast nerves is complex, from the&#xD;
      superficial cervical plexus, brachial nerve plexus, and thoracic vertebral nerves. At&#xD;
      present, the commonly used nerve blocking methods include spinal nerve block, thoracic muscle&#xD;
      block, brachial nerve block, and superficial nerve block. Blocking methods such as the&#xD;
      cervical plexus, studies have shown that peripheral nerve blockade can reduce the amount of&#xD;
      opioid analgesics during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research plan is to design a randomized clinical trial to observe changes in the&#xD;
      analgesic injury index (ANI), surgical pleth index (SPI), intraoperative and postoperative&#xD;
      opiate demand, pain index, etc. inpatients with or without regional anesthesia under&#xD;
      non-intubated breast surgery.&#xD;
