      HITACH developed a new combi-elastography imaging technology combines shear wave imaging and&#xD;
      strain imaging technology. In the study, not only the F index which is related to the stage&#xD;
      of liver fibrosis can be obtained, but also the A index which is related to the stage of&#xD;
      hepatitis can be obtained, which can not be obtained by other ultrasound devices.&#xD;

      HITACHI developed a new combi-elastography imaging technology combines shear wave imaging and&#xD;
      strain imaging technology to make full use of these two imaging modalities and make full use&#xD;
      of different physical characteristics for imaging and quantitative analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study, not only the F index which is related to the stage of liver fibrosis can be&#xD;
      obtained, but also the A index which is related to the stage of hepatitis can be obtained,&#xD;
      which can not be obtained by other ultrasound devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This technology is non-invasive, painless, simple and reliable, therefore it is bound to&#xD;
      contribute to the early diagnosis of chronic liver disease and the real-time evaluation in&#xD;
      the treatment process, which will play an important role in the clinical application.&#xD;
