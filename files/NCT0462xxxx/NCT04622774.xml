  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 1/2, first-in-human, open-label, dose-escalation, and expansion study&#xD;
      designed to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and&#xD;
      preliminary antitumor activity of IMGC936 administered by intravenous (IV) infusion.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalation, and expansion study to determine the Maximum&#xD;
      Tolerated Dose (MTD) and select the recommended phase 2 dose. Dose escalation follows a&#xD;
      conventional 3+3 design; successive cohorts of 3 to 6 participants each will be evaluated in&#xD;
      sequential escalating doses of single-agent IMGC936. Upon completion of the dose-escalation&#xD;
      phase of the study, following determination of the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), up to 5&#xD;
      expansion cohorts may be opened in tumor types selected from those enrolled in dose&#xD;
      escalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with relapsed or refractory, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic solid&#xD;
      tumors including non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), triple-negative breast&#xD;
      cancer (TNBC), colorectal cancer (CRC), gastroesophageal cancer, or pancreatic cancer will be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMGC936 is administered via intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and every&#xD;
      subsequent 21-day cycle thereafter, at the assigned dose for each cohort during dose&#xD;
      escalation, and at the RP2D for expansion. Infusion duration will vary depending on dose and&#xD;
      participant tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sentinel dosing will be used for the first 2 dose levels of dose escalation. The first&#xD;
      administration of IMGC936 in participants at the first 2 dose levels of dose escalation will&#xD;
      be staggered by at least 48 hours. The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation period is 21&#xD;
      days. Participants may continue on study drug until disease progression, adverse event (AE)&#xD;
      requiring discontinuation, DLT during evaluation window, pregnancy, death, investigator&#xD;
      decision, lost to follow up (LTFU), major protocol deviation requiring discontinuation,&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent, or sponsor, investigator or regulatory agency terminates the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor assessments are performed every 6 weeks (Q6W) while on study drug then every 12 weeks&#xD;
      (Q12W). Tumor assessments continue until discontinuation criteria are met. If feasible,&#xD;
      participants who discontinue study drug for reasons other than progressive disease (PD)&#xD;
      (e.g., toxicity) should continue to undergo tumor assessments Q12W as post-treatment follow&#xD;
      up until evidence of PD, initiation of another anticancer therapy, withdrawal of consent,&#xD;
      LTFU, death, or end of study. Post-treatment follow up also includes following ongoing&#xD;
      treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) until the event has resolved to baseline grade, the&#xD;
      event is assessed by the investigator as stable, initiations of another anticancer therapy,&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent, LTFU, death, or it has been determined that study drug or&#xD;
      participation is not the cause of the AE.&#xD;
