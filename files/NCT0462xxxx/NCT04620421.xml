      In this assessor-blinded, randomized, controlled trial our primary aim is to quantify the&#xD;
      effects of a six-month rhythm-based multitask training (RYMA) intervention on fall rates&#xD;
      collected over 12 months, compared to continuation of regular activity schedule, among&#xD;
      community-dwelling older adults (≥70 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This assessor-blinded, randomized, controlled trial aim is to quantify the effects of&#xD;
      six-month rhythm-based multitask training (RYMA) on fall rates collected over 12 months,&#xD;
      compared to continuation of regular activity schedule, among community-dwelling older adults&#xD;
      (≥70 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size calculation estimates that 126 older community-dwelling older adults (≥70&#xD;
      years) are needed. Following baseline measures, the recruited participants will randomly be&#xD;
      assigned to either the RYMA or the control group. The participants in the RYMA group will be&#xD;
      assigned to a single weekly one-hour session for six months, while the control group will be&#xD;
      encouraged to continue their regular activity schedule. Assessment of the primary outcome,&#xD;
      fall rates, will be conducted continuously in 12 months from the beginning of training using&#xD;
      monthly fall calendars. When a fall is reported in the fall calendar, a telephone interview&#xD;
      will be conducted to assess circumstances and consequences (e.g. fall-related fractures,&#xD;
      fall-related hospital admissions) of the falls. Moreover, assessment of physical, cognitive,&#xD;
      and social-psychological surrogate outcomes will be made at baseline, six, and 12 months.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately one-third of older adults (≥65 years) fall at least once a year and 40-60% of&#xD;
      falls lead to injuries. Of these injuries, 30-40% are minor, such as brushes, while 10% are&#xD;
      serious, such as head injuries or fractures. Indeed, falls are the most common cause of&#xD;
      injuries among older adults, and injuries are the fifth leading cause of premature death&#xD;
      among older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an attempt to reduce the fall rate, several fall prevention interventions have been&#xD;
      examined. Here, physical exercise has proven as an effective and cost-effective approach.&#xD;
      However, the majority of exercise interventions only addressed physical risk factors while&#xD;
      only a few focused on cognitive risk factors. For instance, a reduced executive function has&#xD;
      been associated with increased fall risk. Thus, interventions addressing both physical and&#xD;
      cognitive functions could enhance the efficacy of fall prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive-motor training is a training modality that simultaneously incorporates physical and&#xD;
      cognitive elements. A cognitive-motor training approach is RhYthm-based Multitask trAining&#xD;
      (RYMA). During RYMA, participants perform rhythm-based balance-challenging multitask&#xD;
      exercises following the rhythm of improvised piano music. A preliminary study by Trombetti et&#xD;
      al. 2011 showed promising results as the fall rate decreased by 54% following six months of&#xD;
      RYMA using a Dalcroze Eurhythmics approach compared to controls. The observed reduced fall&#xD;
      rate may be due to RYMAs ability to decrease gait variability under dual-task conditions,&#xD;
      improve postural balance, and executive function. However, the Trombetti study had some&#xD;
      limitations. For instance, the primary outcome was gait-variability and not fall rates. Thus,&#xD;
      the study was not adequately designed to quantify differences in fall rates (e.g. no&#xD;
      follow-up period with a no-attention control group). Moreover, the effects of RYMA on&#xD;
      social-psychological factors, such as health-related quality of life (HRQoL), fear of&#xD;
      falling, and loneliness is yet be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This assessor-blinded, randomized, controlled trial primarily aims to quantify the effects of&#xD;
      a six-month RYMA intervention on fall rates collected over 12 months compared to continuation&#xD;
      of regular activity schedule, among community-dwelling older adults (≥70 years). Secondly, we&#xD;
      want to evaluate the effects of RYMA on fall risk, fall-related fractures, fall-related&#xD;
      hospital admissions, as well as physical, cognitive, and social-psychological factors to&#xD;
      explain potential mechanisms concerning fall rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community-dwelling older adults, the municipality of Aalborg will be recruited through&#xD;
      appetizers of RYMA, flyers, and advertisements in local newspapers, radio, and television.&#xD;
      After baseline assessments, participants will be randomly allocated to either the RYMA or&#xD;
      control group. The participants in the RYMA group will be assigned to a single weekly&#xD;
      one-hour session for six months, while the control group will be encouraged to continue their&#xD;
      regular activity schedule., which may include self-administrated training exercises. The&#xD;
      primary outcome, fall rate (falls per person-year), will be assessed continuously from the&#xD;
      day of the baseline assessments and for 12 months after the RYMA intervention begins using&#xD;
      monthly fall calendars in line with the recommendation. In the present study, a fall will be&#xD;
      defined as &quot;an unexpected event in which the participant comes to rest on the ground, floor,&#xD;
      or lower-level&quot;. When a fall is reported in the fall calendar, a telephone interview will be&#xD;
      conducted to assess circumstances and consequences (e.g. fall-related fractures, fall-related&#xD;
      hospital admissions) of the falls. The secondary surrogate outcomes will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline, six, and 12 months. All data will be analyzed using an intention-to-treat approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study will be performed before the commencement of the study to evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility of employing RYMA at the senior activity centres and the acceptance of RYMA and&#xD;
      the testing battery among participants. Thus, changes the protocol may be conducted based on&#xD;
      the pilot study findings.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be assigned to a weekly one-hour RYMA session for six months, followed by a six-month follow-up period without training. An experienced instructor will perform the RYMA sessions, which consists of a wide variety of rhythm-based multitask exercises performed to improvised piano music. The RYMA intervention is inspired by Dalcroze eurhythmics and exercises consists of components such as 1) coordination between hands and/or feet, 2) dissociation between hands and/or feet, 3) movements based on musical cues (e.g. follow the tempo), 4) movement inhibition based on musical cues, 5) handling of props (e.g. balls, scarfs, and plates), 6) pair or group-based coordination movements (e.g. clapping each other's hands and mirroring movements), 7) memorizing and repeating of rhythmic patterns, and 8) quick motoric responses to unexpected cues.</description>
