  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The skin punch-biopsies are frequently used technical acts in the current medical practice.&#xD;
      However, while these skills are actually easy to perform, the subsequent healing procedure&#xD;
      remains still poorly harmonized. Indeed, it usually depends on the physicians personal&#xD;
      experiences and some preconceived considerations without any reliable scientific background.&#xD;
      This study aims to explore the performances of a directed wound healing behaviour in&#xD;
      comparison with the suture.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because of the lack of reliable scientific data about this topic, the usual behaviours&#xD;
      concerning the subsequent healing procedure after a punch skin biopsy remains still poorly&#xD;
      defined and harmonized, currently based on the physicians personal experiences and some&#xD;
      preconceived considerations. The few studies available in the literature are supporting the&#xD;
      assumption that the use of a directed wound healing could be as effective as the widely-used&#xD;
      procedure of performing a suture while it does not downgrade the quality of care. However,&#xD;
      due to their methodological quality and applicability, they have not led to a substantial&#xD;
      modification of the common behaviours. Moreover, the development of some new and the&#xD;
      improvement of the former resources could have changed the situation. Therefore, this study&#xD;
      aims to bring some recent pragmatic data to assist the implementation of recommendations&#xD;
      regarding the attitude to adopt for the healing procedure after a skin punch-biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol will consist in a monocentric, prospective, randomized and controlled,&#xD;
      interventional study. It will be carried out with two parallel groups, in a non-inferiority&#xD;
      setting. All the included participants will undergo a skin biopsy using a punch of 4 mm&#xD;
      diameter. Then they will either get a suture by separated knots using a non-absorbable 4.0&#xD;
      wire and a dry dressing, either get only a dry dressing. All the subjects will receive a&#xD;
      phone call at five days after the skin biopsy in order to collect the self-evaluation of the&#xD;
      maximal experienced pain during the healing period. They will also have a single follow-up&#xD;
      appointment one month after the inclusion and a photograph of the scar will be taken during&#xD;
      this medical consultation. This picture will be evaluated by a blind independent investigator&#xD;
      without the presence of the patient.&#xD;
