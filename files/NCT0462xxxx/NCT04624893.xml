      To assess the clinical outcomes following treatment with Pola in combination with&#xD;
      Bendamustine, Rituximab (BR) or Rituximab (R) in patients with R/R DLBCL who are not eligible&#xD;

      This study is a multi-center retrospective observational study. It aims to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of polatuzumab vedotin treatment in patients with hematopoietic stem&#xD;
      cell transplantation ineligible relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (R/R&#xD;
      DLBCL), who met the criteria to access Pola through the compassionate use program (CUP).&#xD;
      Based on the medical records of patients in the four participating hospitals, the study&#xD;
      database will be established by using the unified case report form (CRF) to search extract&#xD;
      information the data of target population from the hospital database, that is, the variables&#xD;
      without personal identification information.&#xD;
