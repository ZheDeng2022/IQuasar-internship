  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that rehabilitation at almost any Body Mass Index (BMI) level leads to&#xD;
      positive functional outcomes. Some data demonstrating that gains are often more rapid at BMI&#xD;
      above &quot;normal&quot;. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between BMI and the&#xD;
      functional progress of all patients admitted to Tan Tock Seng Tertiary Rehabilitation Center.&#xD;

    <measure>Functional Independence Measure (FIM) on Admission</measure>
    <time_frame>Functional Independence Measure (FIM) was measured within 72 hours of admission</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Independence Measure (FIM), the main primary outcome measure during rehabilitation was measured within 72 hours of admission and discharge by rehabilitation therapists all of whom were trained and certified in the use of the FIM. The FIM is an 18-item instrument comprising 13 motor items and 5 cognitive items, with each item graded on a 7-point ordinal scale (1 denotes complete dependence and 7 denotes complete independence), including the ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) across 6 areas (self-care, sphincter control, transfers, locomotion, communication, and social cognition). Total admission FIM (Ta-FIM) scores, total discharge FIM (Td-FIM) scores (18 - 126), motor FIM (m-FIM) sub-scores (13 - 91) and cognitive FIM (c-FIM) sub-scores (5 - 35), were tabulated.</description>

    <measure>Body Mass Index (BMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>All patients had their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters) measured on admission and discharge by rehabilitation nurses 72 hours after rehabilitation admission and prior to planned rehabilitation discharge. Weight was measured via sitting weighing scales or platform weighing scale for bedbound patients while height was measured with height measuring scale or measured in a supine position with legs outstretched and feet in dorsiflexion at end of bed for bedbound patients. BMI is then calculated as weight /height in meters squared.</description>
