  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, phase II, open-label, single-arm investigator initiated trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of eribulin mesylate combined with anlotinib in metastatic&#xD;
      HER2 negative breast cancer patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy in women worldwide. Treatments on metastatic&#xD;
      HER2 negative breast cancer are still under exploration. Therefore, it is imperative to find&#xD;
      a novel therapy to treat these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study explores the efficacy and safety of eribulin mesylate combined with anlotinib in&#xD;
      metastatic HER2 negative breast cancer patients. The primary objective is to evaluate the&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS). The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety of the&#xD;
      combination of eribulin and anlotinib.&#xD;

    <description>Progression-free survival estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods is defined as the time from the date of informed consent to the earlier of death or disease progression. Patients alive without disease progression are censored at the date of last disease evaluation. Progressive disease (PD) based on RECIST 1.1 is at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Equivocal progression of non-target lesions also qualifies as PD.</description>
