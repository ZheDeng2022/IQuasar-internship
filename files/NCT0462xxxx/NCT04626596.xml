  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the etonogestrel&#xD;
      (ENG) contraceptive implant during participants' fourth and fifth years of use when used as&#xD;
      the only method of contraception. The ENG implant is currently approved for a 3-year&#xD;
      duration, and this study aims to confirm available evidence suggesting that the ENG implant&#xD;
      remains highly effective when used up to 5 years.&#xD;

    <measure>Pregnancy Rate (Pearl Index) for At Risk Cycles During Extended-Duration Use</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Pearl Index is expressed as the number of on-treatment pregnancies per 100 woman-years of exposure. An on-treatment pregnancy is defined as a confirmed pregnancy with an estimated date of conception 36 months to 60 months since the date of implant insertion. Exposure in 100 woman-years is equal to the number of cycles of use/1300, and one woman-year is defined as a period of 13 treatment cycles, each 28 days long. Only &quot;at risk&quot; cycles for conception will be included in this Pearl Index calculation. An at risk cycle is defined as a cycle during which participants with ENG implant had affirmed heterosexual intercourse without the use of additional contraception.</description>

    <measure>Pregnancy Rate (Pearl Index) for Alternative At Risk Cycles During Extended-Duration Use</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Pearl Index is expressed as the number of on-treatment pregnancies per 100 woman-years of exposure. An on-treatment pregnancy is defined as a confirmed pregnancy conceived with an estimated date of conception 36 months to 60 months since the date of implant insertion. Exposure in 100 woman-years is equal to the number of cycles of use/1300, and one woman-year is defined as a period of 13 treatment cycles, each 28 days long. Only &quot;alternative at risk&quot; cycles will be included in this Pearl Index calculation.

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experience One or More Adverse Events During Extended-Duration Use</measure>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention.</description>
