  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TQB2618 is a TIM-3 receptor monoclonal antibody that binds to the extracellular domain of&#xD;
      TIM-3 outside the cell to block the binding of TIM-3 to its ligand, thereby inhibiting the&#xD;
      downstream signal transduction of TIM-3 and deactivating TIM-3 Inhibition of immune cells.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      parameters and antitumor effects of TQB2618 injection in subjects with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
