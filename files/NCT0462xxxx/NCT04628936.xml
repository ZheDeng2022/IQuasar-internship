      This is an open-label study to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of KZR-616 in&#xD;
      patients with active polymyositis or dermatomyositis who completed the double-blind treatment&#xD;
      period of Study KZR-616-003, up to and including the Week 32 Visit, prior to the first dose&#xD;
      of open-label KZR-616.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated for eligibility according to the entry criteria at, or within 8&#xD;
      weeks after, the Week 32 Visit (ie, the End of Treatment [EOT] Visit [Visit 34]) of Study&#xD;
      KZR-616-003.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive a SC injection of 30 mg KZR-616 at Visit 1 (Day 1), followed by&#xD;
      weekly SC injections of 45 mg KZR-616 through Week 48 (EOT Visit). The final follow-up visit&#xD;
      will occur 12 weeks following the last dose of KZR-616 (End of Study [EOS] Visit), for a&#xD;
      total length of participation of up to approximately 60 weeks.&#xD;
