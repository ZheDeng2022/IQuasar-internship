      The objective of this randomized controlled study was to demonstrate whether fetal hearing&#xD;
      can be assessed in utero.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unselected women at term of pregnancy (37-41 weeks of gestation) undergoing cardiotocography&#xD;
      (CTG) according to routine clinical care and with a complete postnatal follow-up were&#xD;
      consecutively recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two groups of women were selected in a random way, and it was an unblended randomization&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT), according to a list created by the website ww.randomization.com.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the CTG was non-reactive for 10 minutes women who were eligible for the study were&#xD;
      randomized into two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An auditive stimulus was generated in group A. This stimulus was produced by hitting a&#xD;
      diapason on an acoustic surface, at a distance of 2-3 cm from the mother's skin (in order to&#xD;
      avoid mechanical vibration to reach the fetus) in the area near the fetus' head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same procedure was repeated three times, waiting 30 seconds between one stimulus and the&#xD;
      following one. The total duration of stimulation was about 2 minutes. Cardiac accelerations&#xD;
      on the CTG and fetal movements perceived by the mother were recorded in the ten minutes after&#xD;
      the stimulus was produced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No stimulation was produced in group B, but the CTG was prosecuted until the clinical&#xD;
      criteria were satisfied. The total length of the CTG was variable from a minimum of 20&#xD;
      minutes to a maximum of one hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the clinical variables were recorded in the Case Report Form (CRF) in particular the&#xD;
      lapse of time needed for the first fetal cardiac acceleration and for the first fetal&#xD;
      movement to occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A complete postnatal follow-up was obtained through the examination of medical records and&#xD;
      parental interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A power analysis was carried out using Power Analysis Sample Size (PASS) software&#xD;
      (Kaysville,UT,USA) and was conducted before the enrollment started. It was estimated that,&#xD;
      for a survival comparison test (Log Rank), given the sample allocation ratio=1:1, 100 cases&#xD;
      per group would be needed to validate a hazard ratio between group A and group B of 1.5 with&#xD;
      a power of 80% and a Type I error of 5%.&#xD;
