  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the World Health Organization, childhood obesity is the most serious problem of&#xD;
      this century. Childhood obesity is an important risk factor for many chronic diseases such as&#xD;
      insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease.Childhood&#xD;
      obesity is a serious public health problem and the public health nurse plays an important&#xD;
      role in the prevention of obesity. Especially in schools, positive health behaviors of&#xD;
      children should be developed by considering them within the scope of school health. Changing&#xD;
      the diet in children will make important contributions to the fight against obesity.In order&#xD;
      to change the child's diet, it is necessary to teach the child the correct diet. School is&#xD;
      the most appropriate educational environment in which the right nutrition can be learned and&#xD;
      permanent behavior change can be established.There is a need for effective methods to teach&#xD;
      proper nutrition and to achieve weight loss. The aim of this study was to compare the effect&#xD;
      of Kaledo game and nutrition education prepared according to health belief model on weight&#xD;
      loss in overweight and obese children. This study is randomized controlled experimental&#xD;
      study. There were 2 experiments and a control group in the study. Children in the first&#xD;
      experimental group were a play session one day a week, and the second experimental group&#xD;
      received 20 minutes of nutrition education once a week. No intervention applied to the&#xD;
      control group. Children in all three groups were 0, 3. Month-weight measurements made and&#xD;
      personal information form, nutrition self-efficacy scale, nutrition attitude scale and&#xD;
      nutrition behavior scale applied.&#xD;

      The population of the study consists of overweight and obese students studying in 5th, 6th&#xD;
      and 7th grades of secondary school. However, due to the very large population, 3 secondary&#xD;
      schools were selected. It was decided to select a sample from these three secondary&#xD;
      schools.The children included in the sample were likely to be in different groups. Also, no&#xD;
      intervention would be applied to children in the control group. There could be problems such&#xD;
      as children labeling each other. To avoid these problems, the groups are divided into&#xD;
      schools. The three schools where the research will be conducted were determined by lot&#xD;
      method. The first school formed the Kaledo game group, the second school the nutrition&#xD;
      education group, and the third school the control group. BMI was determined by making&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements of the children attending these schools. These students were&#xD;
      stratified according to their overweight and obese status and gender. According to the power&#xD;
      analysis, the minimum sample size for the experimental and control groups was calculated as&#xD;
      57 for each group. In this context, the sample size for each group was planned to consist of&#xD;
      64 people, taking into account incomplete and incorrect data and absenteeism. In this study&#xD;
      population, students up to the sample size (n = 64) determined (32 overweight students and 32&#xD;
      obese students) by Power analysis for each school were determined by drawing of lots method.&#xD;
      Later, the interventions defined in the groups were initiated.&#xD;

    <description>Kaledo game, which is a board game, has been developed to inform children about healthy eating. The aim of this game is to teach children calorie balance through the calorie values of foods. Kaledo game gives children the opportunity to stay motivated and have fun. While children are having fun, they also gain the knowledge necessary for healthy eating behavior change. The game is played with 2-4 people. A game session takes 15-30 minutes Children in the playgroup played 15-30 minutes (1 round) Kaledo game every week for 12 weeks.</description>
