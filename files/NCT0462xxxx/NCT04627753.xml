  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  After standard treatment of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), high-dose&#xD;
           methotrexate induction therapy, and consolidation therapy, most patients reach complete&#xD;
           remission, but within the first 6 months, 35-60% of patients refractory to treatment or&#xD;
           experience relapse during the first treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The progression-free survival (PFS) period of relapsed patients is 2.2 months (0-29.6&#xD;
           months), and the survival period is reported as 3.5 months (0-29.6 months). After&#xD;
           relapse, the majority of patients die within 2-4 months due to neurologic deterioration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consolidation therapy after induction therapy includes whole-brain radiation therapy,&#xD;
           high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
           (auto-SCT), and high-dose chemotherapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  However, the median age of the inducing patient is 65 years, and more than half of the&#xD;
           patients who are unable to transplant autologous hematopoietic stem cells (auto-SCT)&#xD;
           after induction therapy account for more than half.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Therefore, we intend to conduct a study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
           maintenance therapy for rituximab and lenalidomide as one of the consolidation therapies&#xD;
           for patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -As described, standard treatment for patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma&#xD;
      is not yet based on a high level of evidence, and studies on consolidation therapy for&#xD;
      elderly patients who cannot transplant this disease are very limited. Based on the Korea&#xD;
      National Cancer Incidence Database, about 100 to 150 cases of primary central nervous system&#xD;
      lymphoma are diagnosed per year in Korea, and 15 to 30% of them are judged to experience&#xD;
      recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rituximab and lenalidomide (RR) are drugs that are expected to play a role in patients with&#xD;
      primary central nervous system lymphoma who have already refractory or relapsed as described&#xD;
      above, but there is a big hurdle that the number of patients is limited. Since then, it has&#xD;
      not been studied as consolidation therapy in elderly or non-transplantable patients.&#xD;
      Therefore, the present investigators attempted to confirm the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      lenalidomide/rituximab maintenance therapy in patients with primary central nervous system&#xD;
      lymphoma who received high-dose methotrexate-containing anticancer drug, but could not&#xD;
      receive consolidation therapy with autograft.&#xD;
