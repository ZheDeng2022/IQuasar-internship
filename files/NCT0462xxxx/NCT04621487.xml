      Non-bismuth quadruple therapies have been proposed as potential strategies in improving the&#xD;
      efficacy of first-line treatments. The non-bismuth quadruple therapy in its concomitant&#xD;
      variant consists of proton pump inhibitor, amoxicillin, nitroimidazole and clarithromycin&#xD;
      given concurrently twice daily. As a result of concurrent administration this therapy has&#xD;
      given better results according to some studies in comparison to sequential variants. However,&#xD;
      this therapy, as well suffers from the aforementioned increase in antibiotic resistance.&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare concomitant non-bismuth quadruple therapy&#xD;
      with a tailored therapy based on antibiotic strain susceptibility testing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than half of world population are H.pylori carriers. The infection is mostly acquired in&#xD;
      childhood and persists lifelong. A notable risk factor is a lower social and economic status&#xD;
      during childhood reflecting mostly poor hygienic standard or small and dense living area.&#xD;
      Newly acquired infections in adulthood are a rarity. The reservoir of H. Pylori is the human&#xD;
      stomach. H. pylori is considered to be the main pathogen involved in causing benign peptic&#xD;
      ulcer and functional dyspepsia as well as gastric cancer. The treatment of H. Pylori&#xD;
      infection is currently complicated by an increase in antimicrobial resistance in different&#xD;
      parts of the world. Corresponding increase in clarithromycin as well as quinolone and&#xD;
      metronidazole resistance poses a major clinical problem and calls for a new approach to&#xD;
      treatment. Under such circumstances there is an emerging trend towards personalized&#xD;
      eradication therapy. Since H. Pylori infection is an infectious disease its optimal treatment&#xD;
      should both theoretically and practically be based on the specific characteristics of the&#xD;
      strain and if possible the host of the infection. The aim of such an approach should be a&#xD;
      better eradication efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-bismuth quadruple therapies have been proposed as potential strategies in improving the&#xD;
      efficacy of first-line treatments. The non-bismuth quadruple therapy in its concomitant&#xD;
      variant consists of proton pump inhibitor, amoxicillin, nitroimidazole and clarithromycin&#xD;
      given concurrently twice daily. As a result of concurrent administration this therapy has&#xD;
      given better results according to some studies in comparison to sequential variants. However,&#xD;
      this therapy, as well suffers from the aforementioned increase in antibiotic resistance.&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare concomitant non-bismuth quadruple therapy&#xD;
      with a tailored therapy based on antibiotic strain susceptibility testing assuming that&#xD;
      eradication rate with tailored therapy will be above 90%.&#xD;
