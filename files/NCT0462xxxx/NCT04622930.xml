    <textblock>
      The investigators are testing the efficacy of Smartphone-delivered cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      therapy (CBT) treatment for social anxiety disorder (SAD). The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      participants receiving app-CBT will have greater reduction in LSAS scores than those in the&#xD;
      waitlist condition at treatment endpoint (week 12).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aims of this study are to test the efficacy of a Smartphone-based CBT treatment&#xD;
      for adults with SAD recruited nationally. Eligible subjects (N=80) will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to 12 weeks of Smartphone-delivered CBT for SAD either immediately, or after a 12-week long&#xD;
      waiting period (50-50 chance). The investigators hypothesize that Smartphone-delivered CBT&#xD;
      for SAD will be feasible and acceptable to individuals with SAD, and that it will lead to&#xD;
      greater reductions in SAD symptom severity compared to the passage of time (waitlist&#xD;
      control).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Endpoint (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) is a clinician-administered measure of social anxiety symptom severity. It contains 24 social situations likely to elicit social anxiety, and items are scored on a Likert scale ranging from 0 to 3. Higher scores indicate more severe SAD symptoms. The LSAS will be used to assess change in social anxiety symptoms from baseline to endpoint.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in depression severity as assessed by change in The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale - Revised (CESD-R) total scores from baseline to week 12.</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who receive app-CBT will have a difference in depression severity as assessed by change in The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale - Revised (CESD-R) total scores from baseline to week 12. The CESD-R is a self-report measure of depressive symptoms consisting of 20 scale items with responses ranging from 0 to 4, including two questions about suicidal ideation (item #14, #15). Higher scores correspond with greater depression severity, and the measure is a well-validated, sensitive measure of symptom severity in depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in functional impairment as measured by change in The Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) total scores from baseline to week 12.</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who receive app-CBT will have a difference in functional impairment as measured by change in The Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) total scores from baseline to week 12. The WSAS uses a Likert scale from 0 (not at all impaired) to 8 (very severely impaired) to assess impairment in occupational, social, and family/friends domains. Higher scores indicate greater impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in quality of life as assessed by change in The Quality of Life, Enjoyment, and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form (QLESQ-SR) total scores from baseline to week 12.</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who receive app-CBT will have a difference in quality of life as assessed by change in The Quality of Life, Enjoyment, and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form (QLESQ-SR) total scores from baseline to week 12. The Q-LES-Q-SF is a self-report measure of subjective quality of life, containing Likert items ranging from 1 (Very Poor) to 5 (Very Good). Total scores are presented as a percentage of the maximum value (i.e., ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater quality of life).</description>

    <description>12-week Smartphone-delivered CBT for SAD. In-person cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an empirically supported treatment for SAD. The app-delivered CBT in this project includes modules such as cognitive skills (e.g., cognitive restructuring, core belief work), behavioral skills (e.g., exposure with ritual prevention), and perceptual retraining/mindfulness skills.</description>
