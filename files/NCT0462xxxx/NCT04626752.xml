        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subjects voluntarily participated in the study and signed the informed consent&#xD;
             form by themselves or their legal guardian;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. According to the international standard for multiple myeloma (IMWG 2014);&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Diagnosed as relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Relapsed and refractory were&#xD;
             defined as follow.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Relapsed: patients had received for at least 3 drugs with different mechanisms of&#xD;
             action (including protease inhibitors and immunomodulators) and disease progression&#xD;
             within 60 days of the most recent treatment. Refractory was defined as: disease&#xD;
             progression occurred during the recent treatment, or disease progression occurred&#xD;
             within 60 days after treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The expression of BCMA in myeloma cells was reported as positive by flow cytometry or&#xD;

          4. Patients who need urgent treatment due to tumor progression or spinal cord&#xD;
             compression;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The investigator determines that there are serious complications or diseases that will&#xD;
             increase the risk of the subject or affect the study, including but not limited to,&#xD;
             for example, cirrhosis, recent major trauma, etc;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. After allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiency or other diseases requiring&#xD;
             immunosuppressive（excluding glucocorticoid）therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. There was uncontrolled active infection;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. There were live vaccinations within 4 weeks before admission;&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Active hepatitis (positive for HBVDNA or HCVRNA), syphilis and other acquired and&#xD;
             congenital immunodeficiency diseases, including but not limited to those with HIV&#xD;
             infection;&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects had a history of alcohol, drug or mental illness;&#xD;
&#xD;
