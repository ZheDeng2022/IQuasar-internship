    <textblock>
      This is to be one-centre, single ascending dose and double-blind multiple ascending dose two&#xD;
      part study of CPL207280 compound in healthy volunteers. PART A is a single dose, open-label&#xD;
      part with CPL207280 compound administered with dose escalation between cohorts.Additionaly&#xD;
      assessing the effect of food and effect of metformin on bioavailability of CPL207280 is to be&#xD;
      done in additional cohort. PART B is a multiple, double-blind part with CPL207280 compound&#xD;
      administered for 14 days with dose escalation between cohorts. Participants in this part are&#xD;
      to be randomized to receive Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) or placebo in 3:1 ratio.&#xD;
      Safety and pharmacokinetic properties of CPL207280 compound is to be determined following&#xD;
      different doses in single oral IMP administration in PART A and different doses of IMP&#xD;
      administered orally for two weeks in PART B.&#xD;
