  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since 2012, NGS sequencing of long fragments or long reads has developed in various fields of&#xD;
      research and today presents itself as a very promising alternative solution in the analysis&#xD;
      of repeat amplifications. The Oxford Nanopore NGS automaton offers the prospect of bringing&#xD;
      together 1st and 2nd line analyzes of all loci potentially indicated in neurogenetics at the&#xD;
      same time. The project aims to compare the use of this new technology with methods currently&#xD;
      used in reference laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to evaluate the ability of next-generation high-throughput Oxford&#xD;
      Nanopore-type sequencing (NEURONGS3) to diagnose 9 neurogenetic diseases compared to&#xD;
      reference protocols via PCR (+/- Southern blot).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to evaluate the repeatability of the NGS (intra-sample&#xD;
      reproducibility) analysis in the diagnosis of 8 neurogenetic diseases.&#xD;

      Multicenter cross-sectional early phase diagnostic study on already existing biological&#xD;
