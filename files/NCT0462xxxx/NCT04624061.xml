      The INTEGRATED HIV/HTN is a hybrid type-1 effectiveness/implementation cluster randomised&#xD;
      trial evaluating the introduction of a multi-component integrated HIV/HTN care model&#xD;
      intervention, randomised to 13 districts in the intervention arm compared to 13 districts in&#xD;
      the control. Selected health facilities within the 13 intervention districts will receive the&#xD;
      intervention while those in the 13 control districts will continue implementing the standard&#xD;
      of care as per the Ministry of Health (MoH) guidelines. All the participating facilities will&#xD;
      receive blood pressure (BP) machines, and Non- communicable diseases (NCDs) registers as a&#xD;
      standard of care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to evaluate a multi-component integrated HIV/HTN care intervention&#xD;
      through a cluster randomised controlled trial. A cluster has been defined at the level of the&#xD;
      district which is the randomisation unit. A total of 26 districts will be randomised.&#xD;
      Selected health facilities within the 13 intervention districts will receive the&#xD;
      multi-component intervention of combined HIV and (hypertension) HTN care which includes; 1)&#xD;
      Training and capacity building on the INTEGRATED HIV/HTN model and NCD care; 2) the&#xD;
      Integrated HIV/HTN care delivery model by promoting HTN screening and care in HIV clinics; 3)&#xD;
      Health management information system (HMIS) enhancements through mentorship and coaching on&#xD;
      the use of NCD registers and NCD patient cards and HTN data capture in the EMR system; and 4)&#xD;
      Short messaging system (SMS) and/or WhatsApp for data coordination and communication among&#xD;
      providers, DHOs and the study team (who acts as mentors). The 13 control districts will&#xD;
      continue implementing the current standard of care as per MoH guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will test the hypothesis that a multi-component intervention of combined&#xD;
      HIV and HTN care, based on the PRECEDE framework, to continuously identify barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators leads to better health outcomes including dual control of HIV/HTN among adults&#xD;
      in HIV care in the intervention compared to control facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives are as follows;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the effectiveness of an integrated HIV/HTN care model on HTN and dual&#xD;
           HIV/HTN control among adult patients in HIV clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the barriers and facilitators of the integrated HIV/HTN care model for HIV&#xD;
           patients at different levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the cost, cost-effectiveness and incremental gain costs of the integrated&#xD;
           HIV/Hypertension care model approach.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>IDRC will use its proprietary Data Management system to manage and store the data throughout the life of the project. Data is transferred to the system from remote sites via an encrypted link using secure File Transfer Protocol. The system includes a data repository specific to this study which is accessible only to designated study personnel. Study staff will access the repository via a password protected website and the data will be transferred over an encrypted connection via secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol.&#xD;
After the study, clean study datasets will be made shareable in a public certified repository that supports open access. Prior to release, all datasets will be reviewed to ensure they are properly de identified. Any workflows will be exactly described and documented such that it will allow any external groups to precisely reproduce results from the raw data. IDRC will also keep the raw data on the IDRC servers for at least 5 years after the end of the study.</ipd_description>
