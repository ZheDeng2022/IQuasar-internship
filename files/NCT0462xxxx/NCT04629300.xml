    <textblock>
      This research study is looking at the role of a supportive care mobile app in improving&#xD;
      symptoms, coping skills, and quality of life in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Feasibility Study, which is the first-time investigators are&#xD;
      examining this supportive care mobile app intervention. The goal of this research study is to&#xD;
      refine and examine the feasibility and benefits of a supportive care mobile app to improve&#xD;
      symptoms, coping skills, and quality of life in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
      Many people diagnosed with lung cancer experience challenging symptoms and increased stress.&#xD;
      To help address these concerns, this study is exploring how a mobile application (app)&#xD;
      intervention, designed specifically for people with lung cancer, can expand the availability&#xD;
      of much needed supportive care services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A supportive care mobile app consisting of six intervention modules that focus on&#xD;
           components of wellbeing, such as physical, social, functional, and emotional wellbeing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires asking about demographic information (e.g., gender, ethnicity, income)&#xD;
           and participants' experience with cancer (e.g., quality of life, symptoms)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data collection from participants medical records&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing a baseline study questionnaire, participants will be randomized into two (2)&#xD;
      study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Usual Care Group: Participants will receive standard oncology care and attend their&#xD;
           regular clinic visits. Study staff will monitor participant use of supportive care&#xD;
           services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention Group: Participants will be provided with a study-issued tablet computer to&#xD;
           access the mobile app and receive tutorial and instructions for how to use the app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be in this research study for 12-14 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 120 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsors of this study are the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and&#xD;
      AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals. NCCN is a non-profit alliance of leading cancer centers across&#xD;
      the United States, and AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals is a global bio-pharmaceutical company.&#xD;
      These two sponsors are together providing funding and oversight for the conduct of this&#xD;
      research study.&#xD;
