    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate preliminary safety and efficacy of TP-0184 to treat anemia when&#xD;
      administered to adult patients with Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R)&#xD;
      low or intermediate risk MDS. The recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be determined by the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) in the Phase 1 portion of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
