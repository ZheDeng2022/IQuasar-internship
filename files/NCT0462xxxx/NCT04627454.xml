    <textblock>
      Anterior cervical decompression and fusion (ACDF) is the traditional method for treating&#xD;
      degenerative cervical disc disease, providing satisfactory results in a high proportion of&#xD;
      patients. However, stabilization of the treated segment may result in loss of mobility as a&#xD;
      functional spinal unit and acceleration of degeneration of the adjacent disc. Re operations&#xD;
      may be required to treat complications of fusion, such as recurrent radicular symptoms,&#xD;
      non-union, graft collapse, or expulsion. Many previous studies have shown that loss of motion&#xD;
      at the fused level is compensated by increased motion at adjacent segments after ACDF, which&#xD;
      induces a high rate of degenerative change adjacent to the fused segment. Cervical non-fusion&#xD;
      techniques have increasingly been accepted and applied by spine surgeons. As a main component&#xD;
      of cervical non-fusion techniques, artificial cervical disc replacement provides good ROM of&#xD;
      the cervical spine. Dynamic cervical stabilization with the DCI is a novel treatment approach&#xD;
      for cervical disc disease that was initially conceived as a method to combine the potential&#xD;
      advantages of fusion and total disc replacement. The first DCI was designed by Matgé in 2002&#xD;
      for treating cervical spondylosis. Paradigm spine introduced the second generation DCIs in&#xD;
      2005. A U-shaped appearance and axial elasticity are two the most significant&#xD;
      characteristics. A prospective study by Matgé et al. in 2009 showed that the clinical&#xD;
      efficacy was satisfactory after DCI replacement in 102 cases of cervical spondylosis and&#xD;
      during a 1-year follow-up; there was neither device migration nor subsidence. The basic&#xD;
      concept of the inter-body implant is to maintain a distraction-compression mechanism and so&#xD;
      avoid possible collapse of the disc height. This is achieved using the special titanium-alloy&#xD;
      DCI, which is bio compatible, available in various sizes, and provided with different foot&#xD;
      prints. The U-shaped body provides support and has tooth-like serrations that resist&#xD;
      expulsion or retropulsion of the implant when placed into the inter-vertebral space. With the&#xD;
      end-plate left intact, osteogenesis and bone fusion are inhibited and no further hetero-topic&#xD;
      fusions are supposed to occur. The initial clinical and radio graphic results with the DCI&#xD;
      appear promising as an alternative to TDR and ACDF in the treatment of cervical disc disease.&#xD;
      It affords maximal neurological improvement, along with maintenance of excellent clinical&#xD;
      outcomes. The potential bio-mechanical advantages of DCI include the ability to maintain&#xD;
      device-level motion and minimize the development of adjacent-segment disease, while&#xD;
      protecting the facet joints from excessive stresses noted with other motion-preserving&#xD;
      devices during lateral bending, axial rotation, and extension. The surgical technique&#xD;
      included the use of a conventional anterior cervical approach and discectomy. As reported,&#xD;
      disc replacement with DCI is a new strategy, in between ACDF &amp; ADR. It is an intermediate&#xD;
      solution in the spectrum of management strategies of cervical disc diseases. Immediate&#xD;
      dynamic stability with good clinical response and no implant-related morbidity or&#xD;
      complications are the main advantages of this implant.&#xD;
