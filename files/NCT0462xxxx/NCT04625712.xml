      Introduction Acute pancreatitis is the third gastrointestinal cause of hospital admission. It&#xD;
      is estimated that 35-60% have a biliary origin, and most of them are mild.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a mild acute biliary pancreatitis (ABP), there is a high risk of recurrence of others&#xD;
      biliary events. 15-20% of patients will suffer another pancreatitis, cholangitis,&#xD;
      choledocolithiasis, or cholecystitis. Therefore, is necessary a definitive treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although it is suggested to perform cholecystectomy early, there is still insufficient&#xD;
      scientific evidence on this subject. All publications have biases and do not allow establish&#xD;
      recommendations. In addition, the usual clinical practice tends to postpone the&#xD;
      cholecystectomy, because of doubts about the safety of early intervention and for hospital&#xD;
      logistical reasons. On the other hand, is discussing if early cholecystectomy carried out&#xD;
      more persistence of residual cholelithiasis, explains for the pathophysiology of the ABP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, it is important to mention, that in our environment 25% of the patients with an ABP&#xD;
      are more than 75 years old. There are not any trial that includes this age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Demonstrate that early cholecystectomy is feasible in all patients, including&#xD;
      elderly patients, and decreases the number of readmissions for other biliary events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods It is being done a multicenter prospective randomized trial. After an&#xD;
      ABP, patients are randomized in two treatment branches. Group A is cholecystectomy within the&#xD;
      first week after the ABP. Group B four weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are collect data from demographic information, comorbidities, biliary events before the&#xD;
      surgery, residual choledocolithiasis, difficulty of the surgical technique, postoperative&#xD;
      complications and patients are follow-up for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain a representative sample of the population, we consider it appropriate to include&#xD;
      all age groups, including patients older than 75 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results With this study we pretend to demonstrate that early cholecystectomy is&#xD;
      feasible and safe. It does not increase the number of residual choledocolithiasis, and&#xD;
      prevents readmissions for new biliary events.&#xD;
