  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with kidney failure receiving maintenance hemodialysis (HD) have high mortality&#xD;
      rates, driven largely by cardiovascular causes. Volume-related factors are critical,&#xD;
      modifiable contributors to cardiovascular complications. Reversing volume overload has been&#xD;
      shown to improve blood pressure and cardiac remodeling. Use of loop diuretics may represent a&#xD;
      pragmatic, low-cost, and low-burden strategy to improve outcomes in people receiving HD. Lack&#xD;
      of data on optimal furosemide dosing, safety, and acceptability are barriers to expanded use.&#xD;
      This study investigates whether oral furosemide is safe and effective at increasing urine&#xD;
      volume in HD patients.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a single-center (multi-clinic), open-label, non-randomized pilot study to test whether oral furosemide is safe and effective at increasing urine volume in HD patients. The study will consist of 2 periods: a 6-week dose escalation period (period 1) and a subsequent 12-week follow-up period (period 2). During period 1, all participants will receive escalating doses of furosemide as tolerated, and the short-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of furosemide will be examined. During period 2, all participants will continue the maximally tolerated period 1 furosemide dose, and the acceptability of and adherence to furosemide and the longer-term safety and efficacy of furosemide will be examined.</intervention_model_description>

First 2 weeks of the study: participants not taking oral furosemide at enrollment will take 80mg furosemide twice daily, those taking oral furosemide at enrollment will stay on their prescribed dose, and those taking another loop diuretic at enrollment will discontinue their prescription and take an equivalent oral furosemide dose. At week 4: dose escalation if tolerated (from 80mg to 120mg twice daily for the 1st group, and a 50% increased dose not &gt;320mg/day for the 2nd &amp; 3rd groups). At week 6: dose escalation if tolerated (from 120mg to 160mg twice daily for the 1st group, and a 50% increased dose not &gt;320mg/day for the 2nd &amp; 3rd groups).
