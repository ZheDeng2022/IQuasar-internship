      Phase Ib clinical trial using Autologous Dendritic Cell Vaccine Loaded with Personalized&#xD;
      Peptides (PEP) in order to stimulate/induce both innate and adaptive immunity by activating&#xD;
      T-cells and Natural Killer (NK) cells, combined with standard of care (SOC) adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy, followed by nivolumab, an antibody against Programmed Cell Death 1 (PD-1), to&#xD;
      maintain and boost the vaccine's effect in patients with non-metastatic resectable pancreatic&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, single arm, phase Ib trial to evaluate the feasibility, safety,&#xD;
      immunogenicity, and efficacy of subcutaneous dendritic cell (DC) vaccine loaded with&#xD;
      personalized peptides [PEP-DC vaccine] in combination with standard of care adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy (gemcitabine and capecitabine), followed by the antibody nivolumab in patients&#xD;
      with non-metastatic surgically resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have previously undergone collection of resected advanced pancreatic tumor&#xD;
      tissue under a different research protocol with a separate informed consent. After&#xD;
      registration, all patients will receive standard of care chemotherapy consisting of&#xD;
      intravenous gemcitabine, and oral capecitabine for eight 21-day cycles. Additionally, all&#xD;
      eligible patients will undergo apheresis during the last week of cycle 3 of standard of care&#xD;
      chemotherapy to collect peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for dendritic cell vaccine&#xD;
      production. All patients will receive at least six PEP-DC vaccinations starting concomitant&#xD;
      with the 5th cycle of chemotherapy. Vaccine will be administered subcutaneously every 3&#xD;
      weeks, on day 9 (the day after last gemcitabine infusion) of each 21-day cycle, and&#xD;
      thereafter every four weeks starting from the second nivolumab administration. Nivolumab&#xD;
      intravenous administration will start three weeks after the last cycle of chemotherapy and&#xD;
      will be given as a flat dose every 2 weeks during the vaccination period until the last&#xD;
      vaccine dose or at least 8 weeks after the end of the last chemotherapy cycle if vaccination&#xD;
      stops earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular physical examination, radiological evaluation and blood testing for safety parameters&#xD;
      will be performed according to the schedule during treatment.&#xD;
