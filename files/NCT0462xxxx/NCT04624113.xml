      The primary aim of the phase 1 portion of the trial is to establish the recommended phase 2&#xD;
      dose (RP2D) of tazemetostat in combination with a fixed dose of pembrolizumab in patients&#xD;
      with recurrent or metastatic (RM) head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the phase 2 portion of the trial is to establish the proportion of&#xD;
      patients with pembrolizumab- or nivolumab-resistant, PD-L1 positive, RM head and neck&#xD;
      squamous-cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who achieve an objective tumor response to tazemetostat and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;

                  cancers that originate in the head and neck, except central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
                  cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Phase 2 specific: recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
                  of the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx or hypopharynx.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Phase 1 specific: Measurable or evaluable disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Phase 2 specific: Measurable disease per RECIST. Measurable disease defined as&#xD;
                  lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest&#xD;
                  diameter to be recorded) as ≥ 10 mm with CT scan, as ≥ 20 mm by chest x-ray, or ≥&#xD;
                  10 mm with calipers by clinical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Phase 2 specific: Progression of disease, as assessed by RECIST, that occurred on&#xD;
             prior pembrolizumab or nivolumab (given alone or with other therapy) in the last 6&#xD;
             months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Phase 2 specific: PD-L1 positive (CPS ≥ 1 by IHC, 22C3 antibody) on archived tumor&#xD;
             tissue. If CPS not available, tumors with PD-L1 TPS ≥ 1 are also eligible (but CPS&#xD;
             should be performed in these cases).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Incurable disease (defined as surgery and/or radiation is unable to offer curative&#xD;
             potential), or ineligible for (or patient declined) local therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 1&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of tazemetostat on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason&#xD;
             and because histone methyltransferase (HMT) agents are known to be teratogenic, women&#xD;
             of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal&#xD;
             or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration&#xD;
             of study participation, and for 6 months after the last day of treatment. Should a&#xD;
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,&#xD;
             she must inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this&#xD;
             protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the&#xD;
             duration of the study, and for 6 months after last day of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent&#xD;
             document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiation, chemotherapy, or targeted therapy within 14 days of treatment start.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Phase 2 specific: Prior therapy with an EZH2 inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Investigational therapy within 21 days of treatment start.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of other malignancy with the exception of malignancies for which all&#xD;
             treatment was completed at least 1 year before registration and the patient has no&#xD;
             evidence of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known active CNS metastases. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may&#xD;
             participate provided they are stable (without any evidence of progression by imaging 4&#xD;
             weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment and any neurologic symptoms have&#xD;
             stabilized), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are on stable&#xD;
             or tapering doses of steroids for at least 14 days prior to first dose of study&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or&#xD;
             biologic composition to tazemetostat, pembrolizumab, or other agents used in the&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Unable to swallow oral medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving systemic corticosteroid therapy (in doses exceeding 10 mg daily of&#xD;
             prednisone equivalent) within 7 days prior to the first dose of treatment. A history&#xD;
             of severe autoimmune disorder requiring high-dose corticosteroid treatment due to&#xD;
             prior PD-1 inhibitor is an exclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative&#xD;
             serum pregnancy test within 7 days of first dose of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior organ or allogeneic stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has an active autoimmune disease (i.e. rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Sjogren's&#xD;
             syndrome) that has required IV or subcutaneous systemic treatment in the past 6 months&#xD;
             (excluding Rituxan). Replacement therapy (i.e. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic&#xD;
             corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is&#xD;
             not considered a form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
