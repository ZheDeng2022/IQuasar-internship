      This study aims to determine whether a breath test could be used for early detection of&#xD;
      hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are attending for a planned liver outpatient services or investigations will be&#xD;
      approached to provide a breath sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi platform mass spectrometry analysis will be performed to establish volatile biomarkers&#xD;
      that can discriminate between fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Volatile organic compound (VOCs) emitted from the human body have been of interest to&#xD;
      researchers for several decades. In 1971, Pauling et al reported that breath and urine&#xD;
      contained approximately 250 and 280 VOCs respectively in normal human subjects. VOCs are&#xD;
      traditionally measured in food industry and counter-terrorism. Routine clinical applications&#xD;
      include the alcohol breathalyser, 13-C urea breath test for H. pylori, nitric oxide in&#xD;
      asthma, and hydrogen/methane test for bacteria overgrowth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary work has suggested that there is alteration in the VOC profile of patients with&#xD;
      liver disease. It is suggested that as fibrosis increases, liver function is impaired,&#xD;
      resulting in increased levels of certain compounds. These compounds are then present at&#xD;
      higher levels within the blood stream and when they reach the lungs, they are exhaled. There&#xD;
      has also been work demonstrating a change in the profile of VOCs within cancers,&#xD;
      demonstrating specific &quot;breath signatures&quot; in patients with oesophageal cancer. At Imperial&#xD;
      College London, Marker et al have developed a breath test as screening test for oesophageal&#xD;
      cancer with comparable sensitivity and specificity to other screening methods (e.g. faecal&#xD;
      occult blood testing). The investigators would aim to achieve similar with hepatobiliary&#xD;
      disease via a prospective cross-sectional study aimed at determining the diagnostic accuracy&#xD;
      of exhaled breath volatile organic compounds (VOC) for the detection of liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from outpatient clinics and hospital wards based across Imperial&#xD;
      College Healthcare Trust. They may also be recruited from the radiology department when&#xD;
      attending for liver biopsies or hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance ultrasound scans. When&#xD;
      attending for their appointment, a member of the research team will discuss the research&#xD;
      project with the patient, explain that is requires the patient to provide a breath +/- urine&#xD;
      sample. Patients will be provided with a patient information leaflet. If the patient is to&#xD;
      agree to this, they will be asked to sign a written consent form. If a recent PHES test has&#xD;
      not been performed, one will be conducted otherwise no additional investigations, invasive or&#xD;
      otherwise will be required of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients under regular follow up within the trust, they may be asked to consent to&#xD;
      further breath samples being taken at future appointments to facilitate longitudinal follow&#xD;
      up. Patients will be entitled to withdraw at any point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients attending for endoscopy, fibroscan or liver biopsy will have been nil by mouth for&#xD;
      4-6 hours prior to the procedure as per local guidelines. For those attending outpatient&#xD;
      appointments, if identified prior to their appointment by their clinical team, the&#xD;
      investigators will aim to contact the patients and request that they fast. Should they not be&#xD;
      fasted, they may be asked to perform basic oral hygiene techniques (e.g. rinsing mouth with&#xD;
      water), prior to the breath sample being taken. A food diary of the preceding 24 hours will&#xD;
      be taken as part of the pre-sampling questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the consent process, patients will also be asked permission to access their&#xD;
      hospital records for the purpose of the research study only, including their blood tests,&#xD;
      radiology and pathology results. All data will be anonymised and all hospital records shall&#xD;
      be handled with strict confidentiality in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and&#xD;
      the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to give a number of exhalations into a breath sampling device until a&#xD;
      defined volume of breath has been sampled. This may be done via one of several techniques.&#xD;
      The investigators preferred option is that they breathe into a custom designed nalophan bag&#xD;
      which is attached to thermal desorption tubes and a breath sampling device. Alternatively,&#xD;
      patient may be asked to perform normal tidal breathing whilst wearing a face mask, which&#xD;
      takes around 2 minutes on average. Patients located at St Mary's Hospital may also be asked&#xD;
      to breathe directly into a mass spectrometer machine (SYFT Voice200Ultra). This mass&#xD;
      spectrometer instrument is a self-contained mobile device which can be moved between clinical&#xD;
      areas within St Mary's Hospital. Sampling by this method will involve a single deep nasal&#xD;
      inhalation followed by complete exhalation via their mouth into a plastic cylinder connected&#xD;
      to a tube leading to the mass spectrometer itself. This is repeated three times within a 60&#xD;
      second window. The investigators expect the breath sampling process to take no longer than&#xD;
      5-10 minutes in total. Patients will be requested to pass urine into a standardised 60ml&#xD;
      urine specimen vial, which will be immediately sealed. 20ml of urine will be aliquoted into a&#xD;
      standard 60ml specimen vial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VOCs from the breath will be trapped onto adsorbent tubes inserted into the breath taking&#xD;
      device. After sampling the adsorbent tube is removed from the device, capped and transported&#xD;
      back to the laboratory at St Mary's Hospital London for analysis. Samples will be transported&#xD;
      by courier or by a member of the research team. The sample(s) shall undergo analysis via mass&#xD;
      spectrometry instruments, at St Mary's Hospital London.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breath VOCs sampled on adsorbent tubes will be analysed within 48 hours of collection. The&#xD;
      sample constituents are destroyed within the mass spectrometer for detection meaning that no&#xD;
      clinical material will remain after analysis by the mass spectrometry instruments. Urine&#xD;
      samples will be stored within a registered tissue bank in accordance with the Human Tissue&#xD;
      Act and disposed of following analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the study, the investigators will aim to follow patients up longitudinally to&#xD;
      ascertain if a participant's VOC profile changes with progression or regression of liver&#xD;
      disease. At each appointment, before sample is taken, the participant's consent will be&#xD;
      reviewed and if the participant is still willing to continue in the study, further breath and&#xD;
      urine samples will then be collected. This would be for a maximum of 24 months.&#xD;
