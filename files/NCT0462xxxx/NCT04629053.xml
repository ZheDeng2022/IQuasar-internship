  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective multi-site observational study aims to describe causes and clinical outcomes&#xD;
      of acute febrile illness as well as host biomarkers in patients aged &gt;28 days residing in&#xD;
      rural areas in Laos, Myanmar and Bangladesh and presenting with acute febrile illnesses (≤ 14&#xD;
      days duration) to participating health facilities.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of people in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in South and Southeast&#xD;
      Asia live in rural areas. These people are some of the poorest in the region and the exact&#xD;
      health issues which concern them, in that they have not been fully studied, have not been&#xD;
      well defined. Despite this lack of data, there are indications that disease of an infectious&#xD;
      aetiology, 'febrile illness,' in particular in the tropics, still accounts for significant&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. This is in contrast to higher-income countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The South and Southeast Asian Community-based Trials Network in Rural Febrile Illness project&#xD;
      (SEACTN RFI) aims to better understand and quantify the burden of febrile illness, the&#xD;
      aetiological causes and the manner in which it affects the people of the area, all on a scale&#xD;
      which has not been attempted before. It will collect information to help better understand&#xD;
      and predict these outcomes based on a multitude of factors, which will form the basis for&#xD;
      interventions within the network in the future. The initial study will be observational, as&#xD;
      the current understanding of the local health issues and the health systems in these areas is&#xD;
      insufficient to know how best to intervene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a separate work package, Work Package A (WP-A), will be collecting data from within the&#xD;
      participating SEACTN communities through village health workers (VHWs) and local health&#xD;
      facilities on the incidence, causes and outcomes of febrile illness in these areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Work Package B (WP-B) will recruit patients seeking care at higher level facilities than&#xD;
      the WP-A VHWs and health centres. These patients are likely to be more severely ill,&#xD;
      therefore in order to obtain a more thorough understanding of the causes and burden of&#xD;
      febrile illness in these areas. A broader range of specimens, including venous blood samples&#xD;
      and respiratory specimens, and conduct in-depth diagnostic testing including blood cultures,&#xD;
      serological assays, PCR and validation of 'pathogen blind' next generation sequencing&#xD;
      approaches will be collected. The data from WP-A gathered in the community complemented by&#xD;
      the WP-B data from higher level health facilities in the same regions will provide a rich&#xD;
      understanding of the causes, incidence and outcomes of febrile illness in these areas. These&#xD;
      data will be analysed using advanced statistical methodology to create electronic&#xD;
      decision-support tools (eDSTs) to aid VHWs in their assessment, triage and treatment of&#xD;
      patients. These and other relevant interventions will later be trialled across the SEACTN&#xD;
      villages.&#xD;
