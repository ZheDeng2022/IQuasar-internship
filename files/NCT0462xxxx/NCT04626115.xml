  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence and mortality of renal cell carcinoma are increasing year by year.&#xD;
      Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is helpful for early diagnosis and treatment to renal tumor, and&#xD;
      is of great importance to distinguish benign from malignant and clinical stages&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The morbidity of renal cell carcinoma is only lower to prostate cancer and bladder cancer in&#xD;
      urinary tumor, and the mortality rate is up to 40%. At present, diagnostic techniques such as&#xD;
      ultrasonography, CT examination and MRI examination are widely used in Clinical practice,&#xD;
      which greatly improves the detection rate of asymptomatic renal cell carcinoma. Compared with&#xD;
      enhanced MRI and enhanced CT, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has outstanding advantages,&#xD;
      including spatial, temporal and contrast resolution, continuous real-time visualization,.&#xD;
      Sonazoid, the second generation ultrasound contrast agent, is composed of microbubbles&#xD;
      containing chemically stable and insoluble perfluorobutane (PFB) gas and phosphatidylserine&#xD;
      sodium hard shell (diameter 2-3μm) wrapped by outer layer. These microbubbles can generate&#xD;
      stable nonlinear oscillation in low-power sound field, and generate echo at the second&#xD;
      harmonic frequency of transmitted pulse. Sonazoid has the advantages of long-time development&#xD;
      and good stability, which may improve the accuracy of distinguishing benign and malignant&#xD;
      renal space-occupying lesions, especially small lesions. In addition, the characteristics of&#xD;
      long-time development are also helpful to extract more imaging information to assist the&#xD;
      clinical staging of renal tumors.&#xD;

        diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke history, general condition of the patients and&#xD;
        physical examination results of the patients should be registered for outpatient or&#xD;
        inpatient patients after obtaining the informed consent of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If the patient is undergoing surgical treatment, record the operation mode, results and&#xD;
        complications of the patient. Patients who need comprehensive treatment after operation&#xD;
        should record the treatment measures and the name, usage and dosage of drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Contact information (fixed telephone or mobile phone) of at least two patients and their&#xD;
        families should be obtained for future follow-up.&#xD;
