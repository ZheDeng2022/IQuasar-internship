      Aims: To evaluate changes in levels of ADRB3, ROCK2, and GEF which have key roles in the&#xD;
      adrenergic and cholinergic pathways of contraction-relaxation harmony in voiding physiology,&#xD;
      and to investigate the diagnostic potential of these proteins in OAB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study included 60 idiopathic OAB patients and a healthy control group. All&#xD;
      patients completed a validated OAB-V8 questionnaire. Serum levels of ADRB3, ROCK2, and GEF&#xD;
      were examined by ELISA. ROC curves were generated to evaluate the diagnostic performance of&#xD;
      these protein levels for OAB diagnosis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder (OAB) is defined by The Standardization Subcommittee of the International&#xD;
      Continence Society (ICS) as a symptom syndrome consisting of urgency, with or without urge&#xD;
      incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia, in the absence of proven infection or&#xD;
      other obvious pathology. OAB is a clinical diagnosis and its assessment is very important,&#xD;
      especially for evaluation of treatment effectiveness. OAB is diagnosed by symptoms only, and&#xD;
      symptoms are subjective definitions that vary from person to person. Therefore, various&#xD;
      scoring systems and urodynamic tests are used to make an objective diagnosis and to determine&#xD;
      the severity of symptoms. In recent studies, there are several substances that have been&#xD;
      proposed as biomarkers of OAB, such as especially urinary proteins but studies that have&#xD;
      compared these markers are lacking, also these proteins present low sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity. In the future, physicians may consider the use of biomarkers to identify&#xD;
      distinct OAB phenotypes, with distinct causal mechanisms, selecting patients for specific&#xD;
      target therapies with expected better outcomes. Biomarkers can be useful to phenotype&#xD;
      patients and for selecting more effective target therapies. So, there is a need for stable&#xD;
      and non-invasive biomarkers that can be used reliably for assessment of OAB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though the exact cause or causes of OAB have not yet been identified, the most powerful&#xD;
      theory accepted in pathogenesis is detrusor muscle hyperactivity by relaxation decrease or&#xD;
      contractions increase in detrusor smooth muscle. The molecular mechanisms underlying the OAB&#xD;
      clinic are still not fully understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bladder contractions are primarily controlled by parasympathetic cholinergic pathways.&#xD;
      Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) and Rho-related kinase (ROCK) are important in this&#xD;
      way. ROCKs are also important regulators of cellular apoptosis, growth, metabolism, and&#xD;
      migration through control of the cell contraction. GEFs activate small GTPases and they are&#xD;
      regulatory factors that facilitate the separation of GDP from Rho and the binding of GTP. GEF&#xD;
      protein regulates Rho activity. Overexpression of GEF leads to an increase in GTP-dependent&#xD;
      Rho. GTP-dependent Rho enables ROCK2 activation. ROCK2 especially has an important role in&#xD;
      regulating smooth muscle contraction. So, functional disorder or alteration in levels of GEF&#xD;
      and ROCK2 can cause an excessive contraction in smooth muscle and may be effective in the&#xD;
      basis of pathophysiology in OAB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relaxation of the bladder smooth muscle is controlled by a sympathetic cholinergic&#xD;
      pathway in which adrenergic receptor β3 (ADRB3) plays a major role. They have an important&#xD;
      role in regulating smooth muscle tone, especially in the bladder, and show their effect in&#xD;
      many tissues, such as adipose tissue, through relaxation or thermogenesis. The hypofunction&#xD;
      of this receptor causes disruption of the bladder detrusor muscle and dysfunction of the&#xD;
      urinary tract. So a decrease in ADRB3 levels may be responsible for reduced relaxation in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of overactive bladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to understand whether ADRB3, ROCK2, and GEF levels could be&#xD;
      auxiliary parameters for the evaluation of the molecular mechanisms of OAB and to diagnose.&#xD;
      If changes in levels of these parameters affect the amounts and functions of proteins in&#xD;
      these pathways, the pathogenesis of OAB can be better understood and new treatment goals can&#xD;
      be recommended.&#xD;
