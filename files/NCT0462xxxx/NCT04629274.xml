  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a fundamental, prospective, multi-centres, interventional non-comparative study&#xD;
      without the administration of a study product to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phase 0 study is particularly well adapted to early exploration of potential targeted&#xD;
      treatments - i.e. treatments whose efficacy can only be hoped for in patients presenting&#xD;
      specific biological characteristics in addition to being diagnosed with the targeted disease,&#xD;
      Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders (NMOSD) in this study. The main goal of the study&#xD;
      will be to support the selection of Imotopes® (i.e. synthetic peptides encompassing HLA Class&#xD;
      II T epitopes flanked by a thioreductase motif), and (i) capable of binding with class II HLA&#xD;
      antigens of each patient and (ii) causing ex vivo the appearance of epitope -specific&#xD;
      cytolytic CD4+ T cells.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a fundamental, prospective, multi-centres, interventional non-comparative study&#xD;
      without the administration of a study product to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to test in vitro the binding of different Imotopes® to class II HLA antigens&#xD;
      on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) isolated from patients presenting a diagnosed and&#xD;
      stabilized neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, as well as their ability to generate a&#xD;
      cytolytic response directed against the immune cells involved in the maintenance and&#xD;
      triggering of the disease (i.e. non-cytolytic T cells recognising the same epitopes and&#xD;
      antigen presenting cells (APC) presenting the same epitopes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be asked to provide at least 2 peripheral blood samples of approximately&#xD;
      100 milliliters each time, with a minimum of 14 days interval between these 2 samples. These&#xD;
      blood samples will be taken by a member of the healthcare staff qualified to perform this&#xD;
      type of procedure. If the results obtained with the 2 initial samples would be of interest to&#xD;
      the Sponsor, the patient will be asked to come back for additional samplings with a maximum&#xD;
      of 6 additional blood draws. The total volume of blood that will be taken over a 6 months&#xD;
      period cannot exceed 500 milliliters with a maximum of 200 milliliters over a 30-day period&#xD;
      for patients with a weight of min 50kg. The study has no other constraint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The list of analysis planned to be performed on blood samples are presented below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identification of the class II HLA antigens of each patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study of the binding to HLA antigens of synthetic peptides&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identification of peptides which, after binding to the HLA antigens, might induce a&#xD;
           cytolytic response directed against the immune cells involved in the maintenance and&#xD;
           triggering of the disease (i.e. non-cytolytic T cells recognising the same epitopes and&#xD;
           APC presenting the same epitopes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non selective genomic analysis (SNPs) in the scope of the single cell transcriptomic&#xD;
           analysis technics&#xD;
