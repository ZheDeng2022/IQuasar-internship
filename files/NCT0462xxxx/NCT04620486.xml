  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to compare the timeliness of anchor antibiotic administration in the&#xD;
      emergency department (ED) after initial dosing with and without a Best Practice Alert in Epic&#xD;
      (BPA) implemented to remind physicians to re-order the antibiotic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that post-BPA implementation, physicians will have a higher rate of ordering&#xD;
      subsequent doses of antibiotics on-time and with the correct dosages compared to pre-BPA&#xD;
      implementation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antibiotics administration can sometimes be delayed in the emergency department (ED)&#xD;
      environment, where antibiotics are frequently ordered in electronic medical record systems as&#xD;
      a one-time dose and the second dose is delayed or missed. This has been described in the&#xD;
      literature, a 2017 article in Critical Care Medicine noted in a single academic center that&#xD;
      33% of sepsis cases had 2nd-dose-antibiotic delays greater than 25% of the recommend interval&#xD;
      and this was associated with significantly increased hospital mortality (OR 1.61) and&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation (OR 2.44).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An Epic Best Practice Advisory (BPA) was created by the Mass General Brigham eCare Decision&#xD;
      Support team to address this patient safety concern. The BPA alerts providers in the ED or ED&#xD;
      Observation when the next dose of broad-spectrum antibiotic dose is due for a patient if no&#xD;
      future administration has been ordered, based on patient characteristics (such as renal&#xD;
      function) and antibiotic selection. The objective of this study is to analyze the impact of&#xD;
      this BPA on our performance in terms of on-time antibiotics through a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial. Patients whose medical record number (MRN) are odd will be assigned to the treatment&#xD;
      group, while those whose MRNs are even will be assigned to the control group. The BPA will&#xD;
      only be displayed to the patient's providers for the treatment group. We will then compare&#xD;
      the performance of on-time antibiotics between the groups and the resulting impact on patient&#xD;
      outcomes, such as overall hospital length of stay, admission to the intensive care unit&#xD;
      (ICU), and in-hospital mortality.&#xD;
