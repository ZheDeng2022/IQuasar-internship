    <textblock>
      The aim of the STHLM3 AS NorDCaP study is to evaluate the Stockholm3 test in an active&#xD;
      surveillance cohort to predict upgrading on rebiopsy. The study follows a paired design,&#xD;
      evaluating our proposed protocol for follow up men on active surveillance with Stockholm3&#xD;
      versus the standard protocol according to national guidelines with PSA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      STHLM3 AS NorDCaP is a cross-sectional multi-center study, evaluating the predictive value of&#xD;
      Stockholm3 test in a prostate cancer cohort on AS for upgrading on rebiopsy. Men from the&#xD;
      study sites, diagnosed with prostate cancer and currently on AS and planned for rebiopsies&#xD;
      will be invited to the study. Eligible individuals have to be alive without any severe&#xD;
      comorbidity and without a history of initiating treatment; surgery, radiation, hormone&#xD;
      therapy or chemotherapy. To avoid the need for additional investigations, sampling will be&#xD;
      synchronized with timing for planned follow-up within the AS program for each individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline blood will be drawn for Stockholm3 analyses. The patient will be asked to fill&#xD;
      out an informed consent. For each man the following data will be collected: Stockholm3 Risk&#xD;
      Score, Stockholm3 Prostate Volume cut-off, total PSA, DRE status, MRI results (PI-RADS,&#xD;
      optional, only if MRI is conducted within 3 months before biopsy), prostate volume, biopsy&#xD;
      results (ISUP, cancer length, number of positive cores, total number of cores and stage).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measurement will be number of upgrading, i.e. number of detected ISUP ≥ 2&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;
