  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to validate exosomal assays that are based on hypoxia detection as&#xD;
      potential biomarkers of early detection. The study analysis will determine whether the assay&#xD;
      can detect clinical lung cancer at the time of imaging and interval cancers during subsequent&#xD;
      follow up. The study aims to establish preliminary sensitivity/specificity data for the&#xD;
      &quot;combined CT/exosomal risk stratification marker&quot; and provide initial data on the potential&#xD;
      association of the &quot;combined CT/exosomal risk score&quot; with the subsequent cancer progression&#xD;
      and treatment response.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths. Screening for early detection of cancer at&#xD;
      an early stage reduces cancer deaths and therefore improves prognosis. The National Lung&#xD;
      Screening Trial (NLST), for instance, showed that CT screening increases the early detection&#xD;
      rate, and reduces mortality. However, drawbacks include over-diagnosis, false-positive&#xD;
      results, psychological distress and cost. Therefore, lung cancer screening is not recommended&#xD;
      or available within the NHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of lung cancer is currently based on a combination of scans and tissue biopsy. The&#xD;
      invasive nature of current diagnostic procedures limits their application. To improve the&#xD;
      efficacy and cost effectiveness of screening in early detection of lung cancer, additional,&#xD;
      complementary and non-invasive methods, such as circulating biomarkers, should be evaluated.&#xD;
      Our novel exosomal assay (taken from a blood sample) when combined with CT, may improve the&#xD;
      current accuracy of lung cancer detection, especially that of a worse clinical prognosis.&#xD;
      Improvement in the accuracy of detection and/or prediction of future disease by performing&#xD;
      the combined imaging exosome test will cause a paradigm shift. Moving towards the&#xD;
      identification of blood tests can help increase confidence about follow-up decisions and&#xD;
      shorten the interval before biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective cohort study will recruit patients referred to secondary care for the&#xD;
      investigation of clinical symptoms or signs suspicious of lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will run between 2020 and 2024 (two-year active recruitment and two-year follow&#xD;
      up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a single assay of blood taken on one occasion in the lung clinic by&#xD;
      trained staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have normal standard of care chest CT scans and this data will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be actively followed for 3 months and then those with nodules, revealed&#xD;
      by CT Scan, at 3 monthly intervals. Longitudinal clinical data will be collected on the&#xD;
      investigations, diagnoses and outcomes of all study patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected on date, type and results of imaging and biopsy investigations&#xD;
      including nodule size and progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those diagnosed with lung cancer, data on tumour size, stage, type and other markers)&#xD;
      will be recorded together with treatment response and date of death, where this occurs within&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
