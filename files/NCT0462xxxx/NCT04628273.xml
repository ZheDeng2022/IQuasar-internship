      Treatment strategy of chronic pancreatitis (CP) patients with large pancreatic radiolucent&#xD;
      stone (≥ 5mm) has not been established. We aimed to figure out clinical features and efficacy&#xD;
      of endotherapy for large pancreatic radiolucent stone.&#xD;

      1. Treatment strategy of CP patients with large pancreatic stone：&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. . For patients with large radiolucent stone，ERCP with balloon sphincteroplasty was&#xD;
           performed directly to remove radiolucent stone. If ERCP intubation failed, endoscopic&#xD;
           ultrasound-guided drainage of pancreatic duct, surgery or medication would be applied.&#xD;
           ESWL was performed in the following situations. Frist, MPD strictures was so severe that&#xD;
           dilation catheter can not be inserted during ERCP. Second, there was cystic dilatation&#xD;
           in MPD and pancreatic radiolucent stone located in cystic dilatation could not be&#xD;
           extracted by extraction balloon or basket. In the above cases, the naso-pancreatic&#xD;
           catheterwas inserted during ERCP, and then ESWL would be performed with repeated&#xD;
           injection of contrast medium. After ESWL, repeated washing and negative pressure&#xD;
           drainage were performed, and at last contrast medium was injected again to make sure the&#xD;
           stones were cleared. For patients without MPD strictures, the nasopancreatic catheter&#xD;
           can be directly removed, otherwise the nasopancreatic duct would be cut off into a&#xD;
           stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. . For patients with large radiopaque stone, repeated P-ESWL sessions were performed, and&#xD;
           ERCP was routinely performed 48 hours after the last P-ESWL. If ERCP intubation failed,&#xD;
           medication or surgery would be recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. A prospective cohort study was conducted in CP patients with large radiolucent stone.&#xD;
      Patients with large radiopaque stone were matched as the control group, with a ratio of 1:2&#xD;
      according to admission time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. The primary outcome was pain relief. The secondary outcomes were stone clearance, quality&#xD;
      of life score, and changes in pancreatic exocrine and endocrine function.&#xD;

        CP patients with pancreatic radiolucent stones large than 5mm from March 2011 to December&#xD;
        2018 admitted to Changhai Hospital were included in this study. Patients with pancreatic&#xD;
        radiopaque stones large than 5mm were matched as the control group, with a ratio of 1:2&#xD;
        according to admission time. CP was diagnosed primarily based on the Asia-Pacific&#xD;
        consensus. Pancreatic radiopaque stone was diagnosed by CT scan while radiolucent stone by&#xD;
        MRI or MRCP.&#xD;
