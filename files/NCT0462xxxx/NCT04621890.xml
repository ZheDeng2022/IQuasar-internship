  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is a serious disease that happens because the body cannot control blood&#xD;
      glucose (sugar) levels. People with T1D need insulin shots because their body does not make&#xD;
      insulin. Insulin lowers blood sugar levels. When blood sugar levels are too high or too low&#xD;
      it causes medical problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Youth with T1D can really impact their own health if they follow their T1D treatment plan.&#xD;
      However, even with the help of doctors, nurses, and family, most adolescents find it hard to&#xD;
      follow their diabetes plan close enough to meet their A1C goal. It is very common for&#xD;
      adolescents to forget to give an insulin bolus for meals. When insulin doses are missed,&#xD;
      there is a greater chance for poor blood sugar control. When adolescents follow their&#xD;
      diabetes plan closely, they have better blood sugar control and overall health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two behavioral economic interventions will be evaluated. COIN2DOSE (Cash-Only INcentive to&#xD;
      promote mealtime insulin DOSE Engagement) and LOAN2DOSE (Behavioral Economic concept that&#xD;
      uses an economic loss aversion approach to promote insulin dose engagement in adolescents&#xD;
      with Type 1 Diabetes). These programs were designed to improve blood sugar control by&#xD;
      decreasing the number of missed mealtime boluses. For COIN2DOSE, we will offer the&#xD;
      opportunity for youth to earn a bonus reimbursement during which they achieve at least 5 days&#xD;
      of 3 mealtime insulin boluses. Finally, we will pay youth up for sharing their insulin use&#xD;
      data at least two times per week with the study team during the three-month treatment phase.&#xD;
      For LOAN2DOSE, the participants will start with a monetary &quot;balance&quot; and will keep it if they&#xD;
      bolus as instructed - at least 5 days of 3 mealtime insulin boluses. If they do not do this,&#xD;
      their balance will decrease throughout the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal is to develop effective ways to improve glycemic control in youth with&#xD;
      T1D. To that end, we propose to specifically evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility, and&#xD;
      usability of two new behavioral economic interventions in diabetes care: an automated meal&#xD;
      detection and patient engagement device to promote meal-time insulin dosing behavior&#xD;
      (AIM2DOSE) and an economic incentive (COIN2DOSE) to promote patient engagement with mealtime&#xD;
      insulin dosing behavior. If initially efficacious, our results will serve as the basis for an&#xD;
      R01 submission(s) to conduct a fully powered efficacy trial of LOAN2DOSE and COIN2DOSE. This&#xD;
      study is significant as omission of mealtime boluses is one of the common reasons for&#xD;
      suboptimal diabetes control in youth. This project is highly innovative because it will: 1)&#xD;
      target youth who are predicted by artificial intelligence to experience a worsening in&#xD;
      glycemic control, 2) use a just-in-time intervention to improve mealtime insulin dosing&#xD;
      behavior, and 3) use an economic incentive intervention to improve mealtime insulin dosing&#xD;
      behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design The study is an unblinded, 3-arm, randomized, controlled trial. After successful&#xD;
      screening and consent, individuals will wear a blinded Dexcom G6 Pro CGM inserted 1 week&#xD;
      after consent. . At the baseline visit (visit 1; day 1), participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      the LOAN2DOSE, COIN2DOSE, or control treatment arms and will be trained on the procedures&#xD;
      appropriate to their treatment arm. Participants will also complete baseline measures by&#xD;
      questionnaire. Participants will complete procedures specific to their treatment arm weekly.&#xD;
      Visit 2 will occur after 12 weeks (90 days). Participants will stop any treatment&#xD;
      interventions after this visit. A1C and questionnaire measures will be completed, and&#xD;
      participants will again wear the Dexcom G6 Pro CGM for 10 days (the device will be returned&#xD;
      by mail post-visit). Participants will receive no treatment intervention from week 13 to week&#xD;
      24. Participants will return for visit 3 at week 24. Again, A1C and questionnaire measures&#xD;
      will be completed and participants will wear the Dexcom G6 Pro CGM for 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants will also have the option to participate in a focus group discussion&#xD;
      (FGD) on general AI ethical issues (control group) or intervention experiences (intervention&#xD;
      group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents of children who meet inclusion criteria may also elect to participate in a focus&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits Study visits may occur in-person or remotely (i.e., from home). Procedures will&#xD;
      be adapted to accommodate both scenarios.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals who have been predicted via an artificial intelligence-intelligence based model&#xD;
      to experience a rise in A1C in the near future (90 days) will be approached for recruitment.&#xD;
      36 participants will be recruited from the Children's Mercy Diabetes Center (any clinic or&#xD;
      hospital location). Based on preliminary data review of our clinic population, there were at&#xD;
      least 81 individuals who met inclusion criteria who were seen in clinic in the month of May&#xD;
      2019 alone. Patients will be randomized to LOAN2DOSE, COIN2DOSE, or control group using a&#xD;
      1:1:1 randomization scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify an at-risk population for more intensive intervention opportunities, the&#xD;
      Children's Mercy Diabetes Center now routinely uses a validated prediction model based on&#xD;
      advanced machine learning (random forest method) and natural language processing to identify&#xD;
      individuals who are predicted experience a rise in A1C in the next 90 days. The model&#xD;
      analyzes all patients who presented for a diabetes visit in the prior week. To accomplish&#xD;
      this task, the complete health record for the CMH Diabetes Center registry is analyzed. We&#xD;
      will select patients from this cohort for recruitment into the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COIN2DOSE intervention: From one-week post-randomization to the 12-week study visit, youth&#xD;
      randomized to this treatment arm will receive personalized feedback via monetary incentives&#xD;
      for dosing insulin at mealtimes. We will define mealtimes based on hour of the day and the&#xD;
      presence of a carbohydrate entry associated with the insulin bolus. Breakfast will be&#xD;
      0600-1000, lunch will be 1100-1500, and dinner will be 1600-2000. Thus, we will reimburse&#xD;
      youth per mealtime with at least one meal-associated (carbohydrate-associated) insulin bolus&#xD;
      completed. We will offer the opportunity for youth to earn a bonus reimbursement for weeks&#xD;
      during which they achieve at least 5 days of 3 mealtime insulin boluses. Finally, we will pay&#xD;
      youth per week for sharing their insulin use data at least two times per week with the study&#xD;
      team during the three-month treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LOAN2DOSE intervention: From one-week post-randomization to the 12-week study visit, youth&#xD;
      randomized to this treatment arm will receive personalized feedback via monetary deductions&#xD;
      from a virtual bank of $210 for missed doses of insulin at mealtimes. We will define&#xD;
      mealtimes based on hour of the day and the presence of a carbohydrate entry associated with&#xD;
      the insulin bolus. According to the methodology for calculating BOLUS(1) breakfast will be&#xD;
      0600-1000, lunch will be 1100-1500, and dinner will be 1600-2000. Thus, we will deduct $0.50&#xD;
      per mealtime with at least one meal-associated (carbohydrate-associated) insulin bolus missed&#xD;
      (maximum -$1.50/day). Youth can also lose an additional amount of up to $5.00/week for weeks&#xD;
      during which they don't achieve at least 5 days of 3 mealtime insulin boluses. Finally, we&#xD;
      will deduct the virtual account up to $2.00 per week for failing to share their insulin use&#xD;
      data at least two times per week with the study team during the three-month treatment phase&#xD;
      (maximum deduction of $24.00). Therefore, maximum total deductions is $210.&#xD;
