      BACKGROUND Atrial fibrillation（AF）prevalence increases sharply with age, and the risk of&#xD;
      stroke, dementia, heart failure and death increases significantly. Epidemiological data show&#xD;
      that the risk of atrial fibrillation-associated ischemic stroke in Asian population is higher&#xD;
      than that in western population, but the use of oral anticoagulant is significantly lower&#xD;
      than that in western population. However, elderly patients with atrial fibrillation often&#xD;
      have a high risk of stroke and cerebral hemorrhage at the same time. How to balance the&#xD;
      anticoagulant effect and bleeding risk is a challenge for rural doctors in rural China.&#xD;
      Integrated care for atrial fibrillation patients using simple ABC pathway ('A' Avoid stroke;&#xD;
      'B' Better symptom management; 'C' Cardiovascular and Comorbidity optimization) is associated&#xD;
      with a lower risk of adverse outcomes included all-cause death, composite outcome of&#xD;
      stroke/major bleeding/cardiovascular death, and first hospitalization. However, the role of&#xD;
      people-centered integrated care for AF patients in rural China has remained unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM OF THIS STUDY This cluster randomization study aims to compare the people-centered&#xD;
      integrated care versus usual care to improve outcome of older patients with atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation in rural China. The primary endpoint is the composite of cardiovascular death&#xD;
      and all stroke. The secondary endpoints are All-cause mortality, cardiovascular death,&#xD;
      cardiovascular hospitalization, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, major bleeding, clinically&#xD;
      relevant nonmajor bleeding, quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN The MIRACLE-AF China trial is a multicenter, perspective, cluster randomization&#xD;
      clinical trial performed in rural China. We aim to include a minimum of 1000 patients with AF&#xD;
      aged 65 years or above from around more than 30 village clinics. Follow-up duration of this&#xD;
      study is up to 3 years and all patients are followed up every 3 months by rural doctors.&#xD;
      Village clinics will be randomized to either the intervention group (people-centered&#xD;
      integrated care) or the control group (usual care).&#xD;
