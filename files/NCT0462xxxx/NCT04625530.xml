  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine the effect of perioperative treatment with intravenous iron and&#xD;
      tranexamic acid on the reduction of intraoperative and postoperative RBC transfusions in&#xD;
      gynaecological carcinoma patients undergoing abdominal surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radical abdominal surgery often leads to intraoperative bleeding frequently exceeding 1000 ml&#xD;
      and approximately 50% of women undergoing this surgery require blood transfusion.&#xD;
      Perioperative blood transfusions have been shown to increase of length of stay, surgical&#xD;
      complications, postoperative morbidity and mortality. There are a few data on the reduction&#xD;
      in red blood cell count (RBC) transfusions using perioperative management with intravenous&#xD;
      iron and tranexamic acid in women with gynaecological carcinoma surgery. This study is to&#xD;
      determine the effect of perioperative treatment with intravenous iron and tranexamic acid on&#xD;
      the reduction of intraoperative and postoperative RBC transfusions in gynaecological&#xD;
      carcinoma patients undergoing abdominal surgery.&#xD;
