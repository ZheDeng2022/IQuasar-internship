  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In humans and animals, circadian rhythm sleep cycle plays an important role on maintaining&#xD;
      and regulating basic physiological homeostasis, such as cognitive function, glucose&#xD;
      metabolism, memory consolidation, immune function and growth hormone secretion. The induction&#xD;
      of general anesthesia leads to a state of reduced responsiveness, which is often described by&#xD;
      anesthesiologists and patients as &quot;sleep&quot;. This seems to be a common problem in the case of&#xD;
      patients under general anesthesia, besides surgery trauma and general anesthetics may change&#xD;
      sleep function and sleep cycle perioperatively, the postoperative complications such as pain,&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting etc after general anesthesia may also reduce postoperative sleep&#xD;
      quality.Flurbiprofen axetil is a new non-steroidal anti infection analgesic(NSAIDs), which is&#xD;
      widely used for analgesia to reduce the dose of opioids and the occurrence of adverse&#xD;
      reactions, such as declined sleep quality, respiratory depression, nausea and vomiting .&#xD;
      Preemptive analgesia is an analgesic intervention that begins before surgery to prevent the&#xD;
      nervous system from becoming sensitive to subsequent stimuli that may aggravate pain. A large&#xD;
      number of experimental studies have shown that use flurbiprofen axetil preoperatively is&#xD;
      better than use it postoperatively. However, limited information was reported before on the&#xD;
      effect of factors such as age, gender, preoperative negative mood such as anxiety and&#xD;
      depression, type and length of surgery, which could influence postoperative pain and&#xD;
      analgesic consumption and the association between postoperative sleep quality and&#xD;
      postoperative pain intensity. At present, there has been less previous evidence for how&#xD;
      preemptive analgesic with flurbiprofen axetil affect postoperative sleep quality through its&#xD;
      effect on postoperative pain of patients with different sex under general anesthesia.&#xD;
