  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Morbid or severe obesity is a chronic pathology of multifactorial etiology that affects 4.3%&#xD;
      of the French population. In these patients, eating disorders are frequent and must be&#xD;
      managed as they are considered risk factors with poorer weight prognosis and lower quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some authors have proposed that the concept of food addiction (i.e., the existence of an&#xD;
      addiction to certain foods rich in sugar, fat and/or salt) may make it possible to identify,&#xD;
      among obese patients, a subgroup of patients that is more homogeneous in terms of diagnosis&#xD;
      and prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food addiction is common in obese patients and is associated with higher levels of&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, impulsivity, emotional eating and poorer quality of life. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      we do not know the impact of managing this addiction on the future of these patients (food&#xD;
      addiction, weight, comorbidities, quality of life). Telephone-based cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      therapy intervention (Tele-CBT) is a treatment of choice for addictions, but there are&#xD;
      inequalities in access to this treatment (distance between home and hospital, limited local&#xD;
      resources of caregivers, constraints in patient availability) which require the therapeutic&#xD;
      framework to be adapted to these constraints. A short Tele-CBT program has demonstrated its&#xD;
      effectiveness in reducing bulimic hyperphagia in these patients (Cassin et al. 2016), but its&#xD;
      effectiveness on food addiction, Body Mass Index and the evolution of metabolic complications&#xD;
      related to obesity is still unknown. The evaluation of this program was limited to 6 weeks&#xD;
      (American study), and we do not know if these results can also be extrapolated to France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis of this study is that in patients suffering from severe or morbid obesity&#xD;
      and with food addiction, the performance of tele-CBT (intervention group: 12 sessions for 18&#xD;
      weeks) will be accompanied by a significant medium-term decrease in the prevalence of food&#xD;
      addiction compared to usual management (control group).&#xD;
