  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study collects information about the safety and effect of portal vein stenting in&#xD;
      gastrointestinal cancer patients with portal vein stenosis. This study may help researchers&#xD;
      learn how long the portal vein stays open and free from blockage and the effects of portal&#xD;
      vein stenting on patients' overall well-being.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of portal vein stenting in patients with portal vein&#xD;
      (PV) stenosis and gastrointestinal malignancies, including quality of life measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Stent patency and duration of clinical success related to the intervention. II. Compare&#xD;
      the efficacy of portal vein stenting on liver volumes, nutritional status, and laboratory&#xD;
      values relative to patients with portal vein stenosis/thrombosis who do not undergo portal&#xD;
      vein stenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT A: Patients complete a quality of life (QoL) questionnaire at 2-4 weeks and then 6-8&#xD;
      weeks after portal vein stenting procedure. Patients' medical records are also reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT B: Patients' medical records are reviewed retrospectively.&#xD;
