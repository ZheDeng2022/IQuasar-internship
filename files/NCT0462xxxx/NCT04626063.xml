  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute non-specific low back pain (LBP) is one of the most common complaints at the emergency&#xD;
      department. It is more prevalent in countries with high-income economies, where 60-80% of the&#xD;
      population report back pain at some point in their life. Numerous medication options are&#xD;
      available for acute LBP relief such as non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),&#xD;
      myorelaxant drugs, opioids, and benzodiazepines. Magnesium is a physiological&#xD;
      voltage-dependent blocker of N-methyl-D-aspartate NMDA)-coupled channels that can influence&#xD;
      inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain through several different mechanisms. In this study&#xD;
      the investigators aimed to investigate the effect of magnesium oral supplementation for acute&#xD;
      low back pain.&#xD;

      This study was conducted at our emergency department between June 2018 and March 2020 after&#xD;
      receiving approval from our institutions' ethics committee (2018/1330). This study was&#xD;
      registered as a randomized controlled trial with the US National Institute of Health&#xD;
      (clinical trials.gov). We conducted a three-arm, prospective randomized open label clinical&#xD;
      trial to compare isolated NSAID group, NSAID with paracetamol group and NSAID with oral&#xD;
      magnesium supplementation group (described below) for treatment of acute LBP. Patients were&#xD;
      included after providing informed consent predicated on their understanding of expected&#xD;
      complications and treatment outcomes. Consolidate Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)&#xD;
      guidelines were followed reporting the results of the study Patients from a single university&#xD;
      hospital were recruited for this study between June 2018 and March 2020. Inclusion criteria&#xD;
      were defined as (1) age&gt;18 years old, (2) duration of symptoms &lt;2 weeks and (3) functionally&#xD;
      impairing LBP which we defined as a score of &gt; 5 on Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire&#xD;
      (RMDQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria included (1) age&gt;65 years old, (2) history of trauma, (3) presence of&#xD;
      radicular pain physical examination which was defined as pain radiating below the gluteal&#xD;
      folds, (4) history of primary vertebral tumor or metastasis, (4) patients who were pregnant&#xD;
      or lactating, (5) presence of any contraindication or allergy to investigational medications,&#xD;
      (6) history of chronic analgesic use, (7) history of autoimmune diseases or inflammatory&#xD;
      rheumatic disorders, (8) history of cardiopulmonary restrictions, severe kidney or liver&#xD;
      function disorders and (9) history of prior surgery of lumbar spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We based our sample size calculation assumptions on a recently published clinical trial [11]&#xD;
      and widely accepted minimum clinically important improvement of 5 points on the RMDQ.(14)&#xD;
      With alpha and beta values were set at 0.05 and 0.20 respectively, sample size calculation&#xD;
      revealed that 50 patients were needed in each study group. To account for protocol&#xD;
      violations, lost-to-follow-up and to ensure sufficient power for the intention to treat&#xD;
      analysis (in previous work, up to 1/3 of enrolled patients did not use the investigational&#xD;
      medication), we enrolled 80 patients for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A computer generated random list was established with an online sequencer&#xD;
      (www.random.org/sequences) according to which participants were randomly assigned to one of&#xD;
      three study groups with 1:1:1 allocation ratio. Group A included isolated NSAID treatment and&#xD;
      received 400 mg etodolac twice a day. Group B included NSAID and magnesium treatment and&#xD;
      received a combination of 400 mg etodolac twice a day with 365 mg oral magnesium&#xD;
      supplementation once a day. Group C included NSAID and paracetamol treatment and combination&#xD;
      of 400 mg etodolac twice a day with 500 mg paracetamol twice a day was administered to the&#xD;
      participants of this group (Figure-1). We effort to prevent the placebo effect by comparing&#xD;
      the NSAID + magnesium therapy with both a NSAID plus paracetamol therapy and an isolated&#xD;
      NSAID therapy. Treatment was performed by two authors (S.B and K.Åž) and patients were&#xD;
      followed-up by same authors throughout the study. External medication was not allowed with&#xD;
      the exception of topical analgesics. Patients who received any intravenous or intramuscular&#xD;
      analgesia during the treatment period were excluded from study. Co-medications for any&#xD;
      accompanying chronic condition (diabetes, hypertension etc.) were unchanged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluation of participants was performed at first admission to emergency department,&#xD;
      at 4th and 10th days after the initiation of designated treatment. Outcome measures included&#xD;
      pain, mobility of lumbar spine and functional outcome. Pain intensity was assessed using a&#xD;
      visual analogue scale (VAS). Lumbar spine mobility was assessed using the &quot;finger to floor&quot;&#xD;
      test. Participants were asked to stand on erect posture with knees extended and then to bend&#xD;
      forward in an attempt to reach for the floor with their fingertips without losing knee&#xD;
      extension. Distance between patient's fingertips and the floor was then measured with a&#xD;
      measuring tape. Functional outcome was evaluated with Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire&#xD;
      (RMDQ) score. RMDQ is a 24-item LBP functional scale and is recommended for research&#xD;
      purposes. Higher scores signify greater low back-related functional impairment. An&#xD;
      improvement of 5 points was considered clinically significant.&#xD;
