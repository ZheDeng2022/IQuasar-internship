      The main objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the&#xD;
      medical product ForgTin with regard to the impairment and change in the sensation of tinnitus&#xD;
      (volume, frequency, psychological stress).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be randomized into two groups whereas both groups will experience the therapy during the course of the clinical investigation.&#xD;
Group 1 receives the intervention for a duration of three months. This Phase I is followed by a Washout period of one month and by a non-interventional phase (Phase II).&#xD;
Group 2 receives no initial treatment for a duration of three months (Phase I). This Phase I is followed by a Washout period of one month and by an interventional phase (Phase II). Phase III is introduced for both groups for ethical and motivational purposes and to observe potential long-term effects within Group 2.</intervention_model_description>

    <intervention_name>ForgTin©</intervention_name>
    <description>The device is clamped behind the ear via two connected temple parts that pressed together around the connecting axis until an individual perfect wearing comfort is achieved. The pressure is adjusted so that the wearing of ForgTin© is barely noticed at all and may be changed at any time.&#xD;
The aim is a slight pressure stimulation of clearly defined points behind the ear - thus wearing ForgTin© leads to a minimization of individual tinnitus noises.</description>

             a duration of &gt; 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tinnitus of Grade II, III or IV according to Mini-Tinnitus-Questionnaire (Mini-TF12):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Grade II (score of 8-12): moderately distressed&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Grade III (score of 13-18): severely distressed&#xD;

          -  If a drug therapy with psychoactive substances (e.g. antidepressants, anticonvulsants)&#xD;
             exists at the beginning of the therapeutic intervention, it must have been stable for&#xD;
             at least 30 days. The therapy should remain constant during the duration of the study,&#xD;
             but a necessary change is not an exclusion criterion. Any change in medication is&#xD;
             documented in the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Objective tinnitus&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other tinnitus-related treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ménière's Disease&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Acute infections (acute otitis media, otitis externa, acute sinusitis)&#xD;

             neuro-vascular conflicts) detected by clinical assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious, concomitant disorder, including major depression, anxiety&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, might prevent safe&#xD;
             participation in the study or interfere with study objectives&#xD;
