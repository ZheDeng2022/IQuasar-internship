      The primary aims of the HOME Study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Design and implement a natural history study for metachromatic leukodystrophy to serve&#xD;
           as a source of external control data, to augment or replace concurrent controls in&#xD;
           clinical trials;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pilot test and develop guidance on how to design, conduct, and analyze the data from a&#xD;
           natural history study to support adaptive trial designs for regulatory use;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduce burden of participation in trials and provide a potential solution to patient&#xD;
           recruitment challenges, particularly for RCT's; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Design approaches that support remote participation in studies.&#xD;

      The HOME Study is a web-based natural history study for patients with metachromatic&#xD;
      leukodystrophy. It is hosted by the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD); an&#xD;
      independent non-profit patient advocacy organization dedicated to individuals with rare&#xD;
      diseases and the organizations who serve them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study collects information from participants (or their authorized respondents, heretofore&#xD;
      referred to collectively as &quot;participants&quot;) who are affected by metachromatic leukodystrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data are collected at pre-baseline, baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months through online surveys,&#xD;
      telephone Interviews, web-based virtual assessments with a clinical study coordinator, and a&#xD;
      (optional - only for U.S. residents) mobile application. Data entered into this study&#xD;
      includes name, date of birth, diagnosis, treatments, medical history, family history, quality&#xD;
      of life, disease progression, treatment - past and proposed, general medical information,&#xD;
      genetic test results and mutations, blood level results, upload of medical records.&#xD;

        The study is open to English speaking individuals of all ages who have a diagnosis&#xD;
        consistent with metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD). MLD is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mutations in the ASA and PSAP genes identified by genetic testing;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A diagnosis of MLD by MRI of the brain; or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sulfatase enzyme activity and urinary sulfatide excretion identified by biochemical&#xD;
             testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        This diagnosis will be confirmed by participant upload of confirmatory test (genetic,&#xD;
        blood, urine).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants providing data must be at least 18 years of age, or legally authorized to&#xD;
        provide information on behalf of a minor or someone who is unable to provide information&#xD;
        themselves. Consent from a legally authorized representative is required for participants&#xD;
        who are minors or who are over the age of 18 but unable to provide informed consent.&#xD;
        Consent of one parent or legally authorized representative is considered sufficient for&#xD;
        participation of a minor in this study and assent will not be collected.&#xD;
