  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supracondylar femur fractures in the geriatric population present a unique challenge to the&#xD;
      orthopaedic surgeon both in terms of fixation, healing, and final extremity axial alignment.&#xD;
      Pulsed dosing of parathyroid hormone derivatives (Forteo) has been shown to increase bone&#xD;
      mass, and several studies in Europe have demonstrated its benefit as an adjuvant for fracture&#xD;
      healing. Abaloparatide represents a new compound which similarly offers great potential for&#xD;
      accelerating fracture healing, especially healing associated with callous formation. This is&#xD;
      a randomized, double blind placebo-controlled trial to compare a group of patients being&#xD;
      treated for supracondylar distal femur fractures who receive abaloparatide (n=38) with a&#xD;
      control group of patients who receive a placebo (n=38).&#xD;

      Supracondylar femur fractures in the geriatric population present a unique challenge to the&#xD;
      orthopaedic surgeon both in terms of fixation, healing, and final extremity axial alignment.&#xD;
      Multiple methods of fixation are well accepted, and each has its own advantages and&#xD;
      disadvantages. The common occurrence of periprosthetic supracondylar femur fractures adds&#xD;
      another level of complexity, and the universal goal when treating these patients is to obtain&#xD;
      and maintain acceptable alignment, allow mobilization and early weight bearing, and achieve&#xD;
      union. To a degree, mobilization and weight bearing compete with maintenance of axial&#xD;
      alignment, and any final outcome is a race between healing and loss of fixation. As a result,&#xD;
      any intervention that can accelerate healing would be of great benefit. As the vast majority&#xD;
      of these injuries heal with secondary bone healing (callous), the determination of &quot;healing&quot;&#xD;
      is reliably determined using the modified Radiographic Union Score for Tibia Fractures&#xD;
      (mRUST), and thus this patient population offers an ideal population in which to evaluate an&#xD;
      accelerant of fracture healing.&#xD;
