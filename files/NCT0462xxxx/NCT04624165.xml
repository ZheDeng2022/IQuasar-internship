      Research question: do patients in a gynecologic oncology practice value the use of&#xD;
      telemedicine as an adjunct to in-person visits and in what circumstances might patients not&#xD;
      find these visits to be sufficient?&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the United States, 14.8 million women live greater than 50 miles away from the closest&#xD;
      gynecology oncologist underscoring the need for increased implementation of telemedicine. In&#xD;
      consideration of the COVID-19 outbreak, recommendations were made to organize goals of&#xD;
      therapy by prioritizing curative intent and utilizing telemedicine to manage current&#xD;
      therapies. Research regarding telemedicine, its benefits, and patient perspectives in other&#xD;
      specialties has been reported, however there appears to be a dearth of information in the&#xD;
      field of gynecologic oncology. Our study aims to seek patients' perspective of telemedicine&#xD;
      and whether implementation for extended office visits, teleconsultations and more are&#xD;
      feasible and valuable to them.&#xD;
