  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of diabetic foot ulcer recurrence in one year can reach 35%. Plantar foot&#xD;
      diabetic foot ulcer is the most frequently diabetic foot ulcer recurrence. The recurrence&#xD;
      incidence can occur at least 14 days after the diabetic foot ulcer has healed. Physical&#xD;
      activity and exercise are highly recommended for the prevention of diabetic foot ulcers. The&#xD;
      study about the form of foot exercise to prevent a diabetic foot ulcer recurrence is still&#xD;
      unclear. The major hypothesis was there is an effect of self-structured foot exercise on the&#xD;
      plantar foot diabetic ulcer recurrences. The minor hypothesis was (1) The improvement of&#xD;
      HbA1c, ABI, diabetic neuropathy examination score, callus, and walking speed can decrease the&#xD;
      incidence of plantar foot diabetic ulcer (2) a self-structured foot exercise can decrease the&#xD;
      incidence and the speed of incidence plantar doot diabetic ulcer recurrence. Participants&#xD;
      were randomized into two groups: Exercise group (n=25) and control group (n=25). The exercise&#xD;
      is the combination of flexibility and resistance exercise using a flexible band in 24 weeks.&#xD;
      The incidence of plantar diabetic foot ulcers was monitored through the research process.&#xD;

      1. Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
           Diabetic foot ulcers are a form of diabetes mellitus (DM) patients' foot problems,&#xD;
           characterized by chronic wounds below the ankle, which can penetrate the skin to the&#xD;
           dermis. Meta-analysis results in 2016 showed a global prevalence of diabetic foot ulcers&#xD;
           of 6.3%. The incidence in Indonesia reaches 7.3 - 24%.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Diabetic foot ulcers can result in amputation and even death in patients. The diabetic&#xD;
           foot ulcer caused 85% of foot amputation cases and 2.48 times higher than for patients&#xD;
           without ulcers in the next five years. Diabetic foot ulcers can provide a high economic&#xD;
           burden for patients, families, and the country due to the healing period of diabetic&#xD;
           foot ulcers and expensive maintenance costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Healed diabetic foot ulcers can undergo recurrence. Approximately 26 -78% of all&#xD;
           diabetic foot ulcer incidents are recurrence events. Prevalence of recurrence globally&#xD;
           within one year, three years, and five years after diabetic foot ulcer healing is 40%,&#xD;
           60 %, and 65%. The prevalence of diabetic foot ulcer recurrence in Semarang, Indonesia&#xD;
           country reaches 35.4 %. It indicates that post-cured diabetic foot ulcer patients have a&#xD;
           very high risk for recurrence of diabetic foot ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The high incidence of diabetic foot ulcer recurrence is closely related to the&#xD;
           biological and behavioral factors of patients who have not been resolved, despite the&#xD;
           healing. The previous studies explained that the risk factors for diabetic foot ulcer&#xD;
           recurrence after recovery include the location of plantar ulcers, HbA1c &gt; 7,5%,&#xD;
           peripheral artery disease, peripheral neuropathy, the absence of callus, duration of&#xD;
           ulcers, duration of DM, and limitations of foot musculoskeletal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The International Working Group on Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) stress the importance of&#xD;
           efforts to prevent the occurrence of diabetic foot ulcers.The act of performing foot&#xD;
           exercises has not been a guideline in preventing diabetic foot ulcer recurrence,&#xD;
           although exercise is highly recommended in all DM patients to prevent diabetic foot&#xD;
           ulcers. The recent studies, limited to DM patients, showed that foot exercises designed&#xD;
           for DM patients could increase joint range of motion, muscle strength, walking speed,&#xD;
           ankle-brachial index (ABI) as well as lower HbA1c levels that are also risk factors for&#xD;
           diabetic leg ulcer recursion. Self-structured foot exercises are a combination of foot&#xD;
           resistance exercises using flexible bands and foot flexibility exercises performed&#xD;
           independently by patients, with frequencies three times a week at home. The study aimed&#xD;
           to prove the effect of self-structured foot exercise on plantar foot diabetic ulcer&#xD;
           recurrence incidence after recovery of at least one month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study used a Randomised control trial (RCT) design. The study had approved by the ethics&#xD;
      committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Diponegoro University. The participants of the study&#xD;
      were patients with healed plantar foot diabetic ulcers who had been treated at two hospitals&#xD;
      in Semarang Indonesia and had been selected consecutively. The study carried out random&#xD;
      allocation using software into a control group and intervention group. The participants were&#xD;
      directly supervised in the first three weeks and after that supervised using a mobile phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The demographics and characteristics related to diabetic foot ulcer history were collected.&#xD;
      The changing of ABI, diabetic neuropathy examination score, HbA1c level, walking speed, and&#xD;
      callus before and after intervention were collected also. The researchers took all of the&#xD;
      data outcomes before the intervention, 12 and 24 weeks after foot exercises. The participants&#xD;
      discontinued the intervention if they had recurrence before 24 weeks, and then data retrieval&#xD;
      was carried out one last time. The time of recurrence incidence was recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of data used a computer with SPSS. The researchers used the Shapiro Wilk&#xD;
      normality test to see the distribution of numerical data. Homogeneity of respondents'&#xD;
      characteristics and the changes difference in DNE, ABI, walking speed, and HbA1c levels were&#xD;
      tested using independent T-tests, Man Whitney, Chi-Square, and Fisher tests. Changing in DNE,&#xD;
      ABI, HbA1c levels, and walking speed were calculated by calculating the difference in the&#xD;
      last data collection results with the preliminary data collection from respondents. The&#xD;
      difference of calluses between two group after the intervention were tested also. Spearman's&#xD;
      test was conducted to look at the effect of ABI improvements, DNE scores, HbA1c levels, and&#xD;
      walking pace on the decrease in plantar foot diabetic ulcer recurrence. Recurrence data for&#xD;
      participants who did not complete the outcome for 24 weeks were filled in according to the&#xD;
      last condition found. Chi-square tests and relative risk (RR) calculations with 2x2 tables,&#xD;
      Confidence Interval (CI) 95%, and significant levels of &lt;5% were conducted to determine the&#xD;
      effect of self-structured foot exercises on plantar foot diabetic ulcer recurrence incidence.&#xD;
      A logistical regression multivariate test was conducted to look at the effect of&#xD;
      self-structured foot exercises, on plantar foot diabetic ulcer recurrence with control on&#xD;
      confounding variables. Cox's multivariate regression test was conducted to look at the effect&#xD;
      of self-structured foot exercises on the timing of plantar foot diabetic ulcer recurrence&#xD;
      events with control on confounding variables.&#xD;
