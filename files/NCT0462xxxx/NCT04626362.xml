  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators pre-preliminary study showed that the urine from a portion of study&#xD;
      participants had anti-adhesion activity. The investigators propose that UTI susceptible women&#xD;
      can be divided into responders and non-responders depending on whether cranberry intake&#xD;
      increase anti-adhesion activity of their urine. The overall objectives are to identify gut&#xD;
      microbes and anti-adhesive urinary biomarkers which significantly contribute to the&#xD;
      anti-adhesion of E. coli.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The American cranberries (Vaccinium macrocarpon) have been consumed for centuries to prevent&#xD;
      urinary tract infections (UTI), which affect 50% of women in their lifetime. However,&#xD;
      NIH-funded clinical trials of cranberries on UTI in the last 20 years yielded conflicting&#xD;
      results but the reasons are unknown. About 90% of UTI are initiated by adhesion of&#xD;
      uropathogenic E. coli on urinary tract epithelia. It was reported that human urine after&#xD;
      cranberry intake inhibited the adhesion of E. coli. A-type procyanidins and xyloglucans are&#xD;
      the presumed bioactives in cranberries; however, none of these compounds are absorbable in&#xD;
      small intestine. They are degraded by microbes in colon.The pre-preliminary study showed that&#xD;
      the urine from a portion of study participants had anti-adhesion activity, suggesting there&#xD;
      are polymorphisms in human's ability to metabolize cranberry bioactives. Based on these&#xD;
      observations, the investigators formulate a novel hypothesis that not all, but a fraction of&#xD;
      women harbor specific gut microbes with the ability to catabolize cranberry bioactives to&#xD;
      anti-adhesion metabolites in the urine; therefore, the variation of gut microbiome is the&#xD;
      underlying mechanism for metabolic polymorphisms and disparity in UTI prevention. The&#xD;
      investigators propose that UTI susceptible women can be divided into responders and&#xD;
      non-responders depending on whether cranberry intake increase anti-adhesion activity of their&#xD;
      urine. The overall objectives are to identify gut microbes and anti-adhesive urinary&#xD;
      biomarkers which significantly contribute to the anti-adhesion of E. coli. The expected&#xD;
      result will be to generate strong preliminary data showing the differences of gut microbiome&#xD;
      between responders and non-responders in additional to correlations between gut microbes and&#xD;
      candidate anti-adhesion biomarkers in the urine of UTI susceptible women.&#xD;

    <description>Compare the statistical difference between the changes from baseline in the an-adhesion activity uropathogenic E. coli in UTI-susceptible women after consuming the cranberry beverage for 3 weeks versus the change after consuming the control beverage for 3 weeks. Anti-adhesion activity in urine will be measured using a fluoresces-based micro-plate method. The anti-adhesion activities of urines will be expressed by its equivalence to myricetin level. The unit for urine anti-adhesion activities is µg myricetin/ mg creatinine.</description>
