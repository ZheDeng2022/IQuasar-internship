    <textblock>
      The current study is the second clinical administration with PF-07304814, the phosphate&#xD;
      prodrug of the active moiety PF-00835231, and the first in healthy adult participants. It is&#xD;
      to evaluate safety, tolerability and PK of single escalating doses of PF 07304814 given as a&#xD;
      24-h IV infusion.&#xD;
