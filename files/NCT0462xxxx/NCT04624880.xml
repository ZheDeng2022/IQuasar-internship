  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypnosis is an effective pain management tool for surgery that can reduce opioid use up to&#xD;
      40%. COMT single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can predict pain sensitivity and opioid use&#xD;
      perioperatively, and may also be associated with hypnotizability or response to hypnotic&#xD;
      analgesia. Analyzing COMT haplotypes from DNA extracted from saliva or blood using a giant&#xD;
      magnetoresistive (GMR) nanotechnology platform may be faster, less expensive, and at least as&#xD;
      accurate as pyrosequencing. This study aims to validate a multi-SNP point-of-care (POC) GMR&#xD;
      assay for the rapid genotyping of SNPs predictive of COMT activity, and test the feasibility&#xD;
      of using COMT activity as a biomarker for hypnotizability and/or response to hypnotic&#xD;
      analgesia.&#xD;

        Participants in this trial are drawn from three prior trials. One trial measured&#xD;
        hypnotizability and collected genetic samples with permission to use for future research,&#xD;
        23 samples will be drawn from this cohort. The second trial measured hypnotizability in&#xD;
        healthy volunteers, 42 participants agreed to be contacted for future studies will be&#xD;
        invited to participate by submitting a saliva sample for DNA analysis. The third trial used&#xD;
        hypnotic analgesia for knee replacement surgery, approximately 32 patients had&#xD;
        hypnotizability tested and will be invited to participate for the primary analysis. Another&#xD;
        approximately 30 patients from the control group of that trial had pain and opioid use&#xD;
        collected postoperatively, and will be invited to provide genetic sample to be used for the&#xD;
        secondary outcome analysis.&#xD;
