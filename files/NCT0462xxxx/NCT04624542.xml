      1. to investigate the relation between NCV of femoral nerve and other dependent variables&#xD;
           such as ( pain &amp; limited hip extension ROM )in patients with PFPS .&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is considered one of the most common condition affecting&#xD;
      young active populations, it accounts for about 40% of individuals complaining from knee&#xD;
      pain.PFPS is the anterior or retro patellar pain that can be precipitated by some daily&#xD;
      activities such as ascending and descending stairs, kneeling, squatting or performing&#xD;
      everyday tasks. Individuals with PFPS can experience a history of cracking or popping sounds&#xD;
      when changing position or climbing stairs and also experience pain during repeated knee&#xD;
      flexion. In a previous study conducted by Jensen et al .(2008),they observed that individuals&#xD;
      with PFPS experienced symptoms that are related to neural compromise like patellar numbness&#xD;
      and reduced ability to differentiate between different thermal stimulus .so PFPS may be&#xD;
      related to neurological impairments or dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Femoral slump test can be used in examining the neurodynamic responses in individuals with&#xD;
      anterior knee pain which has a specificity of more than 75% in testing neural&#xD;
      mechanosensitivity In a study conducted by Lin et al (2014) that examine the hip extension&#xD;
      range of motion (ROM) and mechanical sensitivity of femoral nerve as a neurodynamic response&#xD;
      in individuals with PFPS , they proposed that 30% of them have decrease hip extension ROM and&#xD;
      increased mechanosensitivity comparison with healthy individuals. The current management of&#xD;
      the patellofemoral pain support using open- and closed-chain exercises, strengthening,&#xD;
      stretching, aerobic exercise, patellofemoral and tibiofemoral mobilizations, patellar taping,&#xD;
      highintensity NMES, neuromuscular training, and gait retraining as a multi modal treatment&#xD;
      for PFPS. Despite these methods result in significant improvement, other few patients&#xD;
      reported some residual symptoms Hung et al .,(2015) have encouraged that using the femoral&#xD;
      nerve mobilization as a neurodynamic management for treating PFPS patients especially those&#xD;
      with postive femoral slump test , and testing the hip extension range of motion as a&#xD;
      reference of improvement previous studies reported the presence of neurogenic dysfunction&#xD;
      model to PFPS but most of these scientific researches lack the presence of the gold standard&#xD;
      and objective method for identifying the neurogenic patellofemoral pain&#xD;
