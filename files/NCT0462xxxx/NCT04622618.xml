  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overall incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) after general anesthesia is&#xD;
      40-90 % . gabapentin has been incorporated into &quot;fast-track&quot; packages and improved recovery&#xD;
      during surgery protocols to avoid unintended side effects associated with opioid&#xD;
      alternatives. Interestingly, gabapentin has also been noted to reduce the effects of&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced nausea, effective in treatment of gravidarum hyperemesis, and postdural&#xD;
      puncture emesis. Different dosing regimens were tested.The goal of the study is to determine&#xD;
      the most effective dose of oral gabapentin given 1 hour prior to surgery on the occurrence&#xD;
      and severity of PONV and drug side effects in the first 24 hours postoperatively to find the&#xD;
      most effective dose of gabapentin with the least side effects.&#xD;

      A total of (150) adult patients who will undergo elective abdominal laparoscopic surgery will&#xD;
      be included in the study. Written informed consent will be obtained from all patients before&#xD;
      randomization. Randomization will be done with the help of a computer generated list of&#xD;
      numbers. Patients will be divided randomly and equally into three groups (50 patients each(.&#xD;
      The first group of patients will receive 300 mg gabapentin orally 1 hour before induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia by a sip of water (group G1), the second group of patients will receive 600 mg&#xD;
      gabapentin orally 1 hour before induction of anesthesia by a sip of water (group G2), the&#xD;
      third group of patients will receive 900 mg gabapentin orally 1 hour before induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia by a sip of water (group G3). Drug formulation will be done by one of the&#xD;
      researchers making the dosage of the three groups the same in number and shape of the&#xD;
      capsules and then given to a junior anesthetist who is neither involved nor interested in any&#xD;
      way in the sample to be administered to the patients surveyed&#xD;
