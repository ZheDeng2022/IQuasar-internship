  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraoperative stress among the surgical team can be a threat to patient safety and good&#xD;
      teamwork. During surgery, surgeons often work under stressful conditions. Reducing&#xD;
      intraoperative stress for surgeons could benefit surgeons and subsequently patients. Based on&#xD;
      the hypothesis that an intraoperative pause including a sugar-containing drink would decrease&#xD;
      surgeon's stress levels, the aim of this study is to compare stress levels, in relation to&#xD;
      intraoperative stress and how this is affected by a pause including a sugar-containing drink&#xD;
      in simulated operations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled cross-over trial was conducted in a simulator environment. Primary&#xD;
      endpoint was intra-individual change in salivary cortisol between simulations with or without&#xD;
      a pause including a sugar containing drink. Secondary endpoints were change in heart rate,&#xD;
      change in self-perceived stress measured by the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and&#xD;
      experience of the intraoperative pause.&#xD;

    <description>measured by the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) Each STAI item is given a weighted score of 1 to 4. A rating of 4 indicates the presence of a high level of anxiety for ten S-Anxiety items and eleven T-Anxiety items.
