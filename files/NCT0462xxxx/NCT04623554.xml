  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Neo-Train study is a randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of supervised&#xD;
      pre-operative aerobic and resistance exercise in patients with breast cancer during&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long neoadjuvant chemotherapy period in patients with breast cancer brings a time window&#xD;
      of opportunity to investigate the potential of pre-operative exercise to increase treatment&#xD;
      efficacy with improved tumour regression. A possible improvement in chemotherapy completion,&#xD;
      lift in physical function, alleviated toxicities as well as changes in biological markers can&#xD;
      also be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      120 patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer who start neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be&#xD;
      randomized to the intervention arm (n=60) and control arm (n=60).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the intervention arm will be prescribed a prehabilitation program consisting&#xD;
      of thrice weekly combined supervised aerobic and resistance exercise during the neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy period. Participants will be screened for psychological distress four times and&#xD;
      in case of moderate-severe distress be advised to visit the local Cancer Society Support&#xD;
      Center where participants will be assessed and offered free services based on their&#xD;
      psychosocial needs and available offers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the control arm will receive usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be measured at baseline (diagnosis), during neoadjuvant chemotherapy, during&#xD;
      the week before breast surgery, at breast surgery and at 3 months follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will receive the recommended neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens in Denmark -&#xD;
      currently up to 24 weeks. With expected chemotherapy dose delays, the time of breast surgery&#xD;
      is expected to be within 30 weeks from baseline. The treatment plans will be individually&#xD;
      modified based on tumour response and expected side effects to treatment. A subgroup of&#xD;
      participants may change neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen and be referred to breast surgery&#xD;
      early. In these participants, the last measurement during chemotherapy will be used, and the&#xD;
      3 months follow up measurement will still be scheduled at 3 months after breast surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study procedures will be pre-tested in a pilot study with 6 patients who will all receive&#xD;
      the prehabilitation program.&#xD;

    <description>The prehabilitation program includes combined high-intensity interval training on a cycle ergometer and machine-based resistance exercise of large muscle groups supervised by a physiotherapist. Exercise sessions will take place in physiotherapy departments at local hospitals or in municipality rehabilitation centres 3 times a week during the neoadjuvant chemotherapy period and ending in the week before breast surgery (maximum estimated 29 weeks depending on number of chemotherapy cycles, dose delays and time of breast surgery). Participants will be screened for psychological distress four times and in case of moderate-severe distress be advised to visit the local Cancer Society Support Center where participants will be assessed and offered free services based on their psychosocial needs and available offers. Participation will be monitored.</description>
