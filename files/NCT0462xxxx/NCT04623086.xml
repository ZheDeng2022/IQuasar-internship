  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates direct switching vs use of a bridging dose from insulin glargine to&#xD;
      insulin degludec in type 1 DM patients. Half of the participants will receive a bridging&#xD;
      insulin glargine dose along with the 1st dose of degludec, while other half will receive a&#xD;
      placebo and 1st dose of degludec.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insulin degludec (IDeg), an ultra-long-acting basal insulin, is increasingly used to treat&#xD;
      patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). IDeg has a half-life of 25 hours and duration of action&#xD;
      exceeding 42 hours in patients with T1D and as a result does not require as stringent a&#xD;
      dosing schedule as other basal insulins. However, steady state concentration of IDeg is not&#xD;
      reached until 2 to 3 doses are administered daily, and this may result in greater glycemic&#xD;
      variability in the 24 to 72 hours following the initiation of therapy with IDeg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that among patients who transition from insulin glargine to IDeg, those who&#xD;
      use a bridging dose of insulin glargine will not have a significant change, on average, in&#xD;
      time spent in target glycemic range during the transition period, whereas, those&#xD;
      transitioning directly to IDeg will have a significant change in this parameter. We further&#xD;
      hypothesize that those using the bridging dose of insulin glargine will have less&#xD;
      hypoglycemia, less hyperglycemia and need fewer correction boluses than the direct-conversion&#xD;
      patients during the transition period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though IDeg is being increasingly used in clinical practice, there are no guidelines on what&#xD;
      is the best way to transition patients from other long-acting insulins, such as glargine, to&#xD;
      IDeg. The package insert recommends 1:1 dose conversion from other basal insulins to IDeg,&#xD;
      but this does not account for the time taken by IDeg to achieve steady state (typically 48-72&#xD;
      hours). There is no guidance on what to do in those 48-72 hours. Given the time taken for&#xD;
      IDeg to achieve steady state, the period of transition from one insulin to another, can&#xD;
      result in significant glycemic variation in the 24-72 hours after the first dose. We want to&#xD;
      study how best to avoid or minimize this and the option of using a small dose of their&#xD;
      original long-acting insulin has anecdotal evidence of success in our practice.&#xD;
