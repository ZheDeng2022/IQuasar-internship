    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, phase II study to evaluate safety and efficacy of tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor (TKI) cessation for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients with stable molecular&#xD;
      response in a real world population.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transitioning from busulfan, hydroxyurea, IFN-α to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has&#xD;
      dramatically altered the natural history of CML. Patients with CML appropriately managed with&#xD;
      TKIs are able to benefit from near normal life expectancy. Given the age-adjusted incidence&#xD;
      of 1.6 per 100,000 people combined with a reduced annual mortality of less than 2% to 3% per&#xD;
      year, it is expected the prevalence in the US to increase from approximately 70,000 in 2010&#xD;
      to a projected 144,000 in 2030. Thus, advancing our knowledge regarding clinical management&#xD;
      is critical in order to care for this expanding population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However the morbidity associated with prolonged TKI exposure remains a substantial burden on&#xD;
      this patient population. In addition to a relatively benign side effect profile (edema,&#xD;
      muscle cramps, diarrhea, nausea, musculoskeletal pain, rash and other skin problems,&#xD;
      abdominal pain, fatigue, joint pain, and headaches), patients continued to experience grade 3&#xD;
      and 4 adverse events (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, elevated liver enzymes,&#xD;
      congestive heart failure, and other drug-related adverse events) more than 2 years after&#xD;
      initiating therapy. For patients with high-risk CML that may benefit from faster and/or&#xD;
      deeper molecular responses, or who develop intolerance or resistance to imatinib, second&#xD;
      generation TKIs (dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib) are available. Indeed, there is a&#xD;
      structural and dose-dependent relationship between TKIs and ischemic heart disease, ischemic&#xD;
      cerebrovascular events and/or peripheral artery disease accompanied with a linear increase in&#xD;
      the cumulative frequency of these cardiovascular events over time. Additionally, experts&#xD;
      believe the cost of CML medicines &quot;are too high, are unsustainable, may compromise access of&#xD;
      needy patients to highly effective therapy, and are harmful to the sustainability of our&#xD;
      national health care systems.&quot; Given the implications on quality of life, adverse events and&#xD;
      financial burden on patients, TKI therapy should be discontinued when medically appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thankfully, discontinuation of TKIs in CML-CP patients with RT-PCR negative for BCR-ABL1&#xD;
      transcripts (Undetectable Minimal Residual Disease, UMRD) or MR has established that 38% to&#xD;
      45% of patients are able to achieve TFR with persistence of UMRD and MR at 5 and 8 years,&#xD;
      respectively. Subsequent studies (EURO-SKI, ENESTfreedom, ENESTop, and DADI) have&#xD;
      independently validated these results, and patients who experience MR will mostly do so&#xD;
      within three to six months after discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, in patients with complete cytogenetic response, those who have a deeper&#xD;
      molecular response (&gt;3 log reduction in transcripts) compared to those without have an&#xD;
      improved estimated 7-year event-free survival. ddPCR is a powerful tool that allows for the&#xD;
      absolute quantitation of nucleic acids and provides a more precise and sensitive assay than&#xD;
      real-time PCR (RT-PCR) in detecting BCR-ABL1 transcripts. There is neither a precise&#xD;
      molecular mechanism to characterize MR, nor a clinically actionable assay to determine which&#xD;
      patients will benefit from TKI cessation and achieve TFR. Thus, leveraging ddPCR can impact&#xD;
      patient outcomes in CML-CP patients undergoing TKI treatment by potentially determining who&#xD;
      is expected to achieve of TFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer causing mutations can affect oncogenes that normally stimulate growth, suppressor&#xD;
      genes that normally inhibit growth, and repair genes that normally limit mutations. Of the&#xD;
      20,000 protein coding genes in the human genome, approximately ~140 genes can promote&#xD;
      tumorigenesis while the remaining passenger mutations confer no selective growth advantage.&#xD;
      In CML, genomic analysis has identified variants in patients with poor outcomes. Therefore,&#xD;
      mutational analysis of clinically relevant genes and genes of emerging clinical relevance&#xD;
      could provide insight into which patients are at risk for relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to these findings, a truly curable clinical status after CML diagnosis was previously&#xD;
      attainable only with allogeneic stem cell transplantation. It is known that successful&#xD;
      remission in relapsing CML patients who have undergone stem cell transplantation was&#xD;
      primarily driven by an alloreactive T-cell dependent graft-versus-leukemia effect. The&#xD;
      cytotoxic role of a WT-1 peptide specific TCR Vβ21 T-cell clone against K562 cells has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in vitro. Taken together, these data suggest a role of immune cells and the&#xD;
      subsequent maturation, generation, and homing of CML-antigen-specific T-lymphocytes - the&#xD;
      hallmark of elimination during cancer immune surveillance. Massively paralleled sequencing of&#xD;
      the complementarity determining region 3 by TCR-sequencing (TCR-seq) allows for a detailed&#xD;
      understanding of the T-cell repertoire and is representative of clonal distribution,&#xD;
      antigenic response diversity, and the degree of T-cell immunomodulation. A diverse T-cell&#xD;
      repertoire capable of recognizing CML-specific antigens with concomitant clonal expansion may&#xD;
      be associated with successful TFR and potentially provide additional biomarkers towards&#xD;
      identifying patients with CML-CP who should be optimal candidates for TKI cessation.&#xD;
