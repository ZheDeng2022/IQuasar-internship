    <textblock>
      After patients is explained all potential risks and study guidelines all patients will be&#xD;
      given an ICF to sign if they wish to participate. Once the ICF has been signed by patient&#xD;
      approximately between 3-5 days will undergo a screening to determine protocol eligibility. If&#xD;
      patients qualifies (eligible) for study patients will be randomly assigned either to the&#xD;
      miracle fruit intervention or to supportive measures at first and later participants will&#xD;
      cross over to the other intervention&#xD;

                  required to check their blood sugar on their usual home glucose meters at least&#xD;
                  once a day, prior to the ingestion of the miracle fruit. If the patient does not&#xD;
                  a glucose meter, we will provide the patient with one. Any case of hypoglycemia&#xD;
                  (blood sugar below 60) should be reported immediately to the treatment physician&#xD;
                  and the patient should stop the miracle fruit treatment.&#xD;
