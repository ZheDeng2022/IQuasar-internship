  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastro-Intestinal Acute Graft Versus Host Disease (GI-aGVHD) is a complication of allogeneic&#xD;
      stem cell transplant which is usually treated with steroids. When aGVHD does not respond to&#xD;
      steroids it is described as steroid-refractory aGVHD. There is no standard therapy for&#xD;
      steroid-refractory GI-aGVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) is the transfer of fecal material from a healthy donor&#xD;
      to a patient in order to restore the diversity of the intestinal microbiota. FMT is currently&#xD;
      indicated for the treatment of recurrent Clostridium Difficile infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that perturbations in the intestinal microbiota following&#xD;
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are essential for the development&#xD;
      and propagation of acute graft-versus-host disease. Therefore, modification of HSCT&#xD;
      recipients' gut microbiota using fecal transplantation from a healthy donor could be used to&#xD;
      treat gut acute GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study evaluates safety and feasibility of fecal microbiota transplantation with frozen&#xD;
      capsules from healthy donors for the treatment of steroid resistant or steroid dependent&#xD;
      acute graft-versus-host disease of the gut.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to reconstruct the intestinal micro-ecology of patients with&#xD;
      steroid-refractory gastrointestinal acute graft versus host disease (GI-aGvHD) by FMT. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to evaluate the safety of FMT capsule in the treatment of&#xD;
      steroid-refractory GI-aGvHD patients. The secondary objectives are as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To observe the efficacy of FMT capsule in the treatment of steroid-refractory GI-aGvHD 28&#xD;
      days after the first administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the characteristics of gut microbiota changes after FMT capsule treating&#xD;
      steroid-refractory GI-aGvHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety of FMT capsule treating steroid-refractory GI-aGvHD 12 weeks and 24&#xD;
      weeks after the first administration.&#xD;
