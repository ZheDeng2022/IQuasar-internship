  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the study is to evaluate a digital lifestyle intervention that has been&#xD;
      developed in an academic setting at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. The tool is based&#xD;
      on self-affirmation theory and has large emphasis on self-reflection to enable sustainable&#xD;
      lifestyle changes. The effects of the tool on HbA1c, reflecting long-term blood glucose, will&#xD;
      be evaluated in patients with type 2 diabetes. The study will contain two phases. The study&#xD;
      consists of a three-month period in which participants are randomly assigned to usual care or&#xD;
      access to the intervention tool, followed by an open-label three-year observation period&#xD;
      during which participants have access to the tool in addition to ordinary healthcare and are&#xD;
      compared with matched controls on usual care.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Considerable evidence suggest that lifestyle interventions can prevent or delay the onset of&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes, and self-care behaviors largely determine HbA1c. Modifiable lifestyle&#xD;
      factors have been established as key drivers of disease onset, progression, and prognosis,&#xD;
      motivating the use of &quot;lifestyle as medicine&quot;. Despite this, a substantial number of patients&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have difficulties attaining adequate glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lifestyle interventions are often complex and difficult to implement on a large scale.&#xD;
      Digital health interventions are increasingly incorporated into diabetes care, and have the&#xD;
      potential to improve both behavioral and clinical outcomes on a broad basis. However, low&#xD;
      levels of uptake, reduced user engagement over time, and low acceptance among patients, raise&#xD;
      concerns about their effectiveness. Knowledge on how to design interventions aimed at&#xD;
      inducing change by promoting motivation and personal engagement, as well as a better&#xD;
      understanding of patient interaction with digital health interventions, could help overcome&#xD;
      these challenges and inform the development of a novel and effective health support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective or this study is to evaluate a new web-based tool, developed at the University&#xD;
      Gothenburg, Sweden, that aims to support patient autonomy and motivation to make sustainable&#xD;
      lifestyle changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will test the hypothesis that users of the tool get improved HbA1c relative&#xD;
      to baseline as compared with controls on usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall study design The study is an investigator-initiated single-center study conducted at&#xD;
      Sk√•ne University Hospital, Sweden, and will follow participants over three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with T2D will be recruited by sending letters with study information to patients&#xD;
      in the ANDIS (All New Diabetics In Scania) registry in Sweden or by advertisements. If HbA1c&#xD;
      is 52 mmol/mol or above participants are included and attend study visits every three months&#xD;
      during the first year and every sixth month during the following two years for blood sampling&#xD;
      and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has an initial 3-month randomization period. Thereafter, all participants get&#xD;
      access to the tool and used it during an open-label observation period of up to three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures All participants receive an email with a link to their personal account on&#xD;
      the tool. This email is sent immediately after the initial visit. Via the link participants&#xD;
      set a password, complete an initial questionnaire and are then randomized to immediate access&#xD;
      the tool or to be on a three-month wait list (1:1 ratio).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization is performed by a web-based system, using a block size of eight.&#xD;
      Randomization is unknown to all participants when completing the initial questionnaire and is&#xD;
      also unknown to the study personnel at the initial study visit. Thereafter, randomization is&#xD;
      non-blinded, i.e. there is full transparency as to who get access to the tool and not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those randomized to the wait list receive usual care, which means that participants are&#xD;
      followed by their ordinary healthcare provider. Those participants do not receive any&#xD;
      information about the tool or its content during the three-month period. Participants who are&#xD;
      randomized to wait receive an invitation to a second study visit after three months.&#xD;
      Following the visit, an email is sent with a link to complete the questionnaire after which&#xD;
      the tool can be accessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits Every physical study visit lasts appr. 20 minutes and includes measurements of&#xD;
      length and weight, blood pressure, and estimations of fat and muscle mass by bioimpedance.&#xD;
      Fasting blood samples are taken for analysis of HbA1c and other cardiometabolic proteins.&#xD;
      Participants will not receive any counselling or lifestyle advice at the study visits.&#xD;
      Technical problems are referred to the study coordinator, who may also respond to requests to&#xD;
      clarify content in a general manner without providing personal advice. Patients are followed&#xD;
      by their ordinary physician throughout the study, i.e. the tool is provided on top of&#xD;
      ordinary anti-diabetic treatment and healthcare contacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention The tool is web-based and used via a computer or mobile phone. It is used at&#xD;
      each individual's preferred pace but participants are recommended to login at least every&#xD;
      other week. Every round the participants choose a themes (out of appr. 80 possible covering&#xD;
      e.g. food, exercise, stress, self-reflection aspects), which takes appr. 15-30 minutes to&#xD;
      complete. Participants then reflect on the content and how it could be implemented in daily&#xD;
      life. When returning for next round participants are asked to reflect on any changes done&#xD;
      since last time. There is no interaction between individual participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics As one primary endpoint an intention-to-treat analysis is used to compare HbA1c&#xD;
      between the two randomization groups based on data between first and second visit&#xD;
      (DeltaHbA1c). Patients lost to follow-up between first and second visit will not be included&#xD;
      in the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard deviation of DeltaHbA1c is 6 mmol/mol over 3 months in ANDIS patients with&#xD;
      baseline HbA1c at 52 mmol/mol or above. With 80% power at alpha=0.05, 142 participants are&#xD;
      needed to each randomization arm to detect a significant difference between the groups,&#xD;
      assuming that the true treatment effect of the intervention is 2 mmol/mol over 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will continue until the required number of participants are reached, accounting&#xD;
      for those lost to follow-up during the randomization period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As another primary endpoint, investigators will during the open-label observation period&#xD;
      compare DeltaHbA1c at one year relative to baseline between patients using the tool as&#xD;
      recommended and matched controls with usual care(1:2 ratio between exposed and controls).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard deviation of DeltaHbA1c is 7 mmol/mol over one year (as observed in patients&#xD;
      with baseline HbA1c at 52 mmol/mol or above in the ANDIS cohort). With 80% power at&#xD;
      alpha=0.05, 24 participants using the tool as recommended and 48 matched controls are needed&#xD;
      to detect a significant difference between the groups, assuming that the true treatment&#xD;
      effect of the intervention is 5 mmol/mol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subanalysis of MOD patients A data-driven cluster analysis of 9,000 diabetes patients has&#xD;
      been performed in the ANDIS registry based on six variables measured at diagnosis: GAD&#xD;
      antibodies, age, BMI, HbA1c (reflecting long-term blood glucose), HOMA2-B (reflecting insulin&#xD;
      secretion) and HOMA2-IR (reflecting insulin resistance). Four clusters of T2D patients were&#xD;
      highlighted, each with different characteristics and risk of complications. One of these&#xD;
      cluster, MOD (Mild Obesity-related Diabetes), is characterized by high BMI and insulin&#xD;
      resistance but relatively well-preserved insulin secretion. It has been suggested that&#xD;
      patients with MOD characteristics would benefit particularly from lifestyle changes. The&#xD;
      investigators therefore hypothesize that patients with MOD characteristics would benefit&#xD;
      particularly well from the intervention. As a subanalysis the investigators will therefore&#xD;
      analyse the interaction between MOD/non-MOD subgroup and exposure to the intervention using a&#xD;
      linear model with a term for the cluster variable, a term for the exposure to the&#xD;
      intervention and an interaction term.&#xD;
