  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of implant therapy is to obtain long-term peri-implant health. Among local risk&#xD;
      factors in the etiology of peri-implant diseases the absence of keratinized tissue (KT)&#xD;
      around the implant has been reported. In fact, a certain amount of KT width, providing better&#xD;
      sensory isolation and, hence, less pain discomfort during brushing, may be useful to&#xD;
      facilitate plaque control. A good plaque control should maintain periimplant health during&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A very recent systematic review assessed the effect of soft tissue grafting procedures on&#xD;
      peri-implant health, revealing that soft tissue grafting using autogenous tissue for gain of&#xD;
      KT results in a significant decrease of PI, BOP and GI values and significantly lower PI and&#xD;
      GI values and higher marginal bone levels at the study endpoint compared to maintenance&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based in the available data in literature, it has been demonstrated that the level of&#xD;
      brushing discomfort was significantly higher in sites with &lt;2 mm of KT width, which exhibited&#xD;
      more plaque and more bleeding on probing than sites with ≥2 mm of KT width. Therefore,&#xD;
      various procedures and materials were proposed in the past to augment the soft tissues around&#xD;
      dental implant. Soft-tissue grafting seems beneficial, especially in posterior mandible, when&#xD;
      patients complains of soreness during oral hygiene procedures and plaque control is less than&#xD;
      ideal and it may be facilitated by a better topography. The surgical procedures most&#xD;
      frequently used to increase the width of keratinized tissue around an implant-supported&#xD;
      restoration include an apically positioned split-flap/vestibuloplasty (APF) with or without&#xD;
      the application of autogenous tissue (i.e., free gingival graft) or a xenogeneic collagen&#xD;
      matrix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, it remains unclear whether or not surgical procedures for gain of KT may establish&#xD;
      peri-implant health limiting the incidence of peri-implant disease and may positively affect&#xD;
      self-performed oral hygiene measures reducing peri-implant soft tissue inflammation when&#xD;
      compared with non-augmented, inadequately dimensioned implant sites. Neither do clinical&#xD;
      suggestions exist for a specific soft tissue transplant to obtain more favorable outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present randomized controlled clinical trial is to assess the effect of soft&#xD;
      tissue augmentation procedures at diseased (mucositis) implant sites in terms of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  occurrence of peri-implant health (absence of BoP/suppuration, PPD&gt;6mm, longitudinal&#xD;
           radiographic bone loss) at 3, 6 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reduction of BoP (%) at 3, 6 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  marginal bone loss (MBL) at 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improvement of self-performed oral hygiene measures (PI, VAS) at 3, 6 and 12 months and&#xD;
           post-operative morbidity (VAS) at 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  change in tissue morphology: increase of KT width (2D in mm.) and tissue volume&#xD;
           (volumetric 3D) at 3, 6 and 12 months and aesthetic (blinder examiner) at 6, 12 months.&#xD;
