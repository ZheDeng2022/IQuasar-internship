    <textblock>
      It is thought that prophylactic enteral probiotics in newborns may play a role in the&#xD;
      prevention of infection and NEC-related morbidity by preventing bacterial migration in the&#xD;
      mucosa, reducing their number by competing with pathogenic bacteria, providing microbial&#xD;
      balance, and increasing intestinal immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, it was determined to detect normal D-lactic acid levels in urine in late&#xD;
      premature (babies born after 34 weeks of gestation) and term babies, to show the negative&#xD;
      effect of antibiotic treatment on the intestinal flora indirectly by measuring urinary&#xD;
      D-lactic acid, and the probiotic support in babies using antibiotics was disrupted. We aim to&#xD;
      investigate our hypothesis that it will have a corrective effect on the intestinal flora by&#xD;
      comparing urinary D-lactic acid levels.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Lactic acid exists as two optical isomers, L-lactic acid and D-lactic acid. These isomers are&#xD;
      metabolized to or synthesized from pyruvate by the action of isomer-specific enzymes&#xD;
      (L-lactate dehydrogenase and D-lactate dehydrogenase). Mammals, including humans, do not&#xD;
      possess D-lactate dehydrogenase, and therefore D-lactate production in human tissue is very&#xD;
      limited. The endogenous single D-lactate synthesis known in man is carried out by glyoxalase.&#xD;
      In this pathway, methylglyoxal is converted into D-lactate by the enzymes glyoxalase-1 and&#xD;
      glyoxalase-2. Due to this restricted production, the blood D-lactate level in healthy people&#xD;
      is so low that L-lactate is the major physiological enantiomer of lactate in the human body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bacterial flora in the human gastrointestinal tract has the ability to produce L and / or&#xD;
      D-lactate depending on the amount of L-LDH and D-LDH present. Some strains of bacteria have&#xD;
      the enzyme DL-lactate racemase to convert one isomer to another. Therefore, racemization&#xD;
      reactions can further increase the amount of D-lactate isomers present in the column.&#xD;
      Although there is no D-lactate dehydrogenase enzyme in humans, D-Lactate is metabolized into&#xD;
      pyruvate by the enzyme D-2-hydroxy acid dehydrogenase (D-2-HDH), an intramitochondrial&#xD;
      flavoprotein with high activity in the liver and renal cortex. The kidney's threshold for&#xD;
      D-lactate is much lower than L-lactate and is efficiently excreted in urine as well as&#xD;
      metabolic clearance. Thus, under normal conditions, D-lactate produced by tissue metabolism&#xD;
      or bacterial fermentation in the gut; It does not cause a clinically significant increase in&#xD;
      lactate in blood, urine or feces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D-lactic acidosis is a well-defined complication of short bowel syndrome due to the&#xD;
      combination of altered gastrointestinal tract anatomy and abnormal bacterial flora. Many case&#xD;
      reports reported in the literature are associated with short bowel syndrome secondary to&#xD;
      various causes. There are studies investigating the effects of fermented formulas and&#xD;
      probiotics on D-lactic acid in healthy babies. In these studies, no increased risk for&#xD;
      D-lactic acidosis was found in healthy infants fed with probiotic supplemented formulas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the studies on newborns; In babies with necrotizing enterocolit, it has been&#xD;
      shown that urinary D-lactate excretion increased as a result of increased enteric bacterial&#xD;
      activity. In another study, plasma D-lactic acid level was found to be high in premature&#xD;
      babies with necrotizing enterocolitis. However, more detailed studies on newborns are needed.&#xD;
