  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this investigation is to characterize the diagnosis of chronic pain in torture&#xD;
      survivors. The investigators hypothesize that using a validated pain screen to supplement the&#xD;
      existing United Nations Istanbul Protocol can improve the ability to detect pain from 15% to&#xD;
      90% in this study population. Investigators will test this hypothesis by conducting a&#xD;
      prospective, blind comparison to gold standard study.&#xD;

      The objective of this application is to improve the diagnosis and treatment of chronic pain&#xD;
      in torture survivors. The central hypothesis, based on strong preliminary data from 25&#xD;
      subjects from the Weill Cornell Center for Human Rights, is that the novel application in&#xD;
      torture survivors of a validated pain screen, the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPISF),&#xD;
      can supplement the United Nations Istanbul Protocol (UNIP) and improve its sensitivity for&#xD;
      pain from 15% to 90%, as compared to the gold standard (a pain specialist). The rationale for&#xD;
      the investigation is to improve the diagnosis of pain in torture survivors, leading to&#xD;
      targeted treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to improve the diagnosis of pain in torture survivors with&#xD;
      the novel utilization in this population of a pain screen. The findings of this study also&#xD;
      have implications for other populations that experience complex trauma such as veterans,&#xD;
      prisoners of war, and sexual violence survivors.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Investigators will enroll subjects from four human rights centers in New York City and compare the diagnostic ability of the United Nations Istanbul Protocol (UNIP) alone to the UNIP plus a validated, self-administered pain screen (BPISF), both against the gold standard for pain assessment (pain specialist exam). With a sample size of 100, a 95% confidence interval for the sensitivity of the UNIP + BPISF can be constructed within ± 6.4% of the observed sensitivity. While the investigators' pilot data demonstrate a significant difference in pain diagnosis by the UNIP versus the UNIP + BPISF, data-driven, definitive evidence is needed to change the current medical assessment guidelines of torture survivors.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>As the UNIP results in a binary &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; clinical pain diagnosis by the evaluator, the continuous BPISF will be converted into a binary &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; for pain. Any subject who experiences mild (score 1-4), moderate (score 5-6), or severe (score 7-10) pain will be categorized as &quot;yes&quot; for pain; a score of 0 will be categorized as &quot;no&quot; for pain on the BPISF.</description>
