  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder of the brain and is also one of the top&#xD;
      ten disabling diseases. A common symptom of schizophrenia (SCZ) is hearing voices inside&#xD;
      one's heads which others do not. Despite adequate medication, SCZ patients may continue to&#xD;
      hear voices that are often rude or unfriendly and cause distress to the patients.&#xD;
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a safe, non-invasive brain stimulation&#xD;
      technique that reduces 'hearing voices'. However, how and why add-on tDCS works is unclear.&#xD;
      The brain can change itself in response to its environment; this is called neuroplasticity.&#xD;
      tDCS possibly changes the brain's environment and/or enhances the brain's ability to respond&#xD;
      favourably to its environment. This theory will be examined here by studying changes in brain&#xD;
      functions before and after giving tDCS to schizophrenia patients hearing voices. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to examine the brain's neuroplasticity potential as the biological phenomena&#xD;
      driving treatment effects of tDCS in Schizophrenia patients with clinically significant and&#xD;
      persistent auditory verbal hallucinations. The secondary aims are to answer whether the&#xD;
      brain's neuroplasticity potential in schizophrenia patients can predict their responsivity to&#xD;
      tDCS treatment for auditory verbal hallucinations, and if chronicity of illness effects tDCS&#xD;
      treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The brain's neuroplasticity potential will be examined using neuroimaging and&#xD;
      neurophysiological techniques that give information about the integrity of the brain's signal&#xD;
      processing efficiency, the chemical concentration of certain bio-molecules within it, and how&#xD;
      well different areas of the brain communicate with each other. With this information, the&#xD;
      potential role of the brain's neuroplasticity potential in facilitating treatment effects of&#xD;
      tDCS can be better understood. With this knowledge, it could be possible personalize tDCS&#xD;
      treatment, profile tDCS responders and non-responders based on demographic and biological&#xD;
      factors, and prescribe tDCS at the appropriate time within the illness course for maximal&#xD;
      benefit to the SCZ patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      20-30% schizophrenia (SCZ) patients struggle with auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH)&#xD;
      minimally responsive to pharmaceutical treatments. Add-on fronto-temporoparietal transcranial&#xD;
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) is suggested to address persistent AVH in SCZ patients.&#xD;
      High heterogeneity among existing randomized control trials for AVH treatment in SCZ and lack&#xD;
      of empirical studies investigating tDCS action mechanism warrants a systematic investigation&#xD;
      into the mechanistic basis of tDCS action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes and examines the brain's neuroplasticity potential as biological&#xD;
      phenomena driving treatment effects of tDCS. Using a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      sham-controlled parallel-arm, pre-post design, changes in neuroplasticity potential with tDCS&#xD;
      treatment for AVH in SCZ will be assessed. The four composite primary outcome measures of&#xD;
      this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. changes in N100-derived event-related-potential waveforms (neurophysiological),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. changes glutamine-glutamate levels (neurochemical),&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. changes in resting-state functional connectivity (neuroimaging), and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. reduction in AVH severity (clinical).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. exploring the correlation between neurobiological measures of neuroplasticity changes&#xD;
           induced by tDCS and clinical improvement in AVH to indicate the nature and strength of&#xD;
           the relationship between the two;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. exploring the effect of verum (active) tDCS on early course versus late course SCZ&#xD;
           patients will uncover if illness chronicity is a potential barrier to tDCS responsivity;&#xD;
           and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. utilizing disorder-related (age at illness onset, medication, the severity of the&#xD;
           symptom, etc.) and biographic (age, sex, years of education, etc.) features of the study&#xD;
           sample towards predicting neuroplasticity modulation in the study sample.&#xD;
