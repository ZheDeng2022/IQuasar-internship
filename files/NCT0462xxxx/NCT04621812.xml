    <textblock>
      Efficient immunosuppressive therapy and improved surgical techniques have developed liver&#xD;
      transplantation as a well-established and life-saving treatment. The 1-year survival rate of&#xD;
      approximately 85-90%. Acute cellular rejection (ACR) is one of the main causes of liver&#xD;
      dysfunction (LD) after liver trans- plantation, occurring 30% to 70% of transplanted patients&#xD;
      and potentially leading to allograft failure. In addition to ACR, presence of sepsis, drug&#xD;
      injury, viral infections like CMV or recurrence of viral hepatitis is also other causes of&#xD;
      graft dysfunction. Laboratory tests are commonly used as less invasive methods of monitoring&#xD;
      allograft rejection, but they are not specific to rejection and are often elevated in other&#xD;
      types of graft dysfunction too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Till date the immunosuppressive regimen in liver transplant recipient is considered as an art&#xD;
      in absence of an objective measures of the immune state. Therapeutic drug monitoring has&#xD;
      little value in the assessment of the immune state and is always used as a supportive guide.&#xD;
      The development of specific immune monitoring assays to measure the net immunosuppressive&#xD;
      state in a transplant recipient would allow a more individualized therapeutic regimen&#xD;
      Patients with altered gut microbiota had more chances of infection and longer course of&#xD;
      hospital stay. Probiotics could mediate beneficial effects in graft rejection. Dysbiosis&#xD;
      activates T cells through PAMPS and causes the inflammatory injury in the graft liver. The&#xD;
      studies shown that lower Eubacteria, Bifidobacterium, Faecal bacterium and Lactobacillus with&#xD;
      abundance of Enterococcus and Enterobacteriaceae. They restored to near normal after&#xD;
      transplant in majority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is known that there is a dysbiosis in the natural history of ACLF or decompensated&#xD;
      cirrhosis, and often correlated to complications like-endotoxemia, sepsis, worsening liver&#xD;
      failure and poor survival. This has led to consider fecal microbiota modulation as an&#xD;
      emerging therapy. Liver transplant and consequent recovery, there is over all change in the&#xD;
      recipient homeostatic milieu as well as the immune milieu and the same may be happening to&#xD;
      the gut flora too.It's well known that liver has animprint of resident gut flora. The&#xD;
      preliminary rat model showed alteration of gut flora to predict the development acute&#xD;
      cellular rejection before it happens. Similarly the risk of infection is more among&#xD;
      transplant recipients with decreased microbial diversity after liver transplant. However the&#xD;
      data is scanty and there is an urgent need to understand the mechanism..&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study was necessitated in view of emerging role of gut microflora and its&#xD;
      influence on immune remodeling for the prediction of infection, rejection and may be an early&#xD;
      biomarker for the graft dysfunction. This may be of varied cause in liver transplant&#xD;
      recipients along with its impact on overall immune status. Uniqueness of the present study&#xD;
      will be to understand the mechanism of development of sepsis or graft dysfunction in due&#xD;
      course of time using high-throughput tools of single cell analysis in whole blood and gut&#xD;
      microbiota alterations among liver transplant recipient as a cause for graft dysfunction in&#xD;
      first year of live donor liver transplant.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To characterize the fecal microbiota changes over one year after living donor liver&#xD;
      transplantation and its association with graft rejection and sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Incidence of graft dysfunction attributable to sepsis, rejection and CMV infection in&#xD;
           first year of LDLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study the pre-LT immunological profile and its correlation with post-transplant&#xD;
           rejection, immunosuppression requirements and restoration of immunosenescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To correlate the dynamic changes in immune cells and cytokines in predicting graft&#xD;
           rejection and sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN Type of study - Single centre, prospective, observational study Study population&#xD;
      - consecutive 100 patients fulfilling the eligibility criteria and undergoing living donor&#xD;
      liver transplant in ILBS between April 2020 to March 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration - 24 months from the date of approval of IEC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of gut microbiota:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA extraction All subjects will undergo serum and stool collection the same day. About 5-8g&#xD;
      of fecal materialwill be collected .The QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit for stool samples will&#xD;
      be used for DNA extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCR Amplification of the 16s RNA Gene Briefly, PCR amplification of the V3-V4 hypervariable&#xD;
      regions will be done by using the 341F and 806R primers containing the sample specific&#xD;
      barcode. Purified amplified product (QIAGEN), will be run on the MiSeq platform with custom&#xD;
      sequencing primer reads 1 (R1), read 2 (R2) and index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole blood: Whole blood will be (5-10ml) will be collected. Plasma will be separated by&#xD;
      centrifugation at 2500rpm. Plasma will be stored at -80C in biobank (NLDB) until processed&#xD;
      for cytokines array. Remaining blood will be treated with RBC lysis buffer and will be&#xD;
      processed for immune cells analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunophenotyping for frequency/absolute number of immune cells: The cells in the whole blood&#xD;
      will be stained with specific flurochrome labelled monoclonal antibodies for the surface&#xD;
      markers for T cells subsets (Th1,Th2, Th17, Tregs), B regulatory cells using Flowcytometry&#xD;
      and analysis will be done by FCS express software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytokine Array: The pro-inflammatory (IL-1Î²) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10)will be&#xD;
      measured in plasma of the patients under study. The cytokine array kit will be procured&#xD;
      commercially and will be done according to the manufacturer's instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data will be reported as mean + SD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Categorical variables will be compared using the chi-square test or Fisher exact test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal continuous variables will be compared using the Student t test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non normal continuous variables will be compared using the Mann-Whitney rank-sum test&#xD;
           (unpaired data) or the Wilcoxon test (paired data).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison between groups on quantitative variables will be analyzed by ANOVA A Cox&#xD;
           regression analysis will be performed to identify independent prognostic factors for&#xD;
           graft function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY END POINTS Primary End point&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Development of sepsis, rejection, CMV infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary End points&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post LT complications requiring surgical interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Retransplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcome of the project:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. This will help us in designing simple diagnostic tools based on microbial profiling or&#xD;
           immune cells signatures for diagnosis of graft dysfunction and sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. This will also give us insight about mechanism of immune pathogenesis during the&#xD;
           development of severe conditions and this will pave way for newer therapeutic options.&#xD;
&#xD;
