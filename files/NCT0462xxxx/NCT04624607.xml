  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with spinal cord injury (SCI) have motor dysfunction that results in substantial&#xD;
      social, personal, and economic costs. Uncontrolled muscle spasticity and motor dysfunction&#xD;
      result in disabilities that significantly reduce quality of life. Several rehabilitation&#xD;
      interventions are utilized to treat muscle spasticity and motor dysfunction after SCI in&#xD;
      humans. However, because most interventions rely on sensory afferent feedback that is&#xD;
      interpreted by malfunctioned neuronal networks, rehabilitation efforts are greatly&#xD;
      compromised. On the other hand, changes in the function of nerve cells connecting the brain&#xD;
      and spinal cord have been reported following repetitive electromagnetic stimulation delivered&#xD;
      over the head and legs or arms at specific time intervals. In addition, evidence suggests&#xD;
      that electrical signals delivered to the spinal cord can regenerate spinal motor neurons in&#xD;
      injured animals. A fundamental knowledge gap still exists on neuroplasticity and recovery of&#xD;
      leg motor function in people with SCI after repetitive transspinal cord and transcortical&#xD;
      stimulation. In this project, it is proposed that repetitive pairing of transspinal cord&#xD;
      stimulation with transcortical stimulation strengthens the connections between the brain and&#xD;
      spinal cord, decreases ankle spasticity, and improves leg movement. People with motor&#xD;
      incomplete SCI will receive transspinal - transcortical paired associative stimulation at&#xD;
      rest and during assisted stepping. The effects of this novel neuromodulation paradigm will be&#xD;
      established via clinical tests and noninvasive neurophysiological methods that assess the&#xD;
      pathways connecting the brain with the spinal cord.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Motor dysfunction after SCI results in substantial personal, social, and economic costs.&#xD;
      Secondary complications related to muscle spasticity and motor dysfunction significantly&#xD;
      reduce quality of life. Rehabilitation efforts are compromised because most therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions rely heavily on sensory afferent feedback that is interpreted by malfunctioned&#xD;
      neuronal networks. On the other hand, electrical signals delivered over the spine regenerate&#xD;
      neurons of the spinal cord in injured animals, and paired associative stimulation produces&#xD;
      enduring neuronal plasticity in healthy and injured humans and animals. A fundamental&#xD;
      knowledge gap still exists on induction of functional neuroplasticity and recovery of leg&#xD;
      motor function following repetitive pairing of transspinal cord stimulation with&#xD;
      transcortical stimulation in people with motor incomplete SCI. Our central working hypothesis&#xD;
      is that transspinal cord stimulation paired with transcortical stimulation strengthens&#xD;
      corticospinal neuronal connections, decreases ankle spasticity, and improves leg motor&#xD;
      function. This notion is based on the concept tested in the applicant's laboratory that this&#xD;
      novel stimulation paradigm potentiates synaptic actions and activity of spared but&#xD;
      compromised axons providing the necessary environment for functional neuroplasticity. The&#xD;
      rationale of this research study is that neuromodulation methods that can modify effectively&#xD;
      the input-output relations of cortical and spinal neuronal pathways in people with motor&#xD;
      incomplete SCI are needed. Based on strong preliminary data, two specific aims will be&#xD;
      addressed: Specific Aim 1: Establish induction of transspinal-transcortical paired&#xD;
      associative stimulation (PAS) neuroplasticity and improvements in leg sensorimotor function&#xD;
      in people with motor incomplete SCI when PAS is administered during robotic-assisted gait&#xD;
      training. Cortical and corticospinal neuronal circuits via state-of-the-art&#xD;
      neurophysiological methods in seated (Aim 1A), soleus H-reflex excitability during assisted&#xD;
      stepping (Aim 1B), and sensorimotor function evaluated via standardized clinical tests (Aim&#xD;
      1C) will be assessed before and after 15 sessions of transspinal-transcortical PAS delivered&#xD;
      with subjects supine. Specific Aim 2: Establish induction of transcortical-transspinal PAS&#xD;
      neuroplasticity and improvements in leg sensorimotor function in people with motor incomplete&#xD;
      SCI when PAS is administered during assisted stepping. Cortical and corticospinal&#xD;
      neuroplasticity via state-of-the-art neurophysiological methods in seated (Aim 2A), soleus&#xD;
      H-reflex excitability during assisted stepping (Aim 2B), and leg sensorimotor function&#xD;
      evaluated via standardized clinical tests (Aim 2C) will be assessed before and after 15&#xD;
      sessions of transspinal-transcortical PAS delivered during assisted stepping. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that transspinal-transcortical PAS delivered at rest or during assisted stepping&#xD;
      strengthens corticospinal connections, increases spinal inhibition, decreases ankle&#xD;
      spasticity, and improves leg motor function. Further, transspinal-transcortical PAS delivered&#xD;
      during assisted stepping normalizes the abnormal phase-dependent soleus H-reflex modulation&#xD;
      commonly observed during stepping in people with motor incomplete SCI. To test the project&#xD;
      hypotheses, 12 people with motor incomplete SCI will receive 20 sessions of&#xD;
      transspinal-transcortical or transcortical-transspinal PAS during assisted stepping. In&#xD;
      people with SCI, and assess improvements in leg motor function with standardized clinical&#xD;
      tests. In all subjects, assessments of neuroplasticity in cortical, corticospinal, and spinal&#xD;
      neuronal networks will be administered. These results will advance considerably the field of&#xD;
      spinal cord research and change the standard of care because there is great potential for&#xD;
      development of novel and effective rehabilitation strategies to manage spasticity and improve&#xD;
      motor function after SCI in humans.&#xD;
