  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized control study where adult patients had been divided randomly into two&#xD;
      equal groups using video laryngoscope in group (V) and flexible intubating laryngoscope in&#xD;
      group (F)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Routine pre-operative assessment including history taking, clinical examination, and&#xD;
      laboratory tests. Patients were admitted to the operating room with a small 20G IV cannula&#xD;
      after applying inclusion &amp; exclusion criteria and airway assessment by applying El Ganzuri&#xD;
      multivariate risk index for difficult intubation which include assessment of the following :&#xD;
      inter-incisor gap, Mallampati classification, head &amp;neck movement, buck teeth prognathism,&#xD;
      thyromental distance, body weight and history of difficult intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operating room was prepared using :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Difficult airway cart that includes different size oral airways, endotracheal tubes,&#xD;
      different sizes face masks &amp; laryngeal airway masks Suction apparatus to be ready for use&#xD;
      Video laryngoscopy The flexible intubating laryngoscopy with the tube mounted over the&#xD;
      fiberscope before the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard monitoring devices were applied including ECG, non invasive blood pressure. pulse&#xD;
      oximetry and capnography after intubation Patients were then pre-oxygenated via face mask for&#xD;
      three minutes and using 0.01 mic/kg atropine then general anesthesia is induced using&#xD;
      fentanyl 1-2 mic/kg followed by propofol 2 mg/kg and esmeron 0.5 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is mechanically ventilated using face mask until full relaxation is established&#xD;
      after 3-5 minutes. The intubation is done using video laryngoscope in group (v) or using&#xD;
      flexible intubating laryngoscopy in group (f) In the first group (v) The video laryngoscope&#xD;
      was introduced with the patient appropriately positioned, the operator used the left hand to&#xD;
      introduce the video laryngoscope into the midline of the Oropharynx and gently advances until&#xD;
      the blade tip pass the posterior portion of the tongue. Using video visualization, the ETT&#xD;
      was then advanced on a smooth curve through the glottis and intubation proceeds. Viewing the&#xD;
      entire insertion step on the video screen allows the operator to quickly become facile with&#xD;
      the motion of gently rotating or angling the tube using the right hand to redirect as&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second group(f) patients positioned supine with the operator standing at the head of&#xD;
      the bed. Simple chin lift and jaw thrust may improve the view through the flexible&#xD;
      laryngoscopy and also help to prevent airway obstruction. The endotracheal tube should be&#xD;
      lubricant to facilitate its subsequent advancement into the trachea. Once the endotracheal&#xD;
      tube is in place, the scope is removed, and the patient is ventilated. Flexible intubating&#xD;
      laryngoscopy is often performed with the operator looking through the eyepiece. However,&#xD;
      connecting the flexible laryngoscopy to a monitor is often advantageous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After collecting demographic data of the patient (age, sex, body mass index &amp; ASA) The&#xD;
      following parameters will be measured :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intubation time, Hemodynamic parameters, success rate and number of attempts &amp; incidence of&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;

The cord includes a channel for a light source, a working channel for suction or administration of oxygen or local anesthetic, and a cable that allows the operator to flex the tip of the scope. The cord attaches to a handle with a light source,camera head control lever for flexion/extension of the tip, and a working channel port. The device is connected to the monitor via connecting table</description>
