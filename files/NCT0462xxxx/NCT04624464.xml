    <textblock>
      The AEGON study is a German multicenter, prospective observational study. The study consists&#xD;
      of two parts, which are carried out at all participating study sites and include two&#xD;
      different patient cohorts. Part 1 focuses on the collection and analysis of rectal swabs from&#xD;
      newly admitted VREf-negative patients at high risk of nosocomial VREf acquisition. Moreover,&#xD;
      patients included into this part of the study will undergo in-depth documentation of clinical&#xD;
      data if an antibiotic therapy is administered. Initiated antibiotic therapies will then be&#xD;
      assessed by an AMS board (Antimicrobial Stewardship Board). In Part 2, environmental&#xD;
      investigations will be performed in newly occupied single rooms of previously known&#xD;
      VREf-positive patients. In addition, rectal swabs will be collected and data on antibiotic&#xD;
      exposure of these patients will be documented in order to correlate the VRE contamination&#xD;
      burden of surfaces with the intestinal VREf-load and antibiotic exposure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current studies show that Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) have become increasingly&#xD;
      widespread throughout Germany in recent years, especially E. faecium (VREf). Healthy&#xD;
      individuals can come into contact with VREf in various ways, for example via the food chain,&#xD;
      contaminated drinking water or animal contacts. A possibly caused low-grade colonisation of&#xD;
      the gastrointestinal tract with VREf (so-called low-level colonisation) can remain undetected&#xD;
      during hospital admission using routine screening methods. The AEGON study, based on the use&#xD;
      of state-of-the-art molecular diagnostics and comprehensive clinical data collection, will&#xD;
      provide a detailed analysis of the factors involved in the rapid spread of VREf. In addition,&#xD;
      diagnostic detection limits of common screening methods are determined by the use of&#xD;
      additional diagnostics such as enrichment culture or molecular VREf detection.&#xD;

        The selection of patients to be included in Part 1 of the AEGON study is based on the risk&#xD;
        stratification for the nosocomial acquisition of VREf performed in the CONTROL study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        It is planned to include a total of 150 patients from the participating study centers in&#xD;
        Part 1. Based on the results of the CONTROL study, it can be assumed that within the&#xD;
        selected target group in approx. 11% there is already an VREf colonisation by direct&#xD;
        culture at admission and in 15% of the cases (22 of 150 patients) a nosocomial acquisition&#xD;
        of VREf by direct culture (see method part) can be determined. Patients with&#xD;
        VREcolonization detected at admission are excluded from the study.&#xD;
