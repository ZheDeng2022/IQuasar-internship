  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary microcirculatory dysfunction has been known to be prevalent even after successful&#xD;
      revascularization of STEMI patients. Previous study presented that index of microcirculatory&#xD;
      resistance (IMR) in culprit vessel of STEMI patients showed significant association with the&#xD;
      risk of cardiac death or heart failure admission. Recent technical development enabled&#xD;
      angiographic derivation of IMR without pressure wire, hyperemic agents, or theromdilution&#xD;
      method. In this regard, the current study will evaluate prognostic implication of&#xD;
      angiography-derived IMR in STEMI patients who were successfully revascularized.&#xD;

      Coronary microcirculatory dysfunction has been known to be prevalent even after successful&#xD;
      revascularization of STEMI patients. Previous study presented that index of microcirculatory&#xD;
      resistance (IMR) in culprit vessel of STEMI patients showed significant association with the&#xD;
      risk of cardiac death or heart failure admission. Recent technical development enabled&#xD;
      angiographic derivation of IMR without pressure wire, hyperemic agents, or theromdilution&#xD;
      method. In this regard, the current study will evaluate prognostic implication of&#xD;
      angiography-derived IMR in STEMI patients who were successfully revascularized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study cohorts consist with 2 separate cohort: first, diagnostic accuracy cohort, which&#xD;
      will evaluate diagnostic accuracy of angiography-derived IMR for invasive IMR. For this, 31&#xD;
      patients with culprit vessel IMR measurement at the time of primary PCI will be evaluated.&#xD;
      The patients cohort is the subgroup of previous registry (NCT02186093). Second, prognosis&#xD;
      cohort, in which angiography-derived IMR will be measured in the culprit vessel after&#xD;
      successful revascularization. Those patients have follow-up data after 10 years from index&#xD;
      procedure. This cohort is STEMI subgroup derived from Institutional registry of Samsung&#xD;
      Medical Center, whose results were previously published (JACC Cardiovascular Intervention.&#xD;
      2019 Apr 8;12(7):607-620.) Among 490 STEMI patients from the overall study cohorts, 309&#xD;
      patients with available angiograms and who were suitable for angiographic FFR and IMR&#xD;
      measurement will be analyzed. Primary clinical outcome will be cardiac death at 10 years from&#xD;
      index procedure. Secondary outcome will be any myocardial infarction, ischemia-driven&#xD;
      revascularization, definite or probable stent thrombosis, congestive heart failure admission&#xD;
      at 10 years from index procedure.&#xD;

    <description>Patients are subgroup of previously published study (JACC Cardiovascular Intervention 2020;13:1155-67), which evaluated invasive physiologic indices from culprit and non-culprit vessels of acute myocardial infarction patients. From the study cohort, 31 STEMI patients who underwent IMR measurement in culprit vessel after successful revascularization will be analyzed. In these patients, diagnostic accuracy of angiography-derived IMR will be compared with invasive IMR.</description>
