      This is a global, multi-center, prospective, post-market, confirmatory, interventional,&#xD;
      non-randomized, single-arm clinical investigation evaluating arteriovenous fistula (AVF)&#xD;
      creation by means of the WavelinQ™ EndoAVF System in patients who require a vascular access&#xD;
      for hemodialysis (HD).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical investigation is to provide clinical evidence to further&#xD;
      demonstrate reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the WavelinQ™ EndoAVF System&#xD;
      when used for endovascular arteriovenous fistula (endoAVF) creations. Treated participants&#xD;

    <description>The WavelinQ™ EndoAVF System is indicated for the cutting and coagulation of blood vessel tissue in the peripheral vasculature for the creation of an AVF used for HD. The device is intended to be used in patients suffering from chronic kidney disease requiring HD by physicians trained and experienced in endovascular techniques. The WavelinQ™ EndoAVF System will be used for these intended purposes as part of this clinical investigation according to its instructions for use (IFU).</description>

             to collection of clinical investigation data or performance of clinical investigation&#xD;
             procedures (or where allowable the participant's legally authorized representative&#xD;
             (LAR) on behalf of the participant).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Be able to and willing to comply with the CIP requirements, including clinical&#xD;
             follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Be male or non-pregnant female ≥ 18 years of age with an expected lifespan sufficient&#xD;
             (≥ 24 months) to allow for completion of all clinical investigation procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have established, non-reversible kidney failure, who are currently on HD at screening&#xD;
             or are in need of a vascular access for HD as determined by the referring clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Target treatment vein diameter(s) for AVF creation ≥ 2.0 mm as measured via DUS or&#xD;

             Investigator (PI) (or authorized designee).&#xD;

          8. At least one superficial outflow vein diameter ≥ 2.5 mm as measured via DUS or&#xD;
             angiography that is in communication with the target creation site via a proximal&#xD;
             forearm perforating vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The participant must not have:&#xD;

          1. Active or nontreated hypercoagulable state.&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Another medical condition, which, in the opinion of the PI (or authorized designee),&#xD;
             may cause him / her to be non-compliant with the CIP, confound the data&#xD;
             interpretation, or is associated with a life expectancy insufficient to allow for the&#xD;
             completion of clinical investigation procedures and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Current participation in an investigational drug or device clinical investigation that&#xD;

             with the clinical investigation endpoints. Note: Investigations requiring extended&#xD;
             follow-up visits for products that were investigational, but have since become&#xD;
             commercially available, are not considered investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Central venous stenosis or central vein narrowing ≥ 50% based on imaging, or any&#xD;
             degree of central venous stenosis with accompanying signs or symptoms, on the same&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. The absence of a proximal forearm perforating vein feeding the target cannulation&#xD;
             vein(s) from the target creation site via DUS or angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Occlusion or stenosis ≥ 50%, or any degree of stenosis with accompanying signs or&#xD;
             symptoms of target cannulation vein(s) such as cephalic, median cubital, basilic, etc.&#xD;
             assessed via DUS or angiography and as clinically determined by PI (or authorized&#xD;
             designee).&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Significantly compromised venous or arterial architecture (e.g. severe vessel&#xD;
             calcification) or flow in the treatment arm as determined by the PI (or authorized&#xD;
             designee) and DUS or angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Presence of significant calcification at the target endoAVF location that could&#xD;
