  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The BORNTOGETTHERE consists of improving health programs for early detection and surveillance&#xD;
      of Cerebral Palsy (CP) by implementing the first International Clinical Practice Guidelines&#xD;
      (Novak et al, 2017) in multiple sites in Europe (Italy, Denmark, Netherlands), in low- and&#xD;
      middle-income countries (Georgia, Sri Lanka) and hard to reach populations (Remote&#xD;
      Queensland, QLD and Western Australia, WA). In addition, exploiting early detection of&#xD;
      infants at very high risk of CP, the investigators will implement best-evidence knowledge on&#xD;
      early intervention in CP, thereby improving the outcomes of the infants and of their&#xD;
      caregivers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the study is to utilize Knowledge Translation strategies to disseminate&#xD;
      culturally appropriate guidelines for early detection, surveillance, and early intervention&#xD;
      for infants at risk for CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives A1 To optimize the context-specific health programs for early detection of&#xD;
      CP through the implementation of a tailored multifaceted knowledge translation strategy, in&#xD;
      &gt;500 infants with CP from Tuscany (Italy); Denmark; Netherlands, Georgia, Sri Lanka, and&#xD;
      rural/ remote Australia (QLD, WA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also evaluate health care resource usage following the implementation&#xD;
      of our translation strategy compared with a two-year period prior to the implementation- e.g.&#xD;
      costs of early detection and targeted surveillance, targeting infants with CP (costs and&#xD;
      consequences/outcomes of surveillance and intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1 Our hypothesis is that, compared with usual care, implementation of our translation&#xD;
      strategy will increase the proportion of children that receive a diagnosis of CP &lt;6 months of&#xD;
      age from ~25% to &gt;60%, as measured by CP Registers. Additional costs of screening and&#xD;
      surveillance in our translation strategy will be off-set by targeting the highest risk babies&#xD;
      earlier. Health care costs and usage will be focused on the most at-risk group, leading to&#xD;
      improved outcomes across all children (costs/consequences analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A2 To optimize the context-specific health programs for early surveillance of associated&#xD;
      impairments and functional limitations of infants with CP, thereby fostering individualised&#xD;
      (needs-based patient specific) early intervention and preventing secondary complications&#xD;
      (e.g. hip dislocation, feeding disorders). The investigators will evaluate the early&#xD;
      developmental trajectory of CP in infants aged 0-2 years and parental mental health to inform&#xD;
      early intervention and surveillance needs to improve prediction of outcomes. The&#xD;
      investigators will also compare the rates of hip displacement at 2 years following the&#xD;
      implementation of our translation strategy compared with usual care (i.e. proportion of&#xD;
      children with migration percentage &gt;30%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2 Our hypothesis is that the natural history of CP in infants aged 0-2 years will differ&#xD;
      according to motor severity, with different trajectories identified as early as 6 months'&#xD;
      corrected age. The investigators also predict a reduction in the rate of hip displacement&#xD;
      from 33% in current practice to &lt;10% following the implementation of our translation strategy&#xD;
      (consistent with Scandinavian screening programs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A3 To optimize the context-specific health programs for early intervention in infants with&#xD;
      CP, thereby improving the outcomes of both the infant and the caregivers. In Low- and&#xD;
      Middle-Income Countries (LMIC) and hard-to-reach populations the investigators will also&#xD;
      implement a community-based, parent delivered early intervention program for infants at high&#xD;
      risk of CP (LEAP-CP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3 Our hypothesis is that infants with CP who receive the multi-domain intervention will have&#xD;
      better motor development (Peabody DMS), social- emotional development on the Infant-Toddler&#xD;
      Social Emotional Assessment (ITSEA), cognitive development (Bayley Scale of Infant&#xD;
      Development (BSID III)) compared to infants receiving care as usual. Caregivers who receive&#xD;
      the multi-domain intervention will have reduced scores on the Depression, Anxiety and Stress&#xD;
      Scale compared to caregivers receiving care as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the aims listed above, there will be 3 parallel studies within the protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A: Healthcare Providers Observational Study B: Infant Prospective Observational study C:&#xD;
      Infant wait-list Randomised Controlled Trial of LEAP-CP, a home - based early intervention&#xD;
      (Georgia, Sri-Lanka and remote Australia only, RCT (randomized controlled trial) registered&#xD;
      separately with ANZCTR)&#xD;
