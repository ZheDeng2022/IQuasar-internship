  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United&#xD;
      States and causes genital warts and cancers in both females and males. Vaccination against&#xD;
      HPV is recommended for routine use in those aged 11-12 years old, yet is underutilized. The&#xD;
      study's premise is that preteens are relevant decision makers who can be motivated to&#xD;
      initiate and complete the HPV vaccine series (assuming parental consent and provider&#xD;
      recommendation). This study evaluates a serious video game to engage preteens in the decision&#xD;
      to pursue HPV vaccination. The hypothesis is that preteens who are assigned to the video game&#xD;
      will be more likely to initiate and complete HPV vaccination than preteens who are not&#xD;
      assigned to the video game.&#xD;

      The aims of this pilot study are to (1) evaluate whether preteens who receive the video game&#xD;
      have better self-reported outcomes related to knowledge of HPV and HPV vaccine, vaccination&#xD;
      self-efficacy and decisional balance compared with preteens who do not receive the game; and&#xD;
      (2) evaluate outcomes related to immersion in the video game and game play experiences of&#xD;
      preteens who played the game. HPV vaccination initiation and completion data are collected&#xD;
      from practices for both preteens who receive the game and a comparison group who do not&#xD;
      receive the game.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multiple baseline study based in primary care practices in North Carolina and&#xD;
      conducted over 3 waves of 16 practices each wave. The goal is to recruit 160 boys and girls&#xD;
      ages 11-12 and not vaccinated against HPV for each wave. Participants are recruited by their&#xD;
      primary care providers to enroll in the study. Parents give consent and preteens give assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An original video game, Land of Secret Gardens, is created for the study. The game is a&#xD;
      metaphor for protecting seedlings (body) with a potion (vaccine). Points to buy seeds and&#xD;
      create the potion are earned by playing minigames. The minigames include several versions of&#xD;
      finding secret objects in a garden shed and another involves playing a shield game with blue&#xD;
      spikey balls (i.e., HPV) before they land on budding plants. Throughout the play, players are&#xD;
      exposed to messaging about HPV and the benefits of the HPV vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preteens are randomly assigned to an intervention group to play the video game or to a&#xD;
      comparison group that will not play the game. Participants are asked to complete baseline and&#xD;
      postintervention surveys. Measures included are scales for knowledge of HPV and HPV vaccine,&#xD;
      vaccination self-efficacy and decisional balance about deciding to pursue HPV vaccination.&#xD;
      Participants in the intervention group are also asked about story immersion and game play.&#xD;
