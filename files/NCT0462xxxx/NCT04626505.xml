  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of 2 different&#xD;
      doses of a study drug called ziltivekimab to placebo (an inactive substance) in reducing&#xD;
      inflammation and improving some of the bad effects of inflammation on heart disease.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly (by chance) assigned to receive either ziltivekimab or placebo.&#xD;
      The chance that participants will be assigned into one of the three study arms of&#xD;
      ziltivekimab (either 15 mg or 30 mg) or placebo is the same (approximately 33%). This is a&#xD;
      double-blind study, which means neither participants nor the study doctor will know which&#xD;
      group the participants are in. In case of an emergency, however, the study doctor can get&#xD;
      this information. The study drug will be injected under the skin once every 4 weeks. In this&#xD;
      study participants will receive 3 injections of study drug. The total study duration for each&#xD;
      participant will be approximately 6 months.&#xD;
