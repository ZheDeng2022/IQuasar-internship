  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will prospectively evaluate the accuracy of a deep-learning based software&#xD;
      algorithm in the detection of diabetic retinopathy from 60° wide single-field retinal fundus&#xD;
      images.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will obtain 60° wide single-field retinal fundus images from subjects who are diabetic&#xD;
      patients in primary care environments (i.e. non-eye care settings, such as internal medicine,&#xD;
      family medicine, and endocrinology). The fundus images will be uploaded to the RetinaVue&#xD;
      Network software using the AutoDx-DR with Over-read modality, where images are transmitted to&#xD;
      both AutoDx-DR and a remote ophthalmologist. AutoDx-DR will generate an initial Refer or Not&#xD;
      Refer recommendation and the remote ophthalmologist will provide a detailed diagnostic image&#xD;
      interpretation which will be used for patient management and referral during the course of&#xD;
      the study. AutoDx-DR can also generate a third output which is &quot;Inadequate for&#xD;
      Interpretation&quot;. In this case, the images will still be sent to the remote ophthalmologist&#xD;
      for interpretation. If the ophthalmologist also cannot interpret the images, the patient will&#xD;
      be recommended to have an in-person comprehensive ophthalmologic exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects participating in this study will undergo further retinal fundus imaging: four&#xD;
      mydriatic, stereoscopic 45° field of view (4W) retinal images and spectral domain optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography (SD-OCT) captured with the Reference Standard Camera (i.e. Zeiss Cirrus&#xD;
      600 photo, or other appropriate FDA-cleared imaging device with stereo fundus photography and&#xD;
      SD-OCT capability that meets the requirements of the certified fundus photography reading&#xD;
      center such as Topcon, Optovue, and Heidelberg). The 4W and SD-OCT imaging will be performed&#xD;
      by a certified technician located at or near the enrolling study site. The 4W and SD-OCT&#xD;
      images will be interpreted by a certified fundus photography reading center (FPRC) for more&#xD;
      than mild DR or any diabetic macular edema. The FPRC's Not Refer/Refer determination will be&#xD;
      used as the &quot;gold standard&quot; interpretation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AutoDx-DR interpretation of the 60° wide single-field images will be compared to the FPRC&#xD;
      &quot;gold standard&quot; interpretation for the Not Refer/Refer recommendation. Accuracy metrics of&#xD;
      sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV),&#xD;
      positive likelihood ratio (PLR), and negative likelihood ratio (NLR), with 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals will be calculated. All diabetic patients who are attending routine primary care or&#xD;
      endocrinology appointments and meet the enrollment criteria will be invited to participate in&#xD;
      the study. All study procedures will be performed during a single study visit.&#xD;
