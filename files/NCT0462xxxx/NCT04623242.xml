  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, biomarker and cognitive&#xD;
      efficacy of investigational products in subjects who are known to have an Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease-causing mutation by determining if treatment with the study drug slows the rate of&#xD;
      progression of cognitive impairment and improves disease-related biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an analysis study for an MPRP: DIAN-TU-001 Master NCT01760005&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mutations in presenilin 1 (PSEN1), presenilin 2 (PSEN2) and amyloid precursor protein&#xD;
      (APP) that are associated with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease have very high&#xD;
      penetrance (near 100%). This study will target individuals who are either known to have a&#xD;
      disease-causing mutation or who are at risk for such a mutation (the child or sibling of a&#xD;
      proband with a known mutation) and unaware of their genetic status. Because the age at onset&#xD;
      of cognitive changes is relatively consistent within each family and with each mutation, an&#xD;
      age at onset is determined for each affected parent or mutation. This study will enroll&#xD;
      subjects who are either asymptomatic and are within a specific window of time of expected age&#xD;
      at onset for their family and/or mutation or who have symptoms of mild Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to identify individuals destined to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) within the&#xD;
      next 10-15 years with a high degree of confidence provides a unique opportunity to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of therapies while individuals are asymptomatic and/or very early stages of&#xD;
      dementia. Families with known disease-causing mutations are extremely rare and are&#xD;
      geographically dispersed throughout the world. These constraints necessitate a specialized&#xD;
      study design. Many of the subjects in this study will not yet have any cognitive symptoms of&#xD;
      AD; they will be &quot;asymptomatic&quot; carriers of mutations that cause dominantly inherited&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease and would be expected to perform normally on standard cognitive and&#xD;
      functional testing. Imaging and fluid biomarkers will be used to demonstrate that the&#xD;
      treatment compounds have engaged their therapeutic targets. A set of cognitive measures&#xD;
      designed to assess the very earliest and most subtle cognitive changes will be collected.&#xD;
      Additionally, because many at-risk individuals decide not to know whether they have the&#xD;
      disease-associated mutation or not, some of the at-risk individuals enrolled in this study&#xD;
      will not have the disease causing mutations; they will be &quot;mutation negative&quot;. It is&#xD;
      important to enroll non-carrier subjects to avoid coercion (e.g., potential subjects may be&#xD;
      pressured into genetic testing to learn their genetic status in order to be eligible for the&#xD;
      trial). These mutation negative individuals will be assigned to the placebo group; and will&#xD;
      not be included in the primary efficacy or futility analyses. Subjects and site study staff&#xD;
      will remain blinded as to these individuals' active or placebo group assignment and mutation&#xD;
      status. Thus, the study will be double blinded for placebo and for mutation status, except&#xD;
      for mutation positive subjects who are aware of their genetic status. There may be&#xD;
      exceptional circumstances when required by local regulation or health authorities where&#xD;
      enrollment may be restricted to mutation carriers only but such mandates will be thoroughly&#xD;
      documented and agreed upon by the governing regulatory agency and sponsor. Several different&#xD;
      therapies (each referred to as a study drug arm) will be tested in order to increase the&#xD;
      likelihood that an effective treatment will be discovered. The compounds are selected for&#xD;
      this trial based on mechanism of action and available data on efficacy and safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design includes a pooled placebo group shared by all study drug arms. Mutation&#xD;
      positive subjects will be assigned to a study drug arm and subsequently randomized within&#xD;
      that arm in an overall 3:1 ratio to active drug:placebo. Mutation negative subjects will all&#xD;
      receive placebo treatment. Importantly, subjects and study staff will not be blinded as to&#xD;
      which study drug arm (gantenerumab or solanezumab) each subject has been assigned; they will&#xD;
      be blinded as to whether subjects have been randomized to active drug or placebo. Biomarker&#xD;
      data will be analyzed for pre-specified endpoints consistent with the drug's mechanism of&#xD;
      action and known effects on the tested biomarkers. The primary cognitive endpoint will be the&#xD;
      same for all study drug arms. This study is an adaptive platform based study. Interim&#xD;
      analyses of the imaging or fluid biomarker endpoint will assess safety and whether each study&#xD;
      drug engages its biological targets. This biomarker approach is particularly important in&#xD;
      this study as most study subjects will be cognitively normal at baseline and most will remain&#xD;
      cognitively normal during the first 2 years of the study. The cognitive composite is designed&#xD;
      to assess subtle cognitive changes that may be detectable before the onset of dementia. The&#xD;
      cognitive multivariate disease progression model (MDPM) endpoint design will allow for&#xD;
      detection of these subtle cognitive changes.&#xD;
