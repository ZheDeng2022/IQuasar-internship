  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug-related deaths (DRD) are a significant and increasing public health problem in Scotland.&#xD;
      Benzodiazepines and BZD-type substances (BZD) are increasingly implicated in DRD. In 2018,&#xD;
      BZDs were implicated in 67% of DRD, often in combination with other illicit and prescribable&#xD;
      substances including Opiate Replacement Therapies (ORT) such as methadone and buprenorphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Illicit BZD use and dependence is higher among people with other substance use disorders. 29%&#xD;
      of patients presenting to Scottish addiction services report current illicit BZD use. There&#xD;
      is widespread variance in approaches to the clinical management of BZD dependence among&#xD;
      people with opioid use disorder in Scotland. Some addiction clinicians are reluctant to&#xD;
      prescribe BZD to people on ORT, some will prescribe BZD with the primary aim of dose&#xD;
      reduction and detoxification, others will consider longer-term maintenance prescribing whilst&#xD;
      patients stabilise on ORT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research has identified increased risks of mortality among people taking BZD and&#xD;
      ORT. Other work suggests that co-prescribing BZD and ORT increases patient engagement and&#xD;
      retention in addiction treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This retrospective cohort study will analyse anonymised, linked data on people who received&#xD;
      ORT between 01/01/2010 and 31/12/2020 to explore any relationships between exposure&#xD;
      (co-prescribing of BZD and ORT) and harms including: mortality (all-cause and DRD),&#xD;
      hospitalisation, illicit drug use during ORT, and reduced retention in addiction care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Scotland is experiencing a 'public health emergency' of escalating drug-related deaths (DRD)&#xD;
      in which benzodiazepine (BZD) are increasingly implicated, often in combination with other&#xD;
      substances (National Records of Scotland, 2019; Scottish Government, 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2008 BZD were implicated in 26% (n=149) of DRD and were exclusively prescribable drugs&#xD;
      such as diazepam, although the source is not known. By 2018 BZD and BZD-type drugs were&#xD;
      implicated in 67% (792) of DRD, predominately substances not available on prescription in the&#xD;
      United Kingdom (UK) such as etizolam and alprazolam (Xanax). We refer to these as illicit&#xD;
      BZD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who use illicit BZD, of unknown constituents and potency, can inadvertently or&#xD;
      deliberately consume megadoses of BZD many times in excess of safe therapeutic doses, often&#xD;
      with alcohol and other drugs, which combine to increase the risk of harm and death. Rights,&#xD;
      Respect and Recovery, the current drug and alcohol strategy, expressed Scottish Government&#xD;
      concern regarding the increased prevalence and potency of BZD-type drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People presenting to addiction services for initial assessment frequently report illicit BZD&#xD;
      use in the month prior to assessment, an average of 2,561 (29%) per year in the past five&#xD;
      years for which data are available. The prevalence of illicit BZD use is known to be higher&#xD;
      among people with other substance use disorders, especially problematic opiate and/or alcohol&#xD;
      dependence. A systematic review identified a high prevalence (typically &gt;40%) among people on&#xD;
      Opiate Replacement Therapy (ORT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The picture of BZD prescribing among people on ORT is complex and evolving. Previous work&#xD;
      shows that BZD prescribing among ORT patients is associated with increased harms including&#xD;
      mortality, but conversely protective factors such as increased engagement in care. Scottish&#xD;
      addiction specialists have confirmed that some addiction services are exploring maintenance&#xD;
      prescribing to reduce the risks associated with illicit BZD use among ORT patients. However&#xD;
      clinical guidance does not currently provide a framework for this. Evidence of patient safety&#xD;
      and other outcomes from BZD prescribing in the context of ORT is sparse and conflicting. A&#xD;
      2018 Cochrane review concluded &quot;it is not possible to draw firm conclusions regarding&#xD;
      pharmacological interventions to facilitate BZD discontinuation in chronic BZD users&quot;. Recent&#xD;
      UK public health alerts have highlighted the need for caution and additional monitoring when&#xD;
      co-prescribing BZD and ORT, and the need for improved harm reduction advice regarding the&#xD;
      risk of illicit BZD. Addiction clinicians have indicated there has been disagreement among&#xD;
      certifying pathologists regarding the role of benzodiazepines in DRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need to understand patterns of, and outcomes from, BZD prescribing among ORT&#xD;
      patients in Scotland to inform safe and effective clinical practice, address problematic BZD&#xD;
      use in the content of poly-drug use, and reduce the risk of harms including mortality among&#xD;
      people who use drugs (PWUD).&#xD;
