    <description>The Crohn's Disease Activity Index or CDAI is frequently used to assess disease severity. It gives a score ranging from 0 to over 600, based on a diary of symptoms kept by the patient for 7 days, and other measurements such as the patient's weight and haematocrit.&#xD;
A CDAI score of less than 150 is considered to be clinical remission.</description>

    <description>The Crohn's Disease Activity Index or CDAI is frequently used to assess disease severity. It gives a score ranging from 0 to over 600, based on a diary of symptoms kept by the patient for 7 days, and other measurements such as the patient's weight and haematocrit.&#xD;
A CDAI score of less than 150 is considered to be clinical remission, a score greater than 220 is considered to define moderate to severe disease, and a score greater than 300 is considered to be severe disease.</description>

    <description>Defined as increase in SIBDQ by at least 9 points between week 0 and week 16.&#xD;
The Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) is a 10-item health-related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaire validated for use in CD patients. It assesses 4 domains: physical, social, emotional, and systemic and is scored on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (severe problem) to 7 (no problems at all). The absolute score ranges from 10 (poor HRQOL) to 70 (optimum HRQOL).</description>
