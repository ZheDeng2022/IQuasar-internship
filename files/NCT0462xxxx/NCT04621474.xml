  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopy plays a pivotal role in the management (diagnosis and treatment) of Barrett's&#xD;
      related neoplasia. The standard endoscopy is generally done under white light, which is known&#xD;
      to be imperfect in detecting early neoplastic lesion. Narrow band imaging (NBI) improves&#xD;
      definition of the superficial morphology and vasculature of GI mucosa. Some studies have&#xD;
      shown the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce the number of biopsies required&#xD;
      for Barrett's related neoplasia. This can ultimately improve the cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      endoscopic surveillance. The ability to discriminate between healthy and diseased tissue also&#xD;
      makes NBI a useful technique for the delineation of lesions to treat with endoscopic mucosal&#xD;
      resection (EMR). However not all studies provide evidence of diagnostic utility. Also the&#xD;
      majority of these studies have been conducted by expert endoscopists, which makes the results&#xD;
      difficult to extend to general endoscopy practice. The limited number of Barrett's&#xD;
      specialists in certain areas of the country validates the need for a study to investigate&#xD;
      whether there is an objective improvement in detection and delineation of Barrett's&#xD;
      neoplastic lesions by less experienced observers. The aim of this study was to determine the&#xD;
      utility of non-magnified NBI in non-expert identification of lesions as compared to expert&#xD;
      endoscopists as well as the inter-observer agreement among endoscopists on WLE and NBI.&#xD;

      Matched non-magnified white-light endoscopy (WLE) and narrow band imaging (NBI) images of&#xD;
      Barrett's oesophagus with and without lesions from the same level will be obtained&#xD;
      prospectively. Lesions will be delineated by 3 expert endoscopists and the overlap between&#xD;
      all delineations for each image, regarded as the &quot;sweet spot&quot;, will be used as the gold&#xD;
      standard. The images will then be assessed by a group of non-expert endoscopists (trainees&#xD;
      and nurse endoscopists) as well as senior endoscopists with no interest in Barrett's. First,&#xD;
      white light images will be assessed, followed by a wash-out period and then NBI. Assessments&#xD;
      will be carried out using a computer application designed in MATLAB. Observers will be also&#xD;
      asked to complete the following 1) Paris classification of lesion 2) delineation of the&#xD;
      lesion on the screen 3) rate the ability to delineate the lesion for each of the two&#xD;
      respective imaging modalities (using a Visual analog scale (VAS score 1-10), 4) choice a&#xD;
      single point for virtual diagnostic biopsy. Thus, the quantitative interobserver agreement of&#xD;
      the delineations for WLE and NBI will be calculated. VAS scores for the ability to delineate&#xD;
      the lesion will be compared between WLE and NBI. Rate of inclusion of the biopsy point in the&#xD;
      sweet spot on WLE and NBI will be compared.&#xD;
