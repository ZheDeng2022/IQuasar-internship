  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Haemorrhoidal disease is one of the most common anorectal disorders which affects&#xD;
      nearly half of the general population1. Given the current numerous modalities the obvious&#xD;
      question which needs to be answered is which treatment is the best. An interesting conclusion&#xD;
      from a recent systematic review regarding operative procedures for haemorrhoidal disease is&#xD;
      that all procedures have their own advantages and disadvantages. There is a need for&#xD;
      evaluating treatment from the patient's point of view and transparency in surgical and&#xD;
      non-surgical treatment outcome. So far there is no sufficiently large trial that meets that&#xD;
      demand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To establish the best treatment of patients with symptomatic haemorrhoids grade&#xD;
      III: haemorrhoidectomy versus rubber band ligation (RBL). Patient bound effectiveness,&#xD;
      clinical effectiveness and cost-utility of both treatments is compared; primary outcome is&#xD;
      quality of life at 24 months measured with the EQ-5D-5L with Dutch rating and recurrence at&#xD;
      one year post procedure. The assumption is that treatment with rubber band ligation is&#xD;
      equally effective in comparison with haemorrhoidectomy in terms of quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:Multicentre randomized controlled non-inferiority trial with cost-utility&#xD;
      analysis. Two treatment protocols are compared: haemorrhoidectomy and rubber band ligation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients aged â‰¥ 18 years with symptomatic haemorrhoids gr III. Patients are&#xD;
      recruited in multiple clinics during 18-24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Participants are allocated to either rubber band ligation or haemorrhoidectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary outcome measure is quality of life at 24 months&#xD;
      measured with the EQ-5D-5L with Dutch rating and recurrence at one year post procedure.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are: complaint reduction with proctology specific patient-related outcome&#xD;
      measure (HSS, PROM, PROMHISS), vaizey score, resumption of work, pain (VAS), complications&#xD;
      and recurrence at two years.&#xD;

    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a generic Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) measure, which is broadly used in economic evaluation. The instrument examines a patient's HRQoL on the day of the interview. It consists of the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and the EQ-Visual Analogue Scale. The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has five levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. Responses to the 5 items result in a patient's health state that can be transformed into an index score representing health-related quality of life, ranging between 0 (death) and 1 (full health). These index scores are combined with length of life to calculate the QALY. The EQ-VAS records the patient's self-rated health with endpoints labelled 'the best health you can imagine' at the top and 'the worst health you can imagine' at the bottom.</description>

    <description>Rubber band ligation is performed by a suction device that allows a rubber band to be applied at the base of the haemorrhoid via a proctoscope. Maximal suction force used is 40 mmHg. A maximum of 3-4 bands are used per session. This rubber band constricts the blood supply causing it to become ischaemic before being sloughed approximately 1-2 weeks later. The resultant fibrosis reduces any element of haemorrhoidal prolapse that may have been present. No sedation is required for this day-care procedure. Patients are asked to administer an enema 2 hours prior to the procedure.</description>
