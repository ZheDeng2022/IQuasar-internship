      Patients with STEMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction) with multivessel disease&#xD;
      which have PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention)-suitable non-IRA (infarct related artery)&#xD;
      will be randomized to immediate complete revascularization group or staged revascularization&#xD;
      group by 1:1 fashion. Non-IRA lesion which have equal or more than 70% diameter stenosis by&#xD;
      visual estimation will be revascularized without FFR (fractional flow reserve) evaluation.&#xD;
      Non-IRA lesion with diameter stenosis 50-70% by visual estimation will be evaluated using FFR&#xD;
      device. In case of FFR value more than 0.8, non-IRA lesion wll be deferred without PCI. If&#xD;
      FFR value was equal or less than 0.8, non-IRA lesion will be revascularized.&#xD;

      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the optimal timing of non-infarct related artery (IRA) percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention (PCI) with the aid of FFR (fractional flow reserve) (immediate complete&#xD;
      revascularization during primary angioplasty vs. staged procedure for non-IRA PCI) in&#xD;
      patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction with multivessel disease (MVD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete revascularization (CR) at index procedure is not inferior to staged in-hospital CR&#xD;
      in patients with STEMI and MVD who undergoing FFR-guided revascularization for non-IRA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multivessel coronary artery disease (MVD) is a common clinical condition, about 40-65% of all&#xD;
      primary angioplasty, encountered by interventional cardiologists in ST-segment elevation&#xD;
      myocardial infarction (STEMI), and it is associated with poorer clinical outcomes than&#xD;
      single-vessel disease. Older guidelines recommended culprit-vessel only revascularization&#xD;
      (CVR) during primary angioplasty, except in patient that are hemodynamically unstable.&#xD;
      Several recent studies have reported improved clinical outcomes in these patients with&#xD;
      multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and others reported promising results&#xD;
      from CVR followed by elective second-stage PCI at non-infarct related artery (non-IRA) with&#xD;
      significant stenosis. However, there has been no consensus of optimal revascularization&#xD;
      strategy in this circumstance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, several large-scaled randomized controlled trials were conducted about this issue,&#xD;
      and confirmed the benefit of immediate complete revascularization during primary angioplasty&#xD;
      compared to CVR. Furthermore, fractional flow reserve (FFR)-guided PCI at non-IRA was more&#xD;
      effective than angiography-guided PCI at non-IRA for reducing repeat revascularization by&#xD;
      either immediate multivessel PCI strategy or staged PCI strategy in the other trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although FFR is a well-known tool to evaluate significant ischemia of moderate stenosis, the&#xD;
      most studies regarding FFR enrolled patients without acute myocardial infarction (AMI).&#xD;
      Timing of non-IRA PCI is also uncertain. After promising results of above-mentioned&#xD;
      randomized trials, current guideline recommendation of multivessel PCI (immediate or staged)&#xD;
      was upgraded. However, current guidelines simply mentioned about the timing of non-IRA PCI&#xD;
      which recommends complete revascularization during initial hospitalization by either of&#xD;
      immediate of staged PCI strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators planned to perform prospective, open-label, multicenter,&#xD;
      non-inferiority trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of immediate complete&#xD;
      revascularization (PCI for both IRA and non-IRA during primary angioplasty) compared to&#xD;
      staged PCI strategy of non-IRA (primary angioplasty for IRA followed by non-IRA PCI after&#xD;
      several days). PCI procedure at non-IRA with diameter stenosis between 50 and 70% should be&#xD;
      conducted with the aid of FFR, and non-IRA with diameter stenosis ≥ 70% will be&#xD;
      revascularized without FFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized after primary PCI for IRA. Non-IRA lesion which have equal or&#xD;
      more than 70% diameter stenosis by visual estimation will be revascularized without FFR&#xD;
      evaluation. Non-IRA lesion with diameter stenosis 50-70% by visual estimation will be&#xD;
      evaluated using FFR device. In case of FFR value more than 0.8, non-IRA lesion wll be&#xD;
      deferred without PCI. If FFR value was equal or less than 0.8, non-IRA lesion will be&#xD;
      revascularized.&#xD;
