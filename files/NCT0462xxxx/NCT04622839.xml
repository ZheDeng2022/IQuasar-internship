    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate overall opioid and non-narcotic analgesic use following surgical&#xD;
      treatment for shoulder pathology, and recommend evidence based guidelines for standardized&#xD;
      postoperative pain management.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is currently very limited information in the literature regarding postoperative pain&#xD;
      medication consumption following orthopedic shoulder surgery. To fill this knowledge gap,&#xD;
      this study will evaluate overall opioid consumption in morphine milligram equivalents and&#xD;
      non-narcotic analgesic use following surgical treatment for shoulder pathology.&#xD;

    <description>This study will assess an aspect of perioperative care relating to pain control. Subjects will not be aware of which aspect is randomized, but will be given a list of possible aspects which will include the intervention (listed below):&#xD;
Agents used in nerve block (lidocaine vs ropivacaine)&#xD;
Location of injection for analgesic&#xD;
Use of over-the-counter pain management (including but not limited to acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, etc.)&#xD;
Type of initial opioid prescribed (including but not limited to oxycodone, tramadol, hydrocodone, etc.)&#xD;
Number of pills in the initial opioid prescription&#xD;
Instructions for sling wear (duration of use or type of sling)&#xD;
Ice usage (duration of use and frequency of use)&#xD;
Blinding the participant to the randomized aspect of this study will help prevent bias in patient responses for outcome scores and medication usage.</description>

             the amount of pain medication consumed after surgery An exception will be made for&#xD;
             those who have used narcotic medication for fracture-related events, and expect to&#xD;
             undergo surgical treatment for fracture repair (ORIF or arthroplasty)&#xD;
