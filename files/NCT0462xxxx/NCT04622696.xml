  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety Cohort</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days post-implant</time_frame>
    <description>The safety cohort will consist of approximately 491 evaluable subject medical records reviewed retrospectively from patients followed for a minimum of 90 days post-implant unless the subject was exited according to the medical records due to the implant being removed/explanted or subject death. Device-related adverse events and device deficiencies will be collected.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Performance Cohort</measure>
    <time_frame>6 - 12 weeks post-implant</time_frame>
    <description>The performance cohort will prospectively enroll approximately 341 subjects with a suspected breast cancer that will undergo as part of standard of care an ultrasound-guided breast biopsy procedure, including placement of HydroMARK, with an aim of achieving a minimum 239 evaluable subjects (assuming 30% attrition rate due to surgical excision prior to follow-up, lost to follow-up, death) returning to the office at 6-12 weeks for ultrasound imaging to evaluate HydroMARK visibility.&#xD;
The visibility rate will be dichotomized into two categories from rankings using a 1-5 Likert-type scale - 1 &quot;no/inadequate visibility&quot; and 2 &quot;slightly visible&quot;, 3 &quot;moderately visible&quot;, 4 &quot;very visible&quot; and 5 &quot;extremely visible&quot; will be coalesced into a single category of &quot;being visible&quot;.</description>
