      This is an open-label, single-arm, phase I/II, single-center study with dose finding and dose&#xD;
      expansion parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study hypothesizes that the combination of platinum-based chemotherapy, Oregovomab and&#xD;
      Nivolumab will improve intracellular CA 125 antigen processing and elicit a stronger systemic&#xD;
      CA 125-specific T cell response and that it will be in a manner that is synergistic, safe and&#xD;
      clinical efficacious in patients with relapsed platinum sensitive epithelial ovarian&#xD;
      carcinoma (EOC).&#xD;
