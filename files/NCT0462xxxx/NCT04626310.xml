  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) skills training is effective in the treatment of&#xD;
      borderline personality disorder, it contains four skills modules and there is little research&#xD;
      to guide their modular application. This study compares the unique effects of two distinct&#xD;
      DBT skills training modules, relative to a non-DBT therapy group for adults with borderline&#xD;
      personality disorder. Using innovative laboratory-based assessment methods, the proposed&#xD;
      study will examine the effects of these conditions on emotional responding and interpersonal&#xD;
      functioning, as well as clinical outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe mental health condition with high morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality. Although dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is an efficacious treatment for&#xD;
      BPD, it is resource-intensive and lengthy in its full form, involving one year of weekly&#xD;
      individual therapy and group skills training in mindfulness, emotion regulation,&#xD;
      interpersonal effectiveness, and distress tolerance. As a result, few patients have access to&#xD;
      the full treatment. A better understanding of how the distinct components of DBT affect&#xD;
      different sets of symptoms could help to streamline this treatment and personalize its use&#xD;
      with specific patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvements in both interpersonal and emotional functioning are theorized to underlie&#xD;
      improvements in BPD. Thus, emotion regulation and interpersonal effectiveness skills training&#xD;
      may be particularly important components of DBT. Therefore, this study examines the unique&#xD;
      effects of two distinct DBT skills training modules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are adults with BPD and recent, recurrent self-injurious behaviors (planned N =&#xD;
      81) who are randomly assigned to six weeks of DBT emotion regulation skills training&#xD;
      (DBT-ER), DBT interpersonal effectiveness skills training (DBT-IE), or a non-skills control&#xD;
      group. Using innovative laboratory-based multimethod assessments, this study examines the&#xD;
      effects of these conditions on emotional responding and interpersonal functioning, as well as&#xD;
      BPD related outcomes. Aim 1 examines the unique effects of DBT-ER and DBT-IE on their&#xD;
      respective emotion-related (subjective and biological emotional reactivity, behavioral&#xD;
      emotion regulation, skills use) and interpersonal (subjective and behavioral) targets,&#xD;
      compared to the non-DBT treatment. Aim 2 examines whether improved emotional functioning&#xD;
      predicts reductions in BPD symptoms and self-injury. Aim 3 examines whether baseline emotion&#xD;
      dysregulation interacts with treatment condition to predict treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research is innovative in its experimental examination of the effects of DBT&#xD;
      components on specific targets in BPD. Given the high societal costs of BPD, this work has&#xD;
      important public health significance. Findings will inform larger studies evaluating the&#xD;
      potential modular use of DBT components to result in briefer and more efficient&#xD;
      individualized treatments for patients.&#xD;
