      Open-label, Phase 1, four way crossover study to compare the PK of the new ferric maltol&#xD;
      suspension, in healthy volunteers, with the existing ferric maltol capsules under fed and&#xD;
      fasted conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      32 subjects will be randomised to 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive one of the treatment sequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the randomised sequence, subjects will receive a single dose of 30mg ferric maltol&#xD;
      capsule in a fed/ fasted condition and 30 mg (5ml) ferric maltol suspension in a fed/ fasted&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject participation in the study will consist of 3 periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening: up to 14 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Randomised treatment: 8 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Post-treatment follow up: 3-7 days following drug discontinuation&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All of the following criteria must be met for a subject to participate in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Must voluntarily sign and date each Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved informed&#xD;
             consent form (ICF) prior to the initiation of any screening or study-specific&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Willing and able to comply with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Healthy adult subjects 18 to 55 years of age, inclusive at the time of informed&#xD;
             consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18-32 kg/m2 inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Female subjects of childbearing potential must not be planning a pregnancy or be&#xD;
             pregnant or lactating. All female subjects must have a negative result for the&#xD;
             pregnancy tests performed at screening and each treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Female subjects of childbearing potential (including perimenopausal females who have&#xD;
             had a menstrual period within 1 year prior to screening) must agree to use a reliable&#xD;
             method of contraception until study completion and for at least 4 weeks following&#xD;
             their final study visit. Reliable contraception is defined as a method which results&#xD;
             in a low failure rate, i.e., less than 1% per year when used consistently and&#xD;
             correctly, such as hormonal contraception (oral, implants, injection, ring, or patch)&#xD;
             and intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUDs), at least 3 months prior to Screening,&#xD;
             or a vasectomized partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: complete abstinence from sexual intercourse is an acceptable form of&#xD;
             contraceptive practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Female subjects of non-childbearing potential must be either surgically sterile&#xD;
             (hysterectomy, bilateral, tubal ligation, bilateral salpingectomy, and/or bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy at least 26 weeks before the Screening Visit) or post-menopausal, defined&#xD;
             as spontaneous amenorrhea for at least 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Male subjects with partners of childbearing potential must have had surgical&#xD;
             sterilization (vasectomy) at least 26 weeks prior to Screening or use a male barrier&#xD;
             method of contraception (i.e. male condom with spermicide) during any sexual&#xD;
             intercourse from Study Day -1 (beginning of confinement) until 3 months after the&#xD;
             Follow-up Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Complete abstinence from sexual intercourse is an acceptable form of&#xD;
             contraceptive practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Male subjects must agree to abstain from sperm donation from initial study drug&#xD;
             administration through 3 months after administration of the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A subject who meets any of the following criteria is not eligible for participation in the&#xD;
        study.&#xD;

             renal, pulmonary, hematologic, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, neurological, or&#xD;
             psychiatric disease, as determined by the Investigator;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Presence or history of any other condition (including surgery) known to interfere with&#xD;
             the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of medicines;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Recent (within 6 months of screening) history of drug or alcohol abuse;&#xD;

          6. Consumption of alcohol within 72 hrs prior to study drug administration;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Positive test result for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBSaAg), hepatitis C virus&#xD;

          8. Donation or loss of 550 mL or more blood volume or receipt of a transfusions of any&#xD;
             blood product within 8 weeks prior to study drug administration and 14 days for plasma&#xD;

             to Screening until study completion. Except for ordinary pain (e.g. headache), some&#xD;
             analgesics (mainly paracetamol) and contraception which have no drug interactions with&#xD;
             the study products may be given;&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Has received within 28 days prior to Screening intramuscular or intravenous (IV)&#xD;
             injection or administration of depot iron preparation;&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Has received oral iron supplementation within 7 days prior to Screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Has concomitant disease that would significantly compromise iron absorption or&#xD;
             absorbed iron utilization such as swallowing disorders, gastric pH-disturbance and/or&#xD;
             extensive small bowel resection;&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Scheduled or expected hospitalization and/or surgery during the course of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Diagnosed to be COVID-19 positive by polymerase chain reaction testing&#xD;

&#xD;
         15. Participation in any other interventional clinical study within 28 days prior to&#xD;
             Screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
