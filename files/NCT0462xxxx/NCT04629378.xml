  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single-center, open-label clinical trial to determine the early bactericidal activity (EBA)&#xD;
      and safety of the combination of meropenem and amoxicillin/clavulanate plus pyrazinamide vs.&#xD;
      meropenem and amoxicillin/clavulanate plus bedaquiline administered for 14 consecutive days.&#xD;
      This study forms part of a series of 2-week EBA studies to determine the relative&#xD;
      bactericidal activity of several new or repurposed anti-tuberculosis agents from which to&#xD;
      determine the most effective and safe combination to evaluate in larger and longer duration&#xD;
      regimen-based trials.&#xD;

      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single-center, open-label clinical trial. Study treatments include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Meropenem 6g intravenously once daily plus amoxicillin/clavulante 2 x 1000mg/62.5mg&#xD;
           orally once daily and pyrazinamide 20-30mg/kg orally once daily on days 1-14. Ten&#xD;
           participants will be included in this treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Meropenem 6g intravenously once daily plus amoxicillin/clavulanate 2 x 1000mg/62.5mg&#xD;
           orally once daily and bedaquiline 400mg orally once daily on days 1-14. Ten participants&#xD;
           will be included in this treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Rifafour e- 275® (HRZE) orally once daily on days 1-14, with weight-banded dosing. Two&#xD;
           participants will receive standard first line TB treatment as per the South African TB&#xD;
           guidelines (Rifafour e- 275®) and is included as a control for the EBA quantitative&#xD;
           mycobacteriology and to evaluate whether HRZE gives similar EBA results to that&#xD;
           demonstrated in prior studies with this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 22 male and female participants aged between 18 and 65 years (inclusive), with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed, smear-positive, pulmonary TB will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigational Product (IP) will be supplied as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Meropenem 1g reconstitution vials&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amoxicillin/CA 1000/62.5mg tablets&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pyrazinamide 500mg tablets&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bedaquiline 100mg tablets&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a descriptive study with no inferential statistics or hypothesis testing. The planned&#xD;
      sample size of 10 participants per treatment group is in keeping with other phase 2 trials of&#xD;
      this type and accounts for the possibility of up to 3 drop-outs per arm, which based on&#xD;
      previous studies of this type conducted at these sites, represents a conservative estimate of&#xD;
      the expected drop-out rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      37 days (up to 9 days pre-treatment plus 15 days treatment period plus 14 days post-&#xD;
      treatment follow- up).&#xD;
