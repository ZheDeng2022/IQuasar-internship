  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this observational, cross-sectional study is to effectuate a survey of chronic&#xD;
      pain in a population of children, adolescents and adults with various forms of cerebral palsy&#xD;
      in an educational and therapeutic setting in Athens, Greece. (Cerebral Palsy Greece-Open&#xD;
      Door) Prevalence, intensity and localisation of pain will be associated to factors related to&#xD;
      the functional and communicative limitations of the study's participants. The study also&#xD;
      examines the agreement rate between different information sources and evaluation levels of&#xD;
      chronic pain assessment in cerebral palsy (self-reports, caregiver questionnaires,&#xD;
      observational check-lists administered by rehabilitation professionals, clinical evaluations&#xD;
      by experts). A further research aim is to identify behavioural markers of chronic pain in&#xD;
      individuals with cerebral palsy and a very limited communicative level.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increasing research evidence suggests that children, adolescents and adults with cerebral&#xD;
      palsy belong to a population with a significantly high prevalence of chronic and recurrent&#xD;
      pain that has a negative impact on their participation level and their quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Etiology of pain in CP covers a broad spectrum of reasons. First of all, individuals with CP&#xD;
      might, like any other person, have problems with headache, periodic pain and other commonly&#xD;
      encountered causes of pain. Pain emerging from muscles, joints and the skeleton are common.&#xD;
      For some individuals increased muscle tone, spasticity or dystonia can be an important&#xD;
      contributing factor for pain. This type of pain often referred to as musculoskeletal pain can&#xD;
      be localized in the back, neck, foot/ankle, shoulder, knee, hip and arm. Gastro-intestinal&#xD;
      pain often caused by gastro-oesophageal reflux secondary to changed muscular function in the&#xD;
      oesophagus or lower oesophageal sphincter and spinal deformity (scoliosis) is another source&#xD;
      to chronic pain. Furthermore many activities of daily living such as getting dressed, being&#xD;
      lifted and daily assisted stretching can be painful. Finally dental pain caused by&#xD;
      difficulties in maintaining good oral hygiene or gastro-oesophageal reflux (causing erosions&#xD;
      to the dental enamel and secondary caries) needs special consideration (AACPDM Fact Sheet).&#xD;
      Children with CP who are faced with chronic pain use fewer coping strategies and tend to rely&#xD;
      on social support. In the case of individuals with cerebral palsy who do not have the ability&#xD;
      to communicate because of disabilities caused by central or peripheral nervous system&#xD;
      impairment, chronic and incidental acute pain can remain undetected and undertreated.&#xD;
      Assessing pain in individuals with cerebral palsy encompasses particular methodological&#xD;
      challenges. Pain assessment in individuals with cerebral palsy must take into account their&#xD;
      verbal or non-verbal communication level. In that case by proxy (observational-behavioural)&#xD;
      tools are necessary. In addition using observational tools to truly recognize pain expression&#xD;
      one should also considered that a number of factors such as learned reaction to chronic pain&#xD;
      are reported to influence more than others the display of the behavioural pain indicators&#xD;
      included in certain tools of behavioural pain assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is the screening and assessment of chronic pain in a population of&#xD;
      children, adolescents and adults with various forms of cerebral palsy in a specific special&#xD;
      needs educational and rehabilitation setting in Athens, Greece (Cerebral Palsy Greece- Open&#xD;
      Door). Furthermore, the investigators will explore the possible connection of pain in&#xD;
      cerebral palsy with factors such as severity of CP, age, gender, comorbidities developmental&#xD;
      status and current health status. A significant percentage of the study population has&#xD;
      limited communication abilities. Consequently, this cross-sectional observational study has&#xD;
      to take into account the verbal and non-verbal communication level of the population's&#xD;
      subjects when determining the most appropriate pain assessment procedure, differentiating&#xD;
      between patients whose pain status will be assessed through self-report and patients whose&#xD;
      pain status will be assessed through observational tools (check lists). In terms of their&#xD;
      reliability both self-report and by proxy (observational) tools of pain assessment, share&#xD;
      some evidence of strong agreement between them. The following procedures will be followed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assessment of the level of verbal and non verbal communication skills The ability of the&#xD;
           subjects to give valid and reliable information concerning their pain status through&#xD;
           meaningful verbal and non verbal communication will be evaluated according to their&#xD;
           Communication Function Classification System -CFCS classification levels by trained&#xD;
           speech therapists. Classification is based on the effectiveness of communication between&#xD;
           a sender and receiver of information. CFCS considers the familiarity of individual&#xD;
           communication partners. All ways of communicating are considered including speech,&#xD;
           gesture, facial expression and augmentative and alternative communication. A person&#xD;
           classified at Level I is a more able communicator than a person classified at Level V.&#xD;
           According to CFCS classification 4 categories could be defined. These are A. Children&#xD;
           with adequate communication B. Children with inadequate communication C. Adults with&#xD;
           adequate communication and D. Adults with inadequate communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Classifications of the type cerebral palsy and functional level Type of cerebral palsy&#xD;
           will be taken into account according to ICD codes (ICD-10 version 2016) and functional&#xD;
           motor ability will be recorded using Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS)&#xD;
           and the Manual Ability Classification System (MACS). The GMFCS was used to assess the&#xD;
           severity of a child's neuromotor impairment. Based on this instrument, children were&#xD;
           grouped according to the following levels of severity: levels I and II refer to those&#xD;
           children with lower functional impairment and that are able to walk without&#xD;
           restrictions; level III refer to those children that need help; level IV/V includes the&#xD;
           children that use assistive technology to ambulate. The GMFCS was assesses for its&#xD;
           validity and reliability with satisfactory results. MACS describes how children with&#xD;
           cerebral palsy (CP) use their hands to handle objects in daily activities. MACS includes&#xD;
           five levels. The levels are based on the children's self-initiated ability to handle&#xD;
           objects and their need for assistance or adaptation to perform manual activities in&#xD;
           everyday life. Level I includes children with minor limitations, while children with&#xD;
           severe functional limitations will usually be found at levels IV and V.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Selection of the appropriate tools for the assessment of pain for each category&#xD;
           Subjective reports of pain location and intensity through non verbal communication&#xD;
           (pointing) from study participants will be collected using the Wong Baker FACES Pain&#xD;
           Rating Scale (permission needed) and the Body Diagram screening tool. The Body Diagram&#xD;
           was tested for content and concurrent validity and alternate forms reliability. This&#xD;
           tool is rated as approaching well-established according to the evidence based&#xD;
           psychometric properties assessment criteria. In terms of clinical utility this tool was&#xD;
           classified as strong.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Self-reports will be administered to subjects who have an adequate communication level&#xD;
           (CFCS level I, II, III), following the directives set by relevant research. In the case&#xD;
           of subjects with an adequate communication level (CFCS level I ,II, III) but an&#xD;
           inadequate manual ability functional level (MACS level IV and V) the administration of&#xD;
           Wong Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale and of the Human Form diagrams will be facilitated by&#xD;
           the use of assistive technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pain observational reports by proxy (teacher, therapist in the rehabilitation setting)&#xD;
           will be collected using translated versions of the Non Communicating Children's Pain&#xD;
           Check List and the Non Communicating Adults' Pain Check List. These observational&#xD;
           reports will be administered in the case of subjects with a CFCS level IV and V and a&#xD;
           developmental age lower than 3 years old. The NCCPC-R (revised) version requires a&#xD;
           2-hour observational period followed by the completion of the 30-item questionnaire. The&#xD;
           NCCPC-R hosts strong external validity as psychometric testing within natural and&#xD;
           clinical settings. Researchers have affirmed the NCCPC-R accurately captures pain&#xD;
           behaviours across various levels of a child's development.78 The working group&#xD;
           recommended the NCCPC-R for children with GMFCS levels I to V because of its&#xD;
           well-established psychometric properties and strong clinical utility.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pain for the adults CP Patients with intellectual and communicating disabilities will be&#xD;
           assessed with the the Non-Communicating Adults Pain Checklist (NCAPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Parental interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to better define the subjects' pain status a parental interview will also be&#xD;
      obtained. Parents are invited to report the presence, localization, etiology and duration of&#xD;
      the subject's pain and to give information concerning the use of pain management measures. In&#xD;
      children and adults without adequate communication parental experience will be recorded by a&#xD;
      structured interview based on Paediatric Pain Profile (PPP) where the parent is invited a) to&#xD;
      give a pain history and b) to answer questions in terms of non verbal learned reactions and&#xD;
      behaviours to chronic pain on behalf of the subject (baseline assessments). The Paediatric&#xD;
      Pain Profile is a tool that has been developed specially to help in assessing and monitoring&#xD;
      pain in children with severe neurological impairments, especially those with impairments&#xD;
      which lead them to be unable to communicate pain through speech. Such impairments mean that&#xD;
      the children are dependant on their caregivers for interpretation of their signs of pain. It&#xD;
      and has been used with adults up to 76 years of age. In order to better define the subjects'&#xD;
      pain status we will take advantage of additional information from the young participants'&#xD;
      medical record. In addition each case will be judged separately in terms of pain expression&#xD;
      and severity, by a interdisciplinary panel of experts consisting of a general practitioner, a&#xD;
      neurologist, a paediatrician, an orthopaedic, a psychologist, a dentist, a physical&#xD;
      therapist, a speech therapist, an occupational therapist an expertise nurse, a social worker&#xD;
      and the caregiver of the subject, who are daily involved in patient health needs and&#xD;
      activities of living during their half day stay in the setting (Cerebral Palsy Greece) for at&#xD;
      least 6 months. This group is going to consider for each patient the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the extent of the patient's disease or injury (physical impairment)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What is the magnitude of the illness? That is, to what extent is the patient suffering,&#xD;
           disabled, and unable to enjoy usual activities?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Does the individual's behaviour seem appropriate to the disease or injury, or is there&#xD;
           any evidence of symptom amplification for any of a variety of psychological or social&#xD;
           reasons (e.g. benefits such as positive attention, mood-altering medications, financial&#xD;
           compensation)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Agreement rates between different evaluation levels of chronic pain assessment will be&#xD;
      examined permitting to determine the reliability level of various sources of information&#xD;
      concerning the diagnosis of chronic pain in cerebral palsy. Further statistical analysis of&#xD;
      check-list scores will attempt to identify items in these observational schedules that could&#xD;
      be conceptualized as behavioural indicators of chronic pain in non-communicative subjects&#xD;
      with cerebral palsy&#xD;
