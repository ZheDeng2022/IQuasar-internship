  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project is a pilot study in preparation for a larger study called The&#xD;
      BrainHealth Project. The BrainHealth Project will be a prospective, longitudinal (10 yr)&#xD;
      study focused on identifying determinants of brain health. Over the 4-month time commitment&#xD;
      of this pilot study, 200 participants will complete online cognitive testing &amp; functional&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 2 time points (pre- and post-intervention). Up to 200&#xD;
      participants will complete online cognitive testing at 2 time points (pre- and&#xD;
      post-intervention) and no fMRI. In between those time points, all participants will&#xD;
      participate in online training and education regarding ways to optimize brain health, as well&#xD;
      as overall health. Online training that will be recommended to participants include the&#xD;
      following: (1) Strategic Memory Advanced Reasoning Training (SMART) teaches meta-cognitive&#xD;
      strategies for individuals to apply to their daily lives for improved performance; and (2)&#xD;
      Stress Solutions provides individuals with practical tools to reduce stress, build resilience&#xD;
      and improve quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives are: (i) to characterize lifestyle, cognitive, and behavioral markers&#xD;
      related to an individual's cognitive function from adolescent to elderly ages, (ii) to assess&#xD;
      the neural/biological determinants predictive of maintenance of brain health, and (iii) to&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of available cognitive and lifestyle interventions on improving and&#xD;
      maintaining brain health.&#xD;

      The Center for BrainHealth and Brain Performance Institute have years of experience working&#xD;
      as a translational research facility with the mission of delivering evidence-based&#xD;
      BrainHealth services to the public. However, as the goal of the larger project is to reach&#xD;
      120,000 individuals, this is only feasible through the use of online, remote interactions.&#xD;
      Historically, the preponderance of experience at the Center for BrainHealth and Brain&#xD;
      Performance Institute has been through face-to-face interactions. In order to make this shift&#xD;
      to remote assessments, training, and interactions, we propose a pilot study of up to 400&#xD;
      healthy adults aimed at informing and perfecting the protocols for the larger study. In order&#xD;
      to better understand any modifications or enhancements that may be required to the current&#xD;
      online assessments and training, these pilot study participants will be selected from the&#xD;
      local population, and will complete their BrainHealth Assessment, as well as complete online&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessments and training included in this protocol consist of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASSESSMENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Online BrainHealth Index (2x) - a battery of measures of connected language, which have&#xD;
           been found to be preserved in normal aging (see list of previous studies in the next&#xD;
           section), combined with standardized neuropsychological measures that assess other areas&#xD;
           of cognition such as attention, memory, visuospatial, executive and psychomotor&#xD;
           functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A. COGNITIVE (Recall. Learn. Solve. Innovate.) The COGNITIVE evaluation looks at how an&#xD;
           individual thinks. We will look at complex thinking capacities - such as reasoning,&#xD;
           flexibility, and strategy - and specific thinking components, such as processing speed,&#xD;
           attention, and memory. (Completion time ~ 1 hour) BrainHealth Measures of Cognitive&#xD;
           Performance - 30 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Strategic Memory: Visual Selective Learning Task&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Integrated Reasoning: Test of Strategic Learning (Test of Strategic Learning, TOSL&#xD;
                part I)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Innovation: Test of Strategic Learning (TOSL part II)&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Memory for Detail: Test of Strategic Learning (TOSL part III)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ace Measures of Cognitive Performance - 25 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Basic Response Time&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Color Blindness screening (non-editable)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Visual Search, Top-Down Attention, Distraction Cost, Processing Cost&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Directed Attention&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Selective Attention, Interference Resolution&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Working Memory Updating Cognitive Flexibility&#xD;
&#xD;
           B. EMOTIONAL Well Being (Mood. Centered. Perspective. Rebound.) The EMOTIONAL Well Being&#xD;
           evaluation taps into an individual's emotional sense of yourself. We will ask how they&#xD;
           feel about the quality of their life, their level of happiness, their levels of stress&#xD;
           and sadness, and get a gauge on their emotional resilience. (Completion time: 15 min)&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Happiness: Oxford Happiness Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Life Satisfaction: Quality of Life Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Resilience: Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21)&#xD;
&#xD;
           C. SOCIAL (Engage. Relate. Connect. Empathize.) The SOCIAL evaluation looks at an&#xD;
           individual's social vibrancy and quality of relationships. We want to know how they feel&#xD;
           about their social support networks and the meaningfulness of their social engagements.&#xD;
           (Completion time: &lt;8 min.)&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Amount of Positive Social Support: Social Support Survey Index&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Complexity of Social Interactions: Social BrainHealth Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
           D. DAILY FUNCTION (Strive. Challenge. Habits. Responsibility.) The DAILY FUNCTION&#xD;
           evaluation monitors the complexity (depth and breadth) of your daily responsibilities,&#xD;
           habits, and challenges. We are interested in how you strive to optimize your life&#xD;
           circumstances and habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (Completion time: 20 minutes )&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Mindset: BrainHealth Appraisal Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Significance of Life Engagement: Engagement in Meaningful Activities Survey&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Sleep: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Occupational Complexity: O*Net Database Census Coding&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Physical Exercise: Cardiorespiratory Fitness Estimate Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Brain Imaging (2x)(resting state functional MRI), blood flow (Arterial Spin Labeling),&#xD;
           cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR - with breath hold task) and white matter integrity&#xD;
           (Diffusion MRI). In this pilot study, as well as the larger BrainHealth Project study,&#xD;
           the neural data will be analyzed in conjunction with non-neural measures (cognitive,&#xD;
           well-being, social engagement, sleep, etc.) to support the development of a reliable set&#xD;
           of metrics to assess brain health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Brain Gauge by Cortical Metrics (2x) - 15 minutes. The Brain Gauge is a cognitive&#xD;
           assessment tool that measures brain health by testing sensory perceptions in the&#xD;
           fingertips. This will be completed at the BrainPerformance Institute prior to imaging at&#xD;
           the University of Texas (UT) Dallas BrainHealth Imaging Center. During each test, two&#xD;
           orange tips on the Brain Gauge device will vibrate the pointer and middle finger on a&#xD;
           participant's non-dominant hand in a specific way. The computer-based application will&#xD;
           ask questions about what the participant felt. By measuring eight components of brain&#xD;
           health (speed, focus, fatigue, accuracy, sequencing, timing perception, plasticity, and&#xD;
           connectivity) the application will then analyze responses using clinically-proven&#xD;
           neuroscience to provide a comprehensive mental fitness score called the CorticalMetric.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTIONS Online Interventions 1. Strategic Memory Advanced Reasoning Training (SMART) is&#xD;
      a curriculum that teaches strategies of how to use the brain better, in such a way that may&#xD;
      improve brain health and performance. SMART strives to achieve optimal cognitive function&#xD;
      realized by the brain's ability to efficiently manage complex information by abstracting its&#xD;
      essential meaning rather than attempting to memorize details, and to prioritize the&#xD;
      information in order to attend to the most relevant parts. Importantly, because this training&#xD;
      is intended to improve cognition in the healthy population that is being studied in this&#xD;
      submission, and is NOT treating or preventing a medical condition, it will not be classified&#xD;
      as a medical device for the purposes of this study. Other similar online strategy-teaching&#xD;
      curriculum in studies of healthy aging have set a precedent for this position, utilizing this&#xD;
      rational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Stress Solutions - provides individuals with practical tools to enhance performance,&#xD;
      reduce stress, build resilience and improve quality of life. Training will include the&#xD;
      neurophysiological effects of chronic stress and the neurophysiological impacts of&#xD;
      mindfulness. Participants will learn and practice skills in awareness, self-regulation, and&#xD;
      emotion regulation through attentional focus exercises grounded in mindfulness meditation.&#xD;
      This training enables learners to recognize habitual, conditioned modes of reacting and&#xD;
      resources the learner with skills to make a shift in their relationship to their thoughts,&#xD;
      feelings and body sensations within conditions of chronic and acute distress.&#xD;
