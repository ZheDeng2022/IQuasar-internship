  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emergence delirium (ED) is a manifestation of acute postoperative brain dysfunction that&#xD;
      occurs with a relatively high frequency after pediatric anesthesia. The incidence varies&#xD;
      depending on the diagnostic criteria used and the combination of administered anesthetic&#xD;
      drugs. The use of sevoflurane has been identified as one of the most important risk factors.&#xD;
      In the investigators' study，the researchers conducted the current study to investigate&#xD;
      whether remimazolam can reduce incidence of ED.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One hundred twenty children aged 1-6 years old were randomly allocated into three equal&#xD;
      groups. Anesthesia is induced with propofol，fentanyl and rocuronium. In group P (Placebo&#xD;
      group), anesthesia is maintained by sevoflurane and continuous infusion of normal&#xD;
      saline(1ml/kg/h) is administered until about 5min before the end of the surgery. Then&#xD;
      intravenous bolus of 0.2ml/kg normal saline is administered. In group B (Bolus group),&#xD;
      anesthesia is maintained by sevoflurane and continuous infusion of normal saline(1ml/kg/h) is&#xD;
      administered until about 5min before the end of the surgery. Then intravenous bolus of&#xD;
      0.2mg/kg remimazolam is administered. In group C (continuous infusion group), anesthesia is&#xD;
      maintained by sevoflurane and continuous infusion of remimazolam(1mg/kg/h) is administered&#xD;
      until about 5min before the end of the surgery. Then intravenous bolus of 0.2ml/kg normal&#xD;
      saline is administered. Maintain BIS values in the range of 40-60. Recorded the pediatric&#xD;
      anesthesia emergence delirium scale (PAED) during the recovery period.&#xD;
