    <textblock>
      clinical trial comparing the regression rate after 12 months of histologically confirmed&#xD;
      cervical intraepithelial lesions 1 in 2 parallel groups. One group using the vaginal gel&#xD;
      Papilocare® for 6 months and one group without any treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer affects 3000 women and causes 1100 deaths every year in France. This type of&#xD;
      cancer usually takes about 10 to 15 years to develop and has distinct precursor stages.&#xD;
      Persistent infection by Human Papillomavirus is necessary for the development of these&#xD;
      lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, when a colposcopy biopsy reveals low grade lesion, it is recommanded to make a new&#xD;
      cervical cytology or HPV testing, 12 months later. No treatment is recommended over this&#xD;
      period. However 11% of these lesions evolve from low to high grade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Papilocare® is a vaginal gel that would improve the re-epithelialization of the uterine&#xD;
      cervix. Creating a protective film on the cervix, it could induce a favorable environment for&#xD;
      regression of the cervical intraepithelial lesions 1 and for clearance of Human&#xD;
      Papillomavirus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of our study is to include 150 women with a histologically confirmed cervical&#xD;
      intraepithelial lesions 1. Half of them will be using the vaginal gel Papilocare® for 6 month&#xD;
      while the other half will not receive any treatment (as suggested by current&#xD;
      recommendations). Each patient will have a cervical cytology and a HPV testing after 6 months&#xD;
      and after 12 months. Therefore we will be able to compare the percentage of normalization of&#xD;
      cervical cytology and HPV clearance for each group after 6 months and after 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will visit the Orleans hospital once for the inclusion and twice for follow-ups&#xD;
      after 6 months and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the use of Papilocare® really induces a significant regression of low grade lesions, this&#xD;
      vaginal gel could be offered as soon as these lesions are histologically identified in order&#xD;
      to stop its progress to high grade.&#xD;

    <description>Papilocare® is a self-administered vaginal gel. Its single-dose cannula contains hyaluronic acid and pre-biotics (Coriolus Versicolor) that would improve the re-epithelialization of the uterin cervix. By creating a protective film on the cervix, this gel could induce a favorable environment for regression of the cervical intraepithelial lesions 1 and for clearance of Human Papillomavirus.&#xD;
The specific approach related to our study would be to apply Papilocare® vaginal gel for 6 months for the treated group.&#xD;
Smear and HPV test will be perform by all patients at 6 and 12 months.</description>
