  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whiplash is the most common injury associated with motor vehicle accidents and a major cause&#xD;
      of disability and litigation. An acute whiplash injury follows sudden or excessive&#xD;
      hyperextension, hyper flexion, or rotation of the neck affecting the soft tissues. It&#xD;
      typically results from rear-end or side-impact motor vehicle collisions. Patients commonly&#xD;
      present with pain and stiffness in the neck, headache, and upper backache. Chronic whiplash&#xD;
      syndrome is characterized by symptoms of neck pain that persist for more than 3 months (1,&#xD;
      2). With over half a million people making whiplash injury claims per annum in the UK, it has&#xD;
      a major impact on the healthcare and legal systems and also the economy. Over 40% of patients&#xD;
      with whiplash injury report chronic neck pain and this is often refractory to conservative&#xD;
      management (pain relief medications, physiotherapy). Current treatment involves burning the&#xD;
      small nerves that supply the joints (facet joints) in the neck. Although they provide pain&#xD;
      relief that can last 6-9 months, the nerves re-grow and the treatment has to be repeated.&#xD;
      This treatment is a complex procedure that requires extensive training and has the potential&#xD;
      to cause serious harm. There is new evidence to show that the pain in whiplash injury could&#xD;
      be due to an impaired function of the neck muscles arising from whiplash trauma. Current&#xD;
      treatment for this condition is injection of numbing medicine or steroids directly into the&#xD;
      muscle. Although this treatment is safer than burning the facet nerves, it provides&#xD;
      short-term relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have shown that a novel treatment targeting the nerves that supply the&#xD;
      muscles in the neck can provide durable relief in patients with chronic neck pain. The&#xD;
      medication is injected into a specific area (plane) in the neck of the patient and is called&#xD;
      cervical plexus block (CPB). The investigators currently offer CBP treatment as a standard&#xD;
      treatment in the management of patients with chronic neck pain arising from whiplash injury.&#xD;
      There are two types of CPB: CPB with numbing medicine (CPB-LA) and CPB with steroid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of two types of Cervical Plexus Block (CPB)&#xD;
      treatment in reducing pain at three months in patients with refractory chronic neck pain from&#xD;
      whiplash injury&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The proposed study is a prospective, observational pilot study that will be&#xD;
      conducted at Leicester General Hospital over 36 months. Potential participants will be given&#xD;
      an information sheet by the clinical team when they are seen in the outpatient clinic. The&#xD;
      participants will have 24 hours to read the information sheet. Thereafter, the research team&#xD;
      will approach the potential participant to obtain informed consent. After providing written&#xD;
      consent, adult patients with chronic neck pain from whiplash injury will receive ultrasound&#xD;
      guided CPB-LA in the theatre. If treatment provides &gt;30% relief at 3 months, they will be&#xD;
      re-assessed at six months and CPB-LAi will be repeated as per waiting list. If at 3 months,&#xD;
      the pain returns to the baseline, CPB with steroid will be performed. If CPB with steroid&#xD;
      does not provide any benefit, the participants will receive a rescue treatment (trigger point&#xD;
      injection) within three months. Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires on pain&#xD;
      scores and mood. Participation in the study will end at 9 months following the first CPB&#xD;
      treatment on completion of relevant questionnaires.&#xD;

      Whiplash is the most common injury associated with motor vehicle accidents and a major cause&#xD;
      of disability and litigation. An acute whiplash injury follows sudden or excessive&#xD;
      hyperextension, hyper flexion, or rotation of the neck affecting the soft tissues. It&#xD;
      typically results from rear-end or side-impact motor vehicle collisions. Patients commonly&#xD;
      present with pain and stiffness in the neck, headache, and upper backache with or without&#xD;
      paraesthesia of the upper limbs. Chronic whiplash syndrome is characterized by symptoms that&#xD;
      persist for more than 3 months. With over half a million people making whiplash injury claims&#xD;
      per annum in the UK, it has a major impact on the healthcare and legal systems and also the&#xD;
      economy. In 1995, whiplash-associated disorder (WAD) was defined by the Quebec task force as&#xD;
      'Whiplash is an acceleration-deceleration mechanism of energy transfer to the neck. The&#xD;
      incidence of WAD is very variable, averaging to about 9 per 1000 people in the UK, the&#xD;
      highest in Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Around 40% of patients suffer from symptoms of WAD beyond 3 months (chronic whiplash) and 2 -&#xD;
      4.5% of patients are left permanently disabled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence that neck pain in WAD could arise from either cervical facet joint or due&#xD;
      to impaired function of neck muscles (Cervicothoracic Myofascial Pain Syndrome, CTMPS) or&#xD;
      both. The investigators have recently reported on ultrasound guided cervical plexus block&#xD;
      with depot steroids in the management of refractory cervicothoracic myofascial pain. This&#xD;
      intervention involves a single injection that targets a number of muscles that are commonly&#xD;
      involved in causing chronic WAD. The treatment has a definite end point that helps to&#xD;
      standardize the intervention with a good safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is an observational study on the effectiveness of two types of cervical&#xD;
      plexus block (CPB-Local Anaesthesia and CPB-Steroids) treatment as a part of standard care in&#xD;
      providing durable analgesia. The objective is to collect data to inform the design a larger&#xD;
      multicentre study&#xD;
