      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of green tea extract (GTE) on fat&#xD;
      oxidation, body composition and exercise performance in overweight individuals. The study&#xD;
      will be conducted under laboratory conditions following an 8 week supplemental period.&#xD;
      Participants will be required to attend the laboratory for a pre-screening/familiarisation&#xD;
      trial followed by assessments at week 0 (baseline), week 2, 4 and 8. Across the intervention,&#xD;
      participants will maintain habitual dietary intake and follow a prescribed exercise&#xD;
      programme. Additionally participants will be randomised to either a placebo, green tea&#xD;
      extract or GTE with antioxidant supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesised that the addition of antioxidants with GTE will enhance fat oxidation in&#xD;
      overweight individuals more than GTE or placebo. It is further hypothesised that such&#xD;
      improvements in fat oxidation due to GTE will lead to improvements in both body composition&#xD;
      variables and submaximal exercise performance (metabolic efficiency) in overweight, but&#xD;
      otherwise healthy persons.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The health benefits of polyphenols found in green tea (GT), the unfermented leaves of the tea&#xD;
      plant, Camellia sinensis, are of current scientific interest. These health benefits, in part,&#xD;
      relate to the bioactive catechin polyphenol content of GT, of which&#xD;
      (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) can account for between 50-80% of the total catechin&#xD;
      content. GT catechins have been proposed to influence metabolic and thermogenic activities in&#xD;
      the short term, leading to enhanced fat oxidation capacity, although this has been disputed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research investigating GT extracts (GTE) and exercise have produced conflicting results.&#xD;
      Modest EGCG dosage in the short term (270 mg·d-1 EGCG for 6 days, and 68 mg·d-1 EGCG for 3&#xD;
      weeks) did not alter metabolic or performance variables in healthy or endurance trained&#xD;
      volunteers. However, the inclusion of 100.5 mg·d-1 EGCG over a 10 week training period&#xD;
      enhanced whole-body metabolic efficiency elsewhere. One confounding factor though is the use&#xD;
      of caffeinated GTE in these studies. When decaffeinated GTE (dGTE) has been employed, 366 mg&#xD;
      EGCG was found to acutely increase fat oxidation by 17%. Indeed a recent publication from our&#xD;
      research group investigating the short term use of dGTE demonstrated positive changes in fat&#xD;
      oxidation in healthy volunteers. However, less is known as to whether dGTE (or indeed&#xD;
      combinations of dGTE with antioxidant nutrients which may improve GTE bioavailability) could&#xD;
      provide similar results in overweight or sedentary individuals embarking on an exercise&#xD;
      programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this research proposal is therefore to assess the impact of two GTE strategies on&#xD;
      fat oxidation, cardiometabolic health, visceral fat reduction, and exercise performance in a&#xD;
      healthy, but overweight cohort undertaking a standardised exercise training programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Q1: Does regular consumption of dGTE favourably enhance fat oxidation and/or improve&#xD;
      variables associated with cardiometabolic health and body composition in comparison to a&#xD;
      placebo supplement in healthy, but overweight individuals? Q2: Does a dGTE complex (including&#xD;
      key antioxidant nutrients) enhance fat oxidation and/or improve variables associated with&#xD;
      cardiometabolic health and body composition more so than dGTE or placebo supplementation in&#xD;
      healthy, but overweight individuals?&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve participants attending sessions at Compass House, ARU, undertaking&#xD;
      the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline trial: all participants will attend a subject briefing, provide written,&#xD;
           informed consent prior to participation. Following this, all participants will undertake&#xD;
           a baseline test for maximal fat oxidation rates (FATmax) and oxygen uptake using a&#xD;
           standardised incremental cycling exercise protocol and expired air analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention period: participants will be randomly assigned to either dGTE (400mg EGCG&#xD;
           daily), dGTE with antioxidants (150mg quercetin, 150mg alpha-lipoic acid) or placebo for&#xD;
           8 weeks. During this period, participants will undertake regular aerobic exercise (3x/&#xD;
           week; 45mins; at ~ FATmax intensity)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental evaluation of progress will be assessed at weeks 0,2,4, and 8. During&#xD;
           laboratory visits, participants will be required to have a single venepuncture blood&#xD;
           sample, assessment of blood pressure/ body composition (skinfold, bioelectrical&#xD;
           impedance, waist circumference), assessment of FATmax, and assessment of fat oxidation&#xD;
           during steady state exercise at FATmax.&#xD;
