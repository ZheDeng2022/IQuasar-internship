    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the difference in genetic profiling of subjects with breast cancer&#xD;
           recurrence&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the comprehensive genetic profiling of subjects with late stage breast&#xD;
           cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the potential biomarkers for early detection and prognosis for breast&#xD;
           cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the genetic profiling of immune system in different subtypes of breast&#xD;
           cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      By integrating and analyzing the data generated using the methods of NGS, these information&#xD;
      can be used for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Understanding the genetic profiling of different subtypes of breast cancer in Taiwan&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assessing the efficacy of different treatments in breast cancer subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Defining the molecular risk factors and predicting the potential risk of breast cancer&#xD;
           recurrence&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assessing the immune repertoire and the potential effects of immunotherapy in breast&#xD;
           cancer subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Developing new strategies in treating patients with triple negative or late stage of&#xD;
           breast cancer&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects aged over 20 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject with confirmed diagnosis of primary invasive breast cancer and is planning to&#xD;
             receive treatments for breast cancer. However, subjects with breast cancer recurrence&#xD;
             at screening will be enrolled if meet both the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Subjects had received surgery for primary breast cancer within 3 years prior to&#xD;
                  screening [i.e. recurrence within 3 years after surgery (mastectomy or BCS)];&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Subjects diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer beyond 3 years after surgery&#xD;
                  (mastectomy or BCS) or who had received or are currently receiving treatments for&#xD;
                  breast cancer. And subjects with primary tumor FFPE tissues available and pass&#xD;
                  the RNA quality check.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance score ≤ 3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy ≥ 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject agrees to provide the written informed consent. If a subject has breast cancer&#xD;
             recurrence within 3 years prior to screening, she will be eligible if she agrees to&#xD;
             provide the paired FFPE tissues (primary and recurrent tumors)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will be excluded if they had primary cancer other than breast cancer within 5&#xD;
             years prior to screening&#xD;
