      The National Heart and Lung Institute determines asthma as a common chronic airway disease&#xD;
      distinguished by variable and reoccurring manifestations, bronchial hypersensitivity,&#xD;
      reducing the flow of air in and out of the lungs and inflammatory reactions with in air&#xD;
      passages in the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Earlier in the first place asthma is also defined as existence of spontaneously reversible&#xD;
      airway obstruction or with treatment and narrowing of airways also increased to different&#xD;
      stimuli i.e. abrupt changes in weather, cold air, histamine, dust, pollen, feathers,&#xD;
      exercise, viral upper respiratory infection, animal dander, cigarette smoke, fungal spores or&#xD;
      respiratory allergens that increases bronchial hypersensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      segmental breathing technique is used for increasing the expansion of chest in individual's&#xD;
      having empyema whose expansion has been decreased. Total 40 individuals with empyema were&#xD;
      included in this study. Chest expansion at three levels have been checked i.e. at axilla&#xD;
      level, at sternum level and at xiphoid level were examined before and after implementation of&#xD;
      segmental exercise technique. Segmental breathing techniques play a major role in expansion&#xD;
      of damaged lungs and as a consequence integral to rehabilitation of Respiratory disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of segmental breathing technique and deep breathing exercise on expansion&#xD;
      of chest and pulmonary function test. The physical therapy treatment comprises of dyspnea&#xD;
      alleviating positions, simple breathing exercises, and exercises for thoracic expansion,&#xD;
      inspiratory muscle training with incentive spirometers. Segmental breathing techniques are&#xD;
      used to give support or enhance expansion of restricted lung in respiratory disorder. This&#xD;
      technique is meant to have an effect on variation of mechanism, involving the stretch reflex&#xD;
      process. Fast stretch on external intercostal muscles brings on assistance in contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intercostal stretching with breathing control exercises might be more effective in enhancing&#xD;
      lung parameters. This may also take part in ventilator capacity like tidal volume, saturation&#xD;
      of oxygen and minute ventilation. Intercostal stretching might have stimulated the receptors&#xD;
      of stretch mechanism in chest wall, hence distend the thoracic cavity which would have&#xD;
      connected to medulla oblongata with nerve cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of buteyko method on control of asthma and quality of living in individuals with&#xD;
      asthma. The buteyko breathing exercise is non-medical method that had shown to be better in&#xD;
      reducing the frequency and seriousness of asthma. The interventional group manifested a&#xD;
      considerable improvement in control of asthma score and quality of living score after four&#xD;
      weeks. The other control group didn't manifest any improvement. This study suggested that&#xD;
      buteyko breathing exercise may upgrade the physical, societal, spiritual and occupational&#xD;
      effect on asthma and improved quality of living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combined effect of buteyko breathing exercise and walking exercise on peak expiratory&#xD;
      flow. The experimental group was specified for the combination of buteyko exercises and&#xD;
      walking exercise for duration of eight weeks, three times per week and of 55 minutes of&#xD;
      training session. The benefit of this technique is hold interval that can decrease overuse of&#xD;
      carbon dioxide (CO2) that will control breath rate with the help of medulla oblongata in&#xD;
      respiratory center, providing Nitric oxide (NO) which particular has bronchodilator effect.&#xD;
      These both exercises minimise inflammatory reaction so that they decrease the sign and&#xD;
      symptoms of asthma.&#xD;
