      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) infection is a complication requiring multiple&#xD;
      hospitalizations, operations, and outpatient visits placing a significant burden on both&#xD;
      patient and treating surgeons. When revision surgery is needed, two kinds of treatment can be&#xD;
      applied----one-stage and two-stage reimplantation procedure. The two-stage reimplantation&#xD;
      procedure is considered the gold standard for treatment of subacute and chronic deep&#xD;
      periprosthetic infections. Placement of antibiotic-loaded spacer is a standard procedure for&#xD;
      eradication of peri-prosthetic joint infection. For better patient outcome, the purpose of&#xD;
      this study was to determine the success rate of total knee infection patients treating with&#xD;
      two-stage reimplantation procedure.&#xD;

      *Background and study aims: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) infection is a devastating&#xD;
      complication requiring multiple hospitalizations, operations, and outpatient visits placing a&#xD;
      significant burden on both patients and treating surgeons. The incidence of prosthetic joint&#xD;
      infection after primary hip or knee arthroplasty is about 2% among the Medicare population.&#xD;
      When revision surgery is needed, two kinds of treatment include one-stage and two-stage&#xD;
      re-implantation procedure can be applied. Bengtsonet al., in an earlier report, evaluated 107&#xD;
      patients with a 75.7% success rate after one-stage revision. In the case of two-stage TKA&#xD;
      revision success rates of 89% to 100% are noted with follow-up periods of 2 to 7.5 years.&#xD;
      Delayed re-implantation after administration of intravenous antibiotics appears to offer&#xD;
      better success rates than direct-exchange techniques. Therefore, the two-stage&#xD;
      re-implantation procedure is considered the gold standard for treatment of subacute and&#xD;
      chronic deep prosthetic joint infections (PJI). However, the protocols of the antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy after resection arthroplasty have varied in different reports. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study will be to evaluate the clinical outcomes of two-stage re-implantation for infected&#xD;
      knee arthroplasty using the standardized protocol of combined parenteral and oral antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy and the criterion for re-implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Study participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period: from March 2011 to June 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Procedures and operations&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The first stage The first stage consisted of the removal of the prosthesis and all hardware,&#xD;
      debridement of all infected and devitalized tissues, removal of all biofilms, and aqueous&#xD;
      povidone iodine irrigation. For primary joint arthroplasty with cement, all the bone cement&#xD;
      was removed. Samples for culture and histology were performed at the time of removal of&#xD;
      prosthesis (ROP). The Long-leg splint was applied to the limb until the next replacement&#xD;
      procedure. The first stage was using antibiotic-impregnated bone cement as a static spacer&#xD;
      block. The types of antibiotic regimens were determined according to the results of cultures&#xD;
      form the preoperative joint aspirations. In this study, 1 to 2 g of vancomycin (for&#xD;
      gram-positive bacteria) and/or 1 to 2 g of ceftazidime (for gram-negative bacteria) per 40g&#xD;
      package of cement would be hand-mixed according to the previous culture. Any past history of&#xD;
      adverse events of the antibiotics used in the cement would be clarified to avoid any possible&#xD;
      allergic reactions to the antibiotic-loaded cement. If the patient had allergic reactions to&#xD;
      vancomycin or ceftazidime, daptomycin or gentamicin 1 to 2 g will be used for alternative&#xD;
      antibiotic cement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients received at least two weeks of intravenous antibiotics after first stage&#xD;
      operation, and then additional 2 to 4 weeks of oral antibiotic therapy according to the&#xD;
      laboratory and culture results performed preoperatively or at the time of the first-stage&#xD;
      procedure. If the cultures revealed certain drug-resistant pathogens, including&#xD;
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis&#xD;
      (especially when the vancomycin MICâ‰§1 mg/L) or vancomycin-resistant enterococci, daptomycin&#xD;
      or linezolid would be selected as the therapy option. Intravenous antibiotic therapy would be&#xD;
      continued until the serum CRP decreased to normal range (less than 1 mg/dL). When the CRP&#xD;
      levels remained normal (&lt; 1 mg/dL), no pathogens were identified from aspirations, and there&#xD;
      were no signs of active infection clinically, the re-implantation surgery would be scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second stage (reimplantation) In the second stage of reimplantation, four sets of&#xD;
           bacterial cultures from different adjacent knee joint tissue (medial and lateral&#xD;
           condyles, patella, and femur-tibia joint space) will be obtained. Prophylactic&#xD;
           antibiotic will be used in the second stage. All patients will be examined clinically at&#xD;
           1st week, 2nd month, 6th month and one year postoperatively at the orthopedic&#xD;
           department. Laboratory tests including complete blood counts (CBC) and differential&#xD;
           counts (D/C), liver alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine (Cre) and CRP will be&#xD;
           performed at each visit. Free of recurrent infection will be defined when the clinical&#xD;
           evaluation of the joint did not show any sign of infection and CRP will be less than 1&#xD;
           mg/dL. Antibiotic therapy, either intravenous or oral form, will be discontinued if&#xD;
           cultures of debridement are sterile. If persistent infection is documented in the&#xD;
           second-stage reimplantation procedure, the patients will be transferred to the medical&#xD;
           ward for an additional 4 to 6 weeks of antibiotics (including intravenous form treatment&#xD;
           at least for 2 weeks) until CRP sustained below 1 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Antibiotic cement In this study, 1-2 g of vancomycin (for gram-positive bacteria) and/or&#xD;
           1-2 g of ceftazidime (for gram-negative bacteria) per 40-g package of cement will be&#xD;
           hand-mixed according to the previous culture identified. Any past history of adverse&#xD;
           events of the antibiotics used in the cement will be clarified to avoid any possible&#xD;
           allergic reactions to the antibiotic-loaded cement. If patient had allergic reactions to&#xD;
           vancomycin or ceftazidime, daptomycin or gentamicin 1-2 g will be used for alternative&#xD;
           antibiotic cement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up Patients will be arranged to follow-up mainly at Orthopedic clinic regularly.&#xD;
           Infectious Disease specialist will be consulted immediately during follow-up if&#xD;
           necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Definition Recurrent and persisted infection Recurrent or persisted infection will be&#xD;
           defined as swelling and pain of the joint with drainage, elevated CRP, persistent&#xD;
           positive culture after two-stage of implantation during follow-up at clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Case record A standard case record form will be used to collect patients' information,&#xD;
           including age, sex, underlying diseases, primary and secondary diagnoses, surgery,&#xD;
           cultures, and the timing of replacement. Complete blood counts, differential counts,&#xD;
           ALT, Creatinine and C-Reactive Protein will be recorded.&#xD;
