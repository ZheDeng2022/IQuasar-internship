  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aim to delineate the effects of the naturally occurring peptide liver-enriched&#xD;
      antimicrobial peptide 2 (LEAP-2) on postprandial glucose metabolism and food intake in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers. The overall objective is to investigate the physiological importance of&#xD;
      LEAP-2 in healthy subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a recent study, the molecular phenotype of enteroendocrine cells in the small intestine&#xD;
      before and after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) surgery in obese individuals was examined.&#xD;
      Enteroendocrine cells were identified and isolated from intestinal biopsies and analysed for&#xD;
      differentially expressed genes by Illumina High Throughput RNA-sequencing. It was discovered&#xD;
      that the gene encoding liver-enriched antimicrobial peptide 2 (LEAP-2), a naturally occurring&#xD;
      peptide in humans, was significantly upregulated compared to baseline expression.&#xD;
      Interestingly, LEAP-2 was recently shown to antagonize ghrelin function in response to&#xD;
      feeding in mice. Moreover, the mature murine LEAP-2 peptide is identical in mice and humans.&#xD;
      Thus, LEAP-2 has been identified as an endogenous peptide that may be able to alter feeding&#xD;
      behaviour and maintenance of glucose levels during calorie restriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that LEAP-2 alters postprandial glucose metabolism and decreases&#xD;
      appetite as well as food intake in relation to a liquid mixed meal and a standardised ad&#xD;
      libitum meal compared with saline (placebo) in healthy subjects.&#xD;
