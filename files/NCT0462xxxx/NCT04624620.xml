  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study team proposes in this pilot to test, in a single-arm mixed-methods study, the&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of the 16 modular classes taught by&#xD;
      a chef, dietitian, and health coach. While the pilot may not have the power to detect&#xD;
      significant change, it will provide preliminary data for a NIH application to further test&#xD;
      this curriculum in a pragmatic, community-based, randomized multi-site Teaching Kitchen&#xD;
      Collaborative Curriculum (TKCC) study planned for Jan 2021 or thereafter. If effective, the&#xD;
      TKCC has potential to impact population health through translation into teaching kitchens&#xD;
      nationally and adaptation to clinic /community settings.&#xD;
