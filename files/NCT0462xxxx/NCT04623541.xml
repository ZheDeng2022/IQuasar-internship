  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial is an open-label, multi-center satefy and efficacy trial of epcoritamab in&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (R/R CLL). The trial consists of two parts,&#xD;
      a dose escalation phase (phase Ib) and an expansion phase (phase II).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the escalation part of the trial is to determine the recommended phase 2 dose&#xD;
      (RP2D) and the maximum tolerated dose (if reached) as well as establish the safety profile of&#xD;
      epcoritamab in patients with R/R CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the expansion part additional patients will be treated with epcoritamab at the RP2D and&#xD;
      the the purpose is to assess and evaluate the preliminary efficacy, safety and tolerability&#xD;
      profiles of epcoritamab at the RP2D.&#xD;
