  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical application value of inverse ratio&#xD;
      ventilation in obese patients during induction of general anesthesia by studying the effect&#xD;
      of inverse ratio ventilation on the safe apnea time.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inverse ratio ventilation(IRV) can produce mean airway pressure(Pmean)similar to external&#xD;
      positive end expiratory pressure(Peep) by increasing inspiratory time. Moreover, the increase&#xD;
      of Pmean was not accompanied by the further increase of peak airway pressure (Ppeak) and&#xD;
      airway plateau pressure (Pplat), while the application of external peep accompanied with the&#xD;
      increase of Pplat increased the risk of barotrauma . High level of Peep increased cardiac&#xD;
      load and decreased cardiac output. A number of studies have found that the hemodynamic&#xD;
      stability of patients can be achieved when IRV regulates the inspiratory / expiratory ratio&#xD;
      in an appropriate range (I: E &lt; 2:1). Therefore, the inverse ratio is considered to be&#xD;
      superior to Peep in terms of gas exchange and respiratory mechanics.&#xD;
