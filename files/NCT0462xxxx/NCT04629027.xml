  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inhibitors of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death ligand 1&#xD;
      (PD-L1) are effective therapies for metastatic NSCLC lacking sensitizing EGFR or ALK&#xD;
      mutations. First-line combination regimens that include a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor may&#xD;
      maximize the chance of response and lead to prolonged survival. PD-L1 expression is the only&#xD;
      validated predictive biomarker for selecting pembrolizumab treatment. However, it is far from&#xD;
      being the ideal biomarker and its role in predicting efficacy from ICPIs remains undefined&#xD;
      due to conflicting results from randomized clinical trials. The selection of patients most&#xD;
      likely to benefit from immunotherapy is crucial in order to avoid exposure to potentially&#xD;
      toxic and ineffective drugs as well as to prevent inappropriate allocation of health&#xD;
      resources. Further studies are clearly needed to better understand the mechanism of action of&#xD;
      immunotherapy in vivo thus allowing the identification of other predictive biomarkers.&#xD;
      Therefore, our research team intends to explore advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated&#xD;
      with immune checkpoint inhibitors, by combining the evaluation criteria of solid tumor&#xD;
      efficacy evaluation criteria (RECIST1.1), clinical pathological characteristics of patients,&#xD;
      and dynamic monitoring of peripheral blood molecular biological markers, finding the&#xD;
      correlation with the efficacy of immunotherapy, establish a detection mode for selecting&#xD;
      patients with clinical benefits.&#xD;
