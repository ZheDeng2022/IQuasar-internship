  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a cross-sectional trial which aims to evaluate the effect of practicing a&#xD;
      physical activity on different domains of the ICF among individuals with an acquired physical&#xD;
      disability. Two different groups of individuals with a spinal cord injury will be enrolled:&#xD;
      one composed of subjects who manage to reach the WHO's recommendations regarding physical&#xD;
      activity, and the other of subjects who do not.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study will recruit participants based on a set of defined eligibility criteria,&#xD;
      in adaptive sports clubs teams and in groups or associations of individuals with an acquired,&#xD;
      and permanent, physical disability. Based on the presence or absence of a regular physical&#xD;
      activity practice undertaken by the subjects who give their consent to participate in the&#xD;
      study, they will be divided into two groups: one where individuals regularly practice a&#xD;
      physical activity, and one where they do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A set of defined outcome measures (detailed in the &quot;Outcome Measures&quot;section) will be&#xD;
      assessed in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes measures will be analysed statistically, using SPSS software. Depending on the&#xD;
      nature of the variables (qualitative or quantitative), different tests will be performed.&#xD;
      Normality will also be verified and will determine which statistical analysis will be carried&#xD;
      out.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain experienced during mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the study, an average of 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>This variable will be measured through a Likert scale out of 5, where greater values show more pain during mobility. Subjects will be asked to rate presence, frequency and intensity of pain felt in the upper-limb when wheeling in their daily environments.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the study, an average of 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>This variable will be measured using a validated questionnaire, &quot;Fatigue Severity scale&quot;. The minimum score is 9, and the maximum is 63. The higher the score, the greater the fatigue severity (= worse outcome for the participant).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Independence in mobility of daily living</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the study, an average of 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>This variable will be measured using the validated &quot;Spinal Cord Independence Measure -mobility&quot;. Minimum score is 0 while maximum score is 40. The higher the score, the better the independence of the participant (=better outcome).</description>

  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Social participation</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the study, an average of 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>This variable will be measured through the validated &quot;Reintegration to Normal Living&quot; index. Minimum score is 0, maximum score is 100. The higher the score, the better the outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life: WHOQOL-BREF</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the study, an average of 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>This variable will be measured through the World Health Organization's 8th version questionnaire, the WHOQOL-BREF. Every one of the 4 domain can obtain a score ranging from 0 (minimum) to 100 (maximum). The higher the score, the greater the quality of life.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>patient's medical history</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the study, an average of 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will ask the subjects to report how many times they were hospitalised in the last six months and how many times they experienced a serious health-complication. We will also ask them how many times per week they receive physiotherapy.</description>
