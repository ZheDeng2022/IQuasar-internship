  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tubercular meningitis occurs in around 10% of those with extrapulmonary tuberculosis and is a&#xD;
      major cause of mortality and morbidity. Inspite of effective Anti-tubercular drugs, still&#xD;
      around 30% of patients develop complications due to arachnoiditis such as spinal tubercular&#xD;
      radiculomyelitis, optico-chiasmatic arachnoiditis, development of new tuberculomas after&#xD;
      starting therapy etc. which are probably immune mediated inflammatory responses due to&#xD;
      paradoxical reaction to ATT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of arachnoiditis is far from satisfactory. High dose methylprednisolone,&#xD;
      intrathecal hyaluronic acid, thalidomide have been tried in small case series and case&#xD;
      reports. However, the results have not been satisfactory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two published reports of cyclophosphamide usage in TBM related vasculitis and&#xD;
      stroke The investigators tried cyclophosphamide in four patients after consent, and found&#xD;
      remarkable improvement in all of them. (Under peer review) In order to test this hypothesis,&#xD;
      a randomized controlled trial is needed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tubercular arachnoiditis occurring as a late complication of TBM is due to immune mediated&#xD;
      reactions and is usually treated with high doses of corticosteroids. In the investigators'&#xD;
      experience patients have received corticosteroids upto a duration of 20-28 months. In such&#xD;
      cases, if the patient is refractory to corticosteroids, it is logical to step up to&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide rather than continuing to give high dose steroids only similar to other&#xD;
      immune mediated conditions such as CIDP, systemic and CNS vasulitis, Lupus nephritis etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide has been used most widely in the management of Lupus nephritis and maximum&#xD;
      experience with the drug has been in this indication. So the dosage and duration of&#xD;
      administration has been adapted from the induction phase dosing schedule of the ACR&#xD;
      guidelines for the management of Lupus nephritis. The guidelines recommend 500 to 1000 mg/m2&#xD;
      BSA of cyclophosphamide. So the investigators decided to use 750 mg/m2 of the drug rounded&#xD;
      off to the higher 50 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathogenesis of tubercular arachnoiditis and Possible mechanism of cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      Tubercular arachnoidiitis is a delayed complication in most cases due to inflammation in the&#xD;
      optochiasmatic, spinal and other cranial nerves leading to neurologic deficits. In such&#xD;
      situations, it is seen that there is an initial improvement in clinical symptoms followed by&#xD;
      deterioration due to enlargement of lesions or appearance of new lesions, especially in&#xD;
      patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis. These new lesions are probably due to immune&#xD;
      mediated mechanisms-it has been seen that in more than 95% of cases are drug sensitive and&#xD;
      corticosteroids are the cornerstone of management of such patients. The complete pathogenesis&#xD;
      of immune medicated tissue injury in tuberculosis has not been elucidated. Various studies&#xD;
      have shown that there is an excess of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including&#xD;
      TNF-alpha and interleukins that lead to recruitment of inflammatory cells and an exhuberant&#xD;
      immune response in patients who develop these complications as compared to those who don't.&#xD;
      There have been studies which have shown genetic polymorphisms in the genes encoding&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines-leading to difference in response to&#xD;
      corticosteroids like LTA4 (Leukotriene- A4 hydrolase) gene. It is also well known that&#xD;
      various immune mediated diseses such as SLE, multiple sclerosis etc are triggered by viruses&#xD;
      and other infections. It is routine practice to treat acute bacterial meninigitis and&#xD;
      tubercular meningitis with dexamethasone, which is again a steroid and immunosuppressant&#xD;
      along with specific antibiotics or anti-tubercular therapy respectively based on evidence&#xD;
      from systematic reviews and meta-analysis. Neurocysticercosis is treated with corticosteroids&#xD;
      and other immunosuppressant medications such as methotrexate as recommended in guidelines,&#xD;
      adalimumab and eternacept used as steroid sparing agents. Various other immune mediated&#xD;
      complications of acute and chronic infections such as dengue myocarditis, ADEM etc are also&#xD;
      treated with immunosuppression including corticosteroids. Lepra reactions in Leprosy are also&#xD;
      treated using steroids, thalidomide, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
      cyclosporine etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent times, the corticosteroid- Dexamethasone has been shown to have mortality benefit&#xD;
      in patients with moderate to severe COVID, proven in a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
      Simliarly, even though there are no RCT data, Tocilizumab, siltuximab and other&#xD;
      immunosuppressant medications have been approved for emergency use based on their efficacy&#xD;
      shown in large case series in COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification for the use of cyclophosphamide this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide is a potent immunosuppressant agent. It is used in Lupus and other immune&#xD;
      mediated conditions and has been shown to be effective in randomized controlled trials in&#xD;
      Lupus nephritis, granulomatous polyangiiitis etc. Though it is widely used off label in&#xD;
      various inflammatory immune mediated neurologic conditions such as CNS vasculitis, CIDP,&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis, autoimmune encephalitis, refractory myasthenia gravis etc, the evidence&#xD;
      for this is basically derived from the rheumatology and nephrology literature. It has to be&#xD;
      emphasized that all the data for immunosuppression with azathioprine, cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
      mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, calcineurin inhibitors in various immune mediated&#xD;
      conditions have been derived from renal transplant/solid organ transplant cohorts, lupus&#xD;
      nephritis cohorts, systemic vasculitis cohorts and inflammatory bowel disease cohorts. The&#xD;
      various guidelines issued by the professional bodies for these conditions form the principles&#xD;
      of treatment of rare conditions such as neuroimmunologic diseases. The major adverse effects&#xD;
      of concern in patients on Cyclophosphamide is the occurrence of life threatening infections&#xD;
      such as tuberculosis. It has been seen that patients on high dose corticosteroids and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide are at higher risk of infection than those on steroids alone or on neither&#xD;
      drug.Though the risk of TB increases with administration of immunosuppressants, the mainstay&#xD;
      of management is early diagnosis and starting appropriate therapy and not cessation of&#xD;
      immunosuppression. In the context of SLE the occurrence of infection is also dependent on&#xD;
      various other factors such as disease activity, previous exposure to tuberculosis etc. The&#xD;
      Americal college of rheumatology guidelines do not say anything on the course of action in&#xD;
      case patients develop infections. There are no professional guidelines for the management of&#xD;
      infections in patients on cyclophosphamide. There are no RCTs on the most appropriate form of&#xD;
      ATT regimens or the modification of immunosuppression in these conditions. There are various&#xD;
      case series and case reports who have been systematically studied infections and their&#xD;
      management including the large prospective EuroLupus cohort. None of these authors advice&#xD;
      complete cessation of immunosuppression in patients who develop infections including&#xD;
      tuberculosis. The guidelines for management of tuberculosis such as British thoracic society&#xD;
      guidelines for the management of TB in CKD,do not suggest cessation of immunosuppression in&#xD;
      post renal transplant patients. The guidelines clearly mention that TB in patients with CKD&#xD;
      have to be treated in same lines of immunocompetent patients, and the anti-tubercular drugs&#xD;
      may need to be given in renal modified doses. In case of tuberculosis risk, it has been shown&#xD;
      by various long term follow up studies that a considerable proportion of patients with latent&#xD;
      TB infections progress to develop active TB post transplantation or after treatment with&#xD;
      immunosuppressants or biologic agents such as anti TNF therapy. In such circumstances, the&#xD;
      guidelines suggest not dropping immunosuppression, but treatment of latent TB or active TB.&#xD;
      The guidelines for the management of active TB in solid organ transplantation suggests early&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis along with increasing the dose of immunosuppressants&#xD;
      such as corticosteroids, cyclosporine or tacrolimus as the ATT regimen containing rifamycins&#xD;
      tend to induce the metabolism of these immunosuppression and trough levels of calcineurin&#xD;
      inhibitors have to be maintained by increasing the dose of cyclosporine or tacrolimus by upto&#xD;
      4-5 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These recommendations are mainly based on a large multicentre cohort of more than 2000&#xD;
      patients derived from 187 publications who had received solid organ transplantation and&#xD;
      developed tuberculosis, where the dose of immunosuppressant drugs had been increased to&#xD;
      maintain adequate blood levels to avoid rejection of the organ graft. Similar recommendations&#xD;
      have been made by the TBNET consensus statement for management of Tuberculosis in transplant&#xD;
      recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of immunosuppression in these cases are mainly based on expert consensus in&#xD;
      other conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthropathy etc. The TBNET consensus&#xD;
      statement also says that in case the organ is not vital or the infection is life threatening,&#xD;
      it may be considered to reduce the level of immunosuppression. The guidelines for the use of&#xD;
      anti TNF-α therapy is clearer in this aspect. While the occurrence of active TB during anti&#xD;
      TNF-α therapy warrants withholding (NOT cessation) of immunosuppression, it may be re started&#xD;
      2 months after ATT the if patients demonstrate a favorable response to anti-TB therapy and&#xD;
      require early resumption of anti TNF therapy.The BTS guidelines suggest that if active TB was&#xD;
      diagnosed prior to starting of &quot;Anti-TNF-α therapy, treatment should not be commenced for at&#xD;
      least 2 months after antituberculosis treatment with full compliance has begun, supervised by&#xD;
      a thoracic physician orinfectious disease specialist, and until the drug susceptibility&#xD;
      profile of the organism in those with positive cultures is known, as a minimum.&quot; However, if&#xD;
      the patient develops TB while on anti TNF therapy the anti-TNF-α treatment can be continued&#xD;
      if clinically indicated because the patient would otherwise be prevented from receiving the&#xD;
      continued clinical benefit to their underlying disease and may have a flare up or major&#xD;
      clinical deterioration. The rationale provided by these guidelines is that HIV positive&#xD;
      individuals with reduced CD4 counts and clinical TB, who are even more immunosuppressed than&#xD;
      those on anti-TNF-a treatment, respond just as well to TB treatment as those who are HIV&#xD;
      negative. Taking that logic forward, it may be reasonable to start therapy with&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide three months after starting standard Anti tubercular therapy in patients&#xD;
      with tubercular meningitis who have shown clearcut improvement followed by deterioration due&#xD;
      to development of arachnoiditis and paradoxical immune responses.&#xD;
