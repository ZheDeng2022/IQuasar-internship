    <textblock>
      The investigators will develop and evaluate a community-based participatory intervention that&#xD;
      will be principally guided by the model we test and confirm in Aim 1. To meet this second&#xD;
      aim, ten guardian consultants will co-develop and co-implement a group intervention whose&#xD;
      goal is to increase 100 guardians' recognition and knowledge of CAMH problems, perceived need&#xD;
      for CAMH services, and willingness to use accessible services at UCH. The investigators will&#xD;
      also evaluate the process of developing, planning, and administering a CBP intervention in&#xD;
      Nigeria and draw broader implications for CBP programming in other LMICs.&#xD;

      One hundred participants will be randomly recruited from the cohort of guardians who&#xD;
      completed the interview in Phase 1 and expressed interest in participating in an&#xD;
      intervention. The investigators will use a switching replication design in which fifty&#xD;
      guardians will be randomly assigned using a lottery to receive the intervention and fifty&#xD;
      will be assigned to a group who will receive the intervention at a later time point.127 The&#xD;
      latter group will serve as a control in the first part of the intervention plan, and the&#xD;
      roles will be switched in the second part. The investigators will initially propose 4&#xD;
      intervention sessions, each comprised of 2 meetings, lasting 1.5 hours each for 25 guardians.&#xD;
      Two sessions will be conducted concurrently for Group 1 (n=50) followed by 2 sessions&#xD;
      concurrently conducted for Group 2 (n=50). The program outcomes - guardian recognition and&#xD;
      knowledge of CAMH problems, the perceived need for CAMH services, and willingness to use&#xD;
      accessible CAMH services - will be measured with the same instruments administered in Aim 1&#xD;

    <description>This was assessed by the Yorùbá version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire - Parent Report (SDQ-P; Goodman, Ford, Simmons; Gatward, &amp; Meltzer, 2000), a 25-item screening measure of emotional and behavioral problems for children aged 3 to 17-years extensively used in Africa (Hoosen et al., 2018). The SDQ-P utilized a three-point Likert scale (0=not true; 1=somewhat true; 2= certainly true). Five subscales were derived from the measure including conduct problems, inattention-hyperactivity, emotional symptoms, peer problems, and prosocial behavior. A total score was calculated by summing the subscales with higher scores indicating more recognition of CAMH problems (range= 0 - 50).</description>

    <description>Adapted from the 2001 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs in the United States (Porterfield &amp; McBride, 2007), we asked caregivers: &quot;Has there been a time in past year when your child/ any of your children (1) seemed sad and did not feel like doing anything over 2 weeks (yes/no)?; (2) not able to sit still or concentrate for long, always getting into trouble (yes/no)?; (3) displayed strange public behavior such as talking or laughing to themselves when no one is around (yes/no)?; (4) behaved in any way or reported feeling anyway that worried them, you, or others in your family or community?&quot; If caregivers affirmed any of the 4 statements, they were subsequently asked: &quot;During the past 12 months, was there any time when your child needed help because you were worried about the problems you just described? (yes/no)&quot; Responses to the final question (0=no; 1=yes) was used to determine perceived need of CAMH services.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Willingness to use accessible CAMH services</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Caregivers' willingness to use accessible mental health service was adapted from a study examining child mental health service utilization among parents in rural Appalachia (S. L. Williams &amp; Polaha, 2014). Caregivers were asked &quot;If my child experienced a mental health condition such as Dapo, Tola, and Moji [fictional characters with depression, ADHD, and psychosis in a previously administered section], I would take my child to see a healthcare provider at the mental health clinic for children and adolescents at UCH&quot; (1 = Not at All, 6=Definitely).</description>
