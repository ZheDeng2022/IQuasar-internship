  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The burnout phenomenon first came to clinical science 50 years ago. It is exponentially&#xD;
      rising worldwide which prompted its discoverers to develop the most popular tool for its&#xD;
      assessment, known as the Maslach burnout inventory (MBI)1. Common symptoms of burnout include&#xD;
      depression, irritability, and insomnia. The growing demand for extra-corporeal membrane&#xD;
      oxygenation (ECMO) may have an effect on burnout as the newly introduced services is&#xD;
      demanding in effort and put the practitioners on complex ethical and administrative&#xD;
      situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study using a combined methodological quantitative&#xD;
      and qualitative approach involving a convenience sample of 1000 healthcare practitioners&#xD;
      within surgical and medical ICUs of Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), Qatar. We will use used&#xD;
      two main instruments to develop an online questionnaire: - The MBI-human service survey&#xD;
      (MBI-HSS) and the Leadership scale Expectations: we expect that we will have a new insight&#xD;
      about the impact of these complex interventions on practitioner's burnout.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study predominates at investigating the BOS in ECMO ICU and non-ECMO ICU, and whether&#xD;
      the leadership attitude could have effect on the mentioned syndrome problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Settings This study will in a tertiary hospital in the Middle East &quot;Hamad Medical&#xD;
      Corporation&quot; as a main centre, the study will be disseminated an online survey among other&#xD;
      centres who will agree to participate on. The participants will be screened for&#xD;
      socio-demographic data such as age, gender, profession, marital state, education, native&#xD;
      country, years of experience, weekly working hours and salary. The questionnaire was&#xD;
      clarified to the potential respondents in order to clear any poor understanding. English used&#xD;
      as the official language in the organization; translation of the used instruments to&#xD;
      individual mother languages is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Cross-sectional descriptive survey with purposeful sampling. Mixed qualitative and&#xD;
      quantitative methodology used in this dissertation. Invitations to participate through the&#xD;
      mail, anonymous questionnaire survey will be presented to the staff members including&#xD;
      physicians, nurses and respiratory therapists who work as full time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Study Population and Study Setting/ Location In this section describe the study population&#xD;
      that is to be enrolled in the study, planned recruitment number and Inclusion and Exclusion&#xD;
      Criteria to be listed here. Also list the Hospitals in which this study will be conducted (&#xD;
      e.g. HGH, Rumailah etc) The study population would include physicians, nurses, and&#xD;
      respiratory therapists working in ICUs. The inclusion criteria will include practitioners&#xD;
      working in intensive care unit including physician, respiratory therapists and nurses who&#xD;
      agree to participate in the survey. We will exclude practitioners who decline to participate&#xD;
      and who will not complete the questionnaires. A flow diagram will be prepared for the&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be approached through communication with one representative within the&#xD;
      assigned ICUs within Qatar, in case of agreement we will ask for a list of mails from each&#xD;
      department to be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted for 12 months from the time of ethical approval. Instrumentation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The used instrumentation is questionnaire that is divided into the following sections:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Condition of work effectiveness questionnaire (CWEQ): This scale consisted of 19 items&#xD;
      developed by Kanter, (1977) measured by a 5-point Likert type response. (9) B) Maslach&#xD;
      Burnout Inventory human services survey (MBI-HSS): The scale is a standardized instrument to&#xD;
      measure burnout it utilize 9 items related to emotional exhaustion and it is most frequently&#xD;
      used in health care researches, the nine items are calculated to get the whole score, scores&#xD;
      of 27 and more signals severe burnout. (10) The percentage of high degree of burnout was used&#xD;
      for advanced analysis. We will get permission to use this scale from (Mindgarden.com, USA) C)&#xD;
      Leadership Behaviours scale (LS): The staff discernment of managers' leadership attitude will&#xD;
      be measured using the 11 item Manager Action Scale. (11)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires will be submitted in English form; no need for translation, as health care&#xD;
      practitioners in the organization, must practice English that is the official language at&#xD;
      workplace. The results of the analysis will be presented using descriptive methods. The&#xD;
      quantitative and qualitative data will be analysed statistically, the relations between the&#xD;
      variables will be interpreted, the relation between burnout score and socio-demographic&#xD;
      variables, occupational stress score, and empowerment scale will be assessed statistically&#xD;
      using (t-test, analysis of variance, correlation efficient and regression).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant identity kept confidential, final report would not contain any identity.&#xD;
      Comprehensive explanation for the participants about the questionnaires, the type, purpose of&#xD;
      the study and outcome was done, early rejection, or late withdrawal was permissive. Ethical&#xD;
      approval was obtained according to the corporate regulations. The ethical consent attached&#xD;
      after being approval from the medical research centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health care practitioners working on ICU whether providing ECMO services or not will be&#xD;
      eligible to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective will be to detect the prevalence of burnout among health care&#xD;
      practitioner s working in ICU with ECMO services The secondary objectives will be to compare&#xD;
      the burnout association in ECMO and non ECMO ICU, the effect of leadership attitude on&#xD;
      burnout syndrome and to look at the burnout in special population within the groups like&#xD;
      respiratory therapists&#xD;
