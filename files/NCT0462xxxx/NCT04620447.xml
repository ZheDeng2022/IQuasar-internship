      Objective: To take the existing VR technology to the next level, the investigators developed&#xD;
      a novel Intelligent Virtual Reality Therapy System (IVRTS). The objective of this project had&#xD;
      three aspects: Namely, development of the novel IVRTS technology involving the development of&#xD;
      a hardware device, development of Artificially Intelligent Psychotherapeutic&#xD;
      software-interface and testing it's clinical efficacy. Methods: It used a two-phased&#xD;
      methodology; Development of the novel technology and testing its Clinical Efficacy. After&#xD;
      development of Novel IVRTS. A 7-week intervention was designed for each subject. The sample&#xD;
      of 500 patients, meeting the criteria of Acrophobia and Anxiety, underwent the interventions&#xD;
      at The GTB hospital (The University of Delhi), for a total 3500 sessions, ranging 5250 hours&#xD;
      for over 2 years. The subjects were randomly divided into 4 groups: IVRTS Group, Mindfulness&#xD;
      group, CBT group and Control Group. The ethics committee and clinical trial registration&#xD;
      number is 33011. Development of this technology would be a land-mark innovation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many researchers have proved the usefulness of Virtual Reality Technology in the treatment of&#xD;
      Psychological Disorders, and many studies have quoted efficacy of the treatment as well. The&#xD;
      research in the VR field is progressing but still is at a very nascent stage10. However,&#xD;
      despite some VR projects being worked upon in the current times, the technology is not being&#xD;
      used widely, due to its limited proven efficacy. The current VR technology that exists is&#xD;
      only limited to placing a patient in his or her phobic situation virtually and not beyond&#xD;
      that. In this current project the investigators attempted to fill this gap by using two&#xD;
      important novel technological developments. Firstly, the investigators moved beyond just the&#xD;
      visual imaging and added haptic touch sensors as well as motion sensors to the device.&#xD;
      Secondly, the investigators developed an automated intelligent interactive Psychotherapy&#xD;
      software to compliment the virtual reality as a part of the device and finally the&#xD;
      investigators tested its clinical efficacy to make sure the novel technology is effective.&#xD;
      When the world is sitting on the verge of a Mental Health Crisis due to the global pandemic.&#xD;
      The investigators need to revolutionize the Psychotherapy modality for two reasons, first&#xD;
      being, the shortage of Mental Health Professionals compared the anticipated cases that would&#xD;
      need help due to this unique global condition and secondly accessibility. When social&#xD;
      isolation has become the norm for prevention, one needs innovative tools to be able to&#xD;
      effectively handle the situation sitting at home, and yet be equally effective, if not more.&#xD;
      This is the dire need of the society today and the project has immense potential as well has&#xD;
      huge social impact for the treatment of Anxiety Disorders which currently effects 80% of the&#xD;
      world population according to the World Health Organization, which is predicted to grow&#xD;
      further due to the current global pandemic. The development of this novel technology would&#xD;
      reduce the cost of treatment of Anxiety disorders, PTSD and Phobias considerably, which would&#xD;
      make interventions viable for people across the world currently not being able to afford long&#xD;
      term Psychological sessions. It would also reduce the treatment time by approximately half.&#xD;
      It would make the accessibility of treatment widely available and more comfortable for the&#xD;
      masses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current Virtual Reality technology to treat Anxiety phobias and general stress was at a&#xD;
      very nascent stage, where a subject was immersed into phobic situation and is expected to get&#xD;
      stage-wise comfortable with it. The current existing Virtual Reality technology to treat&#xD;
      phobia is still relatively new and lacks both theoretical and clinical research. VR&#xD;
      applications need to go beyond only immersing the person into a phobic situation. This&#xD;
      proposed research &amp; development project aimed to integrate complex and proven effective&#xD;
      psychotherapies (visual, auditory, interactive, kinesthetic, motion sensing and tactile),&#xD;
      automated, intelligent and integrated with the Virtual Reality Technology, which the subject&#xD;
      or patient will be able to control and undergo themselves, then it's initial clinical&#xD;
      efficacy was examined. Keller and Bunnel explain, Virtual Reality being a technological&#xD;
      system helps subjects to experience computer and machine generated situations in lab&#xD;
      settings. The technology is being widely utilized in Psychological treatment and research.&#xD;
      Rizzo, mentions that people totally experience Virtual reality when it mimics real life at&#xD;
      the highest possible level and the users start believing that the situation simulates the&#xD;
      real actual world experience that it is recreating. This project developed new technology,&#xD;
      devices, and intelligent psychotherapeutic software programs in VR for curing phobias,&#xD;
      anxiety, stress and even stress management. The current technology in this field that existed&#xD;
      is only at a level of immersing a subject in a realistic VR image/scene and is not beyond&#xD;
      that. Currently, this technology was not useful in the treatment, and that is the reason had&#xD;
      not entered widely in clinical settings yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To take this technology to the next level, one needed to develop a novel VR&#xD;
      technology/device, which is intelligent, as well as which would interact and stimulate &quot;Whole&#xD;
      brain activation&quot; and help the subject overcome phobia/stress/anxiety effectively. This&#xD;
      required developing a device which had motion sensors, interactive sensors which allowed the&#xD;
      subject to feel and interact with the image, scenario, program real- time and other&#xD;
      psychotherapeutic intelligent technological hardware components and intelligent interactive&#xD;
      psychotherapeutic software programs fostering this process, all built in one integrated&#xD;
      compact device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the main components of this project included -Hardware, software, system&#xD;
      interfaces and data. The data being collected by the wireless sensor contains information&#xD;
      about the health status of the user is stored in a database. Health status data included&#xD;
      information about blood pressure, heart rate and other physiological parameters as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is aimed to develop both hardware and software technology and finally test its&#xD;
      clinical efficacy to treat Phobias, General Anxiety, Stress and PTSD. According to the DSM 5&#xD;
      published by the American Psychiatry Association, specific phobias are associated with fear&#xD;
      or Anxiety attached to a specific situation or Object Like water, animals, animals, public&#xD;
      speaking, needles, heights, blood etc. DSM Also defines Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) as&#xD;
      a condition in which a person Feels intrusive, excessive, and persistent worrying to the&#xD;
      extent that daily functioning becomes difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety and Stress is becoming a global epidemic, The World Health Organization, estimates&#xD;
      that 1 in 3 from Clinical Anxiety and 1 in 5 individuals are suffering from Clinical&#xD;
      Depression. About 80% of the world is suffering from general stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is said that situation improves with pumping in of resources and putting in efforts; but&#xD;
      in this situation despite putting in huge funds, highest quality of resources, the best human&#xD;
      minds and fierce efforts, the problem is only increasing. The development of this novel&#xD;
      technology will be a landmark step towards the intervention of these conditions the world is&#xD;
      battling in present times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOVELTY OF THE PROJECT&#xD;
&#xD;
      The approach of the Novel Intelligent Software interface approaches follows the basic premise&#xD;
      that human beings think in terms of images rather than words. While the existing modes of&#xD;
      treatment for phobias rely mainly on talk therapies and counseling; This novel intelligent&#xD;
      software treatment methodology deals with the development of VR programs integrated with&#xD;
      hardware for simulating various phobia-inducing situations, followed by novel automated&#xD;
      integrated most effective psychotherapy; altering these images to reduce the anxiety&#xD;
      experienced. Our treatment package includes a VR device integrated with easily comprehensible&#xD;
      voice commands, along with a user manual and easy user interface, thereby reducing the effort&#xD;
      of training required for operating the device. The framework is a combination of the therapy&#xD;
      methodologies with VR, motion sensors, biofeedback and fNIRS. This would eliminate the need&#xD;
      for a therapist by making the patient self-sufficient in handling the overall treatment&#xD;
      themselves. In the long run, this would prove to be more cost-effective and socially&#xD;
      accessible.&#xD;
