  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the leading female cancer in metropolitan France in terms of incidence and&#xD;
      death. Among the therapeutic arsenal for the treatment of these cancers, surgery plays a very&#xD;
      important role and even if a conservative treatment is possible in the majority of cases,&#xD;
      there is still an indication for mastectomy in about 30% of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, only 30% of women who have undergone a mastectomy choose reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of breast reconstruction from a surgical point of view is to leave as&#xD;
      few aesthetic and functional after-effects as possible while meeting the personal wishes of&#xD;
      each woman according to her morphological, tissue and vascular characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently 2 major surgical procedures for breast reconstruction: breast implant&#xD;
      reconstructions and autologous reconstructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast reconstruction by prosthesis is the simplest and most widely used technique but, the&#xD;
      controversies concerning implants with the PIP breast prostheses scandal in 2010 and more&#xD;
      recently the anaplastic lymphoma scandal have tarnished the image of this type of&#xD;
      reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternatives to breast implants have been developed: autologous reconstructions using first&#xD;
      pedicled tissue flaps, then free flaps, techniques that allow a more natural, more&#xD;
      satisfactory aesthetic result with an evolution that follows the patient's own morphology but&#xD;
      requiring specific training in microsurgery and not without postoperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 1999, the investigators have witnessed the evolution of another autologous technique,&#xD;
      that of lipomodulin. Initially used to improve the results of reconstructions and the&#xD;
      aesthetic sequelae of conservative treatments, it is now used as an exclusive reconstruction&#xD;
      technique. Easily reproducible and offering several advantages, reconstruction by exclusive&#xD;
      lipomodulin is increasingly appreciated by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, this increasingly practiced technique presents specific problems and this is what&#xD;
      the investigators want to evaluate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the practices within our establishment&#xD;
      regarding breast reconstruction by exclusive lipomodulin in terms of feasibility. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives are the evaluation of the cosmetic result and the quality of life of&#xD;
      these patients after this type of reconstruction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, monocentric study using retrospective health data (2012-2020)&#xD;
      combined with quality of life questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The list of patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be collected using the Medical&#xD;
      Information Department. Based on a screening of aggregate data from the center, the sample&#xD;
      size is approximately 150 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires will be mailed to patients during a follow-up site visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The WHOQOL-BRIEF&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The EXCLUFAT questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The questionnaire to be completed by a third party. A phone call will be made to explain&#xD;
           the principle of the study and answer any questions they may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The returned questionnaires will be analyzed. Other necessary data will be collected in the&#xD;
      patients' computer files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no provision for patient follow-up.&#xD;
