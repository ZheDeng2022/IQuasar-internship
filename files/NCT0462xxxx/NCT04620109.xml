      A Phase 1 randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled, single dose escalation (SDE) and&#xD;
      repeat dose escalation (RDE) study to evaluate safety and tolerability, and PK of KDR2-2 in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers. The planned single dose levels are 0.03, 0.06, 0.12, and 0.24 mg/eye, and&#xD;
      repeat dose levels are 0.06, 0.12, and 0.24 mg/eye, QID, × 6 days (one dose in the morning on&#xD;
      Day 7). Subjects are randomized to KDR2-2 or placebo dosing (6:2 for SDE, or 8:2 for RDE) in&#xD;
      each cohorts of relative dosing levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled, single dose and repeat dose&#xD;
      escalation study to evaluate safety and tolerability, and PK of KDR2-2 in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will include a screening period, a treatment period, and a follow-up period of 7&#xD;
      days for single dose escalation (SDE) or repeat dose escalation (RDE) after last&#xD;
      administration. The screening period will be up to 28 days prior to investigational product&#xD;
      administration. The screening process will initiate upon completion of the informed consent&#xD;
      process. Once consent is provided by each participant, a thorough screening process will take&#xD;
      place, including detailed medical history, physical examination and ophthalmology&#xD;
      examination, vital signs, concomitant medications, safety labs, 12 lead electrocardiogram,&#xD;
      serum pregnancy test, urinalysis, serology panel, assessment of inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Upon completion of the screening, qualified subjects will be randomized to KDR2-2&#xD;
      or placebo (6:2 for SDE, or 8:2 for RDE). Each enrolled subject will receive one single or&#xD;
      repeat assigned dose of KDR2-2 or placebo. The investigator and subjects will be blinded to&#xD;
      treatment assignment. During the study, subjects will be evaluated for safety and&#xD;
      tolerability, and PK of KDR2-2. In each cohort, a sentinel group of two subjects will be&#xD;
      dosed first: one sentinel with KDR2-2, and the other with the placebo. The remaining subjects&#xD;
      of the same cohort will be dosed at least 24 hours after sentinel dosing with approval from&#xD;
      the principal investigator upon assessing the sentinel group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KDR2-2 or placebo will be topically administered in the right eye as a single or repeat&#xD;
      instillation on Day 1. Subjects will have end-of-study (EOS) follow-up visits on Day 8 (±1)&#xD;
      for SDE or Day 15 (±1) for RDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned single dose levels are 0.03, 0.06, 0.12, and 0.24 mg/eye, and repeat dose levels&#xD;
      are 0.06, 0.12, and 0.24 mg/eye, QID, × 6 days (one dose in the morning on Day 7). The&#xD;
      Starting dose of KDR2-2 in repeat dose escalation stage will be at least 2 dose levels below&#xD;
      the highest single dose level shown to be safe, for example, if 0.24 mg is proven to be safe&#xD;
      during SDE, the starting dose during RDE will be 0.06 mg. Other higher dose level(s) might be&#xD;
      optional based on emerging data from this study.&#xD;

             FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed)&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. History of significant alcohol abuse within one year prior to screening or regular use&#xD;
             of alcohol within six months prior to the screening visit (more than fourteen units of&#xD;

             amphetamine derivatives) within 1 year prior to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Positive urine drug screen, cotinine test, or alcohol breath test at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Any reason which, in the opinion of the Investigator and Monitor, would prevent the&#xD;
             subject from participating in the study.&#xD;
