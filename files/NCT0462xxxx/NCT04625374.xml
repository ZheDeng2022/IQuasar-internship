  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective for investigators is to determine the prevalence of moderate to severe&#xD;
      chronic pain in the adult population 6 months after consultation in the emergency department&#xD;
      for acute pain (less than 7 days old) and severe pain assessed at admission and defined as&#xD;
      greater than or equal to 6/10 by the numerical pain scale.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The presence of pain is the most frequent reason for a patient to visit the emergency&#xD;
      department. the investigators know that severe acute pain can be a risk factor for developing&#xD;
      chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic pain is a symptom, devoid of biological utility, that persists despite the absence of&#xD;
      nociceptive stimulus, even after a reasonable period of time that would have allowed the&#xD;
      tissue lesion to heal. It is therefore a public health problem with a negative impact on&#xD;
      patients' lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic pain has been studied in anesthesia and surgery in recent years. In 2006, a study&#xD;
      showed the appearance of chronic pain (incidence between 10-50%) in patients who had&#xD;
      undergone routine surgery. On the other hand, few studies have looked at the occurrence of&#xD;
      chronic pain in patients who came to the emergency department for acute pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is in this context that the investigators find it relevant to assess the prevalence of&#xD;
      moderate to severe chronic pain after an emergency department consultation for severe acute&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physiological mechanisms of pain are better identified and the activation of&#xD;
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors contributes to the onset of hyperalgesia. These&#xD;
      receptors are activated under certain conditions, such as during intense and prolonged pain&#xD;
      or exposure to high doses of opioids. In addition, the hyperalgesic effect of opioids is&#xD;
      known and widely described in the literature. Finally, in the perioperative period, it is now&#xD;
      accepted that the administration of a low dose of ketamine can combat these hyperalgesic&#xD;
      effects thanks to its NMDA receptor inhibitory action. This effect may have an impact on pain&#xD;
      at six months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of these data, it seems relevant to question the prevalence of chronic pain in&#xD;
      the course of an emergency department consultation, all the more so in patients with severe&#xD;
      initial pain, in whom there is an initial indication for morphine titration, based on the&#xD;
      recommendations of the French Society of Emergency Medicine (SFMU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators need to question the effects of initial analgesia administered&#xD;
      in the emergency department for patients with severe acute pain. Is there a link between the&#xD;
      use of certain molecules or the combination of molecules on the onset of chronic pain?&#xD;
