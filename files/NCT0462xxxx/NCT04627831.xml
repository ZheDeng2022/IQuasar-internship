      The purpose of this trial is to demonstrate a reduction in the incidence of contrast-induced&#xD;
      acute kidney injury (CI-AKI), also known as contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN), and the&#xD;
      equivalence of image quality following administration of Captisol-Enabled™-Iohexol&#xD;
      (CE-Iohexol) Injection compared to Omnipaque™(Iohexol) Injection in patients with impaired&#xD;
      renal function undergoing invasive coronary angiography.&#xD;
