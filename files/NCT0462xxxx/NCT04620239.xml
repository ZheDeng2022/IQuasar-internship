    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3, open label, single arm study of padeliporfin in the treatment of Upper&#xD;
      Tract Urothelial Carcinoma (UTUC). The ENLIGHTED study will recruit patients with low-grade&#xD;
      non-invasive upper tract urothelial carcinoma in either the kidney or the ureter. Patients&#xD;
      will be treated with padeliporfin VTP in two phases: an Induction Treatment Phase and a&#xD;
      Maintenance Treatment Phase and will be followed up for up to an additional 48 months in the&#xD;
      long term (non intervention) follow up phase with the specific duration depending on the&#xD;
      patient's response to treatment&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Induction Treament Phase: Patients entered in the study will undergo an induction treatment&#xD;
      phase consisting of 1-3 padeliporfin VTP treatments provided 4 weeks (28 +/-3 days) apart.&#xD;
      The goal of this induction treatment phase will be to achieve Complete Response (CR) in the&#xD;
      involved ipsilateral tract system. During this phase, patients will be treated with&#xD;
      padeliporfin VTP to visually identified tumor sites in the calyces, renal pelvis and/or&#xD;
      ureter and subsequently examined endoscopically at 28 +/- 3 days post treatment to determine&#xD;
      whether the treatment was successful. If CR is not achieved, an additional two treatments of&#xD;
      padeliporfin VTP are permitted 28 +/- 3 days apart for a total of up to 3 treatments during&#xD;
      the induction treatment phase. The Primary Response Evaluation (PRE) will be performed 28 +/-&#xD;
      3 days after the last VTP treatment, to determine if the treatment was successful at&#xD;
      achieving CR defined as: absence of visible tumor on endoscopy, negative urinary cytology by&#xD;
      instrumented collection, and no evidence of tumor on biopsy (if feasible). Patients&#xD;
      undergoing extirpative surgery of any part of the ipsilateral kidney or ureter for&#xD;
      indications related to urothelial cancer will be considered as no longer having CR. If CR is&#xD;
      not achieved after 3 treatments with padeliporfin VTP the treatment will be considered&#xD;
      unsuccessful and the patient will be discontinued from the Treatment Phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance Treatment Phase: Patients achieving CR at the induction treatment phase will be&#xD;
      allowed into the maintenance treatment phase of the study. The patients will then be followed&#xD;
      over a period of 12 months post PRE, to assess the duration of response and its safety, and&#xD;
      to provide planned maintenance treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated maintenance VTP treatments during this period will be provided for patients who show&#xD;
      evidence of tumor recurrence that is deemed treatable as defined by the following criteria:&#xD;
      low-grade tumors with the largest tumor (index tumor) betwen 5 mm and 15 mm in diameter, in&#xD;
      up to 2 anatomical locations in the calyces, renal pelvis or the ureter with ureter&#xD;
      involvement in one anatomical location with no more than 20 mm of contiguous ureteral&#xD;
      length). Patients with treatable tumor recurrence post Induction Treatment Phase would be&#xD;
      considered as no longer having 'complete response in the entire ipsilateral kidney' and time&#xD;
      to recurrence will be recorded. Patients undergoing extirpative surgery of any part of the&#xD;
      ipsilateral kidney or ureter for indications related to urothelial cancer will be considered&#xD;
      as no longer having CR and time to this event will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long Term Follow-up Phase: Patients completing the 12 months of the maintenance treatment&#xD;
      phase of the study, could be followed for an additional 48 months to monitor for disease&#xD;
      related outcomes and VTP treatment related adverse events with the specific duration&#xD;
      depending on the patient's response to treatment. No additional padeliporfin VTP treatment&#xD;
      will be administered during this phase. Patients completing the maintenance phase of the&#xD;
      study who are in CR in V3 will undergo additional assessments 18 and 24 months (+/- 1 month)&#xD;
      post-PRE and annually thereafter and for up to 5 years post PRE or until recurrence,&#xD;
      progression, death or loss to follow up, to document safety and ongoing response.&#xD;
