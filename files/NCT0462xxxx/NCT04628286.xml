  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to determine the effectiveness of myofascial induction effects on&#xD;
      stabilometric variables. Forty healthy subjects will be recruited for a single blind clinical&#xD;
      trial. All subjects will be randomly distributed into two different groups: control group&#xD;
      (simulated laser) and experimental group (myofascial induction). Result measurements will be&#xD;
      performed in the center of the pressure area (stabilometry) using a validated platform. Two&#xD;
      trials will be recorded for each condition (eyes closed and eyes open)&#xD;

    <description>Stabilometry assessment was used and subjects were instructed to stand barefoot on the force platform, participants were instructed to remain in a relaxed standing posture with feet shoulder-width apart and positioned at 30º from the midline. Stabilometric variables measure the displacement of the center of pressures in X (in millimeters) with the eyes open.</description>
