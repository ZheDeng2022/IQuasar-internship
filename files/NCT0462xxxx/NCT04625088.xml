  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed clinical trial is a controlled study of n=24 healthy adult individuals tested in&#xD;
      both the Meal-Induced Insulin Sensitization (MIS) state and, following atropine blockade,&#xD;
      Absence of Meal-Induced Insulin Sensitization (AMIS) state to differentiate the postprandial&#xD;
      glycemia, insulinemia, triglyceride and Hepatic Insulin Sensitizing Substance (HISS) levels&#xD;
      in the two states.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is the identification and development of biometric markers which&#xD;
      incorporate the actions and interplay between insulin and HISS. Overall, the study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Utilize a standardized test meal to detect one of the earliest pathologies present&#xD;
           during the development of insulin resistance, pre-diabetes and obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare the control (HISS positive) and post-atropine (HISS negative) tests with the&#xD;
           acute consequences of absence of MIS (AMIS) being graphically shown over 4 hours of&#xD;
           postprandial nutrient partitioning, tracking the full metabolomic dynamic pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To establish values for potential indices (bio-impedance, hand-grip strength,&#xD;
           spirometry) in young, fit, lean individuals. These values will be used as baselines for&#xD;
           comparative analysis in future clinical trials employing individuals with various&#xD;
           degrees of insulin resistance to full Type 2 Diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Demonstrate that these biometric markers can differentiate between the HISS positive and&#xD;
           HISS negative post-meal state with the future aim of using the biomarkers for the&#xD;
           detection of early prediabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve 4 study visits: Visit 1 - Prescreening; Visit 2 - Screening; Visit 3 -&#xD;
      Liquid test meal administration and postprandial blood collection; Visit 4 - Atropine&#xD;
      administration + Liquid test meal administration and postprandial blood collection.&#xD;
