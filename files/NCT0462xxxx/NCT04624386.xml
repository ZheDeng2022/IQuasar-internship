    <textblock>
      Thiol disulfide levels will be determined using venous blood samples from pre- and&#xD;
      postmenopausal women to evaluate oxidative stress in menopause. Furthermore, oxidative stress&#xD;
      will be assessed according to age, and years since the start of menopause. Also, whether the&#xD;
      presence of menopause related osteoporosis has any association with oxidative stress will be&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 77 subjects are divided into two groups: study group (postmenopausal women) and&#xD;
      control group premenopausal women). Biometric data such as age, bmi, obstetric anamnesis,&#xD;
      history of komorbidities, PAP smear results are recorded. Mammography results, dexa scores of&#xD;
      post menopausal women are also obtained. Venous blood samples from all subjects are&#xD;
      collected. Thiol disulfide levels will be determined from serum samples. Thiol disulfide&#xD;
      levels will first be compared between the study and the control group in order to determine&#xD;
      the oxidative stress in menopause. In secondary evaluation years of menopause, age, and dexa&#xD;
      scores will be included.&#xD;

        Women within 30-75 years of age were recruited to this study. Premenapusal healthy women&#xD;
        who visited the clinic for routine gynecological control were included in the control&#xD;
        group. Postmenopausal women older than 45 years of age who entered menopause as a natural&#xD;
        process were included in the study group.&#xD;

        A total of 43 subjects were included in the study group and 34 subjects were included in&#xD;
