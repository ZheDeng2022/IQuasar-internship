  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical study will compare two lubricated polyurethane male condoms of different&#xD;
      thickness with a marketed lubricated control male condom made of natural rubber latex. This&#xD;
      crossover study will randomize 300 heterosexual couples to the sequence in which they use&#xD;
      five condoms of each of the three study condom types. The clinical failure (breakage and&#xD;
      slippage) rates of the two polyurethane condoms will be compared to the clinical failure&#xD;
      (breakage and slippage) rate of commercial natural rubber latex control condom using a&#xD;
      statistical test of non-inferiority. The study will also compare the acceptability of the two&#xD;
      polyurethane condom different thickness with that of the natural rubber latex control condom&#xD;
      obtained from interviews and questionnaires with subject couples.&#xD;

    <description>To confirm each experimental condom is non-inferior to the control condom with respect to total clinical failure rate. The definition of total clinical failure rate as specified in ISO 29943-1:2017 will be used. The Total Clinical Failure Rate is Defined as the Number of Condoms with at least One Acute Failure Event (e.g. Clinical Breakage or Clinical Slippage) Divided by the Number of Condoms Used During Intercourse; Typically Reported as a Percentage; Any Condom which Experiences Multiple Clinical Failure Events Only Count as a Single Clinical Failure.</description>
