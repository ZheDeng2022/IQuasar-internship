    <textblock>
      The most common problem with haemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) and arterio-venous&#xD;
      grafts (AVG) is stenosis, which can lead to inadequate dialysis, and eventual access&#xD;
      thrombosis. Conventional plain old balloon angioplasty (CBA) is associated with high&#xD;
      recurrence rates of stenosis and repeated interventions. The advent of successful&#xD;
      drug-eluting technology in the treatment of the coronary vascular bed and subsequent positive&#xD;
      accumulating evidence in the peripheral arterial circulation has prompted the use of drug&#xD;
      coated balloons (DCB) in the access fistula circuit for venous stenosis and in-stent&#xD;
      restenosis. Recent studies suggest that DCBs may significantly reduce re-intervention rates&#xD;
      on native and recurrent lesions. The restenosis process is in part or in whole the result of&#xD;
      neo-intimal hyperplasia (NIH) and NIH is considered the main culprit in access circuit target&#xD;
      lesion stenosis. NIH is the blood vessel's healing response to the barotrauma from the&#xD;
      angioplasty process. A critical component of NIH is the cellular proliferative stage with&#xD;
      mononuclear leucocytes identified as the primary inflammatory cell type involved. The&#xD;
      rationale for drug elution is to block the NIH response with an anti-metabolite such as&#xD;
      paclitaxel. It is important to emphasize that the role of drug elution in the treatment of&#xD;
      vascular stenosis is not to obtain a good haemodynamic and luminal result but to preserve a&#xD;
      good result obtained during POBA from later restenosis due to NIH and minimise&#xD;
      reinterventions and readmissions to hospital for what is a frail population of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A meta-analysis performed by Khawaja et al. seemed to suggest that DCBs conferred some&#xD;
      benefit in terms of improving target lesion primary patency (TLPP) in AVFs. An updated&#xD;
      meta-analysis performed by our own institution recently reinforced that DCB appears to be a&#xD;
      better and safe alternative to CBA in treating patients with stenosis within all&#xD;
      haemodialysis circuits (fistulas and grafts) based on 6- and 12-months primary patency and&#xD;
      increased intervention free period 5. However, this was not reflected in the largest RCT to&#xD;
      date of DCB vs CBA in AVF with no superior target lesion patency demonstrated at six months&#xD;
      and one and two years follow-up. Another recent meta-analysis found paclitaxel-coated&#xD;
      balloons (PCB) showed no statistically significant improvement over conventional balloons in&#xD;
      decreasing fistula stenosis in randomized controlled trials but were significant for cohort&#xD;
      studies. Hence this shows the heterogeneity of the available data in the literature and the&#xD;
      result is dependent on what studies you include in the review. Another reason why the outcome&#xD;
      data is variable is that the high-speed blood flow in dialysis access circuits washes a large&#xD;
      amount of the paclitaxel away from the target lesion soon after application. A measurement in&#xD;
      swine showed that only 20%-30% of paclitaxel was taken up into the coronary artery wall in&#xD;
      vivo 15-25minutes after PCB application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, recent attention has been drawn to a possible increase in late mortality signal&#xD;
      and lower amputation free survival in patients receiving DCB treatment with paclitaxel for&#xD;
      peripheral arterial disease, although this suggestion has not been demonstrated in the data&#xD;
      of DCB within the fistula circuit either at 1 or 2 years. In light of these concerns,&#xD;
      attention has turned away recently from paclitaxel-based technologies to sirolimus coated&#xD;
      platforms. Sirolimus, like paclitaxel, is a potent antiproliferative agent, which has been&#xD;
      found to prevent restenosis in the coronary bed and more recently in the peripheral&#xD;
      vasculature but to date has not been studied in AVF circuits The aims of the study is to&#xD;
      determine the safety and efficacy of the MedAlliance SELUTION SLR 018™ DEB in the treatment&#xD;
      of failing AV fistula due to conduit stenosis in patients undergoing renal dialysis.&#xD;
