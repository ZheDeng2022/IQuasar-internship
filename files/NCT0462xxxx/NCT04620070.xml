  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: Implantation of on-scene ECPR by the HEMS teams in patients with sustained&#xD;
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, results in the rapid return of circulation and, thus,&#xD;
      improved survival and less neurological impairment, which is associated with lower health&#xD;
      care costs.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Approximately half of all cardiac arrest patients achieve return of spontaneous&#xD;
      circulation (ROSC) within 10 minutes. However, If ROSC is not achieved within 20 minutes,&#xD;
      favourable neurological outcome is rare. Currently, patients without ROSC at scene die at&#xD;
      scene, or are transported (while still in cardiac arrest) to the hospital. In the hospital,&#xD;
      advanced life support is continued, or, when presented to selected hospitals capable for this&#xD;
      strategy, patients receive Extracorporeal CardioPulmonary Resuscitation (ECPR). ECPR is a&#xD;
      strategy in which a miniaturized heart-lung machine (similar to that used in open-heart&#xD;
      surgery) is attached to the patient. Nowadays, the greatest drawback transporting OHCA&#xD;
      patients with refractory arrest to the hospital are the low quality of thorax compression&#xD;
      during transport and long time needed to arrive in the hospital, in part because not all&#xD;
      hospitals are able to provide this treatment. In the Netherlands, Helicopter Emergency&#xD;
      Medical Services (HEMS) deliver highly specialized medical care to trauma and non-trauma&#xD;
      patients, covering the entire country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Implantation of on-scene ECPR by the HEMS teams in patients with sustained&#xD;
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, results in the rapid return of circulation and, thus,&#xD;
      improved survival and less neurological impairment, which is associated with lower health&#xD;
      care costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To improve survival to hospital discharge and costs/QALY in young patients with&#xD;
      OHCA by decreasing the time in cardiac arrest by initiating ECPR on scene.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  - Age between 18 and 50 years, known or as estimated at inclusion by the HEMS&#xD;
             physician.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Expected time from collapse to arrival at an ECPR center with a direct available ECPR&#xD;
