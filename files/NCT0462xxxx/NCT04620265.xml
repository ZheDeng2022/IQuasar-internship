  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging can be defined as sequential deterioration that occurs in elderly people including&#xD;
      weakness, loss of mobility, decline of physical capabilities, increase susceptibility to&#xD;
      disease and many other age-related physiological changes .The beginning of old age in most&#xD;
      developed countries is about 60 or 65 years old. Diabetes mellitus (DM) and most commonly&#xD;
      type 2 DM is one of the most common chronic non-communicable diseases affecting old people in&#xD;
      Saudi Arabia which might be resulted from decline in physical activities. Polyneuropathy (PN)&#xD;
      and its serious consequences represent the most common complication in diabetic mellitus&#xD;
      which could contribute to an increased gait abnormality and risk of falling.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disability and reduction of quality of life are the largest costs of diabetes and its&#xD;
      complications. So taking active intervention to reduce the risk of falls, improve gait&#xD;
      performance and improve the quality of life in elderly with DPN is very important. Lower&#xD;
      extremity aerobic exercise training via treadmill aiming for improving patients' physical&#xD;
      activity levels is an important part in the rehabilitation program to enhance balance and&#xD;
      walking functions and reducing the fall risk, .Treadmill training using s low-load walking&#xD;
      provided by an emerging technology called lower body positive pressure (LBPP) that&#xD;
      effectively reduces body weight could be preferable than other methods of unweighting&#xD;
      treadmill because the air pressure is applied uniformly over the lower body. This kind of&#xD;
      anti-gravity treadmill is ideal in reducing the formation of pain and pressure points that&#xD;
      are common with harness-based unweighting systems. Many other advantages are also associated&#xD;
      with this unique type of antigravity technology that could give it the superiority than the&#xD;
      other types of unweighting treadmills in enhancing walking performance, reducing the risk of&#xD;
      fall and improving quality of life in Saudi elderly people with DPN.&#xD;

    <description>The assessment of functional capacity will be done using Six Minute Walk Test where intensity is moderately higher than daily living activities. Subject will be asked to walk at his own maximal pace from end to end of a 40-meter flat, straight corridor marked every 1 meter with side cones, in order to cover as much ground as possible while maintaining a steady pace without running during the allowed time. No verbal encouragement will be given, and subjects will be informed verbally each 2 minutes of the remaining time. The patients will be allowed to stop, but they can start again, if possible, within the allocated 6 minutes. Distance covered in 6 minutes will be recorded in meter. The longer the distance that will be walked will signify a better performance.</description>

    <description>For assessment of Health Related Quality of Life, 36-item Medical Outcomes Study Short Form Questionnaire (Arabic version) will be used. Dimensions are physical functioning, social functioning, bodily pain, limitations caused by physical health problems; limitations caused by emotional problems, emotional well-being and mental health, energy-fatigue and vitality, general health perception. Participants' scores for Questionnaire will be computed following the protocol of Ware and associates and the higher scores mean better outcome.</description>

    <description>Assessment of Mobility using Tinetti Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment. This is a widely recognized objective instrument for determining balance and gait deficiencies and assessing the risk of future falls. Higher Tinetti scores (maximum 28) correlate inversely with risk of falls. Individuals with Tinetti scores under 19 are considered to be at the highest risk for falls, those with scores between 19 and 24 are considered to have a moderate risk of falling, and those with scores 24 and above are considered to be at low risk for falls.</description>
