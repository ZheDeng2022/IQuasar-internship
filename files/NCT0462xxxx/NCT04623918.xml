      The objective of this randomized efficacy feeding trial was to determine the effects of&#xD;
      consuming iron-biofortified rice on iron status in women, compared to non-biofortified rice.&#xD;
      A randomized trial of biofortified rice (IR68144-2B-2-2-3), bred to enhance iron content, was&#xD;
      conducted among women living in convents in the greater area of Manila, Philippines for 9&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency is the most prevalent nutritional deficiency globally, with the highest&#xD;
      burden in women of reproductive age and children. In this randomized controlled trial, 317&#xD;
      women aged 18-45 years living in convents in the greater Manila area, Philippines, were fed&#xD;
      meals using either biofortified or commercially available rice for all meals, 7 days a week,&#xD;
      for 9 months. Women living in convents in the greater Manila area were recruited for this&#xD;
      study. These women represent a segment of the population at high risk for iron deficiency,&#xD;
      consume large quantities of rice, and all of their meals are prepared and consumed in common&#xD;
      kitchen and dining areas, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that daily consumption of iron-biofortified rice&#xD;
      (IR68144-2B-2-2-3) would improve hemoglobin, serum ferritin, and total body iron in 9 months,&#xD;
      compared to control rice. In order to examine this hypothesis, the investigators conducted a&#xD;
      randomized efficacy trial of iron-biofortified rice and iron status in among women living in&#xD;
      convents in the greater area of Manila, Philippines for 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this randomized efficacy feeding trial was to determine the effects of&#xD;
      consuming iron-biofortified rice on iron status in women, compared to non-biofortified rice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of this study is to determine if iron bio-fortification of rice is an&#xD;
      efficacious and potentially effective strategy to improve iron status of at-risk populations&#xD;
      in resource-limited settings.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Masking description: The study was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of; (1) iron-biofortified rice (IR68144-2B-2-2-3), compared to (2) a commercially available variety of rice (C4), with the intervention randomized at the individual level. Administrators, participants, research staff (i.e. responsible for daily data collection and preparation of rice for all meals, assessment of outcomes), and laboratory staff were blinded to the intervention group.</masking_description>
