  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm prospective trial that evaluates the ability of a novel imaging agent&#xD;
      gallium-68 labelled (68Ga-) FAP-2286 (68Ga-FAP-2286) to detect metastatic cancer in&#xD;
      participants with solid tumors using 68Ga-FAP-2286 tracer. FAP-2286 is a peptidomimetic&#xD;
      molecule that that binds to Fibroblast Activation Protein (FAP). FAP is a transmembrane&#xD;
      protein expressed on cancer-associated fibroblasts, and has been shown to be present on a&#xD;
      number of solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Initially the investigator(s) will focus on imaging breast, pancreas, sarcoma, prostate&#xD;
      cancer, bladder cancer, colon cancer, and head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. determine the dosimetry for gallium-68 labelled (68Ga-) FAP-2286,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. evaluate the uptake and retention of radiotracer in a variety of solid tumors with&#xD;
           FAP-2286, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. evaluate the ability of FAP-2286 to detect metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All cohorts: Safety of 68Ga-FAP-2286&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cohort 1: determine the organ dosimetry of 68Ga-FAP-2286&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cohort 2: determine the feasibility of detecting tumor uptake using 68Ga-FAP-2286&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Cohort 3: determine the feasibility of detecting metastatic disease using 68Ga-FAP-2286&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Correlation of 68Ga-FAP-2286 uptake with FAP expression determined by&#xD;
           immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare 68Ga-FAP-2286 scan results to archival Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET images.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare biodistribution of 68Ga-FAP-2286 in normal organs and blood pool based on renal&#xD;
           function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine impact of administered dose of 68Ga-FAP-2286 on image quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A repeat 68Ga-FAP-2286 PET may be obtained after initiation of subsequent treatment in order&#xD;
      to evaluate changes in PET uptake due to treatment effect. Patients will be followed for up&#xD;
      to 3 days after the injection of 68Ga-FAP-2286 for evaluation of adverse events.&#xD;

    <measure>Proportion of radiation-absorbed doses of 68Ga-FAP-2286 (Cohort 1 only)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Volumes of interest will be drawn around regions identified on the scans, including the liver, spleen, kidneys, urinary bladder, the central sacrum (for hematopoietic marrow) and whole body. Data will be fitted using the Simulation, Analysis, and Modeling Software II (SAAM II) software. Time integrals of activity will be entered into the Organ Level INternal Dose Assessment/EXponential Modeling (OLINDA/EXM) software, using the reference adult model. The results from all patients enrolled will be combined to allow the calculation of mean, standard deviation (SD), and range of radiation-absorbed doses to individual organs</description>

    <measure>Tumor-to-background (TBR) Ratio (Cohort 2 only)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 days</time_frame>
    <description>TBR ratios will be calculated for up to five lesions in each patient, with mediastinal blood pool being used as background activity. The median and range of the measured TBRs will be reported across all RECIST measurable lesions as a table broken down by location (organ metastases, nodal metastases and bone metastases).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sensitivity of 68Ga-FAP-2286 PET compared to conventional imaging (Cohort 3 only)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Conventional imaging will be reviewed in conjunction with the 68Ga-FAP-2286 PET images. Lesions will be characterized as positive on 68Ga-FAP-2286 PET if uptake is greater than 1.5 times higher than mediastinal blood pool and uptake cannot be attributed to physiologic or inflammatory reasons. Conventional imaging will be interpreted as positive by each lesion if the short axis dimension of lymph nodes is greater than 1 centimeter (cm), and organ metastases measure greater than 1 cm in long axis. The gold standard will be the combination of conventional imaging and 68Ga-FAP-2286 PET in combination with clinical follow-up and histopathology (if available). The number of lesions detected by each modality will be compared and sensitivity will be computed. Since this is a proof-of-concept study, it is not powered for the test of agreement. Nevertheless, the agreement will be tested using McNemar's test.</description>
