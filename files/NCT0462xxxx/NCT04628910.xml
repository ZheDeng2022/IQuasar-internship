  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research study is to assess how the implementation of various modern&#xD;
      strategies for augmented recovery affect sleep quality, subjective wellness and other indices&#xD;
      of general well-being.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditional flotation therapy (Float-REST; Flotation Restricted Environmental Stimulation&#xD;
      Therapy) uses sensory deprivation tanks that consist of a very large warm water enclosure&#xD;
      with a high concentration of Epsom salt to create a completely buoyant environment. This,&#xD;
      along with a combination of temperature that is kept equal to skin temperature (94 degrees),&#xD;
      allows the participant to eliminate the gravitational effects on the body, and along with&#xD;
      lack of sound and low to no light (depending on comfort) allows the brain and body to&#xD;
      completely relax for augmented physical and mental recovery. Provided the growing&#xD;
      understanding that sleep quality and quantity are at the forefront of ensuring optimal human&#xD;
      performance states, compounded by the deleterious effects of high stress and anxiety on&#xD;
      sleep, utilizing flotation therapy as a mechanism for enhancing sleep requires further&#xD;
      investigation. In addition to the traditional Float- REST, there have been developments in&#xD;
      newer technologies that enhance the convenience of receiving these proposed benefits;&#xD;
      Zerobody Dry Float technology (www.Zerobody.com) rids the need for multiple showers by its&#xD;
      user, frequent water treatments, and extensive maintenance experienced with traditional&#xD;
      flotation environments. However, research is still needed to assess how this recovery&#xD;
      modality compares to traditional Float-REST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess whether traditional (Float-REST) or simulated (Dry Float) flotation therapy&#xD;
      positively influences sleep and perceptual recovery, participants will undergo a crossover&#xD;
      study. Over the course of 9 weeks, participants will alternate Float-REST and Dry Float in 3&#xD;
      week segments with a 1 week break in-between to gather baseline data (known as the testing&#xD;
      battery). In addition, testing battery data will be collected at weeks 1 and 9. The order in&#xD;
      which participants begin their crossover study, either Float-REST or Dry Float, will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned. All participants may wear a fitness tracker and a sleep monitoring ring&#xD;
      worn on the finger for the duration of the study. In addition, daily, per session, and&#xD;
      pre/post-study questionnaires will be submitted via a smartphone application.&#xD;

    <description>The Zerobody is a new technology designed to simulate the effects of traditional Float-REST therapy, but without the contact with salt water. The system has a very thin membrane that cradles the body and provides a warm sensation, similar to that experienced in a traditional flotation tank. The system will be housed in a room that allows for significant reductions in light and sound to mimic the experience of a flotation tank. The room will contain an intercom that allows participants to communicate with study personnel in the event they need assistance. Participants will undergo 60 minute sessions twice a week for 3 weeks using the Zerobody, also termed &quot;dry floating,&quot; as one of the two interventions.</description>
