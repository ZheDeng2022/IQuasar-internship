  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Past research has shown that patients suffering from chronic health conditions tend to&#xD;
      experience high levels of negative mental health symptoms (e.g., depression). The purpose of&#xD;
      the current study is to evaluate whether an artificial intelligence (A.I.) mental health&#xD;
      chatbot can be used to reduce negative mental health symptoms within this population. A&#xD;
      minimum of 60 individuals with a chronic health condition (diabetes or arthritis) will be&#xD;
      recruited. Participants will be randomly assigned to either a treatment group or a control&#xD;
      group. Those assigned to the treatment group will use the mental health chatbot Wysa&#xD;
      (Touchkin eServices, Bangalore) over a period of four weeks. Those assigned to the control&#xD;
      group will receive no chatbot. Participants will complete measures of depression, anxiety,&#xD;
      stress, and life satisfaction via Qualtrics at the outset of the study, two weeks into the&#xD;
      study, and four weeks into the study (i.e., the final assessment point). Results from the&#xD;
      treatment and control groups will be compared using ANOVA models. Participants in the&#xD;
      treatment group will also be asked to complete some open-ended questions about their&#xD;
      experiences with the chatbot program. A subset of participants from the treatment group may&#xD;
      be asked to complete optional phone or video interviews to gain a better understanding of&#xD;
      their experiences. Results will provide insight into the usefulness of chatbot programs for&#xD;
      reducing negative mental health symptoms among patients with a chronic health condition.&#xD;
      Results may also be used to inform policy decisions about the use of these programs for&#xD;
      healthcare delivery, and to provide practical insight into how these programs can be best&#xD;
      integrated into healthcare settings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People dealing with chronic health conditions are susceptible to mental health issues such as&#xD;
      depression and anxiety. Providing conventional mental health services to all of these&#xD;
      individuals is not practical given the limited resources of the healthcare system. Artificial&#xD;
      intelligence (A.I.) mental health chatbots may be an accessible and cost-effective means by&#xD;
      which people can receive some degree of mental health support while they cope with their&#xD;
      conditions. These automated programs act as a source of virtual support, talking with&#xD;
      individuals and providing them with therapeutic exercises to improve their mental wellbeing.&#xD;
      Several chatbots have been designed to deliver interventions based on popular psychological&#xD;
      therapies (e.g., Wysa, Woebot, and Tess). Research has shown that these programs can reduce&#xD;
      symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress in nonclinical populations. However, the&#xD;
      effectiveness of these programs has not been tested in chronic disease populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the current research is to gain a better understanding of the usefulness of&#xD;
      mental health chatbots for chronic disease populations. This research will be guided by two&#xD;
      fundamental objectives: (1) to determine whether a mental health chatbot can reduce or&#xD;
      prevent negative mental health symptoms in individuals who are dealing with a chronic health&#xD;
      condition, and (2) to learn more about how individuals with a chronic health condition view&#xD;
      these programs, particularly in terms of their potential benefits or drawbacks when used in&#xD;
      healthcare settings. This research will focus on two specific chronic disease populations&#xD;
      that are prone to elevated levels of mental health symptoms: people with arthritis and&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited through social media channels (including online groups),&#xD;
      newspaper advertisements, and emails and newsletters from relevant organizations (e.g., the&#xD;
      Arthritis Society, Diabetes Canada). After volunteering to participate, participants will set&#xD;
      up a phone or video conferencing call with the primary investigator to orient them into the&#xD;
      study. Participants will be randomly assigned to either a treatment group or control group.&#xD;
      Those assigned to the treatment group will download the mental health chatbot Wysa (Touchkin&#xD;
      eServices, Bangalore) on their smartphones. They will interact with the chatbot a minimum of&#xD;
      two times per week over a period of four weeks, with each interaction lasting a minimum of&#xD;
      five minutes. Participants assigned to the control group will receive no chatbot (i.e., they&#xD;
      will be in a no-treatment control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of their group assignment, participants will complete online materials via&#xD;
      Qualtrics at the outset of the study, two weeks into the study, and four weeks into the study&#xD;
      (i.e., the final assessment point). At the outset of the study, participants will fill out an&#xD;
      informed consent form, a demographic questionnaire, and four psychological assessments tools:&#xD;
      measures of depression, anxiety, stress, and life satisfaction. Two weeks into the study,&#xD;
      participants will complete the four psychological assessment tools a second time. Four weeks&#xD;
      into the study, participants will complete the four assessment tools a final time, and those&#xD;
      in the treatment group will be presented with a post-study questionnaire that contains&#xD;
      qualitative questions regarding their experiences with the chatbot. Participants in both&#xD;
      groups will be presented with a debriefing form providing more information about the study.&#xD;
      Those in the control group will be given the opportunity to download and use the chatbot at&#xD;
      this point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the data from the four-week study are analyzed, a subset of participants from the&#xD;
      treatment group may be asked to complete optional phone or video interviews to gain more&#xD;
      insight into their experiences with and opinions on the chatbot program. Approximately 15 to&#xD;
      20 participants will be sought for the interviews. The questions for these interviews will be&#xD;
      developed based on the collective results from the quantitative and qualitative analysis&#xD;
      described above.&#xD;
