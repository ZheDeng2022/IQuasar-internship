  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational, pilot trial to evaluate the feasibility of heart&#xD;
      transplantation using normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) donation after donor circulatory&#xD;
      death (DCD). Normothermic regional perfusion utilizes Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation&#xD;
      (ECMO) or cardiopulmonary bypass to reperfuse the heart and other organs in situ after&#xD;
      isolation and ligation of the cerebral vessels. In situ resuscitation of the heart has the&#xD;
      added advantage of allowing full hemodynamic and echocardiographic assessment of the donor&#xD;
      heart prior to final acceptance for transplantation without the imminent danger of ongoing&#xD;
      warm ischemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current procedure of DCD organ donation and procurement follows a well-established course&#xD;
      for lung, liver, kidney and pancreas transplantation in the United States. DCD&#xD;
      transplantation of a heart has been hampered due to concern about the graft viability after&#xD;
      the obligatory period of warm ischemia and also the limited ability to assess the graft&#xD;
      function after the cessation of circulation. Normothermic regional perfusion restores the&#xD;
      circulation and enables in-situ reanimation of thoracic and abdominal organs after the&#xD;
      circulatory determination of death. For heart transplantation, the investigators will accept&#xD;
      donors between the ages of 18 and 49 without any known history of coronary artery disease,&#xD;
      insulin dependent diabetes, or long-term smoking (&gt;20 pack/years) and normal baseline cardiac&#xD;
      function (EF&gt;50) assessed with transthoracic echocardiogram. After the authorization for&#xD;
      research has been obtained from DCD surrogate, the organs will be allocated through UNOS.&#xD;
      When all parties are present and ready, the donor will be withdrawn from life support (i.e.,&#xD;
      discontinuation of mechanical ventilation and any vasoactive medications). . After&#xD;
      circulatory arrest occurs, death is declared by a physician not associated with the&#xD;
      transplant teams. Subsequently a period of stand-off is observed (5 minutes for organs&#xD;
      donated in Nebraska) to ensure complete cessation of the circulation before organ procurement&#xD;
      is commenced. If after withdrawal of life support the patient does not progress to&#xD;
      circulatory death within the allotted time, the procurement is abandoned and the patient is&#xD;
      transferred out of the operating room and placed on palliative measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that DCD organ donation is already currently practiced in the US, the same standard&#xD;
      approach defined by each state and locality can also be applied to DCD heart donation and&#xD;
      will be followed for this protocol at UNMC. However, this protocol will utilize a&#xD;
      normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) strategy that involves reestablishment of circulatory&#xD;
      blood flow after the period of circulatory arrest has been established and the 5 minutes of&#xD;
      standoff time has passed. The local Organ Procurement Organization (LiveOnNE) have reviewed&#xD;
      and approved this approach to DCD heart donation. Specifically, normothermic regional&#xD;
      perfusion involves the following steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Opening the chest through a standard sternotomy used for heart and lung procurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ligation of the all the blood vessels that supply blood to the brain to ensure that&#xD;
           blood flow to the brain is not reestablished once circulation is restarted as described&#xD;
           below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Standard cannulation of the aorta and the right atrium as is done for cardiac surgical&#xD;
           procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass, which will re-establish the flow of blood to all&#xD;
           organs of the body including the heart under normothermia. The initial step for ligation&#xD;
           of the blood vessels to the head is necessary to ensure that blood flow to the brain&#xD;
           does not occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once blood flow to the heart is established, the heart will start beating. At 30 minute&#xD;
      intervals, the donor will be separated from cardiopulmonary bypass and the heart will be&#xD;
      assessed for functionality. If accepted standard DBD procurement will commence. The heart&#xD;
      transplantation surgery on the potential recipient will only begin once the heart has been&#xD;
      accepted as suitable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If after assessment the heart is not suitable, cardiopulmonary bypass will be restarted. The&#xD;
      donor heart will be reassessed at 30-minute intervals up to 180 minutes. If no significant&#xD;
      acceptable recovery occurs and the heart is not deemed suitable for transplantation, then the&#xD;
      study will be terminated, but the remaining organs can be recovered as standard practice.&#xD;
