  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common lower extremity joint pain condition, and it is&#xD;
      estimated that 15 million people in the US are living with symptomatic knee OA and that more&#xD;
      than half (8 million) are under 65 years of age. To that end, the Centers for Disease Control&#xD;
      and Prevention strongly recommends non-pharmacological treatments for chronic pain including&#xD;
      physical therapy and weight loss; however, these interventions have significant barriers that&#xD;
      can prevent their success. An intervention that targets pain specifically is transcutaneous&#xD;
      electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), which is a low-cost intervention with evidence to&#xD;
      support pain reduction. As used in the majority of research to date, the intervention called&#xD;
      &quot;TENS&quot; refers to the application of electricity across the skin that produces a tingling&#xD;
      sensation that is strong but comfortable. However, electricity is applied at a noxious level&#xD;
      is thought to result in strong activation of the endogenous pain modulation system, thus&#xD;
      producing longer-lasting pain inhibition. However, noxious electrical stimulation (NxES) has&#xD;
      rarely been investigated as a treatment intervention. Recent studies, including our own,&#xD;
      demonstrate that NxES produces immediate and potentially greater pain relief. Despite some&#xD;
      promising research, the clinical use of NxES is sparse and more research is necessary to&#xD;
      demonstrate its effects on resting pain, movement-related pain, physical function, and&#xD;
      quality of life. The investigators hypothesize that the application of NxES will activate&#xD;
      pain modulation mechanisms and change the pain modulation profile toward an anti-nociceptive&#xD;
      state in adults with chronic knee osteoarthritis (OA) pain, and thereby decrease pain (at&#xD;
      rest and with movement), improve physical function, and improve quality of life. The&#xD;
      investigators expect individual differences; therefore, participants will be classified at&#xD;
      baseline and their response to the intervention tracked using psychophysical tests and&#xD;
      clinical response. The hypothesis will be tested through 2 Specific Aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: The investigators will test the magnitude and duration of pain relief and functional&#xD;
      improvement of a single treatment with NxES in adults with chronic knee OA pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: The investigators will determine if repeated NxES treatments show greater pain relief&#xD;
      and/or functional improvements and if so, whether the gains plateau after a certain number of&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The knowledge gained by this study will be important to physical therapists and other health&#xD;
      care practitioners who treat people with chronic knee osteoarthritic pain. If noxious&#xD;
      electrical stimulation is found to be an effective strategy to decrease pain at rest and with&#xD;
      movement, it may lead to improved patient care, improved function, and decreased chronic pain&#xD;
      in people with knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to forty-four participants (22 for Aim 1; 22 for Aim 2) with knee OA will be recruited&#xD;
      using advertisements, the Legacy Scholars research registry maintained by UNE's Center of&#xD;
      Excellence in Aging and Health, from participants with knee OA previously involved in the&#xD;
      investigator's research who indicated their willingness to participate in other studies, and&#xD;
      from a local orthopedic surgeon group practice. Potential participants will complete a&#xD;
      per-participation survey online or by phone that will be used to determine eligibility based&#xD;
      on inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Aims 1 and 2, eligible individuals will be asked to defer any plan for knee joint&#xD;
      injections until after the testing period. Participants will be asked to refrain from taking&#xD;
      any pain medications for at least 4 hours prior to testing. After giving informed consent,&#xD;
      individuals who have diabetes will undergo sensory testing to confirm that their sensory&#xD;
      detection threshold is no lower than the mean (+ 2 standard deviations) of the detection&#xD;
      threshold of healthy older adults which is 1.4 g of force applied by a size 4.17&#xD;
      monofilament. This threshold is based on data collected in our laboratory using the 4-2-1-&#xD;
      method of steps. If the individual is unable to perceive 1.4 g stimulus s/he will not&#xD;
      continue in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol for Aim 1- Data collected for Aim 1 will occur over 4 sessions. The purpose of this&#xD;
      aim is to determine the magnitude and duration of the day-to-day effects on clinical pain&#xD;
      relief and quantitative sensory tests related to pain after a single NxES treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 1: In this session we will gain informed consent, then perform a sensory screen (if&#xD;
      necessary), collect demographic data and baseline questionnaire data and familiarize&#xD;
      participants with the quantitative sensory testing (QST) procedures and to briefly experience&#xD;
      the NxES treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 2: During this session, participants will experience a single treatment with NxES and&#xD;
      we will assess changes in pain and function and QST measures before and after the treatment.&#xD;
      For the NxES Intervention, a pair of 2x3 inch electrodes will be placed on the medial and&#xD;
      lateral sides of the knee. Pulses of electrical current (400 Âµs biphasic square wave pulses&#xD;
      delivered at 50-100 pulses/second; 10-seconds on: 10-seconds off) will be applied for 20&#xD;
      minutes. The amplitude of the current will be increased until the participant rates the pain&#xD;
      50/100 on numeric pain rating scale. Pain intensity and unpleasantness will be assessed every&#xD;
      two-min. and amplitude will be increased to maintain the 5/10 pain intensity level during the&#xD;
      treatment. QST will be performed immediately after the treatment and 1 hour later. One- to&#xD;
      two-minute washout periods will be provided between QST test repetitions and a 20-minute&#xD;
      washout period will be provided after the NxES treatment and the post-treatment test of&#xD;
      conditioned pain modulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sessions 3-4: These sessions will occur 24-hours and 72-hours after session 2 and pain and&#xD;
      function along with QST will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol for Aim 2- The purpose of this aim is to determine if there is a cumulative response&#xD;
      to NxES treatment on clinical pain and quantitative sensory tests related to pain. Data&#xD;
      collected for Aim 2 will begin at least 1-week after the testing for Aim 1 and take place&#xD;
      over a 2-week treatment period. Follow-up testing will take place 72-hours and 4-weeks after&#xD;
      the last NxES treatment session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 1: This session will be used to re-collect baseline questionnaire data and&#xD;
      re-familiarize participants with procedures if it has been greater than 2-weeks since&#xD;
      participation in Aim 1 or if they declined participation in Aim 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 2: During this session, participants will receive the first NxES treatment and&#xD;
      undergo assessment of QST, pain, and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 3-7: These sessions are NxES treatment sessions. Pain and QST assessment will be&#xD;
      collected at the beginning of sessions 3,5 &amp; 7 only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 8: No treatments will be performed; post-treatment assessments will occur at 72 hours&#xD;
      after session 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 9: No treatments will be performed; post-treatment assessments will be completed 4&#xD;
      weeks after session 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sessions 2-7 must be completed within 18 calendar days in order to preserve the fidelity of&#xD;
      the intervention dosage.&#xD;

    <description>The NxES intervention will be applied with a pair of 2x3 inch electrodes placed orthogonally to the knee joint line with one electrode on the medial and lateral sides of the knee. The device is a commercially available unit(Chattanooga Continuum, DJO Global, Vista CA) and the parameters of the NxES include: 400 Î¼s biphasic square wave pulses delivered at 50-100 pulses/second, using a cycle time of 10-seconds on, with a 2-second ramp-up in intensity, followed by a 10-second off period. The current intensity will be dosed over the first 2-minutes of stimulation to find the sensory perception threshold and the threshold for the first perception of a sharp, prickly buzzing sensation that they would identify as painful. Next, the current intensity will gradually be increased until the participant reports a sharp or prickly buzzing sensation that achieves a pain rating of not more than a 5/10 using a numeric pain rating scale.</description>
