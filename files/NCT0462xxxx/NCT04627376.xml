  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multifactorial education and&#xD;
      support program for the prevention of cancer-related cachexia syndrome, for patients and&#xD;
      their family caregivers during anti-cancer treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study and the need to nominate a family caregiver, all&#xD;
      patients and their family caregiver giving written informed consent, they will undergo a&#xD;
      12-weeks multimodal program. Randomly they will divided into two groups (intervention and&#xD;
      control). This 12-weeks multimodal program includes 4 meetings (with cancer nurse and&#xD;
      clinical dietician). In this 4 meetings (about 30 minutes) they will have blood tests (CRP,&#xD;
      Albumin levels), body composition measurements, questionnaires, education on their diet and&#xD;
      symptom management.&#xD;
