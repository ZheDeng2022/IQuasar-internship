      Objectives: To investigate the effect on pain of a stress reducing treatment that combine&#xD;
      Internet based cognitive behavioral therapy (I-CBT) and physiotherapy in persons with chronic&#xD;
      widespread pain (CWP) and to examine factors predicting potential improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 200 persons with CWP will be recruited from different parts of Region Västra&#xD;
      Götaland (VGR) in Sweden, and randomized into two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Combined intervention of stress reducing I-CBT and Physiotherapy. Group 2:&#xD;
      Physiotherapy only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants complete a battery of questionnaires of symptoms and health related aspects&#xD;
      at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months. Interventions will take place at local rehabilitation&#xD;
      centers in VGR.&#xD;

      The overall purpose of the study is to investigate the effect on pain of a stress-reducing&#xD;
      treatment that combine Internet based cognitive behavioral therapy and physiotherapy, for&#xD;
      persons with Chronic widespread pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A randomized controlled multicenter study, with two arms. Participants: 200 persons&#xD;
      with CWP will be recruited to the randomized controlled study (RCT) in primary health care in&#xD;
      VGR and by advertising social media and/or local newspapers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women and men 18-65 years of age in VGR, fulfilling the criteria for CWP (ACR 1990).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sufficient knowledge of Swedish language&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific reasons for the pain, e g rheumatic disease, fracture or surgery in relation to&#xD;
           the pain during the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not having a smart phone or computer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious physical or psychological disease or other condition with restrictions of&#xD;
           physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Score &gt;15 on the subscale for anxiety or depression in the Hospital anxiety and&#xD;
           depression scale (HADS): the participant will be advised to contact a psychologist in&#xD;
           primary health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ongoing psychotherapy or physiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: The persons who are interested in participating in the study will achieve oral and&#xD;
      written information about the study and will be screened for inclusion- and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening will preferably be conducted by phone calls. The persons who are eligible&#xD;
      according to inclusion- and exclusion criteria and accept participation will complete a&#xD;
      battery of questionnaires of symptoms and health related aspects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: After completing the questionnaires the participants are randomized to one of&#xD;
      two groups. The randomization is made by sealed opaque envelopes by an independent person not&#xD;
      involved in the intervention. The randomization will be stratified by gender and according to&#xD;
      if the participant scored over or under 50 points at the SCI-93 to ensure that the degree of&#xD;
      stress symptoms are similar in the different groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: The participants will be followed up by completing the same questionnaires as&#xD;
      baseline after 6, 12 and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1. Combined intervention of stress reducing I-CBT and physiotherapy The intervention in&#xD;
      group 1 consists of two components; I-CBT and physiotherapy aiming to reduce symptoms of&#xD;
      stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I-CBT: Designed to reduce stress, during 8 weeks. Physiotherapy: A total of three visits with&#xD;
      a physiotherapist (at start, after 4 weeks and after 12 weeks). Visit 1 (at start): The&#xD;
      participant and the physiotherapist design together an individual plan of physical activity,&#xD;
      based on the recommendations for stress as suggested in the Physical Activity in the&#xD;
      Prevention and Treatment of Disease (FYSS in Swedish): Physical activity on moderate&#xD;
      intensity 150 min/week and a strengthening exercise program performed at twice a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physical activity is performed outside health care - in the participant´s home or in&#xD;
      other exercise premises outside health care Visit 2 and 3 (after 4 and 12 weeks): Follow up&#xD;
      and revision of the Physical activity plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2. Stress reducing physiotherapy only The intervention in group 2 consists only of one&#xD;
      component; physiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiotherapy: A total of three visits with a physiotherapist (at start, after 4 weeks and&#xD;
      after 12 weeks). The visits are arranged in the same way as in the combined intervention&#xD;
      (group 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements Primary Outcomes Pain intensity: The subscale for pain intensity included in the&#xD;
      Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) is used. The subscale is a visual analogue scale&#xD;
      (VAS) (0-100 mm) on which the participant rate their pain intensity during the previous week,&#xD;
      ranging from 0 (No pain) to 100 (Very severe pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome is assessed both on group level as change in pain intensity over time between the&#xD;
      groups and on an individual level as proportions of participants in each group who have&#xD;
      achieved moderate (≥30%) and major (≥50%) change in pain intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain spread: The participants will state their painful areas in a pain drawing with 18&#xD;
      predefined body areas. The score range from 0 to 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms of stress: The Stress and Crisis Inventory (SCI-93) consists of 35 items assessing&#xD;
      clinical manifestations of stress ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The questions&#xD;
      include both physical and mental experiences. The total score range from 0 to 140 and higher&#xD;
      scores indicate a higher level of stress. The following cut-off values have been recommended:&#xD;
      0-25 p = Normal stress, 26-50 p= Mild stress, 51-75 p= Moderate stress, 75-100 p = severe&#xD;
      stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity: Level of physical activity is measured with the Leisure Time Physical&#xD;
      Activity Instrument (LTPAI), a questionnaire assessing the amount of physical activity during&#xD;
      a typical week. The total score is the amount of hours of physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatigue: Self rated fatigue is assessed with the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20)&#xD;
      which consists 20 statements building 5 subscales; General Fatigue, Mental Fatigue, Physical&#xD;
      Fatigue, Reduced Motivation and Reduced Activity. Each subscale range from 4 to 20 p and a&#xD;
      higher value indicate a higher degree of fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FIQ subscale for fatigue (VAS 0-100 mm) will also be used as a global measure of fatigue&#xD;
      during the last week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health related quality of life is assessed with the Research and development (RAND)-36, a&#xD;
      generic instrument which consists of 8 subscales ranging from 0 to 100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety and Depression are assessed with the hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS),&#xD;
      which contains 2 subscales for anxiety and depression ranging from 0 to 21, a higher value&#xD;
      means a higher degree of anxiety or depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant´s impression of change is assessed with the questionnaire Patient Global&#xD;
      Impression of Change (PGIC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data will also be collected, such as duration of CWP, marital status, work&#xD;
      status, sick leave, medication use and tobacco use.&#xD;
