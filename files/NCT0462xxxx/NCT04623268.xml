  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 8-12 fold higher risk for sisters and brothers of patients with Abdominal Aortic&#xD;
      Aneurysms (AAA) to develop AAA compared to persons in the population is well known in the&#xD;
      scientific community. Recently the value of the screening program for siblings has been&#xD;
      analyzed and is shown to be highly cost-efficient, similar to the population based screening&#xD;
      of 65-year old men for AAA. Most importantly detection of siblings also adresses and includes&#xD;
      women at risk. The adult offsprings to AAA patient would hypothetically bear the same risk of&#xD;
      AAA as siblings. This has never been evaluated scientifically due to the practical&#xD;
      difficulties in tracking the offspring and inviting them to screening at an age when they are&#xD;
      at risk of AAA-disease. In Sweden, the unique multigeneration registry exists which could&#xD;
      support such detection, with the possibility to track adult offspring to patients, and&#xD;
      investigate the true contemporary prevalence in them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DAAAD project aims at investigating the prevalence in adult offspring parallel to&#xD;
      developing a model for such a selective screening program&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project will evaluate four questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Feasibility of study design; can we evaluate the prevalence of AAA by inviting and&#xD;
           detecting risk groups in national registries ?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Point prevalence of AAA in a riskgroup of adult offspring to AAA patients as compared to&#xD;
           a matched control group&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Quality of Life in risk groups: measuring HADS, EQ-5D and questionnaire on heredity,&#xD;
           including their awareness on their risk for AAA&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Cost-effectiveness of such a national program based on prevalence and EQ-5D&#xD;
&#xD;
      This program will evaluate the risk for AAA in adult offspring and also evaluate a highly&#xD;
      probable effective registry-based detection route. This could be more cost-efficient than any&#xD;
      other AAA screening program, since the prevalence presumably is very high, and the&#xD;
      registry-based route could be cheaper than nurse-based detection or incidental screening. The&#xD;
      ultimate benefit of this program will be a crude reduction of sudden deaths from AAA for&#xD;
      adult offspring to AAA patients, and this will be specifically impressive for the female&#xD;
      relatives that are never subjected to any AAA-screening in our country.&#xD;
