  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether testing of stool for a panel of&#xD;
      markers will enable us to detect polyps and cancer compared to standard testing.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants who were diagnosed with Stage I-III colorectal cancer will undergo testing with&#xD;
      mt-sDNA followed by a questionnaire about satisfaction with mt-sDNA (multitarget stool DNA&#xD;
      panel), prior to their scheduled colonoscopies at years 1 and 4 after diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to provide a stool sample for mt-sDNA (Cologuard) testing that&#xD;
      will be collected within 90 days before their scheduled colonoscopy. The kit will be given to&#xD;
      the participant by study personnel and mailed back directly to Exact Science.&#xD;

    <time_frame>at 1 and 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the results between mt-sDNA (categorized as a single positive or negative result) with the findings at colonoscopy, the &quot;gold standard&quot;. Colonoscopy will be considered positive if an adenoma or carcinoma is found and otherwise negative.&#xD;
Sensitivity is defined as True Positive (TP)/(TP+ False Negative (FN))</description>

    <description>Participant acceptance as measured by the Stool Test Satisfaction Survey, which includes 14 questions scored on a Likert scale. Possible scores ranging from 14 - 70, with higher scores indicating better outcomes.&#xD;
Responses will be grouped based on the distribution, but most likely as 1-2 (neutral, unfavorable or least favorable ) versus 3-5 (most favorable or very favorable).</description>

          -  Diagnosis of stage I, II or III adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of preoperative colonoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of bowel resection; use of adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy as&#xD;
             clinically indicated&#xD;

          -  Surgical treatment with subtotal colectomy or total proctocolectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of polyposis syndrome including Lynch syndrome or familial polyposis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of advanced adenomas (1 cm or larger, villous features and/or high grade&#xD;
             dysplasia) that were not removed at the preoperative colonoscopy or contained in the&#xD;
             resection specimen.&#xD;
