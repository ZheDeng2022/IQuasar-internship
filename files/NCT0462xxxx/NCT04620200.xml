      This is an investigator-initiated randomized non-comparative phase II trial consisting of 40&#xD;
      patients with resectable stage III-IVa CSCC randomized 1:1 to ARM A: 2 courses of nivolumab 3&#xD;
      mg/kg in week 0 and 2, or ARM B: 2 courses of nivolumab 3 mg/kg in week 0 and 2 plus 1 course&#xD;
      of ipilimumab 1mg/kg in week 0. Both treatment arms are neo-adjuvant and applied prior to&#xD;
      standard of care (consisting of surgery at week 4 with or without adjuvant radiotherapy).&#xD;

    <description>Histopathological tumor response to neo-adjuvant immunotherapy as measured in the tumor resection specimen will be compared to the tumor response as measured via serial tumor biopsies, the tumor biopsy at time of surgery and imaging (clinical photography, FDG-PET and (f)MRI). Histopathologic response in the tumor biopsies will be defined similarly as histopathologic response in the resected specimen. Response at imaging studies will be measured as follows: Clinical photography via specific clinical observation criteria, FDG-PET via RECIST 1.1 criteria and % change in TLG or MTV and (f)MRI via RECIST 1.1</description>
