  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      UB-421 subcutaneous formulation (UB-421 SC) is developed to provide HIV infected patients a&#xD;
      more convenient drug delivery method. UB-421 SC injection, with significantly less injection&#xD;
      time than IV infusions and with opportunity of self-administration or administered in general&#xD;
      medical setting (in addition to HIV-specific clinic), can provide patient a more convenient&#xD;
      option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This UB-421 SC phase I study will be conducted to investigate short-term safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and anti-viral activity of UB-421 SC at three dose levels in ART-treated&#xD;
      aviremic subjects and treatment naive HIV-infected subjects. The current UB-421 SC&#xD;
      formulation (125 mg/ml) is at least 10-fold more concentrated than UB-421 IV (10 mg/ml). The&#xD;
      highly concentrated formulation makes weekly UB-421 subcutaneous injections feasible. This&#xD;
      study will form the basis of UB-421 SC in combination with antiretroviral agents (ARV) for&#xD;
      treating HIV infected viremic patients in the future clinical trials.&#xD;
