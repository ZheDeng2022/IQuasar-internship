  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperfine Research, Inc. has taken advantage of technological advances and developed an MRI&#xD;
      device that is not only portable, but also uses a very-low magnetic field strength, [less&#xD;
      than 0.2 Tesla or approximately 10 times less] than the field strength of conventional&#xD;
      devices. This critical difference allows HRI to address MRI's core challenges by, first,&#xD;
      operating at very low magnetic field strengths, eliminating the need for special rooms or&#xD;
      shielding. Second, there are minimal safety concerns regarding ferrous metals near the&#xD;
      system, as the field strength is too low to attract metal objects. The removal of metal,&#xD;
      including items such as jewelry, belts, etc. from clothing and person, prior to being&#xD;
      scanned, is unnecessary. Third, the design constraints faced by conventional MRI systems are&#xD;
      lifted at low magnetic field and an open device has been designed to minimize anxiety that&#xD;
      may come with claustrophobic patients. All of this is possible while still providing image&#xD;
      quality that is clinically relevant to a wide variety of fields, including radiology,&#xD;
      neurology, pediatrics, emergency medicine, and others.&#xD;

    <description>â€¢ Patients who have a standard of care MRI, CT or US will undergo a low-field MRI utilizing Hyperfine either at the patient's bedside or in the department of Radiology. Results of the Hyperfine MRI will not be used for clinical care and will only be available to members of the research team for review.</description>
