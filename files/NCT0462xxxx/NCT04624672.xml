  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients that are diabetic, and require insulin for glycemic control, and&#xD;
      going through the bariatric surgery process. This is a prospective study that is trying to&#xD;
      determine if the introduction of a semaglutide increases the remission rates of diabetes&#xD;
      post-operatively.&#xD;

      The evidence to date supporting the association between treatment with GLP-1 agonists and&#xD;
      diabetes remission after metabolic surgery is based on retrospective studies. This study is a&#xD;
      2:1 randomized, blinded, parallel, prospective placebo-controlled trial with a standardized&#xD;
      treatment approach in order to establish the role of GLP-1 in remission of diabetes after&#xD;
      metabolic surgery. This study will enroll 126 patients, with the goal of 100 patients&#xD;
      completing the clinical trial (33 in the Placebo/Control Group and 67 in the Test Group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preoperative program for Metabolic Surgery involves multidisciplinary health evaluation&#xD;
      and care, as well as patient education lasting approximately 6 months. Patients that consent&#xD;
      to the clinical trial, will receive study drug on top of the standard care that is provided&#xD;
      for 4 months prior to bariatric surgery. During this time, glycemic control will be monitored&#xD;
      carefully through points of contact with the study team and additional lab assessments for&#xD;
      the clinical trial. After bariatric surgery, patients will continue in the study for 2 years&#xD;
      and glycemic control will be managed according to the current standard of care for&#xD;
      perioperative glucose control. During this time, patients will continue to meet with the&#xD;
      study team and collect lab assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study patients will be followed for two years after metabolic surgery. Efficacy and&#xD;
      outcomes will be evaluated by comparative analysis of laboratory results (Labs 1-6) which&#xD;
      monitor longitudinal glycemic control. Outcomes will then be compared between Test and&#xD;
      Control groups. The major study outcomes will be diabetes remission as defined by the&#xD;
      American Diabetes Association. Secondary outcomes will include measures of improvement in&#xD;
      glycemic control and beta cell function (change in fasting glucose levels, HbA1C, and C-&#xD;
      peptide). All study labs and chemistry analysis will be performed at the Geisinger Medical&#xD;
      Laboratory which is accredited by the College of American Pathologists and the Centers for&#xD;
      Medicare and Medicaid - Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) and licensed by the&#xD;
      Pennsylvania Department of Health Division of Laboratories. Evaluation of the continued need&#xD;
      for medications for diabetes treatment will be the responsibility of the study team.&#xD;
      Longitudinal information relating to medication use will be derived from direct patient&#xD;
      contact at study visits, and review of standard of care medicine reconciliations from the&#xD;
      Electronic Health Record.&#xD;
