  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to characterize the safety, steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) of&#xD;
      IMT-002, and will serve as a dose range identification for the pharmacodynamic effect of&#xD;
      blocking self-antigen presentation in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) having the human&#xD;
      leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ8 gene.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study that will include 4 ascending&#xD;
      dose cohorts: 350 mg twice daily (BID), 1050 mg once daily (QD), 700 mg BID, and 1050 mg BID.&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo prescreening for genetic typing and then screening procedures up to 28&#xD;
      days prior to the first dose to determine eligibility. T1D adults between 18 and 45 years of&#xD;
      age, inclusive, who are positive for at least one gene encoding for HLA-DQ8 (DQA1*0301,&#xD;
      DQB1*0302) will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cohort will include 6 subjects on active drug, and the study will include 6 subjects&#xD;
      total on placebo. Each cohort will participate in a 2-week dosing period. Enrollment of the&#xD;
      cohorts will be sequentially staggered such that initial safety data after the first four&#xD;
      subjects assigned to active treatment complete one week of treatment in each cohort will be&#xD;
      reviewed before the next ascending dose cohort is enrolled. The safety reviews will include&#xD;
      cumulative safety data for all subjects to that point. Subjects will have 5 scheduled clinic&#xD;
      visits: screening, first day of dosing, 1 week after dosing begins, 2 weeks after dosing&#xD;
      begins (end of treatment), and 1 week following the final dose. Subjects will self-administer&#xD;
      study drug on non-clinic treatment days. Safety assessments will be conducted at all study&#xD;
      visits. Insulin use (dose and frequency) will be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments will be evaluated at every visit during the treatment period&#xD;
      to characterize the following: single dose PK, trough PK and steady PK. Pharmacodynamic (PD)&#xD;
      and immunological assessments will be evaluated before, during and after treatment.&#xD;
