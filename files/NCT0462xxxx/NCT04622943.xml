  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Firearms injuries present a major pediatric public health challenge, killing &gt;800 children&#xD;
      ages 0-15 annually and leading to lifelong disability among &gt;1000 survivors. About â…“ of&#xD;
      firearms injuries to children under age 15 are due to unintentional causes rather than&#xD;
      suicide or homicide. The investigators propose development and evaluation of ShootSafe, an&#xD;
      innovative, engaging, and educational website accessible by smartphone, tablet or computer&#xD;
      that engages children to learn firearms safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ShootSafe extends existing programs to achieve 3 primary goals: a) teach children knowledge&#xD;
      and skills they need to hunt, shoot, and use firearms safely; b) help children learn and hone&#xD;
      critical cognitive skills of impulse control and hypothetical thinking needed to use firearms&#xD;
      safely; and c) alter children's perceptions about their own vulnerability and susceptibility&#xD;
      to firearms-related injuries, the severity of those injuries, and their perceived norms about&#xD;
      peer behavior surrounding firearms use. ShootSafe will accomplish these goals through a&#xD;
      combination of interactive games plus podcast videos delivered by peer actors (impactful&#xD;
      testimonials about firearms injuries/deaths they experienced) and experts (wisdom &amp;&#xD;
      experience from trusted role models). The website will also incorporate brief messaging to&#xD;
      parents, who will absorb key lessons and reinforce them with their children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The website will be evaluated through a randomized controlled trial with 162 children ages&#xD;
      10-12, randomly assigning children to engage in the ShootSafe website or an active control&#xD;
      website on child nutrition. The investigators will incorporate sub-aims to evaluate changes&#xD;
      in children's (a) knowledge, (b) cognitive skills in impulse control and hypothetical&#xD;
      thinking, (c) perceptions about firearms safety, and (d) simulated behavior when handling,&#xD;
      storing and transporting firearms. All outcome measures will be assessed at baseline,&#xD;
      immediately post-intervention, and at a 4-month follow-up assessment to evaluate retention.&#xD;
      Training will comprise two 30-minute sessions.&#xD;
