  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that leads to both motor and&#xD;
      non-motor symptoms. Therapies have been developed that effectively target the motor symptoms.&#xD;
      Non-motor symptoms are far more disabling for patients, precede the onset of motor symptoms&#xD;
      by a decade, are more insidious in onset, have been less apparent to clinicians, and are less&#xD;
      effectively treated. Sleep dysfunction is oftentimes the most burdensome of the non-motor&#xD;
      symptoms. There are limited options for treating sleep dysfunction in PD, and the mainstay of&#xD;
      therapy is the use of sedative-hypnotic drugs without addressing the underlying mechanisms.&#xD;
      Patients with PD who demonstrate significant motor fluctuations and dyskinesia are considered&#xD;
      for subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. Several studies have&#xD;
      reported that STN-DBS also provides benefit for sleep dysregulation. Additionally, local&#xD;
      field potentials recorded from STN DBS electrodes implanted for the treatment of PD, have led&#xD;
      to the identification of unique patterns in STN oscillatory activity that correlate with&#xD;
      distinct sleep cycles, offering insight into sleep dysregulation. This proposal will leverage&#xD;
      novel investigational DBS battery technology (RC+S Summit System; Medtronic) that allows the&#xD;
      exploration of sleep biomarkers and prototyping of closed-loop stimulation algorithms, to&#xD;
      test the hypothesis that STN contributes to the regulation and disruption of human sleep&#xD;
      behavior and can be manipulated for therapeutic advantage. Specifically, in PD patients&#xD;
      undergoing STN-DBS, the investigators will determine whether STN oscillations correlate with&#xD;
      sleep stage transitions, then construct and evaluate sensing and adaptive stimulation&#xD;
      paradigms that allow ongoing sleep-stage identification, and induce through adaptive&#xD;
      stimulation an increase in duration of sleep stages associated with restorative sleep.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Although STN-DBS is routinely used to treat PD motor symptoms, several studies have reported&#xD;
      that STN-DBS also provides benefit for sleep dysregulation through normalization of sleep&#xD;
      architecture. In our previous work, using local field potentials (LFP) recorded from STN DBS&#xD;
      electrodes implanted for the treatment of PD, unique spectral patterns in STN oscillatory&#xD;
      activity were identified that correlated with distinct sleep cycles, offering insight into&#xD;
      sleep dysregulation. These findings were used to construct an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)&#xD;
      that can accurately predict sleep stage. Building on this work with the use of new DBS&#xD;
      battery technology that allows exploration of potential biomarkers and prototyping of&#xD;
      closed-loop algorithms, the investigators will test the hypothesis that STN-a highly&#xD;
      interconnected node within the basal ganglia- contributes to the regulation and disruption of&#xD;
      human sleep behavior and can be manipulated for therapeutic advantage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first part, Aim 1, of a two-part study. Investigators will enroll 20 subjects for&#xD;
      Aim 1 of this study and 20 subjects for Aim 2, with 10 subjects enrolled at each clinical&#xD;
      site for each aim (University of Nebraska Medical Center and Stanford University Medical&#xD;
      Campus). In Aim 1, subjects will undergo standard-of-care STN DBS lead implantation surgery&#xD;
      for the treatment of PD. They will return 3 weeks later to the in-patient Sleep Lab for 3&#xD;
      nights of STN LFP recordings with concurrent PSG, EMG, EOG, actigraphy, and video-EEG. The&#xD;
      first two nights of recording will be used to establish a physiological sleep baseline for&#xD;
      each patient. The third night of recording will involve sub-clinical thresholds of&#xD;
      stimulation in all subjects, in an effort to favorably alter sleep-stage duration, so that&#xD;
      NREM and REM-3 are prolonged. As a secondary outcome, subjects will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      sleep questionnaire for all three nights, sleep during which stimulation occurred will be&#xD;
      compared to the preceding two nights. Data collected during all three nights of recordings&#xD;
      will be used to predict sleep stage identity from the LFPs recorded within STN, with the&#xD;
      ground truth for each sleep stage provided by sleep-expert evaluated PSG. These data will&#xD;
      also be used to identify the optimal sub-clinical threshold current amplitude and sleep-stage&#xD;
      timing for adaptive stimulation to improve sleep. The stimulation algorithm developed in Aim&#xD;
      1 will be implemented in the second part of the study, Aim 2, to provide adaptive stimulation&#xD;
      to subjects during nighttime sleep, over the course of 3 weeks of in-home sleep.&#xD;
