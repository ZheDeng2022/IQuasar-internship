    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that withholding hydrocortisone during the peri-operation in&#xD;
      patients with pituitary adenomas whose hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis are intact are&#xD;
      safe.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pituitary is the headquarters of the endocrine system of the body, secreting several hormones&#xD;
      maintaining the normal function of the endocrine organs. After surgery, pituitary dysfunction&#xD;
      is seen in a small proportion of patients, even in some patients resulting in severe&#xD;
      consequence, i.e. adrenal insufficiency or pituitary crisis. Therefore, patients undergoing&#xD;
      pituitary surgery have been usually given &quot;stress dose&quot; steroids whether their hypothalamus&#xD;
      pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis are deficient or preserved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of several retrospective studies showed that there was no significantly increase in&#xD;
      postoperative adrenal insufficiency in no supplementation (of hydrocortisone) group than in&#xD;
      supplementation group. Given the considerable side effects of using steroids, whether&#xD;
      hydrocortisone administration is necessary for all patients with pituitary adenomas during&#xD;
      peri-operation needs to be discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Chinese patients with pituitary adenomas except for those of Cushing's disease,&#xD;
      hydrocortisone administration during the peri-operation is a routine practice. Peking Union&#xD;
      Medical College Hospital is the China Pituitary Disease Registry Center. Here, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to launch a single-center prospective randomized controlled trial to verify&#xD;
      the hypothesis that withholding hydrocortisone during the peri-operation in patients with&#xD;
      pituitary adenomas whose HPA axis are intact are safe.&#xD;

    <description>Hydrocortisone sodium succinate is given on the operation day (100mg at 0800 &amp; 100mg at 2000), the postoperative day 1 (100mg at 0800 &amp; 50mg at 2000), and the postoperative day 2 (25mg at 0800). Hydrocortisone (po.) is then given starting from the afternoon of postoperative day 2 (20mg at 1600 and 0800) to the end of the first postoperative week, and 20mg at 0800 during the second postoperative week. This is called the &quot;hydrocortisone taper program&quot;. If a patient develops postoperative adrenal insufficiency, he/she needs to receive hydrocortisone treatment (20mg at 0800 and 20mg at 1600) for one month and then check the level of morning serum cortisol to decide if it is time to start the hydrocortisone taper program.</description>
