  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute limb ischemia (ALI) is a sudden decrease in limb perfusion due to either an embolic or&#xD;
      a thrombotic vascular occlusion, defined as the presence of symptoms within two weeks of&#xD;
      onset. The profound ischemia represents an emergency in which delayed treatment results in&#xD;
      limb loss and, potentially, death. Therefore, timely diagnosis and proper treatments for ALI&#xD;
      are important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both surgical thrombectomy and endovascular treatment have benefits and drawbacks. Surgical&#xD;
      thrombectomy using Fogarty embolectomy catheter has been the standard therapy because it is&#xD;
      rapid and effective in cases of embolic ALI. However, blind surgical thrombectomy can result&#xD;
      in poor revascularization or unexpected vascular injury in the presence of underlying&#xD;
      arterial atherosclerosis or in the presence of subacute and chronic thrombi. In addition,&#xD;
      thrombosis of runoff vessels is difficult to remove.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endovascular management using catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) has emerged as an&#xD;
      alternative to surgery. It is less invasive, and does not directly damage the vascular&#xD;
      endothelium with the capacity to clear thrombus in the small vessels. However, long treatment&#xD;
      duration may worsen the clinical situation. Besides, a thrombus of more than two weeks does&#xD;
      not respond well to the thrombolysis, and it is difficult to determine the exact stage of&#xD;
      thrombus according to the clinical history. These problems may be minimized by combined&#xD;
      treatment, which includes surgical thrombectomy and endovascular treatment.&#xD;
