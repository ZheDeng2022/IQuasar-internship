    <textblock>
      To address the significant barriers to PrEP implementation for those who were assigned female&#xD;
      at birth and self-identify as a woman and address racial inequities in HIV prevention in the&#xD;
      United States (US), a novel approach that accounts for multilevel influences is necessary.&#xD;
      This study is one part of a multi-component project and involves a patient-level intervention&#xD;
      in two public health family planning clinics in Duval County Florida, where the majority of&#xD;
      patients are women of color. The area has one of the highest HIV incidence rates among women&#xD;
      in the US. The investigators developed a tablet-based decision support tool that helps users&#xD;
      learn about HIV vulnerabilities and HIV prevention strategies to inform how they consider&#xD;
      options for reducing their likelihood of acquiring HIV. Participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      use the HIV decision support tool before their visit or standard counseling (without the use&#xD;
      of the tool) and will be surveyed about the use of the tool, experiences with HIV prevention&#xD;
      counseling, and intentions about the use of HIV prevention. A subset of participants, all&#xD;
      individuals who self-identify as a woman and as Black or Latina, will also complete a&#xD;
      post-clinic visit interview. The investigators will follow-up with participants at three&#xD;
      months following their initial visit to see if they have initiated the HIV prevention&#xD;
      method(s) they chose at their visit. The main outcomes will include a quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative assessment of PrEP or other HIV prevention use, decisional certainty, and&#xD;
      satisfaction with information about HIV prevention options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Women who use the HIV prevention decision support tool will be more likely to have&#xD;
           initiated PrEP within 3 months compared to women who received standard counseling at the&#xD;
           time of their initial appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The HIV prevention decision support tool will increase women's knowledge of PrEP and&#xD;
           other HIV prevention methods compared to women who received standard counseling at the&#xD;
           time of their initial appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The HIV prevention decision support tool will increase participants' decisional&#xD;
           certainty in their choice of an HIV prevention method compared to women who received&#xD;
           standard counseling at the time of their initial appointment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although 13% of the U.S. female population is Black, 60% of new HIV diagnoses in U.S. women&#xD;
      occur among Black women. The South is the epicenter of the U.S. HIV epidemic, including in&#xD;
      women, and Black Southern women are disproportionately affected: Black women account for 69%&#xD;
      of new HIV diagnoses in women in the South. As the first highly effective, discrete,&#xD;
      woman-controlled HIV prevention method, oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with tenofovir&#xD;
      disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine radically expands HIV prevention options for women.&#xD;
      However, uptake of PrEP in U.S. women has lagged, particularly among groups most affected by&#xD;
      HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PrEP cascades outline the necessary steps for accessing PrEP, including screening and&#xD;
      identifying eligible individuals, linkage to care, prescription, and initiation of PrEP. Data&#xD;
      suggest there are multilevel barriers related to the process of screening for HIV risk in&#xD;
      women and identifying potential PrEP candidates that may drive a significant drop off early&#xD;
      in the PrEP cascade for women. Women report feeling judged by risk assessment questions and&#xD;
      experience stigma around disclosing sexual practices. As a result, if screening is required&#xD;
      to educate patients about PrEP - as is true in most clinical settings - many women for whom&#xD;
      PrEP is appropriate may never learn about PrEP. Further, women have low levels of knowledge&#xD;
      about HIV risk and HIV prevention options, and therefore will not seek out PrEP services&#xD;
      themselves. By offering education to all women about vulnerabilities to HIV as well as&#xD;
      information about HIV prevention methods including PrEP, at-risk women can circumvent these&#xD;
      multifactorial barriers and request PrEP. Electronic decision support tools (DST), which have&#xD;
      been used with success in a range of healthcare contexts including contraception, provide an&#xD;
      efficient and private mechanism for this information-sharing step.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team developed a tablet-based tool that is designed to provide universal PrEP&#xD;
      education and facilitate women's agency to identify their own risks and interest in PrEP. It&#xD;
      was refined with iterative feedback from patient and community stakeholders and finalized&#xD;
      based on cognitive testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DST provides information about vulnerabilities to HIV and core characteristics of&#xD;
      different HIV prevention methods, and then the opportunity to explore these characteristics&#xD;
      in depth, including efficacy, safety and side effects. The user chooses the level of&#xD;
      information that they wish to receive through the interactive interface, allowing for an&#xD;
      individualized experience. Upon reaching the end of the tool, information on the tablet&#xD;
      suggests that women ask their provider about HIV prevention methods they are interested in&#xD;
      using, based on their preferences for method characteristics, and their questions in order to&#xD;
      facilitate deliberation with the provider. The DST takes approximately 10 minutes to&#xD;
      complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 384 women presenting to two reproductive health clinics in Duval County,&#xD;
      Florida, will be randomized to standard counseling plus use of an HIV prevention DST,&#xD;
      providing education about PrEP and encouraging self-assessment of HIV risk, or standard&#xD;
      counseling alone. In addition to the experimental intervention, a subset of 40 participants&#xD;
      (20 per arm, 10 per clinic) will be asked to allow audio-recording of their counseling&#xD;
      sessions with a provider. A subset of up to 40 additional participants (20 per arm, 10 per&#xD;
      clinic), all of whom self-identify as women of color, will be invited to complete one-hour,&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews after their clinic visit about their experiences of using the DST,&#xD;
      HIV prevention counseling, and decision making about PrEP.&#xD;

    <description>The tool is founded on principles of decision-science and developed in a systematic manner including pilot testing. The tool will present HIV prevention information through a tablet in the clinical setting. The decision support tool will address barriers to PrEP delivery, including 1) limited client knowledge about PrEP, 2) limited time to educate patients in busy clinics, 3) women's lack of knowledge of their own HIV vulnerability, and 4) hesitancy of women to initiate discussions about PrEP with providers due to judgmental attitudes and stigma. Also, the tool emphasizes the highly variable and individual nature of baseline risk.</description>
