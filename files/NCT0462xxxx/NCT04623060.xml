  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To examine the feasibility of Low-Volume Interval Training (LV-ITT) and Resistance Exercise&#xD;
      (RE) on walking performance (walking endurance, gait speed, functional balance), lower limb&#xD;
      muscle strength and quality of life among individuals with post-stroke.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prescribing aerobic and resistance training in concurrence is proposed as an optimum strategy&#xD;
      to target cardiovascular as well as musculoskeletal functions in individuals with&#xD;
      post-stroke. Lower limb's resistance training alone in chronic stroke produces a large effect&#xD;
      on muscle strength. However, it has shown uncertainty results on walking performance.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is suggested that to prescribe mix training (treadmill training and strength&#xD;
      training) in order to improve muscle strength, gait performance and quality of life in stroke&#xD;
      survivors. Previous studies have shown the effect of mixed training on walking performance&#xD;
      and endurance in other populations such as multiple sclerosis and coronary artery disease.&#xD;
      However, there is a lack of study that conducted mixed training among chronic post-stroke.&#xD;
      Therefore, the feasibility study on the effectiveness of combining LV-ITT and RE in&#xD;
      post-stroke should be conducted.&#xD;

    <description>This test measures the distance that an individual can quickly walk in a period of 6 minutes on a flat surface. Participants will complete one trial with the gait aide prescribed to them. The distance will be recorded. Participants can stop and rest or discontinue to the test at any time.</description>

    <intervention_name>Combination of Low-volume interval treadmill training and Resistance Training</intervention_name>
    <description>Low-volume interval training (LV-ITT) protocols included a 5 min warm-up (30%-50%VO2peak) up to 20min of LV-ITT and a 5 min cooling down (30%-50% VO2peak). The LV-ITT will repeat 60s bursts of fast treadmill walking at maximum tolerate speed (0% incline), alternate with pre-specified recovery periods about 4 minutes according to protocol. Each time the participants completed a burst successfully, treadmill speed will be increased by 0.1 mph for the next burst. The recovery periods will be 4 minutes. The intervention will be conducted for about 30 minutes.&#xD;
Resistance training will be conducted by using a horizontal leg press machine. They are encouraged to focus on an explosive concentric movement and a controlled eccentric movement such that the time on each phase was in the ratio 1:2.</description>
