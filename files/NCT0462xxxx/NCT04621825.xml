  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The design of the study is an open label, multicentre, single arm trial with subjects with&#xD;
      moderate to heavily exuding chronic and acute wounds consisting of pressure ulcers, leg&#xD;
      ulcers, diabetic leg and foot ulcers, surgical wounds first degree superficial and partial&#xD;
      thickness burns. The performance data from this study will support clinically meaningful&#xD;
      rates of successful improvement in the signs and symptoms of infection, without refection&#xD;
      during 6- week treatment and follow up period.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Immediately following initial assessment, dressing removal every 7 days follow up visits, for 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Effectiveness (performance) of the ActivHeal Silicone PHMB will be evaluated for efficacy success according to the following success criteria:&#xD;
Reduction in signs and symptoms of infection from baseline as defined as&#xD;
The change from the Investigator's opinion of infection being present to no longer being present, or&#xD;
If the Investigator determines infection is still present there is improvement in severity of at least two.&#xD;
No worsening of any signs/ symptoms of infection at 6 weeks or if infection resolved prior to 6 weeks, that no new evidence of infection occurred during the 6 week treatment follow up.</description>

    <measure>Effectiveness of the ActivHeal Silicone PHMB foam adhesive and Non Adhesive foam dressing in terms of wound progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately following initial assessment, dressing removal every 7 days follow up visits, for 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Wound progression, assessed as the change from baseline to end of follow up. Monitoring of tissue types %,decrease in devitalised tissue, size and depth of wound.</description>

    <measure>Effectiveness of the ActivHeal Silicone PHMB foam adhesive and Non Adhesive foam dressing in terms of pain.</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately following initial assessment, dressing removal every 7 days follow up visits, for 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Change in patient pain will be assessed using Visual Analogue Scale, VAS, from baseline to end of follow up. Pain will assessed by completion of a Visual Analogue Scale VAS (0= no pain to 10 = worst pain imaginable).</description>

    <description>Patient pain will be assessed on removal of the ActivHeal Silicone PHMB foam adhesive and Non Adhesive foam dressing ActivHeal Silicone PHMB foam adhesive and Non Adhesive foam dressing. Pain will assessed by completion of a Visual Analogue Scale, VAS(0= no pain to 10 = worst pain imaginable).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effectiveness of the ActivHeal Silicone PHMB foam adhesive and Non Adhesive foam dressing in terms of peri wound skin.</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately following initial assessment, dressing removal every 7 days follow up visits, for 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in the peri wound skin, prevents maceration. (Allows the uptake of exudate into the dressing.) Relative score will be used to score maceration of zero (no maceration), one (minimal maceration), two (moderate maceration), and three (excessive maceration and need to withdraw patient from study). Success will be determined that over the evaluation an increased score would represent peri wound deterioration.</description>

    <measure>Effectiveness of the ActivHeal Silicone PHMB foam adhesive and Non Adhesive foam dressing in terms of dressing removal.</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately following initial assessment, dressing removal every 7 days follow up visits, for 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Did the dressing cause trauma on removal to the wound (prevents formulation of granulation tissue growth into the pores of the dressing). Clinician and patient satisfaction with the device (ease of removal and no pain or trauma on removal) will be assessed using a likert type scale. (Very satisfied, Satisfied and not Satisfied).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effectiveness of the ActivHeal Silicone PHMB foam adhesive and Non Adhesive foam dressing in terms of repositioning.</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately following initial assessment, dressing removal every 7 days follow up visits, for 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Can the dressing be repositioned and or lifted, securely placed back down. Clinician satisfaction with the device (conformability &amp; ease of use) will be assessed using a Likert type scale. (Very satisfied, Satisfied and not Satisfied)</description>
