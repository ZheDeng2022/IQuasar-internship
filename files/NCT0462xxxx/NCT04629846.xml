    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial，parallel control designed to evaluate&#xD;
      treatment with trastuzumab + QL1209 + docetaxel compared with trastuzumab + pertuzumab +&#xD;
      docetaxel in the participants with early-stage or locally advanced HER2-positive and estrogen&#xD;
      receptor/progesterone receptor negative breast cancer. The anticipated treatment duration is&#xD;

      This is A multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel control，comparative clinical&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate whether the clinical efficacy of QL1209 and pertuzumab&#xD;
      are similar in patients with early-stage or locally advanced HER2-positive and estrogen&#xD;
      receptor/progesterone receptor negative breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective are to evaluate whether the clinical safety and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      QL1209 and pertuzumab are similar in patients with early-stage or locally advanced&#xD;
      HER2-positive and estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor negative breast cancer.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With an Objective Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Before surgery</time_frame>
    <description>An objective response was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a complete response or partial response as the best tumor response during the neoadjuvant period (that is, during Cycles 1-4 prior to surgery), as determined by the investigator on the basis of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. No confirmation was required for objective response. Only participants with measurable disease at baseline were included in the analysis. The duration of one treatment cycle is 21 days; the administration of therapy in Cycle 5 should not occur until 2 weeks after surgery.</description>
