      The trial is divided into two parts, one is dose escalation phase, the second one is dose&#xD;
      expansion phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For dose escalation phase, the main purpose is to evaluate safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      XZP-5809-TT1 tablets after treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) in patients With T790M Mutation-positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic&#xD;
      Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For dose expansion phase, the main purpose is to evaluate Objective response rate (ORR) in&#xD;
      patients With T790M Mutation-positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung&#xD;
      Cancer.&#xD;
