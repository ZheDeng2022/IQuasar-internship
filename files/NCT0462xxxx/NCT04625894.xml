  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, single-arm phase I clinical study to exploratory observe&#xD;
      and evaluate the efficacy and safety of anti-PD-1 antibody (Camrelizumab for Injection)&#xD;
      combined with multisite stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) in patients with&#xD;
      oligometastatic gastrointestinal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the origin site of metastases, this study will consist of three subgroups,&#xD;
      including gastric carcinoma group, colorectal carcinoma group and hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      group. For each of the subgroup, seven eligible patients with oligometastatic cancer&#xD;
      originating from stomach, colon and liver, respectively will be recruited. All patients will&#xD;
      receive multisite SABR followed by immunotherapy of Camrelizumab within one week from&#xD;
      completion. Camrelizumab will be administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg intravenously (iv) on&#xD;
      D1 in a 14-day cycle. The treatment will continue for up to two years until disease&#xD;
      progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor tissue samples, sections, paraffin blocks or biopsy blocks, and biomarkers, including&#xD;
      but not limited to PD-L1 expression level and the proportion of positive cells, TMB level and&#xD;
      MMR status, will be collected from subjects.&#xD;
