  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM) is a widespread and invalidating disease that requires a multidisciplinary&#xD;
      approach. Particularly, the psychiatric component seems to influence the algological&#xD;
      management of these patients. Since January 2018, the HADS, SF-36, IMSA, TCI&#xD;
      psycho-attitudinal questionnaires have been introduced in the Pain Therapy unit of&#xD;
      Policlinico Sant'Orsola-Malpighi in an attempt to improve the care of patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      FM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to identify, through retrospective evaluation of TCI tests and its&#xD;
      subdomains, compiled by patients with FM diagnosis, Pain Avoidance and Pain Persistance&#xD;
      personality patterns, indicated in the literature. Anxiety and Depression incidence is also&#xD;
      observed through retrospective evaluation of HADS tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the Antalgic Therapy Outpatient Clinic diagnosed with FM, aged ≥18 years, who&#xD;
      have completed selfadministered psychoattitudinal tests from January 2018 to January 2019&#xD;
      were considered. The data were collected in aggregate and extrapolated anonymously.&#xD;
