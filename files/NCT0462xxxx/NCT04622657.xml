    <textblock>
      In order to achieve collaborative patient-centered rehabilitation in Parkinson's disease,&#xD;
      detailed evaluation of walking and balance in evaluating the perceived difficulty in daily&#xD;
      life is important to evaluate the progression of the disease and its response to treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, there are many scales that evaluate balance and functional performance in&#xD;
      Parkinson Disease. However there is no validity and reliability study of Dubousset Function&#xD;
      Test developed to evaluate balance and functional performance of Parkinson Disease. For this&#xD;
      reason, the aim of study is to examine the validity and reliability of Dubousset Function&#xD;
      Test in Parkinson Disease.&#xD;

      Balance disorders are very common in patients with Parkinson's, and these disorders&#xD;
      significantly affect the patient's body alignment and participation. Especially during&#xD;
      walking, balance disorders occur, resulting in falls, disability and injury in the advanced&#xD;
      stage of the disease. As a result of these losses in patients, falls can be seen, and the&#xD;
      severity of disability that increases with age affects the quality of life of individuals by&#xD;
      affecting their living in their own homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dubousset Functional Test (DFT); A conceptually practical four-component assessment test has&#xD;
      been proposed by Dr. Jean Dubousset to assess the functional capacity of adult individuals.&#xD;
      The validity of the test was made in individuals with spinal deformity. DFT; It consists of&#xD;
      four components: getting up from a chair without arms and walking 5 meters forward and&#xD;
      backward, descending and climbing steps, transition from standing to sitting on the ground,&#xD;
      and the dual task test in which the individual walks while counting down from 50 at the same&#xD;
      time&#xD;
&#xD;

    <description>The four components of the DFT included (1) the Up Walking Test: participants rose without assistance from a and seated position in a chair that did not have arms, walked 5 meters (500 cm) forward before stopping, walked backwards 5 meters, and sat again without assistance; (2) the Steps Test: from a starting position 50 cm away, volunteers climbed three stairs, turned around on the third step (top), and walked down the three steps; (3) Down and Sitting Test: from a standing position, participants sat on the ground and stood up again, using assistance as needed; (4) Dual-Tasking Test: participants walked 5 meters forward, turned around, and walked 5 meters back to the starting position while performing a working memory test (counting down from 50 by intervals of 2).</description>

    <description>A standard chair is used for testing. First, the patient is asked to sit on the chair. The patient is then asked to stand up and walk regularly at a distance of 3 meters with a predetermined length, then return to the chair after 3 meters.</description>

    <description>A distance of 3 m is measured and marked with black tape. Individuals are asked to follow the heel and black band.&#xD;
With the 'start' command they are asked to walk backwards quickly. When the distance of 3 m is completed, a stop is instructed. Individuals are not allowed to run during the test. They are allowed to look back if they wish. The assessor walks behind individuals throughout the test. The test is repeated 3 times, the averages are recorded</description>
