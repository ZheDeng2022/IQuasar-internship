    <textblock>
      We aim to evaluate the role of Ultrasound-guided (USG) fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)&#xD;
      in diagnosis of pancreatic masses compared to endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided fine needle&#xD;
      aspiration cytology (FNAC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United&#xD;
      States. Over 45,000 patients are diagnosed each year in the United States, and the majority&#xD;
      of these patients succumb to their disease. Eighty percentages of patients are diagnosed with&#xD;
      advanced, unrespectable disease. According to the latest statistics, only 7 % of patients&#xD;
      survive 5 years after diagnosis. While the 5-year survival rate improves to 25 % in patients&#xD;
      presenting with stage 1or localized disease, only 9 % of patients are identified at this&#xD;
      early stage. The majority of patients (53%) presents with distant metastatic disease, and&#xD;
      have a 5-year survival of 2%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improving the prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer is a challenge. Overall,&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer has one of the worst prognoses among all cancers; however, the prognosis is&#xD;
      better if cancer is detected at an early stage. For example, patients with pancreatic cancers&#xD;
      â‰¤1 cm in size at the time of diagnosis have a 5-year survival rate of 80.4% . Because such&#xD;
      small cancers now account for 0.8% of all pancreatic cancer, detection of more small cancers&#xD;
      would contribute to improving mortality rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnostic approach to a possible pancreatic mass lesion relies first upon various&#xD;
      non-invasive imaging modalities, including computed tomography, ultrasound, and magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging techniques. Once a suspect lesion has been identified, tissue acquisition&#xD;
      for characterization of the lesion is often paramount in developing an individualized&#xD;
      therapeutic approach. Tools , in addition to radiologic imaging , currently employed in the&#xD;
      initial evaluation of a patient with a pancreatic mass lesion include serum tumor markers ,&#xD;
      endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, Ultrasound-guided (USG) fine needle&#xD;
      aspiration cytology (FNAC) and endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA)&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advancements in radiologic and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) imaging have improved our ability&#xD;
      to detect and stage pancreatic masses allowing for more selective surgical intervention for&#xD;
      patients with resectable disease. Owing to the low sensitivity of cross-sectional imaging to&#xD;
      detect small tumors in the pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), in which the tip of the endoscope contains a high-frequency&#xD;
      transducer , provides high resolution images of the pancreas. Indeed , its high resolution in&#xD;
      experienced hands enables detection of focal lesions as small as 2-5 mm .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound-guided (USG) fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) has emerged as a primary&#xD;
      diagnostic modality in investigation in patients with pancreatic lesions. This technique was&#xD;
      introduced into clinical practice nearly 3 decades ago and has proved to be a simple,&#xD;
      cost-effective and minimally invasive technique that can yield material for tissue diagnosis&#xD;
      .&#xD;
