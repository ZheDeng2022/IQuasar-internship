      This two-group, randomized control trial (RCT) will test the effects of a home-based, 16 week&#xD;
      gait/balance training plus resistance (exercise bands) exercise program as compared to an&#xD;
      educational cancer survivorship attention control condition to address persistent&#xD;
      taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy in 312 patients treated for invasive breast cancer with&#xD;
      taxanes at 1 year or more after completion of therapy. Assessments of lower extremity muscle&#xD;
      strength, gait/balance, nerve conduction, neuropathy symptoms, and quality of life (QOL) will&#xD;
      be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed exercise intervention addresses gait/balance impairments and motor (resistance)&#xD;
      components of taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy. The mechanism by which the intervention&#xD;
      achieves the proposed outcomes is though 1) increasing endoneurial blood flow to peripheral&#xD;
      nerves and mitochondria resulting in reduction in neuropathic symptoms (including pain) and&#xD;
      clinical manifestations of peripheral neuropathy, while improving gait/balance in those with&#xD;
      persistent neuropathy; 2) The subsequent increase in nutrient supply allows the mitochondria&#xD;
      to function more efficiently, and may alleviate the neuropathic manifestations of&#xD;
      taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy. 15&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first study proposing to test the home-delivery of an exercise intervention&#xD;
      specifically aimed at persistent (long-term) taxane-induced neuropathy. If successful, this&#xD;
      study will provide the only evidence-based intervention for patients suffering from&#xD;
      persistent neuropathy from neurotoxic chemotherapy. Additionally, the home-delivery format&#xD;
      makes this intervention easily translated into clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a sample of patients who completed a taxane-containing chemotherapy regimen (&gt; 1 year) for&#xD;
      breast cancer and who have a persistent neuropathy (VAS score of &gt; 3) the specific aims of&#xD;
      this RCT are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test the efficacy of a 16-week -delivered program of gait/balance training plus&#xD;
           resistance exercise, compared to an educational attention control condition in&#xD;
           increasing muscle strength, improving gait/balance and nerve conduction parameters,&#xD;
           decreasing the severity of taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy symptoms, and increasing&#xD;
           quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate for differences in muscle strength, gait/balance, sensory (sural) and motor&#xD;
           (peroneal) nerve conduction, peripheral neuropathy symptoms, and quality of life (QOL)&#xD;
           between patients who receive the exercise program, compared to those in an educational&#xD;
           attention control condition controlling for age, BMI, taxane cycles and intervals,&#xD;
           neuropathic pain, neuropathy/pain medications, current resistance exercise participation&#xD;
           and falls/near falls experienced.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of taxanes in breast cancer chemotherapy regimens is considered standard first line&#xD;
      therapy.1 However, taxanes are known to induce peripheral neuropathy, from 59-87% for&#xD;
      paclitaxel and from 11-64% for docetaxel. 2-4 Sensory manifestations can include pain;&#xD;
      numbness, tingling, &amp; burning; diminished proprioception, and decreased vibration and touch&#xD;
      sensation. 5-6 Motor symptoms such as lower extremity muscle weakness and impaired balance&#xD;
      has been reported. 7 Currently, peripheral neuropathy remains a significant toxicity&#xD;
      resulting in taxane chemotherapy dose reductions or discontinuation, with no evidence-based&#xD;
      preventative or treatment strategies are available. 8 Taxanes induce sensory and motor&#xD;
      neuropathy by inducing both mitochondrial and vascular dysfunction.9 In rodents, treatment&#xD;
      with taxanes resulted in swollen, vacuolated axonal mitochondria that are functionally&#xD;
      impaired, producing a chronic energy deficit.10 In addition, toxic effects to the endothelial&#xD;
      cells of the vasa nervorum (small arterioles that supply peripheral nerves) in the dorsal&#xD;
      root ganglia attenuates blood flow to neurons, resulting in endothelial cell death. 11 These&#xD;
      findings suggest that both mitochondrial impairment and vascular damage are major mechanisms&#xD;
      that underlie the development of taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy, manifesting as sensory&#xD;
      manifestations and neuropathic pain. 9-12&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mitochondrial and vascular dysfunctions lead to sensory loss and reduced muscle strength,&#xD;
      functions dependent upon cellular mitochondria to generate energy in the form of ATP&#xD;
      (adenosine triphosphate). Thus, mitochondrial dysfunction results in the loss of&#xD;
      energy-generating capability, and vascular impairment deprives muscle and nerve cells of&#xD;
      oxygen-rich nutrients, further impairing neuronal function. A limited number of human and&#xD;
      animal studies have demonstrated that exercise stimulates endothelium-dependent vasodilation&#xD;
      and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, increasing endoneurial blood flow&#xD;
      and energy generating capacity through mitochondrial protein synthesis and glycolysis, 13, 14&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed exercise intervention addresses gait/balance impairments and motor (resistance)&#xD;
      components of taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy. The mechanism by which the intervention&#xD;
      achieves the proposed outcomes is though 1) increasing endoneurial blood flow to peripheral&#xD;
      nerves and mitochondria resulting in reduction in neuropathic symptoms (including pain) and&#xD;
      clinical manifestations of peripheral neuropathy, while improving gait/balance in those with&#xD;
      persistent neuropathy; 2) The subsequent increase in nutrient supply allows the mitochondria&#xD;
      to function more efficiently, and may alleviate the neuropathic manifestations of&#xD;
      taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention will consist of a 16-week, home-based gait/balance training and progressive resistance exercises for lower extremities using resistance power bands. Participants will be given the home-based gait/balance training and progressive resistance exercise training access via a link or by DVD, and the resistance training band, and wide, firm foam surface. The intervention group will begin with light warm-up and stretching activity then a 10 minute each of gait/balance and 10 minutes of resistive (strength) training components. The program begins with light stretching to address any range of motion limitations that may affect ability to maintain balance and postural stability, and consisted of hamstring quadricep, gastroc, and soleus stretches. During stretching exercises, participants held each stretch for 10-15 seconds, repeating each stretch 2-3 times for each lower extremity. Stretching exercises do not change during the intervention.</description>

    <description>The Attention Control group will receive an educational intervention via a journal in which to record their clinic appointments, and standardized American Cancer Society pamphlets which have been adjusted to fit within the journal binding for easy reference. At each data collection encounter, the intervention research assistant will discuss the information in each pamphlet, allowing time for questions related to the material. The educational materials consist of 1) Emotions and Breast Cancer; 2) Body Image and Sexuality After Breast Cancer; 3) Follow up Care After Breast Cancer Treatment; 4) Nutrition and Cancer. Sessions last approximately 45-60 minutes and occur at the same intervals as the intervention group and will precede data collection. Attention Control group participants will receive telephone calls every other week which will entail a social visit and reminder of data collection/attention intervention appointments to further equalize contact.</description>
