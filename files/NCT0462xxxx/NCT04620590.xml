      Open label, mechanistic, single-arm study to evaluate the natriuretic effect of 2 weeks&#xD;
      dapagliflozin treatment in T2DM patients with impaired renal function. It will measure the&#xD;
      average change in 24-hr sodium excretion from average Baseline to average values at Day 2 to&#xD;
      4 within the study group. The study will allow for an up to 6-week Screening and Run-in&#xD;
      Period, a 2-week Treatment Period and a 5-day Follow-up Period. Patients will consume food&#xD;
      from standardized food boxes starting on Day -6 (patients not on insulin) or Day -20 at the&#xD;
      earliest (patients on insulin) of the study until Day 18 (inclusive). Eligible patients will&#xD;
      receive dapagliflozin 10 mg tablets once daily for 14±1 days starting on Day 1. This will be&#xD;
      followed by a Follow-up Period of 5 days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, mechanistic, single-arm study to evaluate the natriuretic effect of 2&#xD;
      weeks dapagliflozin treatment in T2DM patients with impaired renal function. The study&#xD;
      population is as described below. The maximum duration of the study will be 62 days including&#xD;
      the allowed window periods for the study (±1 day for Visit 7 at Day 13). The study will allow&#xD;
      for an up to 6-week Screening and Run-in Period. The Run-in Period should always last 6 days&#xD;
      for patients not on insulin but may be up to 20 days (day -20 to day -1) for patients on&#xD;
      insulin. Patients on insulin may require a longer Run-in Period in order to be able to adjust&#xD;
      their insulin requirements according to the caloric content of the food boxes, if needed. It&#xD;
      is recommended to keep the insulin dose stable during the trial, but investigators can change&#xD;
      the dose if medically required. However, it is not mandatory for the patient on insulin to&#xD;
      use the entire extended Run-in Period. Based on the Investigator's judgement, the Run-in&#xD;
      Period may be shortened once each patient (on insulin) has had sufficient time to adapt to&#xD;
      the food boxes, and it is determined that the patient's insulin requirement has stabilised&#xD;
      sufficiently to continue in the study. The study will then include a 2-week Treatment Period&#xD;
      (Day 1 to Day 14) and a 5-day Follow-up Period: Day 15 to Day 19. Patients will consume food&#xD;
      from standardised food boxes (with sodium content 150 mmol) starting on Day -6 (patients not&#xD;
      on insulin) or Day -20 at the earliest (patients on insulin) of the study until Day 18&#xD;
      (inclusive). Eligible patients will receive dapagliflozin 10 mg tablets once daily for 14±1&#xD;
      days starting on Day 1. This will be followed by a Follow-up Period of 5 days.&#xD;

    <description>Dapagliflozin is a stable, reversible, highly selective, and orally active inhibitor of human renal sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2), the major transporter responsible for glucose reabsorption in the kidney. Patients will receive one tablet dapagliflozin 10 mg per day for a total period of 14±1 days. This dose is the recommended dose for monotherapy and for add-on combination therapy with other glucose-lowering medicinal products including insulin to improve glycaemic control in T2DM.</description>
