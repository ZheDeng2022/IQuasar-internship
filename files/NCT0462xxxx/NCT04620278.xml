  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical information and samples (blood, saliva, and tumor) will be collected from patients&#xD;
      with multiple cancers and/or a family history of cancer as well as from affected and&#xD;
      unaffected relatives; samples will be systematically sequenced and evaluated for candidate&#xD;
      driver mutations.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Genetic screening will be performed on DNA (and/or RNA) isolated from collected samples from&#xD;
      affected individuals by whole exome sequencing or RNA sequencing using in-house pipeline to&#xD;
      identify candidate sequence variants. These variants will be tested for segregation with the&#xD;
      phenotype in other relatives (affected/unaffected). Candidate variants will be subjected to&#xD;
      additional downstream analysis, to be guided by the actual type of gene/variant.&#xD;

          1. Any age&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Meets at least ONE of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Personal history (with documented diagnosis) of cancer before the age of 50&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Personal history of more than one primary cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Documented diagnosis of cancer AND family history of that same cancer type or&#xD;
                  multiple other cancers that do not fit classical criteria of hereditary cancer&#xD;
                  syndromes&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Documented diagnosis of a rare cancer AND family history of rare cancers that do&#xD;
                  not fit classical criteria of hereditary cancer syndromes&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. There is the same type of cancer in several generations of a family&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Documented diagnosis of multicentric cancers (e.g bilateral cancers in paired&#xD;
                  organs, or multifocal cancers in single organs) that usually occur as single&#xD;
                  lesions when presented sporadically&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Early onset cancer (before the age of 50, or breast cancer before age 45) AND&#xD;
                  family history of early onset cancer Capable of providing access to detailed&#xD;
                  medical records and family history of cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Established genetic diagnosis of a known hereditary cancer syndrome that is compatible&#xD;
             with the clinical presentation&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Incarcerated&#xD;
