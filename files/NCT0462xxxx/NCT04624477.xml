  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational, multi-center study examining the long-term outcomes of&#xD;
      patients with small, low risk papillary thyroid cancer who offered the choice of active&#xD;
      surveillance (close follow-up to monitor for potential disease progression) or immediate&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational multi-center study, building on an initial single-centre&#xD;
      study from Toronto, Canada (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03271892). Adult patients with&#xD;
      small, low-risk papillary thyroid cancer may choose either active surveillance (close&#xD;
      follow-up with the intention of surgery if the disease progresses or if the patient changes&#xD;
      their mind and wants surgery) or immediate thyroid surgery (thyroidectomy). Patients who&#xD;
      choose active surveillance are clinically followed at the participating study centre and&#xD;
      those who choose surgery, receive usual care from their treating surgeon and/or other thyroid&#xD;
      cancer specialists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thyroid cancer clinical and treatment outcomes are tracked (by medical record review) at&#xD;
      least yearly for up to 10 years after enrollment. Patients are also asked to complete study&#xD;
      questionnaires (patient reported outcomes) yearly for up to 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlying assumption in the study is that since patients' disease management goals&#xD;
      differ for individuals choosing active surveillance and those choosing surgery, 'successful'&#xD;
      disease management is defined differently for these patient groups. For patients choosing&#xD;
      active surveillance, successful disease management may be defined by avoiding thyroid surgery&#xD;
      for thyroid cancer progression (i.e. thyroid cancer that has grown or spread to other&#xD;
      tissues). For patients choosing surgery, the ultimate goal is cure of the thyroid cancer&#xD;
      (i.e. no thyroid cancer detected at long-term follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis in this study is a description of how often patients' initial disease&#xD;
      management goals are not achieved at long-term follow-up. For this study, 'failure' of&#xD;
      disease management is defined as follows: a) in active surveillance group - surgery for&#xD;
      disease progression, and b) in the immediate surgery group - requiring additional treatment&#xD;
      for persistent or recurrent thyroid cancer (i.e. thyroid cancer that is detected and treated&#xD;
      in follow-up). Thyroid cancer clinical and treatment outcomes as well as patient&#xD;
      questionnaire outcomes will be reported.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants in the Active Surveillance Group who Experience 'Failure' of Active Surveillance Disease Management</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an estimated average of 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>'Failure' of Active Surveillance Disease Management is defined as: surgery for the indication of thyroid cancer that has progressed during study monitoring. Thyroid cancer disease progression under active surveillance includes: a) thyroid cancer enlargement &gt; 3mm in largest dimension, b) thyroid cancer growth in a location that is concerning (e.g. extension outside of the thyroid, concerning proximity to critical structures such as the trachea or recurrent laryngeal nerve), or c) development of metastatic disease (in lymph nodes or distant organs). The specific type of disease progression will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants in the Surgical Group who Experience 'Failure' of Surgical Disease Management</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an estimated average of 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>For patients who choose immediate surgery for management of thyroid cancer, the intent of surgery is curative. Thus, 'failure' of surgical disease management is defined by receiving additional treatment for structural thyroid cancer detected at follow-up (i.e. treatment of thyroid cancer detected on imaging or biopsy during follow-up). Additional thyroid cancer treatment may include additional surgery, radioactive iodine, ethanol ablation of lymph nodes, or external beam radiation treatment. The specific treatment used for recurrent or persistent thyroid cancer and the indication for the treatment will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants in Respective Thyroid Cancer Disease Status Categories at Last Follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an estimated average of 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The category of thyroid cancer disease status at last follow-up is recorded at least yearly. For patients in the active surveillance arm, disease status categories include: a) alive with no disease progression, b) alive with cross-over to surgery (with indication for surgery, including disease progression or other reason), c) death due to thyroid cancer, or d) death from any cause. For surgical patients and patients who crossed over to surgery from active surveillance, post-surgical disease status categories include: a) alive with no evidence of thyroid cancer structural disease at last follow-up (e.g.. no evidence of thyroid cancer on imaging or biopsy), b) alive with evidence of thyroid cancer structural disease present at last follow-up (i.e. evidence of thyroid cancer on imaging or biopsy), c) death due to thyroid cancer, or d) death from any cause.</description>

    <description>For patients who undergo thyroidectomy during the study, the presence of long-term surgical complications (&gt; 1 year after initial completion of surgery) will be reported. Specific surgical complications that will be tracked include: a) hypoparathyroidism (requiring prescription treatment), or b) recurrent laryngeal nerve injury.</description>

    <description>Patients under active surveillance choose to not have immediate thyroid surgery. Patients are closely monitored with respect to clinical status, ultrasound imaging, biochemical indices (thyroid function, thyroglobulin, and thyroglobulin antibodies) and any thyroid cancer-related treatments (if received). Active surveillance is conducted at a participating study site. Criteria defining disease progression are established, and if such criteria are met, thyroid surgery is recommended to the patient. However, patients are free to choose to have thyroid surgery at any time, in the absence of disease progression. Thyroid cancer clinical and treatment outcomes are tracked by the study team.</description>

    <description>Patients who choose surgery, undergo thyroidectomy, as per current standards of care, by a surgeon of their choice in an institution of their choice. The treating surgeon, in discussion with the patient, will choose the extent of thyroid surgery that may be appropriate for the individual case. Post-surgical follow-up is per the discretion of the treating surgeon, endocrinologist, or other healthcare providers involved in the patient's thyroid cancer care. Thyroid cancer clinical and treatment outcomes are tracked by the study team.</description>
