  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of Contrast Enhanced Spectral&#xD;
      Mammography (CEDM) in predicting early neoadjuvant therapy response and pathologic complete&#xD;
      response (pCR) compared to mammography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer with available mammography and ultrasound&#xD;
      imaging are eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be imaged at baseline (before initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      or endocrine therapy), early (2-4 cycles of neoadjuvant therapy) and late (after completion&#xD;
      of neoadjuvant chemotherapy or endocrine therapy) timepoints with mammography. CEDM will be&#xD;
      done within 2 weeks of the specified timepoint. Additionally, a survey of subject experience&#xD;
      with CEDM and other pre-operative imaging will be collected after CEDM is performed.&#xD;

      The use of neoadjuvant systemic therapy in the treatment of breast cancer patients is&#xD;
      increasing beyond the scope of locally advanced disease. Imaging provides important&#xD;
      information in assessing response to therapy as a complement to conventional tumor&#xD;
      measurements via physical examination. Tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy can also provide&#xD;
      prognostic information. The attainment of pCR after completion of neoadjuvant therapy and&#xD;
      surgical resection is associated with improved disease-free survival. This correlation is&#xD;
      especially strong for Triple-receptor negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2&#xD;
      (HER-2) positive breast cancer. Studies of neoadjuvant therapy have used a variety of methods&#xD;
      for assessing tumor response. Currently, there are no established clinical practice&#xD;
      guidelines for how best to assess tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy. Typically, patients&#xD;
      undergo conventional breast imaging such as mammography and ultrasonography (US) and physical&#xD;
      examination, and dynamic contrast-enhanced breast magnetic resonance imaging (DCR-MRI) in&#xD;
      selected cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrast Enhanced Digital Mammography (CEDM) is a novel imaging technique, which allows&#xD;
      digital mammography to be used with contrast enhancement to depict cancers that would&#xD;
      otherwise be occult on standard unenhanced mammography. CEDM is performed with and without&#xD;
      intravenous iodine contrast, using the dual energy subtraction technique. Compared with&#xD;
      mammography and US, CEDM improves the sensitivity for breast cancer detection without&#xD;
      decreasing specificity. CEDM digital detector has higher spatial resolution than MRI,&#xD;
      revealing details that are approximately 10 times better. In contrast to the rapid washout in&#xD;
      MRI, enhancement on CEDM in fact persists for at least 10 min after contrast agent infusion.&#xD;
      Today CEDM is available commercially for clinical use. It is estimated that over 200,000 CEDM&#xD;
      examinations have been performed to date in both research and clinical settings. CEDM costs&#xD;
      significantly less compared to MRI. Furthermore, longer time delays between contrast&#xD;
      injection and CEDM exposure could result in stronger enhancement and hence better visibility&#xD;
      compared to MRI, especially given the much higher spatial resolution of digital mammography.&#xD;
      It is unknown whether CEDM can improve the sensitivity of mammography in the early assessment&#xD;
      of neoadjuvant therapy response. We hypothesize that CEDM is superior to mammography and&#xD;
      ultrasound in assessing early response, and pre-surgical residual cancer after neoadjuvant&#xD;
      therapy, and when performed, non-inferior to MRI in assessing the residual disease using the&#xD;
      metrics of pCR and residual cancer burden (RCB).&#xD;
