    <description>The single ascending dose trial set up 7 dose groups of 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60 and 80 mg. The 2.5 mg dose group was the exploratory part with open label, while the other dose groups were double-blind. 8 subjects were randomly enrolled in each dose group, 6 of whom received FCN-207 tablets and 2 of whom received placebo. This part of the study evaluated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies of single dose FCN-207 tablets in healthy volunteers.</description>

    <description>Twelve subjects were enrolled and randomly divided into two groups. The subjects were given FCN-207 tablets after fasting and high-fat diet with double Cross experiment , and feces samples were collected for metabolism/excretion characteristics study.</description>

    <description>A total of 16 subjects were randomly assigned to each dose group for multiple dose study , including 12 who received FCN-207 tablets and 4 who received placebo for a 10-day administration cycle. The dosage of multiple administration was based on the results of single ascending dose study results , and the method of drug administration refers to the results of the food influence test.</description>
