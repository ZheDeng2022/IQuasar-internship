      The investigators will perform this study to prospectively compare the clinical outcome after&#xD;
      percutaneous microwave ablation(MWA) and breast conserving surgery of benign and malignant&#xD;
      breast lesion under ultrasound (US) guidance.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A total of more than 300 patients diagnosed with breast tumor in multiple centers will be&#xD;
      recruited in this study and underwent US-guided percutaneous MWA and breast conserving&#xD;
      surgery treatment. Information for each patient includes demographics; longest diameters of&#xD;
      tumors; tumor numbers; tumor pathological type; location of tumor according to whether&#xD;
      adjacent to skin, pectoralis, areola and papilla. Ablation variables including session,&#xD;
      puncture, time, and power; complete ablation, complications; reduction in volume,&#xD;
      palpability, pain and cosmetic satisfying outcomes,recurrence,survival will be compared and&#xD;
      analyzed.&#xD;

    <description>Microwave ablation（MWA）refers to all electromagnetic methods of inducing tumor destruction by using devices with frequencies greater than or equal to 900MHz. The rotation of dipole molecules accounts for most of the heat generated during MWA. Water molecules as dipoles attempt to continuously reorient at the same rate in microwave's oscillating electric field. As a result of microwave transmission, the water molecules flip back and forth billions of times a second. The vigorous movement of water molecules produce friction and heat, thus inducing cellular death via coagulation necrosis. The microwave unit (KY-2000, Kangyou Medical, Nanjing, China) is capable of producing 100 Watts of power at 2450 MHz.The needle antenna has a diameter of 1.6 mm (16G) and a length of 10 cm. The active tip length is 3mm and 5mm.</description>

    <description>Breast-conserving surgery refers to the removal of the primary tumor and adjacent breast tissue, supplemented by postoperative radiotherapy.Its principle is to remove the primary tumor completely while meet patient's cosmetic satisfaction.The combined treatment of early breast cancer with radiotherapy and chemotherapy is the same as radical surgery or modified radical surgery in terms of local and regional control rate and long-term survival rate. Breast conserving surgery and postoperative comprehensive treatment have become one of the main methods for the treatment of early breast cancer.</description>

    <description>Microwave ablation has the advantages of aesthetics, precise positioning, minimally invasive and painless for patients with early breast cancer.The tumor can be completely killed without injurying adjacent tissue. Some studies have suggested MWA is a safe and effective therapy for the treatment of breast cancer.</description>

    <description>The treatment of early-stage breast cancer tends to be less-invasive including less morbidity, shorter hospitalization, and improved cosmetic results. Many reports have concluded that there was no difference between breast-conserving surgery and the traditional radical mastectomy for early stage breast cancer in time to distant metastases or overall survival, so breast-conserving surgery is becoming an alternative treatment for early-stage breast cancer.</description>
