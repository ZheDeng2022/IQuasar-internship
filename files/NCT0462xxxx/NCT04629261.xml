    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effect of the ECOBICI program in Mexico City on health indicators, activity&#xD;
      levels, mental health, and quality of life and diet after 3 months of follow-up.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) are one&#xD;
      of the main causes of death in the world and in Mexico. According to the 2016 National Health&#xD;
      and Nutrition Survey (ENSANUT), 9.4% has previously diagnosed diabetes and the prevalence of&#xD;
      overweight and obesity is 71.2% in adults. Among the main risk factors for the development of&#xD;
      these diseases are an unbalanced diet, physical inactivity and sedentarism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the World Health Organization (WHO), accumulating at least 150 minutes/week of&#xD;
      moderate-vigorous physical activity either during occupational, home, leisure time and&#xD;
      transportation for at least 10 continuous minutes could result multiple benefits, such as the&#xD;
      reduction of seven types of NCDs including DM2 and obesity. It has been observed that&#xD;
      cycling, compared to other activities during leisure time, appears to be an efficient form of&#xD;
      daily exercise and feasible to increase physical activity levels even in the most physically&#xD;
      inactive individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to a cross-sectional study in 14 countries including the United States, it was&#xD;
      observed that adults who commuted by bicycle had a lower risk of DM2 and obesity.&#xD;
      Additionally, results from randomized controlled studies have shown that cycling may help&#xD;
      reducing body fat and increase maximal oxygen consumption. However, some factors, such as the&#xD;
      lack of attractive bike paths and the lack of safe spaces, may reduce this pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The shared bicycle program has been implemented in more than 30 countries including Mexico.&#xD;
      Among the main objectives of this program - in addition to integrating the bicycle as a form&#xD;
      of active transportation - includes the design of a new infrastructure to offer safety and&#xD;
      comfort to cyclists. This type of program has been evaluated in different countries. Results&#xD;
      show that the combination of interventions, that is, the construction of bicycle facilities&#xD;
      and the shared bicycle programs increased trips in Barcelona and Paris. In Barcelona, it was&#xD;
      observed that this program increased the quality of life and decreased air and noise&#xD;
      pollution. In Montreal, this program was found to attract young people and people within the&#xD;
      highest socioeconomic status. In Valencia, Spain, it was reported that the bicycle system&#xD;
      increased energy expenditure by 257 METs / min / week and helped reducing 2kg. of body weight&#xD;
      in a school year. In Japan, pedaling for 30 minutes to work was found to have an effect on&#xD;
      mental health. Finally, in the United States, it was observed that those who use active&#xD;
      transportation to go to work have a lower probability of obesity, elevated triglyceride&#xD;
      levels, diastolic blood pressure, and fasting glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ECOBICI program is a shared bicycle system within Mexico City. Since 2010, this program&#xD;
      has been managed by the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Mobility, initially&#xD;
      operating with 1,200 bicycles and 84 bicycle stations around Mexico City. It currently&#xD;
      belongs to the Comprehensive Mobility Program 2018-2024, aiming at the accessibility of the&#xD;
      population in the use of bicycles, promoting their use as an air pollution free transport.&#xD;
      This program has been awarded within the urban public transport area, for improving air&#xD;
      quality and for seeking a change in society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Authorities of the ECOBICI program conducted a users' survey in 2014, this included questions&#xD;
      related to the program and health aspects of the users. It was observed that 36% of those&#xD;
      surveyed perceived an improvement in their physical condition, 15% reported having an&#xD;
      improvement in their health and 8% reported having lost weight, however, to date there are&#xD;
      few prospective studies that report the effect of the use of public bicycles on the levels of&#xD;
      physical activity and health indicators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure The project is divided into two phases: phase 1 - initial evaluations and phase 2 -&#xD;
      follow-up. Through social media (twitter and Facebook) adults interested on getting involved&#xD;
      in the ECOBICI program and adults who are not involved in the program or physical activities&#xD;
      aimed to improve their health will be invited to participate. All individuals interested on&#xD;
      participating in this study will received an email indicating a day and time for a zoom&#xD;
      meeting. The investigators will perform two zoom meetings, one for the intervention group and&#xD;
      another for the control group. Within the intervention group meeting the investigators will&#xD;
      explain them the study, benefits and risks to participate and the investigators will randomly&#xD;
      allocate adults in intervention group 1 (free annual program fee) and intervention group 2&#xD;
      (annual program fee paid by participants). Within the control group meeting the investigators&#xD;
      will explain them the study, benefits and risks to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE 1 (month 0). All adults who agree to participate must read and sign the consent letter&#xD;
      before getting involved into the study. Then, the investigators will ask participants to&#xD;
      answer a 20-minutes long questionnaire and will perform anthropometric and blood pressure&#xD;
      measurements. All participants will be evaluated in the ECOBICI module considering COVID-19&#xD;
      hygiene guidelines. At the end of this phase, adults will be invited to participate in PHASE&#xD;
      2 of the study. If agree to participate, the investigator will ask for their cell phone&#xD;
      number or home phone number to be contacted later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE 2 (months 1.5 and 3). The investigators will ask them if we could monitor their bicycle&#xD;
      trajectories using the data from the Ministry of Mobility. In addition, the investigators&#xD;
      will ask adults to use the STRAVA app (GPS app that monitors bike paths) every time they ride&#xD;
      the bike. A manual will be send by email within instructions on how to download the&#xD;
      application and how to use it. In addition, they will be instructed to send us by email the&#xD;
      bike trajectories stored in the STRAVA application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During month 1.5, the investigators will call them to conduct another survey focused on&#xD;
      physical activity levels, diet, mental health, and health indicators (same survey that was&#xD;
      conducted in month 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In month 3, the investigators will quote the patients in the ECOBICI module, within this&#xD;
      visit a final questionnaire and anthropometric and blood pressure measurements will carry&#xD;
      out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All people who agree to participate in the TWO PHASES of the study will receive a voucher for&#xD;
      $ 250 pesos ($1.25 USD).&#xD;
