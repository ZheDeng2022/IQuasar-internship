  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the help of medical progress, life expectancy has increased in our country, resulting in&#xD;
      an increase in the number of elderly people and especially so-called complex patients. These&#xD;
      complex elderly patients present with a combination of poly pathology, locomotor disorders&#xD;
      and loss of autonomy, which leads to increased risks of hospitalization, re-hospitalization&#xD;
      or difficulty in remaining at home. These risks could be reduced by early adapted care&#xD;
      specific to this type of patient. To do this, it is necessary to identify these complex&#xD;
      elderly patients as early as possible in their care pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening complex elderly patients in the emergency department would require trained and&#xD;
      educated staff, or the use of a simple, rapid and reliable diagnostic scale. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to compare two scales for the screening of complex elderly patients, whose use&#xD;
      is adapted to the Hospital Emergency Department environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study assess the diagnostic performance of the ISAR and SoCoLoc scales for complex&#xD;
      elderly patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The assumption of the study is that at least one of these two scales (ISAR or SoCoLoc) is&#xD;
      adapted to the constraints of hospital emergencies and that it presents good performances for&#xD;
      the screening of elderly patients in complex medico-social situations (sensitivity ≥ 90% and&#xD;
      specificity ≥ 50%).&#xD;

    <description>The overall diagnostic performance of each scale will be measured using the area under the ROC curve (sensitivity vs. 1-specificity).&#xD;
The performance of the two scales will be measured and compared using a parametric or non-parametric Z-test for matched data according to the number of events observed, i.e. the number of &quot;complex&quot; patients. A ROC curve will be performed in order to determine the best positivity threshold of each scale.&#xD;
Patients will be classified as &quot;complex&quot; or &quot;non-complex&quot; by the blind adjudication committee of the results of the two scales.</description>
