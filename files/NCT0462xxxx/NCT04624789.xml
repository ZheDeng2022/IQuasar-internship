    <textblock>
      The clinical project &quot;Eight At One Stroke: Attention Gangliosidoses&quot; represents a clinical&#xD;
      registry for recording the clinical manifestation and the disease progression of&#xD;
      gangliosidoses. The intention of this project is to better understand the manifestation and&#xD;
      progression of gangliosidoses and to raise awareness of these disorders in the public health&#xD;
      service. The patients or their families, respectively, will be integrated in the study in&#xD;
      order to measure Patient Outcome and to objectify the psychosocial burden for the patient and&#xD;
      his family. The study has a retrospective and a prospective part. It is planned to transfer&#xD;
      the data of the study into a continuous registry.&#xD;

      1. Aim of the Project&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The aim of the project is to collect fundamental epidemiological and clinical data,&#xD;
                such as prevalence and incidence, but also data regarding phenotype, diagnosis and&#xD;
                mutation spectrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To understand the natural course of these diseases seems to be very important for&#xD;
                individual advice of families and additionally for planning drug studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In this study it should also be analyzed how the families and their setting have&#xD;
                perceived the disease manifestation. Their perception will be compared to clinical&#xD;
                findings and symptoms that were noticed by the physician. The medical history may&#xD;
                indicate which symptoms and findings may lead to a well-directed diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical and genetic data, that also concern aspects of social medicine, of a&#xD;
                greater cohort will raise the awareness of pharmaceutical companies that develop&#xD;
                new drugs and will increase the chance of patients to participate in a clinical&#xD;
                trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The project will enable validation of biomarkers that may be useful for diagnostic&#xD;
                purposes and also for monitoring laboratory parameters during a trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients and their families are involved in the development and procedure of the&#xD;
                study. They become a voice and are noticed as partners in the public health&#xD;
                service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Background 3.1 Gangliosidoses Gangliosidoses represent autosomal-recessive lysosomal&#xD;
      storage disorders, caused by a defect in the lysosomal degradation of gangliosides, resulting&#xD;
      in accumulation of these substrates in several organs. Gangliosidoses are divided in eight&#xD;
      different diseases according to their biochemical and genetic defect: Four disorders are&#xD;
      assigned to GM2-Gangliosidoses, four belong to the Neuraminidase-ß-Galactosidase complex.&#xD;
      Gangliosidoses are characterized by more or less pronounced progressive loss of mental and&#xD;
      motor capabilities. In patients with a more attenuated phenotype the diagnosis is done often&#xD;
      very late, as the typical clinical &quot;classical&quot; features are commonly lacking. Maybe adult&#xD;
      patients were never diagnosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diseases result from the accumulation of gangliosides, caused by genetic defects of&#xD;
      enzymes or other proteins that are involved in the lysosomal degradation of these complex&#xD;
      lipids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Classification of Gangliosides GM1-Gangliosidosis - Sialidosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GM1-Gangliosidosis (1) Morquio B Variant (2) ß-Galactosidase&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sialidosis (3) Neuraminidase&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Galactosialidosis (4) Protective Protein/Cathepsin A&#xD;
&#xD;
      GM2-Gangliosidoses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tay-Sachs Disease (5), incl. B1-Variante (6) Hexosaminidase A&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sandhoff Disease (7) Hexosamidase A&amp;B&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GM2-Activator-Deficiency (8) GM2-activator-protein&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Clinical Phenotypes The degree of clinical expression regarding the age of first&#xD;
      manifestation, rate of progression and symptoms is extremely heterogeneous and reaches from&#xD;
      the lethal hydrops fetalis to the rapidly progressive and to the slowly progressive adult&#xD;
      form. The underlying mutations determine the enzyme respectively protein deficiency, in the&#xD;
      more attenuated forms, however, the phenotype is additionally influenced by epigenetic&#xD;
      factors and the environment. Generally five phenotypic forms are distinguished that differ in&#xD;
      the age of first symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hydrops fetalis Gangliosidoses can manifest as hydrops fetalis that is defined as fetal fluid&#xD;
      accumulation in at least two organ systems, such as ascites, pleural and pericardium effusion&#xD;
      and generalized edema. Hydrops fetalis, that mostly leads to intrauterine death, was&#xD;
      surprisingly not observed in GM2-gangliosidoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infantile Gangliosidoses Patients with the so-called &quot;classical&quot; infantile form manifest&#xD;
      after birth with developmental delay. Between the age of three to six months significant&#xD;
      muscular hypotonia becomes obvious. Often, but not exclusively, in GM2-gangliosidoses the&#xD;
      parents observe as first symptom an excessive response to an acoustic stimulus with sudden&#xD;
      hyperextension of arms and legs and muscle jerks. A cherry-red spot at the eye fundus and a&#xD;
      macrocephaly may lead to the diagnosis. A so-called &quot;Hurler-phenotype&quot; is seen in infants&#xD;
      with sialidosis, galactosialidosis and GM1-gangliosidoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Late-infantile and juvenile Gangliosidoses It is often not possible to differentiate between&#xD;
      late.infantile and juvenile gangliosidoses: In young children the parents observe deficits in&#xD;
      motor and speech development, later these capabilities get lost. The occurrence of epilpetic&#xD;
      seizures implies a bad prognosis. In GM2-gangliosidoses the tetraparesis is hypotonic and&#xD;
      floppy, in GM1-gangliosidoses dystonic and spastic. The progressive visual impairment can&#xD;
      result in blindness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Late-onset Gangliosidoses Patients with late-onset (or chronic-adult) type of gangliosidoses&#xD;
      present with cerebellar signs such as ataxia, dysarthria and hypotonia. Late-onset&#xD;
      GM2-gangliosidoses are characterized by intention tremor and dysmetria, in late-onset&#xD;
      GM1-gangliosidoses dystonia and spasticity are the leading neurological symptoms. Prior to&#xD;
      the occurrence of neurological symptoms psychoses and episodes of psychosis may appear that&#xD;
      later on may dominate the disease manifestation. The cognitive abilities are hardly impaired,&#xD;
      due to the severe dysarthria, however, it may be difficult to correctly evaluate the&#xD;
      cognitive function. Because in adult gangliosidoses the motor neuron is involved, the&#xD;
      patients may resemble individuals with Friedreich-Ataxia ot SMA, for which reason a&#xD;
      differentiation between thoMedise disorders may be difficult&#xD;

    <description>Disease progression was assessed by the 8 in 1 score, which is a disease specific instrument adapted from other scores in neurodegenerative and lysosomal diseases (NPC, CLN). The instrument is designed to monitor disease progession and measure disease severity. The 8 in 1 score summarizes 8 domains (partizipation, medical care, ambulation, manipulation, swallowing, speech, epilepsy and cognition) ranging from 0 - 40. A higher score indicates more severe clinical impairment.</description>
