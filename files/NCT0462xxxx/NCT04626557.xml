      To investigate if asthma affects the inflammatory balance of the endometrium and thereby&#xD;
      interfere with implantation, as indicated by the characteristics of the inflammatory cells in&#xD;
      the endometrium and airways in women with asthma who are referred for IUI or IVF due to&#xD;
      infertility, compared to otherwise healthy women who are referred for IUI or IVF due to&#xD;
      infertility.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The link between asthma and fertility may be associated with widespread tissue inflammation,&#xD;
      as inflammatory changes are not only affecting the respiratory organs, but also systemically,&#xD;
      and here by affecting both the lungs and the reproductive organs in women with asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A likely mechanism involved in infertility among asthmatic women seems to be inflammatory&#xD;
      changes found in the endometrium of the uterus. Some studies show high number of mast cells,&#xD;
      eosinophil granulocytes and basophil granulocytes in the endometrium[1]. One study found low&#xD;
      values of VEGF in endometrial secretion in women with asthma as a possible cause for&#xD;
      subfertility [2]. Others assume, that an imbalance of the adaptive immune system (both the&#xD;
      Th1 and Th2/TH17 response) is associated with infertility [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown that inflammation in the endometrium with a specific combination of&#xD;
      cytokines and chemokines is part of successful implantation [4]. However, If the inflammatory&#xD;
      process is characterized by a less optimal combination of cytokines and chemokines the&#xD;
      reproductive outcome may be less successful. The systemic inflammation caused by asthma could&#xD;
      offset the balance between the cytokines and chemokines in the endometrium and thereby have&#xD;
      negative impact on reproductive outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, our aim is to analyze inflammation in the uterus and in the airways in&#xD;
      women with asthma referred to fertility treatment receiving Intrauterine insemination (IUI)&#xD;
      or in vitro fertilization (IVF) to characterize and thereby provide knowledge of the&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying the association between asthma and reproductive outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an explorative non-randomized study, including 30 participants divided into two groups: 15&#xD;
      women with asthma and 15 non-asthmatic controls. The patients will go through an asthma&#xD;
      work-up (diagnosis, allergy, medication, and inflammation). Menstrual blood will be collected&#xD;
      at home using the menstrual cup and at the 7th-14th day cycle day, an endometrium sample from&#xD;
      the uterus lining will be obtained together with sputum, as indicators of the system&#xD;
      inflammation expressed both in the lungs and the uterus, and blood samples.&#xD;
