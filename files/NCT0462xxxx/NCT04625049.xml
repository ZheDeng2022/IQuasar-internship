  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether increased microglial activation (measured&#xD;
      using TSPO-PET) at lesion rim is associated with more rapid lesion growth during 10 year&#xD;
      follow up.&#xD;

      Objective: To evaluate individual MS lesions and their growth during a total of 10 year&#xD;
      follow-up after initial positron emission tomography (PET) -imaging with PK11195 or TMSX&#xD;
      radioligands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Focal inflammatory lesions in the white and grey matter of the central nervous&#xD;
      system represent the best characterized pathological phenomena of MS disease. Some MS lesions&#xD;
      slowly expand over time. Neuropathological studies have detected inflammatory rim formed by&#xD;
      activated microglia cells around some MS lesions and it has been suggested that the presence&#xD;
      of the inflammatory rim could predict lesion expansion. Our hypothesis is that the lesions&#xD;
      with higher TSPO or TMSX radioligand binding at the initial PET scan will expand more during&#xD;
      the total of 10-year follow up compared to those lesions with lower radioligand binding. This&#xD;
      longitudinal follow-up study will provide a more complete picture of the association of the&#xD;
      innate immune cell activation, lesion growth and disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The research will recruit approximately 100 MS-patients who have taken part&#xD;
      to our previous PET-imaging MS studies in Turku PET centre. The research interventions will&#xD;
      consist of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, blood sampling, clinical neurological&#xD;
      evaluation and patient-reported outcome measures (filling forms).&#xD;
