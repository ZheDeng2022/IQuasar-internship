  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective pilot study conducted within otolaryngology (ENT) clinics in a tertiary&#xD;
      hospital between July and December 2016. 22 patients planned for common elective ENT&#xD;
      operations were given a self-administered one-page survey on the same day after preoperative&#xD;
      counselling. The investigators aim to identify if there are any associations between&#xD;
      perceived and actual understanding of information given during pre-operative counselling and&#xD;
      patient satisfaction with the process.&#xD;
