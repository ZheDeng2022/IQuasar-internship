      The aim of this project is to evaluate the safety and acceptability of our online,&#xD;
      home-based, personalized, neuro-technological mindfulness-based intervention in entraining&#xD;
      anxiety regulation and ameliorating anxiety in healthy adults. Our technology will deliver a&#xD;
      mindfulness-based anxiety regulation intervention through a neuro-/ bio-feedback-based game&#xD;
      interface that is driven by an electroencephalography (EEG) algorithm. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      the intervention would be safe and acceptable. In exploratory analyses, we further&#xD;
      hypothesize that the intervention would help entrain anxiety regulation and ameliorate&#xD;
      anxiety in healthy adults. Data will be analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively to inform&#xD;
      development of our intervention and future research studies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Anxiety disorders, defined by excess worry, hyperarousal and fear, are amongst the most&#xD;
      common class of psychiatric conditions in adults. Large population-based studies on anxiety&#xD;
      disorders estimated a lifetime prevalence of 33.7% and a 12-month prevalence between 2.4% and&#xD;
      29.8%. In Singapore, however, studies have only established the prevalence of a limited range&#xD;
      or anxiety disorders. In a nationwide, cross-sectional, epidemiological survey, the lifetime&#xD;
      prevalence of anxiety disorders, specifically Generalized Anxiety Disorder and&#xD;
      Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, rose from 0.9% and 3.0% respectively in 2010, to 1.6% and 3.6%&#xD;
      in 2016. If untreated, anxiety disorders could result in a range of personal and societal&#xD;
      costs, such as interpersonal dysfunctions, employment, physical health, social functioning,&#xD;
      and frequent primary and acute care visits, resulting in a poor quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large proportion of the population experiences subclinical symptoms of anxiety disorders&#xD;
      which impede daily functioning and well-being, but most often do not seek professional help&#xD;
      or fall below the radar of psychiatric services. Current treatment guidelines recommend&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy (i.e. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] or venlafaxine) and&#xD;
      psychotherapy (i.e. cognitive behavior therapy [CBT]) as first-line treatments for anxiety&#xD;
      disorders. Unfortunately, SSRIs are associated with an increased risk of suicide in young&#xD;
      adults. Thus, local practices often incorporate more psychological therapies in the treatment&#xD;
      of anxiety disorders. However, CBT is labor-intensive and time-consuming - which is&#xD;
      incompatible with the demanding lifestyle Singaporeans lead these days. Moreover, therapeutic&#xD;
      outcomes are also very much therapist dependent. Due to the fear of stigma that is&#xD;
      particularly salient in the local context, individuals with anxiety may be deterred from&#xD;
      engaging with therapists. Even if these individuals do receive adequate treatment, existing&#xD;
      literature shows that outcomes for recommended treatment modalities are sub-optimal at best,&#xD;
      i.e. overall mean remission rate of CBT is 51% while pharmacotherapy is significantly lower.&#xD;
      With the low rates of help-seeking behaviors and dismal success rates of existing therapies,&#xD;
      novel interventions for anxiety are apposite and vital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits of mindfulness-based interventions have been extensively researched in anxiety&#xD;
      disorders in recent years. Improvements reported across a range of outcomes include enhanced&#xD;
      ability to cope with stress, reduced depressive and anxiety symptom severity, as well as&#xD;
      improved sleep quality, all of which lead to increased life satisfaction and overall&#xD;
      well-being. Not all anxiety regulation strategies are helpful, and mindful emotion regulation&#xD;
      presents one promising strategy by cultivating a changing of relationship with one's&#xD;
      emotions. Specifically, this strategy facilitates reduced reactivity to emotional stimuli by&#xD;
      encouraging one to meet, accept, and detach from one's aversive feelings, thoughts, and&#xD;
      ineffective habitual responses. Unfortunately, clinically anxious individuals with no&#xD;
      experience in such practices could find it challenging to engage in them as they often&#xD;
      require a high degree of individual discipline. Coupled with the fact that sustained practice&#xD;
      is crucial to yield the benefits of mindfulness practice, an appealing mode of treatment&#xD;
      delivery is necessary. To this end, gamification strategies could be useful: gamification&#xD;
      strategies have been shown useful in motivating health-related behaviors through interaction&#xD;
      with the immersive interventional programs. Recent preliminary studies have also suggested&#xD;
      that neuro-/ biofeedback-based relaxation and mindfulness training is useful for both healthy&#xD;
      and anxious individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, we have developed an online, home-based, personalized, neuro-technological&#xD;
      mindfulness-based intervention and seek to conduct a preliminary study with healthy young&#xD;
      adults to evaluate its safety and acceptability. Our technology will deliver a&#xD;
      mindfulness-based anxiety regulation intervention through a neuro-/ bio-feedback-based game&#xD;
      interface that is driven by an electroencephalography (EEG) algorithm. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      the intervention would be safe and acceptable. We further hypothesize that the intervention&#xD;
      would help entrain anxiety regulation and ameliorate anxiety in healthy adults.&#xD;
