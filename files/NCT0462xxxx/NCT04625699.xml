  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether it is feasible and safe to give research&#xD;
      participants investigational treatment with durvalumab and tremelimumab after they have&#xD;
      completed standard treatment for NSCLC and once they have detectable circulating tumor DNA&#xD;
      (ctDNA) in the blood before there is evidence of disease recurrence on imaging studies. These&#xD;
      investigational agents are a type of immunotherapy, which is a treatment that activates your&#xD;
      own body's immune system to treat cancer.&#xD;

      This is an open label, single arm, pilot study of adjuvant durvalumab+ tremelimumab (D+T) for&#xD;
      patients with stage II-IIIB (excluding N3) NSCLC.The trial will evaluate the feasibility of&#xD;
      adjuvant D+T in patients who have undergone surgical resection and standard of care (SOC)&#xD;
      adjuvant treatment and subsequently develop detectable plasma ctDNA. 15 evaluable patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled. Patients with resected stage II-IIIB (excluding N3) NSCLC who have&#xD;
      completed adjuvant standard of care treatment will be pre-screened and consented for the&#xD;
      trial. They will undergo ctDNA testing with the Signatera assay at the completion of adjuvant&#xD;
      treatment and every 4 months thereafter with standard CT imaging assessment up to 1 year.&#xD;
      Patients with detectable ctDNA at a mutant allele frequency of &gt;0.1% and no evidence of&#xD;
      recurrence on CT imaging will be enrolled in the trial. They will receive durvalumab every 4&#xD;
      weeks for 4 cycles and tremelimuamb on cycles 1 and 3 with concomitant plasma ctDNA&#xD;
      quantification. Patients will be followed with standard CT imaging of the chest as well as&#xD;
      routine and exploratory blood tests every 4 months until 1 year after completion of D+T. They&#xD;
      will also be followed for up to 3 years for determination of DFS and OS.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Major surgical procedure within 28 days prior to Cycle 1, Day 1 or anticipation of&#xD;

             up to 30 days after durvalumab, tremelimumab administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis of any cause&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because durvalumab and tremelimumab are&#xD;
             investigational agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with durvalumab and tremelimumab, breastfeeding&#xD;
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with durvalumab and tremelimumab.&#xD;
