  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate a video assisted, home therapy program where participants&#xD;
      complete hand therapy on their own following thumb arthroplasty. In this program,&#xD;
      participants will receive prerecorded informational videos. Half of the participants in this&#xD;
      study will do standard of care, in-person therapy. The other half will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      home therapy program. Participants will fill out an assessment of their physical ability&#xD;
      before surgery and again three months after surgery. These assessments will be compared&#xD;
      between groups. The study team hypothesizes that the video-assisted, home therapy program&#xD;
      will be noninferior to traditional in-person therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current postoperative hand therapy regimens can be burdensome to patients and non-compliance&#xD;
      rates are high. Our service area has a lack of hand therapists in the rural areas and the&#xD;
      most common barrier to receiving care is access and transportation. In-person therapy&#xD;
      requires patients to have significant flexibility in transportation, work schedule and&#xD;
      childcare. Travel time and distances put patients who are already disadvantaged at an&#xD;
      increased risk of failed treatment. Furthermore, our hand therapy clinics have high&#xD;
      utilization after first CMC arthroplasty (thumb joint replacement) procedures, for which&#xD;
      therapy is protocol-driven and results are predictable-two aspects that lend this procedure&#xD;
      to amenable results from a virtual, unsupervised program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study's central hypothesis is that video assisted therapy can be used in postoperative&#xD;
      hand therapy without a change in subject outcomes. In this study, the investigators choose to&#xD;
      study therapy for one of the most common postoperative diagnoses seen in Carilion Clinic's&#xD;
      hand therapy clinics: thumb arthroplasty (replacement of a thumb joint).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1 is to determine if a video-assisted, home therapy program (pre-recorded&#xD;
      instructional videos) can effectively replace in-person occupational therapy for thumb&#xD;
      arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Outcomes of a therapy program consisting of pre-recorded instructional videos&#xD;
      will be noninferior to the standard of care regimen for thumb arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The significance of this study is that it investigates a home therapy solution that the&#xD;
      investigators expect to increase access to healthcare in rural populations. This study is&#xD;
      novel because it will be the first prospective, randomized control trial to investigate the&#xD;
      utility of video-assisted home therapy following hand surgery.&#xD;
