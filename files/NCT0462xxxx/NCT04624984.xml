    <description>All patients receive PD-1 Inhibitor on day 1. Treatment cycles repeat every 3 weeks for 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with PET/CT confirmed CR or PR receive PD-1 Inhibitor for another 3 cycles. Patients with PD or SD receive PD-1 Inhibitor plus GVD (gemcitabine, vinorelbine and doxorubicin liposome) regimen every 3 weeks for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
Patients with PET/CT confirmed CR after 6 cycles of PD-1 Inhibitor treatment can receive radiotherapy or ASCT, which is determined by investigators. Patients with PR receive 2-4 cycles of PD-1 Inhibitor plus GVD regimen. Patients with PD or SD receive 4 cycles of PD-1 Inhibitor plus GVD regimen.&#xD;
Patients with confirmed CR or PR after PD-1 Inhibitor plus GVD regimen can receive radiotherapy or ASCT, which is determined by investigators. Patients with PD or SD quit the trial.</description>
