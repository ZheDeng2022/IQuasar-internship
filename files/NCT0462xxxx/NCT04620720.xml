      This Randomised control trial will be conducted at the Department of General Surgery, Dow&#xD;
      University Hospital OJHA Campus Karachi over a period of a year. All Females, ages ranged&#xD;
      between 20 to 80 years and diagnosed with breast carcinoma stage II on the basis of triple&#xD;
      assessment will be recruited in the study. Patients who will refuse to participate in the&#xD;
      study, allergic to gabapentin on the basis if history, previous treatment with Gabapentin in&#xD;
      the previous 8 weeks, Chronic pain syndrome, Substance abuse, sedatives, hypnotics or&#xD;
      antidepressants, analgesic intake within 48 hours before surgery, Diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      Hypertension, and Acute or Chronic Renal Failure on the basis of medical records and&#xD;
      Inability to understand VAS pain score will be excluded from the study. The sample size will&#xD;
      be calculated by the Open Epi calculator. The mean pain score difference at rest between two&#xD;
      groups was taken as 0.7 (Placebo: mean ± SD = 2.9 ± 1.2 and Gabapentin: mean ± SD = 2.2 ±&#xD;
      1.3.5 With 80% power, and 95% confidence level, the total sample size came out to be 102, 51&#xD;
      patients in each group. Consecutive sampling was used to achieve the desired sample. Patients&#xD;
      fulfilling inclusion criteria were randomly enrolled in either of the 2 groups by sealed&#xD;
      opaque envelop method bearing cards, which will be picked by the staff nurses. The&#xD;
      intervention group was labeled as group A and the control group as group B. Patients in the&#xD;
      intervention group received a single dose of 1200 mg of gabapentin 2hours before surgery. All&#xD;
      procedures were performed under general anesthesia. Postoperative analgesic injection&#xD;
      ketorolac 30 mg thrice a day and injection paracetamol 1 gram intravenous thrice a day was&#xD;
      advised. Patients were assessed at 12 and 24 h post-operatively for pain scores at rest and&#xD;
      arm mobilization using VAS pain score, a number of times rescue analgesia when VAS score &gt; 3&#xD;
      by residents of surgery blinded to the study. Those patients, who experience pain (pain score&#xD;
      &gt; 3) in spite of routine analgesics received injection ketorolac 30 mg once, pain score&#xD;
      between 3 to 6 received injection Kinz, pain score &gt; 7 will be given both analgesics single&#xD;
      times, pain score &gt;8 will receive intravenous maximum thrice in 24 hours. Patients with pain&#xD;
      score 0-2 will not be given any additional analgesic All patients will receive antiemetic in&#xD;
      Metoclopramide 10 mg I.V in case of nausea and vomiting. All demographics and outcome&#xD;
      variables will be entered in the proforma. The outcome variables of the study were age, pain&#xD;
      score (VAS), and analgesic requirement.&#xD;
