    <textblock>
      Improving the prescription accuracy of psychotropic medications for military personnel&#xD;
      diagnosed with neuropsychiatric disorders is imperative to promote accelerated treatment&#xD;
      response and recovery. This study will determine whether PEER (Psychiatric EEG Evaluation&#xD;
      Registry) Interactive (a comparison of a quantitative electroencephalogram (QEEG) to an&#xD;
      existing database of subject outcomes) provides an objective adjunctive tool that is more&#xD;
      effective in guiding treatment than the current standard of practice in the treatment of&#xD;
      military personnel suffering from non-psychotic mental illness. For this prospective,&#xD;
      multicenter, randomized, single-blinded, controlled study, 100 participants with a primary&#xD;
      diagnosis of a DSM-V depressive disorder, with comorbidity of non-psychotic behavioral&#xD;
      disorders to include mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder&#xD;
      (PTSD), will be enrolled. Participants will be randomized into a control or experimental&#xD;
      group, and all will undergo a quantitative electroencephalogram (QEEG). For the experimental&#xD;
      group, research staff will receive an Outcome Report from PEER Interactive and will follow&#xD;
      the guidance of the Report to inform treatment. For the control group, research staff will&#xD;
      not receive a participant Outcome Report from PEER Interactive and these participants will be&#xD;
      treated based on current standards. For the control group, Outcome Reports will be&#xD;
      sequestered for post-hoc analysis. Research staff in collaboration with CNS Response (the&#xD;
      Sponsor) will evaluate and validate if the guidance provided by PEER Interactive correlates&#xD;
      with the predicted participant outcome. Research staff in collaboration with the Sponsor will&#xD;
      also evaluate if the treatment guidance provided by PEER Interactive results in improved&#xD;
      mental health and/or a reduction of risk as measured by a reduction in severe adverse events,&#xD;
      including suicidality.&#xD;

      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, single-blinded, randomized, multicenter study to evaluate the utility,&#xD;
      safety, and efficacy of using PEER Interactive to inform the prescription of medications to&#xD;
      participants with a primary diagnosis of a depressive disorder, with or without comorbidity&#xD;
      of non-psychotic behavioral disorders, versus treatment as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is observational in nature, in that the participants in the control group will be&#xD;
      treated according to treatment as usual and best judgment of the treating clinician. The&#xD;
      participants in the experimental group will be treated with adjunctive information provided&#xD;
      by the PEER Interactive Report. It is a controlled study in that the schedule of visits,&#xD;
      procedures and measurements will be defined by the protocol in order to provide consistent&#xD;
      data for both the control and experimental groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be blinded as to presence/use of the PEER Interactive Report and will&#xD;
      provide the primary efficacy outcome evaluation. All participants will be randomized into a&#xD;
      control or experimental group. All participants will receive a quantitative&#xD;
      electroencephalogram (QEEG). For those participants in the experimental group, the research&#xD;
      staff will receive an Outcome Report from PEER Interactive. The clinician in the experimental&#xD;
      group will use the PEER Interactive Report in the medication prescription process. For the&#xD;
      control group, the research staff will not receive an Outcome Report. Outcome Reports for the&#xD;
      control group will be sequestered for post-hoc analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research staff will incorporate the information provided by the Outcome Report from PEER&#xD;
      Interactive in their prescription decisions. PEER Interactive provides adjunctive information&#xD;
      to assist the treating clinician in the clinical decision process. For the experimental group&#xD;
      the research staff is expected to follow the guidance of the subject's PEER Outcome Report as&#xD;
      regards to the participant's responsiveness to the on-label medications noted in the Report.&#xD;
      Although the study staff is strongly encouraged to use the guidance in the medication&#xD;
      decision, prescription of medication is a clinical decision and will be made by the research&#xD;
      staff. A decision to not follow the guidance of the Report should be documented and&#xD;
      explained. In some cases, the Report may indicate sensitivity for a medication to which the&#xD;
      subject has not been responsive in previous treatment - or - if effective for the diagnosed&#xD;
      condition may cause/have caused an undesired side effect e.g. rash, nausea, etc. The&#xD;
      clinician must always consider subject history in the treatment decision. We expect the&#xD;
      Report will indicate that the participant will not be responsive to the previous treatment,&#xD;
      and therefore, the treatment should not be prescribed. The PEER Report informs medication&#xD;
      decisions as a part of treatment. If the only medication indicated by the report is a&#xD;
      medication the participant has had poor experience with; the participant should be treated&#xD;
      with another medication indicated as responsive by the Report. In the event the Report&#xD;
      indicates the participant is not responsive to any of the on-label medications in the Report,&#xD;
      the treating clinician may prescribe according to best clinical judgment. The research staff&#xD;
      will note the basis for all medication decisions in the subject's treatment/study file. The&#xD;
      only change to standard of care is the use of the PEER Report to inform medication decisions&#xD;
      for the experimental group e.g. If a participant is receiving psychotherapy/ counseling along&#xD;
      with medical therapy prior to enrollment, the participant will continue with all other&#xD;
      therapies as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the guidance of the PEER Outcome Report means prescribing any medication the report&#xD;
      indicates the subject would be responsive to and not prescribing medications the report&#xD;
      indicates the subject would not be responsive to. The PEER Outcome Report should be followed&#xD;
      for up to two 'medication trials' to be considered as following the guidance of the report. A&#xD;
      'medication trial' is defined as prescribing a new medication to treat the subject. This&#xD;
      includes augmentation and/or switching to a different medication. Dosing adjustments are not&#xD;
      considered a medication trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research staff, in collaboration with the sponsor, will evaluate and validate how closely&#xD;
      the information provided by PEER Interactive correlates with post-hoc demonstrated subject&#xD;
      medication responsiveness. The research staff, in collaboration with the sponsor will also&#xD;
      evaluate if the information provided by PEER Interactive results in improved mental health&#xD;
      and/or a reduction of risk as measured by a reduction in Psychiatric Specific Adverse Events,&#xD;
      including suicidality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Essentially, there are two evaluations being made in this study. The first is an evaluation&#xD;
      of the clinical utility of PEER Interactive where the health outcome of participants in the&#xD;
      experimental group (those that receive information from PEER Interactive) will be compared to&#xD;
      the outcomes of the control group (those subjects who did not receive information from PEER&#xD;
      Interactive). The second is a validation of the PEER Interactive outcomes database which is&#xD;
      intended to measure post-hoc the health outcomes of participants where the research staff's&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy decisions agreed with the output of PEER Interactive. The chart below&#xD;
      describes these evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus Method Endpoints Outcome database validation Post-hoc observational Mean effect in the&#xD;
      Agreement vs. non-Agreement group Clinical utility Prospective randomized Mean effect in&#xD;
      Experimental vs. Control group&#xD;
&#xD;
      A QEEG is required for this study. Therefore, all participants must be washed off medications&#xD;
      for the QEEG. Though not standard clinical practice in all settings, this is a standard&#xD;
      requirement of the QEEG process when a QEEG study is being performed to compare participant&#xD;
      pathophysiology to a normative database composed of non-medicated participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be followed for not less than 6 months after the initial treatment, or&#xD;
      until the subject has achieved maximum medical improvement (MMI). Determination of MMI is&#xD;
      made retrospectively e.g. we can only determine that a participant has achieved MMI following&#xD;
      that participant's demonstration of stability on medication/in treatment as evaluated across&#xD;
      at least two visits for example: the participant is not getting better/has stabilized and&#xD;
      will, in the judgment of the clinician, not get better. The participant will be seen on a&#xD;
      routine basis and assessments will be made at each interaction to evaluate the participant's&#xD;
      improvement in mental health. The participants will be closely evaluated to determine if they&#xD;
      are experiencing any psychiatric specific adverse events. The research staff is allowed to&#xD;
      treat the participant according to their best medical judgment, which may include adding or&#xD;
      changing medications, seeing the participant more frequently, or other interventions.&#xD;
      Clinicians will be encouraged to use their best clinical judgment and best clinical practice&#xD;
      guidelines to assess the need for transition to a new medication. All interactions and&#xD;
      interventions will be recorded in the case report form (CRF). A second QEEG will be&#xD;
      administered at the final/study termination visit. This second QEEG will allow for analysis&#xD;
      to indicate treatment-related changes to the QEEG. An additional analysis will be performed&#xD;
      to identify changes that might indicate suicidal ideation (Hunter, et al. 2010 and Iosifescu,&#xD;
      et al. 2008). This information will be compared with findings from the participant's CHRT-SR7&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;

    <description>Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR-16) is a 16-item depressive symptomatology self-report questionnaires which has been useful as a way of determining a patient's level of depression before, during, and after treatment. Questions are answered by checking off the most appropriate answer to describe how they have been feeling over the past 7 days and are scored between 0-3 points per question.&#xD;
Total score can range from 0-27 with higher values indicating worse outcomes (5 or lower: no depression, 6 to 10: mild depression, 11 to 15: moderate depression, 16 to 20: severe depression, 21 or higher: very severe depression).&#xD;
The QIDS is score as follows: Sum together the highest score out of Items 1-4, Item 5 score, highest score out of Items 6-9, sum Item 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, highest score out of Items 15 and 16, sum all of these values for the final total score.</description>
