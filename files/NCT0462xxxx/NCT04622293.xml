    <textblock>
      This study is an 8-week single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible&#xD;
      titration trial evaluating the efficacy of solriamfetol in the treatment of fatigue symptoms&#xD;
      in adult patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. Subjects will be randomized to a&#xD;
      solriamfetol group or placebo group. The investigators will utilize an intent to treat model&#xD;
      and impute data. The overall goal of this study is to determine the efficacy and&#xD;
      effectiveness of solriamfetol for treating chronic fatigue syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an 8-week single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible&#xD;
      titration trial evaluating the efficacy of solriamfetol in the treatment of fatigue symptoms&#xD;
      in adult patients (18-65) with a diagnosis of ME/CFS. Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to a&#xD;
      solriamfetol (flexible titration dosing) group (n=17 to 22) or placebo group (n = 17 to 22).&#xD;
      The investigators will utilize an intent to treat model and impute data, if statistically&#xD;
      feasible, from dropouts utilizing a MNAR (missing not at random) approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial involves primary, secondary, exploratory and safety/tolerability objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: Evaluate IMP efficacy in treating ME/CFS fatigue symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: Difference in means at week 8 between treatment and control groups as&#xD;
      measured by the Fatigue Symptom Inventory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: Evaluate IMP efficacy in treating ME/CFS cognitive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint: Difference in means between treatment and control groups as measured by&#xD;
      the BRIEF-A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objective: Evaluate IMP efficacy in treating symptoms related to overall clinical&#xD;
      severity/distress of patients with ME/CFS and common co-occurring conditions of ME/CFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory endpoints: Differences in means between treatment and control groups as measured&#xD;
      by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, the Sheehan Disability Scale, the Clinical Global&#xD;
      Impression measure, and the Patient Global Impression measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability objective: Evaluate the safety and tolerability of IMP for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with a diagnosis of ME/CFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability endpoints: Frequency and severity of AEs, changes in vital signs:&#xD;
      blood pressure, pulse rate, weight, and physical exams. Subjects will undergo a 12-lead ECG&#xD;
      exam, Urine Drug Screens, and Urine Pregnancy Test. Suicidality will be assessed utilizing&#xD;
      the Columbia Suicidality Severity Rating Scale.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This measure has excellent internal reliability and good convergent validity and construct validity. The FSI has been demonstrated to effectively discriminate between patients with clinically significant fatigue and those that do not. Its psychometric properties have repeatedly been demonstrated to support its use in research for fatigue symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>BRIEF-A</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BRIEF-A is a comprehensive measure of executive functioning, examining 8 cognitive tasks. It is non-diagnosis specific and applicable for use with a variety of cognition-impacting conditions</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression (CGI-I and CGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S measures severity at baseline and the CGI-I measures improvement. It is commonly utilized across FDA-regulated trials. The Patient Global Impression (PGI-I and PGI-S) measure was created to tack efficacy in studies involving incontinence, and has become widely used in clinical research to capture change in functioning from the perspective of the patient.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Young CFS Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Due to the strong research and clinical need for a better self-report diagnostic screening tool for ME/CFS that can also reflect changes in symptoms due to treatment, this trial will assist in the development of a proposed measure of ME/CFS, entitled the &quot;Young CFS Scale.&quot; Part of the validation of this measure will be analysis of its relationship with other measures in measuring ME/CFS in clinical samples.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Subjects must not currently be considered a suicide risk (as determined by the primary&#xD;
             investigator and assessed by the C-SSRS). They must not have made a suicide attempt&#xD;
             within the past two years. They cannot have current suicidal ideation with intent or&#xD;
             plan to act, or current suicidal behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must not have a history of substance abuse or drug dependence according to&#xD;

             opinion of the Investigator would compromise participation or would likely lead to&#xD;
             hospitalization during the duration of the study. Subjects with a history of&#xD;
             intellectual impairment or a severe learning disability are also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must not have a history of seizure disorder (other than infantile febrile&#xD;
             seizures), any tic disorder, current diagnosis and/or family history of Tourette's&#xD;

&#xD;
        Subjects must not be taking any excluded medications that cannot be discontinued prior to&#xD;
        beginning treatment with study medication. Subjects' medical history will be reviewed by&#xD;
        the PI and current prescription regimen will be reviewed for CNS stimulants and&#xD;
        noradrenergic and dopaminergic medications. The PI will determine on a case by case basis&#xD;
        if concomitant use of the patient's current prescriptions would affect response to&#xD;
        solriamfetol and reasoning for inclusion or exclusion will be documented. Stimulant&#xD;
        medications will be excluded (methylphenidate or amphetamine based).&#xD;
&#xD;
