  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center, feasibility study to determine the sensations elicited&#xD;
      by non-invasive abdominal electrical stimulation and its effects on bowel function in spinal&#xD;
      cord injured individuals and in able-bodied persons with chronic constipation. Electrical&#xD;
      stimulation will be delivered through commercially available equipment to each subject during&#xD;
      a single site visit.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, single-center, treatment feasibility study to determine the efficacy&#xD;
      of electrical stimulation for bowel functions. The study will determine sensations elicited&#xD;
      by non-invasive, transcutaneous abdominal electrical stimulation and its effects on bowel&#xD;
      function in spinal cord injured individuals and in able-bodied persons with chronic&#xD;
      constipation. The electrical stimulation will be delivered through commercially available&#xD;
      equipment to each subject during a single site visit. Visits are anticipated to be no more&#xD;
      than 5 hours.&#xD;
