    <textblock>
      This study is being carried out to see if the drug atezolizumab can reduce the size of&#xD;
      tumours in patients with types of urothelial cancer before surgery. Atezolizumab is designed&#xD;
      to stop a protein called PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1) being expressed on the cancer,&#xD;
      allowing the immune system to recognise the tumour cells as foreign bodies and attack them.&#xD;
      Atezolizumab has been shown to have activity in urothelial cancer which has spread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There two cohorts for this trial. One cohort will investigate the most common histological&#xD;
      type of urothelial cancer (transitional cell carcinoma) outside the bladder, for example in&#xD;
      the upper urinary tract. The other cohort will investigate rarer histological subtypes (such&#xD;
      as such as squamous cell or adenocarcinoma) of urothelial cancer throughout the entire&#xD;
      urinary system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be recruiting patients from hospitals in the UK, France and Spain. If a&#xD;
      patient is eligible for the study and decides to take part, they will receive up to two&#xD;
      3-weekly cycles of atezolizumab. 4-8 weeks after being enrolled, the patient will have an&#xD;
      operation to remove the bladder (cystectomy) or the kidney, ureter and part of the bladder&#xD;
      (nephroureterectomy or distal ureteral resection) as per normal practice. Following surgery,&#xD;
      they will attend three hospital visits (4,12 and 24 weeks after surgery) and their disease&#xD;
      progress/survival will be followed over the next 2 years. The clinical team will compare the&#xD;
      patient's tumour tissue samples,scan results and blood results from before and after&#xD;
      treatment with atezolizumab in order to see how well the drug works and if it is safe. Many&#xD;
      of the procedures involved in this study are offered as standard care and participation in&#xD;
      this trial will not delay surgery.&#xD;

      Screening (up to 28 days before day 1 of treatment):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be obtained before potential participants undergo any study&#xD;
