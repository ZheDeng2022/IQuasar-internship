  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anesthesia systems with electronic injection assistance for slow injection pressure-limiting&#xD;
      drips (especially for intraosseous anaesthesia) are offered to limit pain. The European&#xD;
      Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (EAPD) recommends them for their pen-like appearance which&#xD;
      avoids the negative aspect of the classic syringe (K端hnisch 2017). A review systematic review&#xD;
      of the literature (Smolarek et al 2019) including 20 randomized controlled trials conducted&#xD;
      at children and adolescents showed a significant reduction in pain with the systems with&#xD;
      electronic assistance compared to conventional anaesthesia performed with a syringe (-0.8:&#xD;
      IC95% (-1.3, -0.3)). Only four of them (Tahmassebi et al 2009, Kandiah and Tahmassebi 2012,&#xD;
      Patini et al 2018, Smail-Faugeron et al 2019) were at low risk of bias, and only two parallel&#xD;
      group trials were of poor quality and included only children in temporary dentition in which&#xD;
      anaesthesia, often problematic, was performed only in the maxilla (Allen et al 2002, Klein et&#xD;
      al, 2005) without assessing the intensity of the pain felt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (FPS-R).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tested strategy, anesthesia system with electronic injection assistance (SleeperOne速 5&#xD;
      Dental Hi Tec), compared to a conventional metallic anaesthetic syringe currently considered&#xD;
      as the standard for performing local anesthesia during oral treatments painful, meets the ISO&#xD;
      13485: 2016 standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elements justifying that the particular surveillance modalities added by research do not&#xD;
      involve negligible risks and constraints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific monitoring modalities added by research include :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explanation of the study to each eligible child and his or her legal guardians&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gathering the informed consent of the child and his or her legal guardians&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The determination of comparative anesthesia systems (SleeperOne速 5 versus syringe metal)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data collection during the two care sessions (maximum 15 days apart)&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a use of a product placed on the market whose conditions of use are in conformity with&#xD;
      its destination and its current conditions of use (RIPH Category 2 application decree) There&#xD;
      is no additional consultation or visit, nor any additional examination, in relation to the&#xD;
      management in accordance with the recommendations of good practice of a child affected by a&#xD;
      carious disease corresponding to the children included. On the other hand, the consultation&#xD;
      will take a little longer due to the indicators to be collected and the data entry. These&#xD;
      particular surveillance modalities added by research have only negligible constraints.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a multicentre, randomized, split-mouth, randomized controlled trial in which the experimental and control anesthetic systems will be randomly assigned to the teeth (randomization unit) of the tooth pair. controlerals considered in the same patient. This design allows a gain in power, each subject being its own witness without any carry-across effect, the two treatments being separated by one to two weeks (&quot;split-mouth cross-over&quot;).</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The dental surgeon cannot, of course, be blind to the type of anesthesia. The subject may be kept blind to the type of anesthesia administered. This is the most important since the main criterion of judgment is a criterion reported by the patient (his or her pain during anesthesia). Similarly, the evaluator will be kept blind to the type of anesthesia administered.</masking_description>
