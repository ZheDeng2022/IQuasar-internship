    <description>The secondary objectives are to investigate the effects of both treatments on the clinical cure rate and symptoms, including redness, irritation, itching, dysuria, dyspareunia, vaginal discharge after 1, 6, 9, and 12 months of therapy. In addition, the prophylactic activity after 6 months maintenance therapy, and the long-term efficacy as number of relapses within 12 months will be investigated. Moreover, information about side effects, discomfort, quality of life, therapy compliance, and cost of treatments for both products will be collected and compared. They will reach from no complaints-a little bit-moderate-severe</description>
