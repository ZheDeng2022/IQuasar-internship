      This study is a prospective, multicenter case series per standard of care EGD procedures&#xD;
      using a nonsignificant risk Saneso 360° gastroscope. 20 cases will be included at up to five&#xD;
      (5) clinical sites. Patients who meet all eligibility criteria will be included and will have&#xD;
      a clinically indicated EGD procedure performed using the study device. Immediately&#xD;
      thereafter, patients will have an EGD procedure using a standard Gastroscope (Olympus GIF180)&#xD;
      by a second endoscopist. Enrolled subjects will be followed for 7 days after their procedure.&#xD;
      If the procedure is not successful with the study device, the endoscopist will complete the&#xD;
      procedure with a traditional gastroscope used at each facility.&#xD;

    <description>Endoscopists will rate their experience with the Saneso 360° gastroscope immediately following the completion of the study procedure 1) using a five-point Likert scales (5 - excellent; 4 - good; 3- acceptable; 2- difficult; and 1-unacceptable).</description>

    <description>Endoscopist qualitative rating of the Saneso 360° gastroscope compared to their past experience with traditional gastroscopes (TG) as it pertains to various design and performance related attributes using a 3-point Likert scale (Saneso gastroscope is 5 - superior to TG; 3 - the same as TG; 1 - inferior to TG).</description>
