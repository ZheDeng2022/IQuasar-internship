  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health information technology (HIT) has the potential to improve the quality, efficiency,&#xD;
      consistency, and availability of cancer survivor care. PREVENT is a novel HIT tool designed&#xD;
      by our team for adolescents (12-19 years). PREVENT aggregates and displays the American Heart&#xD;
      Association's (AHA) Life Simple 7 cardiovascular health (CVH) risk factors and provides&#xD;
      tailored, evidence-based, behavior change recommendations inclusive of community resources&#xD;
      that are delivered to overweight/obese adolescents at the point-of-care to improve CVH. The&#xD;
      investigators seek to expand this tool for patients beyond 19 years of age to increase this&#xD;
      tool's reach to the entire adolescent and young adult (AYA) age range and then evaluate its&#xD;
      effectiveness among AYA cancer survivors.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in minutes of physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 3-months, and 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity will be measured using a triaxial accelerometer (Actigraph GT3X+, Actigraph of Ft. Walton Beach, FL). The participant will be instructed to wear the accelerometer on an elasticized belt, on the left mid-axillary line. The Actigraph is one of the most common accelerometers used for scientific purposes. Participants will be encouraged to wear the accelerometer 24-hours per day for at least 7-days, including 2 weekend days.</description>

    <measure>Provider's satisfaction of PREVENT tool: survey</measure>
    <time_frame>3-months</time_frame>
    <description>A survey (15-questions) will assess provider's satisfaction with five aspects of health information technology: content, accuracy, format, ease of use and timeliness. Questions are asked on a 5-point Likert scale (range: 15-75) with a higher score indicating greater satisfaction</description>

    <measure>Provider's motivation for sustained use of PREVENT tool</measure>
    <time_frame>3-months</time_frame>
    <description>-A survey (12-questions) will assess provider's intent to change their behavior and continue using PREVENT were adapted from Legare's CPD Reaction Questionnaire. Questions are asked using a 7-point Likert scale (range: 12-84) with a higher score indicating greater motivation for sustained use.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fidelity of PREVENT tool implementation</measure>
    <time_frame>0-3 months</time_frame>
    <description>-Fidelity will be measured using direct observation of patient-provider interactions while using the PREVENT tool. A direct observation checklist will be used by the observer to determine the number of interactions with the PREVENT tool that were implemented as intended.</description>
