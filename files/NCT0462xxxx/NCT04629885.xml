  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase 2b study, divided in 2 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The main part of the study investigates the efficacy and safety of the Investigational&#xD;
           Medicinal Product (IMP), intravaginally administered in glass syringes, on&#xD;
           postmenopausal women with vulvovaginal atrophy symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The exploratory part of the study investigates the efficacy and safety of the IMP,&#xD;
           intravaginally administered in a laminate tube, on postmenopausal women with&#xD;
           vulvovaginal atrophy symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comparison of plasma levels of oxytocin when the IMP is administered by 2 different&#xD;
      applicators will be investigated in a sub-group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the main part, 160 subjects are enrolled and randomized to 2 different groups; 80 subjects&#xD;
      receiving IMP and 80 subjects receiving placebo, in glass syringes. In the exploratory part&#xD;
      of the study, 40 patients will be enrolled and randomized to 2 different groups; 30 subjects&#xD;
      receiving IMP and 10 patients receiving placebo, in laminate tubes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is conducted at 3 sites in Sweden, and comprises 5 visits: screening visit (Visit&#xD;
      0), randomization visit (Visit 1; Day 0), treatment follow-up visit (Visit 2; Week 4), end of&#xD;
      treatment visit (Visit 3; Week 12) and a telephone follow-up visit (Visit 4; Week 14). All&#xD;
      patients self-administer the IMP once daily for 12 weeks.&#xD;
