      BACKGROUND The burnout syndrome among health care workers frequently rises to prevalence&#xD;
      above 50%. One of the consequences most supported by the literature is the impoverishment of&#xD;
      the therapeutic alliance, triggered by a loss of empathy of the clinician towards the patient&#xD;
      due to the emotional exhaustion he or she suffers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main factors that influence the presence of this pathology are stressors related to the&#xD;
      organization of work. However, this equation is also influenced by individual factors that&#xD;
      can be acted upon and which are often the only tools available for professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the widely supported relationship of empathy, burnout and therapeutic alliance, the&#xD;
      investigators decided to carry out a complex training plan focused on personal development in&#xD;
      teaching units of Family and Community Care in Spain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTION Is effective an intervention aimed to promoting the development of personal&#xD;
      skills throughout the training of family and community care doctors and nurses?&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD Pre-post study, comparing two educational interventions, one face-to-face (N=90) and&#xD;
      other online (N=70), with a control group (N=170).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: All physicians and nurse trainees on Primary Health Care in three Spanish&#xD;
      Health Regions who wish to participate in the study. The face-to-face intervention consists&#xD;
      of 3 annual workshops, while the online one will be carried out by adapting the theoretical&#xD;
      contents of the face-to-face intervention for online use and will pursue the same objectives&#xD;
      and be fed by the same contents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variation in the level of empathy will be quantified by means of the Interpersonal&#xD;
      Reactivity Index (IRI) questionnaire, adjusted by burnout (Copenhagen questionnaire) and&#xD;
      other variables such as resilience (Connor-Davidson), locus of control, social support&#xD;
      (Oslo-3), sense of coherence (OLQ-13), age, sex, personality (Ten Item Personality Inventory,&#xD;
      TIPI-SP) and other organisational factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis with generalized lineal models and generalized additive models.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the purpose of modeling and evaluating a comprehensive personal development intervention&#xD;
      in family and community care residents (doctors and nurses) this project is proposed. With&#xD;
      two expected results from the professionals' perspective: first, to evaluate the changes in&#xD;
      self-perceived empathy; on the other hand, the modification of the level of exhaustion in&#xD;
      them. In both, taking into account the personal factors discussed above, as well as&#xD;
      organizational or training factors during this period of the residents' lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In essence, our model assumes that personal (on which the intervention will act) and&#xD;
      organizational factors modulate changes in the exhaustion of residents during their&#xD;
      residence. In turn, the differences in professional burnout will be reflected in&#xD;
      self-perceived empathy at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the novelty and curricular changes that its implementation would entail, the&#xD;
      investigators want to quantify its effectiveness in the results sought, comparing the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a face-to-face intervention, an online intervention with the same objectives&#xD;
      and content, and a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mean self-perceived empathy will increase at least 1 point in the face-to-face&#xD;
           intervention group compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The professional burnout syndrome of the participants will be 10% lower in the&#xD;
           face-to-face intervention group at the end of the study compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Personal skills (greater empathy, greater sense of coherence, greater resilience,&#xD;
           internal locus of control, greater social support), will be independently inversely&#xD;
           associated with the burnout syndrome, adjusting for personal factors (younger age, male&#xD;
           sex, positive personality traits), organizational (less workload), training (greater&#xD;
           adherence to the intervention, greater participation in other activities related to it)&#xD;
           and by the participant's baseline anxiety and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Face-to-face intervention will improve self-perceived empathy and decrease burnout&#xD;
           syndrome better than online; these differences will be significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAIN GOAL:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effectiveness of a face-to-face intervention in relation to its online&#xD;
      counterpart and regular training according to changes registered in the degree of&#xD;
      professional burnout syndrome and in self-rated empathy in residents of the Multiprofessional&#xD;
      Teaching Units of Family Medicine and Community Nursing in Vigo, Zaragoza and Mallorca.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - Quantify the adjusted influence of the professional burnout syndrome on self-rated&#xD;
           empathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Quantify changes in resilience and their adjusted influence on the professional&#xD;
           burnout syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - Quantify changes in the locus of control and their adjusted influence on the&#xD;
           professional burnout syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. - Quantify changes in social support and their adjusted influence on the professional&#xD;
           burnout syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. - Quantify changes in the sense of coherence and their adjusted influence on the&#xD;
           professional burnout syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
           MATERIAL AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ante-post evaluation study of the effectiveness of an educational intervention to&#xD;
           improve empathy, with three arms: face-to-face, online and control group, lasting 2&#xD;
           years. The intervention is organized during the training of residents of Family and&#xD;
           Community Care in three teaching units in different health regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Scope of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the face-to-face intervention group, 90 residents of the Vigo Family and Community&#xD;
           Nursing Teaching Unit will participate, both Internal Resident Physicians (MIR) and&#xD;
           Internal Resident Nurses (EIR), from the 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 promotions. In the&#xD;
           online intervention, 70 (MIR and EIR) of Aragón Training Unit of the same promotions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the control group, the same measurements were carried out on 180 residents, doctors&#xD;
           and nurses, from the same classes of the Balearic Islands Teaching Unit, who agreed to&#xD;
           participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recruitment of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Residents will be informed of the existence of the study by people outside the research&#xD;
           team. If they agree to be informed, they will be contacted and they will be explained&#xD;
           what the study consists of, ensuring that their participation or rejection of it will&#xD;
           not have any repercussions on their residence. Residents who agree to participate will&#xD;
           accept the transfer of their contact details to the research team for their management&#xD;
           by a specific professional of the Institute to which the resident belongs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The participants will be sent the surveys for completion on-line using the free software&#xD;
           REDCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Under the hypothesis of achieving changes in the three components of the Copenhagen&#xD;
           Burnout Inventory (CBI) similar to those achieved in the experience of the Harvard South&#xD;
           Shore Psychiatry Residency Training Program (50), for alpha = 0.05 and beta = 0.80 and,&#xD;
           With twice as many cases as controls, at least 74 residents are required in the&#xD;
           intervention group and 148 in the control group (OpenEpi, version 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study period:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will be conducted between November 2020 and June 2023.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomization procedure (if applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Due to the characteristics of the intervention, it is not possible to randomize or use&#xD;
           placebo. The registry will be masked and each participant will receive a random code&#xD;
           that will not be known to any of the researchers. The masking and custody of the codes&#xD;
           will be carried out by the data management unit of the Health Research Institute&#xD;
           corresponding to the participant's area (Vigo, Zaragoza, Mallorca).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Investigators conducting statistical analysis will be blind to group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Measurements and interventions (main and secondary variables).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Outcome variables: Self-rated empathy with Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), level&#xD;
           of burnout in the personal, work and relationship with clients spheres with the&#xD;
           self-completed Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Independent variables: Resilience measure with the abbreviated Connor-Davidson scale&#xD;
           (10-item CD-RISC), self-perception of the Locus of control, perceived social support&#xD;
           (Oslo-3) and the sense of coherence measured through the abbreviated Orientation to Life&#xD;
           scale. Questionnaire (OLQ-13).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Covariates: Sociodemographic (age, sex, nationality), profession, promotion, personality&#xD;
           classification with TIPI-SP, baseline anxiety and depression measured through the&#xD;
           Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire, potentially stressful&#xD;
           situations in the organization (average hours annual worked, average monthly shifts,&#xD;
           number of patients / day in the primary care consultation), process indicators (number&#xD;
           of workshops received, months of residence, months of stay in health center, hours of&#xD;
           training in motivational interviewing and hours of training in mindfulness during&#xD;
           residency and own iniciative).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The completion of all the questionnaires takes an estimated time of 40 minutes and will&#xD;
           be done at the beginning, the year and at the end of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The surveys will be carried out electronically. Participants will receive an e-mail with&#xD;
           the link to access the online survey, which will be completed anonymously.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the first interface the participants will see the informed consent of the part of the&#xD;
           survey, if they want to participate they will accept the terms and write their name,&#xD;
           surname and reference teaching unit. These data will be transmitted independently of the&#xD;
           survey results to the data management unit of the Health Research Institute of the&#xD;
           participant's reference area. This will have a code that will be associated with the&#xD;
           second interface, the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the second interface, the questionnaire will be displayed where they will have to&#xD;
           answer the questions, with no answer being always possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Description of the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
           Face-to-face intervention of the Vigo Teaching Unit:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The intervention has been created specifically for this group, residents of Family and&#xD;
           Community Medicine and Nursing, with the aim of acquiring or improving personal skills&#xD;
           mediating in the processes of physical and mental well-being that help them face with&#xD;
           more motivation, enthusiasm and personal resources professional challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is based on conducting 4-hour face-to-face workshops every four months throughout the&#xD;
           period of specialized health training. They will be instrumented through group dynamics,&#xD;
           communication exercises, leadership, corporality, and reflective and emotional writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Audiovisual media (videos, presentations, recordings) will be used. They will be&#xD;
           developed face-to-face in a classroom equipped with the necessary means for training,&#xD;
           including versatility of the space.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The intervention has been developed by a family doctor, with training and experience in&#xD;
           prevention and approach to individual factors that act as protective factors of&#xD;
           &quot;burnout&quot;. She herself will be the one who gives the workshops and is paid for it.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The online intervention will pursue the same objectives and will be nourished by the&#xD;
           same content as the face-to-face intervention. The theoretical contents will be adapted&#xD;
           for online use, with the flexibility of access and organization that this entails for&#xD;
           the participants, including videos, presentations, recordings ...&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group techniques will be carried out online, every four months during the entire period&#xD;
           of specialized health training. They will be instrumented through group dynamics,&#xD;
           communication exercises, leadership, corporality, and reflective and emotional writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The teacher and tutor responsible for the online intervention will be a member of the&#xD;
           Aragonese team external to the teaching unit, a health psychologist with extensive&#xD;
           training and experience in work and organizational psychology, as well as in clinical&#xD;
           psychology.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The control group will be made up of residents who start or have started their training&#xD;
           in 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 of the Balearic Islands Teaching Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           These residents will receive the usual training in communication skills, according to&#xD;
           the program of their teaching unit. Once the study is completed, they will be able to&#xD;
           enjoy the training with the best results, either in person or online.&#xD;
&#xD;
           They will complete the same questionnaires at the beginning, at the year and at the end&#xD;
           of the study, in the same periods as the intervention group and in the same agreed&#xD;
           sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
           STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
           The analyzes will be done by intention to treat, keeping all the participants in their&#xD;
           initial group of membership, including the missing values through analysis of multiple&#xD;
           imputations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary analysis will be the difference in means of empathy and the professional&#xD;
           burnout syndrome, with multilevel generalized linear models. The dependent variables,&#xD;
           the group, the baseline measurement of each dependent variable and the applicable&#xD;
           covariates will be included; in addition, robust standard errors will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following sensitivity analyzes will be carried out: 1) adjusting for the probability&#xD;
           of the professional burnout syndrome at the baseline and those other covariates that&#xD;
           could indicate an imbalance between the trial arms; 2) comparing unfit and tight models.&#xD;
           Different definitions of compliance-adherence to interventions will also be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All p values will be two-tailed and statistical significance will be considered at the ≤&#xD;
           0.05 level. All intervals will be made at 95% confidence. For statistical analyzes, R.&#xD;
&#xD;
           SAFETY AND ADVERSE EFFECTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
           If through the responses to the questionnaires an imminent risk to the health of any of&#xD;
           the participants is suspected, they will be informed of their results.&#xD;
