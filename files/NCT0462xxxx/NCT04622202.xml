  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is exaggerated neuroendocrine stress response to laryngoscopy and endotracheal&#xD;
      intubation during the Induction to anesthesia-delivery (I-D) period under light anesthesia.&#xD;
      Mechanical stimulation of laryngeal proprioceptors elicits increased secretion of cortisol&#xD;
      and catecholamine with subsequent elevation of blood pressure from 40 to 50 % and heart rate&#xD;
      up to 20 % during direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation&#xD;

      The sample size was calculated using OPEN EPI program assuming that the mean visual analogue&#xD;
      scale anxiety score was 49.3±14.1 among oral pregabalin group and was 58.6± 14.4 among&#xD;
      Placebo group (8) so at power of study 80% confidence interval 95%, the sample size was&#xD;
      calculated to be 74 cases (37in each group&#xD;

    <description>changes in level of consciousness of participant by Alert, verbal response, pain response and unresponsive (AVPU) scale 60 minutes after giving drug (pre-induction).&#xD;
Alert: The patient is aware of the examiner and can respond to the environment around them on their own. The patient can also follow commands, open their eyes spontaneously, and track objects.&#xD;
Verbally Responsive: The patient's eyes do not open spontaneously. The patient's eyes open only in response to a verbal stimulus directed toward them. The patient is able to react to that verbal stimulus directly and in a meaningful way.&#xD;
Painfully Responsive: The patient's eyes do not open spontaneously. The patient will only respond to the application of painful stimuli by an examiner. The patient may move, moan, or cry out directly in response to the painful stimuli.&#xD;
Unresponsive: The patient does not respond spontaneously. The patient does not respond to verbal or painful stimuli.</description>
