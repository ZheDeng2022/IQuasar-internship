  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, partially-blinded, active comparator-controlled will be conducted at&#xD;
      multiple sites. The composition of QVLP to be used in this study includes a mix of&#xD;
      recombinant H1, H3, and two B hemagglutinin proteins expressed as VLPs and will be based on&#xD;
      the 2020-2021 influenza virus strains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 120 healthy adult subjects 65 years of age and older are planned for&#xD;
      randomization in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive QVLP at a dose of 30 µg/strain with AS03 adjuvant&#xD;
      or QVLP (30 µg/strain) (unadjuvanted) or Fluzone HD Quad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will participate in this study approximatly 12 months, during which a first visit&#xD;
      will be scheduled on Day 0 for screening and vaccine administration.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects must have read, understood, and signed the informed consent form (ICF) prior&#xD;
             to participating in the study; subjects must also complete study-related procedures&#xD;
             and communicate with the study staff at visits and by phone during the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male and female subjects must be 65 years of age and older at the Vaccination visit&#xD;
             (Visit 2);&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject must have a body mass index (BMI) &lt; 30 kg/m2 at the Vaccination visit (Visit&#xD;
             2);&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects are considered by the Investigator to be reliable and likely to cooperate&#xD;
             with the assessment procedures and be available for the duration of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects must be non-institutionalized (e.g. not living in rehabilitation centres or&#xD;
             old-age homes; living in an elderly community is acceptable) and have no acute or&#xD;
             evolving medical problems prior to study participation and no clinically relevant&#xD;
             abnormalities that could jeopardize subject safety or interfere with study&#xD;
             assessments, as assessed by the Principal Investigator or sub-Investigator (thereafter&#xD;
             referred as Investigator) and determined by medical history, physical examination,&#xD;
             serology, clinical chemistry and haematology tests, urinalysis, and vital signs.&#xD;
             Investigator discretion will be permitted with this inclusion criterion;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Subjects with a pre-existing chronic disease will be allowed to participate if the&#xD;
        disease is stable and, according to the Investigator's judgment that must be documented in&#xD;
        the source documents, the condition is unlikely to confound the results of the study or&#xD;
        pose additional risk to the subject by participating in the study. Stable disease is&#xD;
        generally defined as no new onset or exacerbation of pre-existing chronic disease three&#xD;
        months prior to vaccination. Based on the Investigator's judgment and documented in source&#xD;
        documentation, a subject with more recent stabilization of a disease could also be&#xD;
        eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. According to the Investigator's opinion, significant acute or chronic, uncontrolled&#xD;
             medical or neuropsychiatric illness. Acute disease is defined as presence of any&#xD;
             moderate or severe acute illness with or without a fever within 48 hours prior to the&#xD;
             Vaccination visit (Visit 2). 'Uncontrolled' is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Requiring a new medical or surgical treatment during the three months prior to&#xD;
                  study vaccine administration;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Requiring any significant change in a chronic medication (i.e. drug, dose,&#xD;
                  frequency) during the three months prior to study vaccine administration due to&#xD;
                  uncontrolled symptoms or drug toxicity unless the innocuous nature of the&#xD;
                  medication change meets the criteria outlined in inclusion criterion no. 5 and is&#xD;
                  appropriately justified and documented by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Investigator discretion is permitted with this exclusion criterion and must be&#xD;
             carefully and fully documented in the source documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any confirmed or suspected current immunosuppressive condition or immunodeficiency,&#xD;
             including cancer, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B or C infection (subjects&#xD;
             with a history of cured hepatitis B or C infection without any signs of&#xD;
             immunodeficiency at present time are allowed). Investigator discretion is permitted&#xD;
             with this exclusion criterion;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Current autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment (such as rheumatoid arthritis,&#xD;
             systemic lupus erythematosus, or multiple sclerosis). Investigator discretion is&#xD;
             permitted with this exclusion criterion, and subjects may be eligible to participate&#xD;
             with appropriate written justification in the source document (i.e. subjects with a&#xD;
             history of autoimmune disease who are disease-free without treatment for three years&#xD;
             or more, or on stable thyroid replacement therapy, mild psoriasis [i.e. a small number&#xD;
             of minor plaques requiring no systemic treatment], etc.);&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Administration of any non-influenza vaccine within 30 days prior to the Vaccination&#xD;
             visit (Visit 2); planned administration of any vaccine up to Day 28 of the study.&#xD;
             Immunization on an emergency basis during the study will be evaluated on case-by-case&#xD;
             basis by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Administration of an authorized COVID-19 vaccine prior to or during the study is&#xD;
             acceptable;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Administration of influenza vaccine within six months prior to the Vaccination visit&#xD;
             (Visit 2) or planned administration of influenza vaccine (other than the study&#xD;
             vaccine) up to completion of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Administration of any adjuvanted or investigational influenza vaccine within one year&#xD;
             prior to randomization or planned administration prior to the completion of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Use of any investigational or non-registered product within 30 days or five&#xD;
             half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to the Vaccination visit (Visit 2) or planned&#xD;
             use during the study period. Subjects who are in a prolonged post-administration&#xD;
             observation period of another investigational or marketed drug clinical study, for&#xD;
             which there is no ongoing exposure to the investigational or marketed product and all&#xD;
             scheduled on-site visits are completed, will be allowed to take part in this study, if&#xD;
             all other eligibility criteria are met;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Administration of any medication or treatment that may alter the vaccine immune&#xD;
             responses, such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Systemic glucocorticoids at a dose exceeding 10 mg of prednisone (or equivalent)&#xD;
                  per day for more than seven consecutive days or for 10 or more days in total,&#xD;

                  intraarticular, ophthalmic, dermatological, and other topical glucocorticoids are&#xD;
                  permitted;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cytotoxic, antineoplastic or immunosuppressant drugs - within 36 months prior to&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Use of any prescription antiviral drugs with the intention of COVID-19 prophylaxis,&#xD;
             including those that are thought to be effective for prevention of COVID-19 but have&#xD;
             not been licensed for this indication, within one month prior to the Vaccination visit&#xD;
             (Visit 2);&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects at high risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infection, including, but not&#xD;
             limited to, individuals with known close contact with:&#xD;
