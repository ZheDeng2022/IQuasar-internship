      This research study will assess whether abemaciclib alone or in combination with MK-6482 are&#xD;
      safe and effective in slowing down the growth of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs in this investigational combination are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abemaciclib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MK-6482&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This a two-arm, non-randomized phase 1/1B trial aiming at assessing the safety and activity&#xD;
      of abemaciclib alone (arm 1), and abemaciclib plus MK-6482 (arm 2) in patients with advanced&#xD;
      refractory clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (croc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of an investigational drug or drug combination and&#xD;
      also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug or drug combination to&#xD;
      use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.The U.S. Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved either abemaciclib or MK-6482 for renal&#xD;
      (kidney) cancer but abemaciclib has been approved to treat other forms of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abemaciclib is in a class of drugs known as CDK4 &amp; 6 inhibitors. These proteins control how&#xD;
      fast cells grow and divide and are found on both normal and cancer cells. They become&#xD;
      overactive in cancer cells causing cells to grow and divide uncontrollably. Abemaciclib&#xD;
      blocks these proteins just as the cells start to grow and divide and in other cancers has&#xD;
      been shown to slow down cancer cell growth and division, causing cancer cells to become&#xD;
      inactive or even die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MK-6482 is an oral, first-in-class selective small-molecule inhibitor that targets&#xD;
      hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-2a, which promotes the growth of new vessels that fuel kidney&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is looking at two different treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 1 - abemaciclib alone:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine the response rate of abemaciclib alone in patients with advanced ccRCC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 2 - combination therapy of abemaciclib and MK-6482&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine the maximum dose of abemaciclib and MK-6482 in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine the response rate of abemaciclib and MK-6482 in patients with advanced&#xD;
                ccRCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study treatment, participant&#xD;
      evaluations and safety follow-up visits, in addition to general health status follow-up after&#xD;
      study treatment. It is estimated that participants will receive 12 to 18 months of study&#xD;
      treatment and 3 months of safety follow-up, totaling about 15 to 21 months from the start of&#xD;
      study treatment. After the safety follow-up visits, the study doctor may request that&#xD;
      participants return to clinic for additional tumor assessments or his/her staff will contact&#xD;
      participants about every 6 months to follow their health status and find out about any&#xD;
      anticancer treatments participants may have begun after study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 40 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
