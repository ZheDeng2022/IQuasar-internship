  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Literature have shown the benefit of practicing regular physical activity during and after&#xD;
      cancer treatment, particularly in terms of improving quality of life. The French Fencing&#xD;
      Federation has thus developed an adapted physical activity program (Solution RIPOSTE)&#xD;
      specially intended for patients with breast cancer. Adapted fencing sessions (saber) are thus&#xD;
      offered to these patients in a perfectly secure context (i.e. compulsory medical-sports&#xD;
      evaluation and trained fencing master). Since 2016, this RIPOSTE program has been implemented&#xD;
      in several fencing halls in Lorraine. Our research project (controlled, randomized trial)&#xD;
      aims to assess the impact of the practice of adapted fencing on the quality of life of&#xD;
      patients, the functional capacities of the operated side (shoulder) and on the reduction of&#xD;
      the sides effects of treatments. Our hypothesis is that such an adapted fencing program&#xD;
      improves quality of life as well as functional abilities.&#xD;
