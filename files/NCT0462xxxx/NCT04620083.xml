      Objectives: To develop an integrative learning program and evaluate its effect on people with&#xD;
      dementia. Methods: The study started from January 2017 to March 2018 and consisted of two&#xD;
      stages. The first stage employed Delphi technique while the second an experimental design. An&#xD;
      expert panel was invited to develop the integrative learning program based on the&#xD;
      neuroplasticity and learning framework in the first stage. A mixed method approach was&#xD;
      adopted for the evaluation of the program in the second stage. Questionnaires and clinical&#xD;
      instruments were used to collect quantitative data. For qualitative data, verbatim&#xD;
      transcripts of case conferences were coded, analyzed, and collapsed into themes and&#xD;
      sub-themes by consensus. Results: Quantitatively, significant improvements in the&#xD;
      participants' functional performance and well-being in the experimental groups, while&#xD;
      qualitatively, improvements on their communications, emotions, connectedness with self and&#xD;
      others, and well-being. Conclusion: Overall the evaluation was positive; however, larger&#xD;
      sample size of old people from more community care centers would provide more conclusive&#xD;
      results.&#xD;

      Stage 1 - The development of the integrative learning program&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delphi technique was employed to gain consensus in the best possible therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions for old people with dementia among members of the expert panel. The panel&#xD;
      consisted of 8 health professionals including a gerontic care nurse, a registered nurse, an&#xD;
      occupational therapist, a physiotherapist, a Chinese medicine practitioner, a mindfulness&#xD;
      practitioner, a nutritionist, and a neuroscientist. They all had more than 10 years of&#xD;
      experience in their own disciplines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research team member explained to the experts individually the purpose of having the Panel&#xD;
      and the importance of opinion sharing and idea exchange. Subsequent exchanges covered the&#xD;
      conceptual framework, needs of people with dementia, components of the program operation and&#xD;
      the intervention protocol. The experts did not meet but to provide their views through emails&#xD;
      or audio recordings. Research members organized, collated the views, presented the aggregated&#xD;
      views iteratively to each expert for consideration. The exchange on each topic terminated&#xD;
      when all experts reached total agreement on their analysis and views were exhausted. Upon&#xD;
      completion of each round, a summary was sent to all experts for accuracy checking. With this&#xD;
      iterative approach, 12 rounds of exchange were necessitated to develop the complete&#xD;
      integrative learning protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To dispel any unrealistic expectations and facilitate learning, training in goal setting&#xD;
      skills is needed in the integrative learning program. It was agreed among the experts that&#xD;
      people with dementia have different needs and expectations, and various levels of difficulty&#xD;
      and ability to meet them, be it basic (novice) or advanced (expert). Hence the Panel&#xD;
      formulated a list of developmental needs which are necessary and essential for quality living&#xD;
      of people with dementia. The goal of development of each need was also identified based on a&#xD;
      novice-expert continuum and the conceptual framework of neuroplasticity and learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Panel reviewed some common dementia management programs used in local institutions.&#xD;
      Although these programs have included many contemporary treatment modalities, the results&#xD;
      were not marked. The Panel also commented that the treatment modalities could have been&#xD;
      sufficient but the piece-meal approach might undermine their efficacy. They concluded that an&#xD;
      integrated and structured multi-modality approach together with emotion management should be&#xD;
      adopted for the integrative learning program. The multi-modality treatments in the program&#xD;
      were structured sessions that employed physical, cognitive, social, and emotional&#xD;
      stimulations to intervene dementia. The modalities selected for the program included reality&#xD;
      orientation, daily living skills training, reminiscence therapy, multisensory stimulation,&#xD;
      fall prevention program, mindfulness activities, Meridian exercise, brain health program&#xD;
      (Four Arts of the Chinese Scholar which referred to zither, go, calligraphy and painting) and&#xD;
      health education. It was also agreed that case managers, caregivers, and participants were&#xD;
      free to choose these treatments or could be assigned to a treatment regime on a 'mix and&#xD;
      match' basis to suit their personality traits for improving their abilities to meet their own&#xD;
      needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the outcome of the above Delphi exercise, the experts brain-stormed the contents and&#xD;
      details of each, followed by discussions before resolutions were made by consensus. Consensus&#xD;
      was reached for the duration of a standard 3-day protocol and 5-day protocol. The 5-day&#xD;
      protocol was an extended version of the 3-day one which allowed the participants to practice&#xD;
      more in a designated time. Table 2 shows the 3-day integrative learning protocol.&#xD;
      Interventions using the protocol were carried out by case managers who could be nurses,&#xD;
      occupational therapists, or other health professionals. These case managers were independent&#xD;
      of the research team. To ensure the competency of the case managers, each one had to attend a&#xD;
      3-day training workshop, with one day on theories, another day on practical training by 3&#xD;
      members of the Expert Panel (the gerontic care nurse, the nurse, and the occupational&#xD;
      therapist) and the final day on quality assurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 - Proof of concept: The evaluation of the implementation of the developed program by&#xD;
      using a mixed method approach&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Quantitative Method The study was held in three community care centers run by the same&#xD;
      non-profit organization (NPO) and their routine and care provided were the same across their&#xD;
      centers. Two types of services were provided in community care centers, residential and day&#xD;
      care. The centers were located in different districts where residents were in public housing.&#xD;
      Three centers were randomly drawn from the NPO by drawing lots. Eligible older people with&#xD;
      dementia from the centers were recruited by convenience sampling. All participants continued&#xD;
      with their daily routines and medications during the research period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having received consent from both the eligible older people and their relatives, the research&#xD;
      team randomly allocated them to the control group (Con), Experimental 3-day normal group&#xD;
      (Exp-N) and Experimental 5-day intensive group (Exp-I). For the control group, the&#xD;
      participants received conventional therapy which included group activities for reality&#xD;
      orientation, reminiscence therapy and activities organized by occupational therapists one&#xD;
      hour a day, five days a week. In addition to conventional therapy, the two experimental&#xD;
      groups also joined the integrative learning program. For consistency, Day 1 and 3 of the&#xD;
      3-day protocol were replicated as Day 4 and Day 5 of the 5-day protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation concealment was done to avoid selection bias while blinding was done to research&#xD;
      assistant who performed data collection. Data were collected before the start of the program&#xD;
      (T0) and upon its completion (T2 - at 6th month) for all 3 groups. For the two experimental&#xD;
      groups, there was a mid-intervention evaluation (T1- at 3rd month). During the intervention,&#xD;
      the trained case managers evaluated the conditions of the participants on a monthly basis&#xD;
      until the completion of the program. They joined the monthly case conferences held by the&#xD;
      respective centers listening to progress of the participants reported by center staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the adoption of the mixed method approach, quantitative data were collected using 10&#xD;
      validated clinical test instruments while qualitative data were based on the verbatim&#xD;
      transcripts of the monthly case conferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) Qualitative Method For the qualitative data, the verbatim transcripts of the case&#xD;
      conferences were used for thematic analysis. These verbatim records were transcribed and&#xD;
      coded for content analysis, based on the conceptual framework of the integrative learning&#xD;
      program. The research assistant first identified words /segments in each transcript and then&#xD;
      condensed them into meaningful units. Two panel members abstracted all the condensed meaning&#xD;
      units into subthemes.&#xD;
