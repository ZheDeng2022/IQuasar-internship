  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke represents one of the main causes of adult disability and will be one of the main&#xD;
      contributors to the burden of disease in 2030. However, the investigator's healthcare systems&#xD;
      do not have enough resources to cover the current demand let alone its future increase. There&#xD;
      is a need to deploy new approaches that advance the current rehabilitation methods and&#xD;
      enhance their efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the latest approaches used for the rehabilitation of a wide range of deficits of the&#xD;
      nervous system is based on virtual reality (VR) applications, which combine training&#xD;
      scenarios with dedicated interface devices. Market drivers exist for new ICT based treatment&#xD;
      solutions. IBEC/ Eodyne Systems has developed and commercialised the Rehabilitation Gaming&#xD;
      System (RGS), a science-based ICT solution for neurorehabilitation combining brain theory,&#xD;
      AI, cloud computing and virtual reality and targeting motor and cognitive recovery after&#xD;
      stroke. RGS provides a continuum of evaluations and therapeutic solutions that accompany the&#xD;
      patient from the clinic to the therapy centre. RGS has been clinically validated showing its&#xD;
      superiority over other products while reducing cost also through its use of standard&#xD;
      off-the-shelf hardware and a Software as a Service model (SaaS). Commercial evaluations have&#xD;
      shown that RGS acts as a workforce multiplier while delivering a high quality of care at&#xD;
      clinical centres (RGS@Clinic). However, in order to achieve significant benefits in the&#xD;
      patients' QoL, it is essential that RGS becomes an at home solution providing 24/7 monitoring&#xD;
      and care. For this reason, this project aims at investigating the RGS acceptability and&#xD;
      adoption model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings derived from this study will contribute to establish a novel and superior&#xD;
      neurorehabilitation paradigm that can accelerate the recovery of hemiparetic stroke patients.&#xD;
      Besides the clinical impact, such achievement could have relevant socioeconomic impact.&#xD;

    <description>The RGS treatment will consist in a variable number of sessions per week of RGS-based training. Each session consists of cognitive and motor training involving reaching, grasping, placing virtual objects. The duration of the training period will be variable. Patients will use the RGS@Clinic from admission to discharge, and will have the RGS@Home during the first 3 months of the outpatient stage after recruitment. After this period of time, the patient will be evaluated by clinicians and the RGS@Home system will be collected. The RGS-Wear will be kept by the patient also during the follow-up period, up to 1 year post-recruitment.</description>

             (sensorial, Wernicke aphasia or apraxia), major pain or other neuromuscular&#xD;
             impairments or orthopedic devices that would interfere with the correct execution of&#xD;
             the experiment (Modified Ashworth Scale &lt; 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to use the RGS independently according to the therapist's observations and&#xD;
