      The purpose of the study is to assess the long-term use of lacosamide oral solution dosed at&#xD;
      2 mg/kg/day to 12 mg/kg/day when administered to pediatric study participants with epilepsy&#xD;
      who have completed NCT01964560 (EP0034) or NCT00938912 (SP848).&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Data from this trial may be requested by qualified researchers six months after product approval in the US and/or Europe, or global development is discontinued, and 18 months after trial completion. Investigators may request access to anonymized individual patient-level data and redacted trial documents which may include: analysis-ready datasets, study protocol, annotated case report form, statistical analysis plan, dataset specifications, and clinical study report. Prior to use of the data, proposals need to be approved by an independent review panel at www.Vivli.org and a signed data sharing agreement will need to be executed. All documents are available in English only, for a prespecified time, typically 12 months, on a password protected portal. This plan may change if the risk of re-identifying trial participants is determined to be too high after the trial is completed; in this case and to protect participants, individual patient-level data would not be made available.</ipd_description>
