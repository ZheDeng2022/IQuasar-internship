  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, Phase 1, open label, multicenter, multiple dose, dose escalation&#xD;
      and dose expansion study intended to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic,&#xD;
      and potential clinical benefit of PF-07209960, an anti-PD-1 targeting IL-15 fusion protein,&#xD;
      in participants with selected locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors for whom no&#xD;
      standard therapy is available, or would not be an appropriate option in the opinion of the&#xD;
      participant and their treating physician, or participants who have refused standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study contains 2 parts, single agent Dose Escalation (Part 1) to determine the&#xD;
      recommended dose of PF-07209960, followed by Dose Expansion (Part 2) in selected tumor types&#xD;
      at the recommended dose.&#xD;
