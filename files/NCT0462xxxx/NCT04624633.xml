      This study is testing the effectiveness of the study drug combination of acalabrutinib,&#xD;
      umbralisib, and ublituximab in participants with Chronic Lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are/is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acalabrutinib (CALQUENCE®, ACP-196)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Umbralisib (TGR-1202)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ublituximab (TG-1101)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this research study, Investigators are exploring the combination of acalabrutinib,&#xD;
      umbralisib, and ublituximab and hoping to determine if the combination is effective at&#xD;
      controlling cancer growth in participants with CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive the study drugs for a maximum of 24 cycles (2 years) and will be&#xD;
      followed for a maximum of 5 years after discontinuing the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are/is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acalabrutinib (CALQUENCE®, ACP-196)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Umbralisib (TGR-1202)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ublituximab (TG-1101)&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 60 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drugs to learn whether the drugs work in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drugs are being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved umbralisib or ublituximab&#xD;
           as a treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved acalabrutinib for CLL, but not&#xD;
           in this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Acalabrutinib is a type of drug called a kinase inhibitor. It blocks a type of&#xD;
                protein called Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) that helps CLL cells live and grow. By&#xD;
                blocking BTK, acalabrutinib may kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Umbralisib is an investigational drug which blocks a protein called PI3K. PI3K is a&#xD;
                protein that helps CLL cells grow.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ublituximab is a type of investigational drug called a monoclonal antibody. A&#xD;
                monoclonal antibody is a type of protein made in the laboratory that can locate and&#xD;
                bind to substances in the body, including tumor cells. By binding to the tumor&#xD;
                cells, the antibody might prevent the tumor cell from growing and spreading.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants must have measurable disease, defined as lymphocytosis &gt; 5,000 / μL, or&#xD;
             palpable or CT measurable lymphadenopathy ≥ 1.5 cm, or bone marrow involvement ≥ 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For enrollment to Cohort 1: Participants must have relapsed or refractory disease as&#xD;
             per iwCLL 2018 criteria,1 and must have received no more than 2 prior lines of&#xD;
             anti-cancer therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For enrollment to Cohort 2: Participants must have previously untreated disease (i.e.&#xD;
&#xD;
        must not have received any prior systemic therapy for CLL or SLL).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the&#xD;
             use of umbralisib, acalabrutinib, and ublituximab in participants &lt; 18 years of age&#xD;
             and CLL is extremely rare in this population, children are excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2 (Karnofsky ≥ 60%, see Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (unless due to&#xD;
                  hemolysis or Gilbert's disease, in which ≤ 3 × institutional ULN is acceptable)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 × institutional ULN, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 5 × institutional ULN if there is hemolysis or&#xD;
                  documented disease involvement in the liver&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min (as calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault&#xD;
                  formula)&#xD;
&#xD;

             treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac&#xD;
             function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be&#xD;
             eligible for this trial, participants should be class 2B or better.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of umbralisib, acalabrutinib, or ublituximab on the developing human fetus&#xD;
             are unknown. For this reason and because anti-cancer agents are known to be&#xD;
             teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use highly&#xD;
             effective methods of contraception. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform&#xD;
             her treating physician immediately. Men and women treated on this protocol must agree&#xD;
             to use highly effective contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, and 4 months after completion of umbralisib, acalabrutinib, or&#xD;
             ublituximab administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to swallow and retain oral medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be able to receive prophylactic anti-pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia&#xD;
             (PJP) and anti-viral therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with progressive or refractory disease while receiving either a BTK&#xD;
             inhibitor or PI3K inhibitor. Prior exposure to either a BTK inhibitor, PI3K inhibitor,&#xD;
             or both is acceptable as long as the participant's disease did not progress during&#xD;
             active therapy with the agent(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have undergone a major surgical procedure within 28 days of the first&#xD;
             dose of study drug. If a participant had major surgery greater than 28 days prior to&#xD;
             the first dose of study drug, they must have recovered adequately from any adverse&#xD;
             event and/or complications from the intervention prior to the first dose (as judged by&#xD;
             the treating investigator). For enrollment to Cohort 1: receipt of prior BTK inhibitor&#xD;
             treatment within 7 days, or any other anti-cancer therapy (e.g. chemotherapy,&#xD;
             immunotherapy, radiation, biologic therapy or any investigational agent) within 21&#xD;
             days of the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;

             CLL to large cell lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known CNS involvement, because of their poor prognosis and because&#xD;
             they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the&#xD;
             evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. Participants with no known history&#xD;
             of CNS leukemia are not required to undergo CT scan or lumbar puncture (LP) for trial&#xD;
             eligibility unless the participant is symptomatic as judged by the treating&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with uncontrolled autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) or idiopathic&#xD;
             thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with active clinically significant bleeding or history of bleeding&#xD;
             diathesis (e.g. hemophilia or von Willebrand disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants requiring or receiving anticoagulation with warfarin or equivalent&#xD;
             vitamin K antagonists (other anticoagulants are permitted).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a history of significant cerebrovascular disease/event within 6&#xD;
             months before the first dose of study drug, including stroke or intracranial&#xD;
             hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including but not limited to:&#xD;
             unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or poorly controlled and clinically&#xD;
             significant atherosclerotic vascular disease (including patients who required&#xD;
             angioplasty, cardiac or vascular stenting within 6 months prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             study agent), myocardial infarction within 6 months of screening, congestive heart&#xD;
             failure, or patients with Class 3 or 4 cardiac disease as defined by the New York&#xD;
             Heart Association Functional Classification. Note: participants with controlled,&#xD;
             asymptomatic atrial fibrillation are permitted to enroll on study. Concomitant use of&#xD;
             medication known to cause QT prolongation or torsades de pointes should be used with&#xD;
             caution and at investigator discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible with the following&#xD;
             exceptions: individuals who have been treated and are disease-free for a minimum of 2&#xD;
             years prior to study enrollment, or individuals who are deemed by the treating&#xD;
             investigator to be at low risk for disease recurrence. Additionally, individuals with&#xD;
             the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and curatively treated within the past&#xD;
             2 years: basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin, and breast or cervical&#xD;
             carcinomas in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prostate cancer on observation, with stable PSA for 6 months, is also eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who require ongoing immunosuppressive therapy including systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroids (prednisone or equivalent ≤ 10 mg daily is permitted). Topical,&#xD;
             inhaled, and ophthalmologic steroids are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (e.g. Crohn's disease or&#xD;
             ulcerative colitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with greater than 3 loose stools per&#xD;
             day at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with evidence of ongoing systemic bacterial, fungal, or viral infection,&#xD;
             except localized fungal infections of the skin or nails. NOTE: participants may be&#xD;
             receiving prophylactic antiviral or antibacterial therapies at the treating&#xD;
             investigator's discretion. Use of anti-pneumocystis and antiviral prophylaxis is&#xD;
             required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a known history of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with evidence of chronic active Hepatitis B (HBV, not including patients&#xD;
             with prior hepatitis B vaccination or positive serum Hepatitis B antibody), chronic&#xD;
             active&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hepatitis C infection (HCV), active cytomegalovirus (CMV), or known history of human&#xD;
        immunodeficiency virus (HIV):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If HBc antibody is positive, the subject must be evaluated for the presence of HBV DNA&#xD;
             by PCR (see Appendix B). Subjects with positive HBc antibody and negative HBV DNA by&#xD;
             PCR are eligible but serial monitoring of HBV DNA by PCR is required, see Section 5.4.&#xD;
             Subjects with positive HBV DNA by PCR are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with positive HBsAg are to be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If HCV antibody is positive, the subject must be evaluated for the presence of HCV RNA&#xD;
             by PCR. Subjects with positive HCV antibody and negative HCV RNA by PCR are eligible.&#xD;
             Subjects with positive HCV RNA by PCR are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the subject is CMV IgG or CMV IgM positive, the subject must be evaluated for the&#xD;
             presence of CMV DNA by PCR. Subjects who are CMV IgG or CMV IgM positive but who are&#xD;
             CMV DNA negative by PCR are eligible, anti-viral prophylaxis should be considered per&#xD;
             treating investigator discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of allergic reactions attributed to study drugs including active product&#xD;
                  or excipients, or compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to&#xD;
                  acalabrutinib, umbralisib, or ublituximab, including participants with a history&#xD;
                  of anaphylaxis (excluding infusion-related reactions) in association with&#xD;
                  previous anti-CD20 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants requiring concomitant treatment with any medications or substances&#xD;
                  that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 at the time of study enrollment.&#xD;
                  Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to&#xD;
                  regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the&#xD;
                  enrollment/informed consent procedures, the participant will be counseled on the&#xD;
                  risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to&#xD;
                  be prescribed or if the participant is considering a new over-the-counter&#xD;
                  medicine or herbal product.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants requiring concomitant treatment with proton pump inhibitors&#xD;
                  (e.g.omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, dexlansoprazole, rabeprazole, or&#xD;
                  pantoprazole) at the time of study enrollment. Note: participants receiving&#xD;
                  proton pump inhibitors who switch to H2-receptor antagonists or antacids prior to&#xD;
                  the first dose of study medication are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
                  compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because acalabrutinib, umbralisib,&#xD;
                  and ublituximab are anti-cancer agents with the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
                  abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
                  events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
                  acalabrutinib, umbralisib, or ublituximab, breastfeeding must be discontinued&#xD;
                  prior to the initiation of study treatment. A negative serum pregnancy test is&#xD;
                  required for women of childbearing potential within 3 days prior to Cycle 1 Day&#xD;
                  1.&#xD;
