      This trial studies how well yoga therapy works during chemotherapy and radiation treatment in&#xD;
      improving physical and emotional well-being in patients with stage IB2-IIIB cervical cancer.&#xD;
      Yoga therapy may help to balance the mind and body through exercise, meditation (focusing&#xD;
      thoughts), and control of breathing and emotions.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Establish feasibility of delivering a yoga therapy program during chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiation therapy (CRT) for loco-regionally advanced cervical cancer undergoing&#xD;
      chemo-radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Measure the effects and variance of yoga on fatigue, depression, anxiety, pelvic pain and&#xD;
      over-all quality of life (QOL) in cervical cancer (CxCa) patients undergoing primary&#xD;
      treatment with CRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Examine changes in other psychosocial outcomes including ability to find meaning in the&#xD;
      illness, spirituality and sexuality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate whether markers of stress response (plasma levels of other pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines, including interleukin-6 [IL-6], and IL-8, IL-10, VEGF, and CRP) change in response&#xD;
      to yoga therapy and their association with fatigue, depression, anxiety, pelvic pain, meaning&#xD;
      in the illness, experience, spirituality, and QOL in CxCa patients undergoing primary CRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I (YOGA GROUP): Patients attend at least 2 yoga classes per week over 5-6 weeks lasting&#xD;
      approximately 60 minutes each for up to 15 classes during the CRT. Patients also complete&#xD;
      surveys pre-treatment, once a week, and post-treatment over 5-10 minutes and receive a yoga&#xD;
      manual and DVD during and after CRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II (WAIT LIST CONTROL): Patients refrain from participating in any new stress&#xD;
      management activities and receive a DVD. Patients are also offered 4 group yoga classes after&#xD;
      3 months of CRT. Patients also complete surveys as in Group I.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Score of =&lt; 2 on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance scale&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to speak English&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IB2 through IIIB biopsy-proven&#xD;
             CxCa (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and adenosquamous) with plan to undergo&#xD;
             curative outpatient CRT at main campus MD Anderson Cancer Center&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medically documented restrictions at enrollment that could interfere with&#xD;
             participation in the yoga interventions (i.e. uncontrolled vaginal bleeding)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical illness that would prevent administration of full-dose chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent diagnosis of a second cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior hysterectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neuroendocrine histology&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  It is standard procedure to administer a pregnancy test before the start of CRT.&#xD;
                  Patients are deemed not pregnant by virtue of urine pregnancy test (UPT) or&#xD;
                  testing of the blood. Due to radiation and the nature of the disease, a patient&#xD;
                  becoming pregnant while on study is highly unlikely. In the event a patient were&#xD;
                  to get pregnant, they would be removed from study because their radiation therapy&#xD;
                  (RT) might be stopped or fetus would be terminated, which might influence other&#xD;
                  parameters that are being measured&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with major psychiatric diagnoses (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with extreme mobility issues, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had a regular yoga practice (at least one time a month) in past 6&#xD;
             months prior to study enrollment or who are currently engaged in a regular mind-body&#xD;
             practice&#xD;
