      The purpose of the study is to determine if using the smartphone application quitSTART can&#xD;
      help people quit smoking and to understand how use of specific smartphone application&#xD;
      features when trying to quit smoking is associated with success.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S. and causes multiple&#xD;
      cancers. Approximately 34 million U.S. adults currently smoke cigarettes, but over half of&#xD;
      all smokers attempt to quit smoking each year. However, only about 6% quit successfully, in&#xD;
      part, because many smokers make unassisted quit attempts, due to the lack of accessibility of&#xD;
      cessation programs. Mobile health (mHealth) smoking cessation programs delivered through&#xD;
      smartphone applications ('apps') can potentially reach a large number of smokers in the U.S.,&#xD;
      as 81% of U.S. adult smokers own a smartphone. The National Cancer Institute hosts&#xD;
      Smokefree.gov, a suite of free, publicly available smoking cessation resources. In addition&#xD;
      to web based and text-messaging resources, Smokefree.gov launched the quitSTART smartphone&#xD;
      app in 2013, which is a publicly available smoking cessation app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be asked to complete a pre-cessation assessment, then&#xD;
      download, install, and try to quit smoking using the smoking cessation smartphone&#xD;
      application, quitSTART. Participants will be asked to use quitSTART for 4 weeks. Participants&#xD;
      will also be asked to complete online surveys 2 and 4 weeks after the start of the study. To&#xD;
      understand how people are using quitSTART, the investigators will collect quitSTART usage&#xD;
      data from all participants (for example, how often someone opens quitSTART during the study&#xD;
      period and what specific features someone uses).&#xD;

    <description>All participants will have access to the Smokefree.gov Initiative smoking cessation smartphone application, quitSTART. This app is available, at no cost, to anyone who owns a smartphone and is interested in quitting smoking. All smokers who download quitSTART are asked to provide basic information about themselves (e.g., age, sex, reason to quit smoking, triggers to smoke, when users typically smoke, how users plan to celebrate success, smoking frequency, age when started smoking regularly, ethnicity, race, cigarettes smoked per day), and set a quit date. Information about cessation and challenges to help support quitting are available, as well as games and tracking features. While using the app, users can proactively report cigarette cravings, if they slipped, if they are feeling &quot;down&quot; or feeling &quot;great&quot;. If a user reports a craving, they have the option to mark the timing or location of the craving and request a reminder to resist future cravings at the same time or location.</description>
