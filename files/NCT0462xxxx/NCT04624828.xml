    <textblock>
      At the moment there is a lack of data in the setting of oligometastatic PC in particular&#xD;
      regarding the interaction between ablative SBRT, ADT and patient's immune system response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis underlying this project consists in the idea that the patient's immunological&#xD;
      context, RT and ADT may interact in the context of metastatic PC. Indeed the immune landscape&#xD;
      of patients may interfere with the efficacy of SBRT and on the other side RT may modulate the&#xD;
      immune response by driving immunotolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scope of the study will be to investigate the immune modulation after SBRT in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients with diagnosis of oligorecurrence during a treatment-free interval&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients with oligoprogression or oligopersistance during hormonal therapy&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (PC) represents the second most common cancer in men worldwide, managed with&#xD;
      surgery or radiotherapy (RT) in case of localized disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advanced PC can metastasize and often presents as an oligometastatic state, defined as an&#xD;
      intermediate state between localized and widespread diffused disease. Oligometastatic PC is&#xD;
      characterized by the presence of a limited number of metastases, commonly 1 to 5 lesions.&#xD;
      Recently, the ESTRO-EORTC collaboration characterized the oligometastatic disease and&#xD;
      provided a classification into oligorecurrence, and oligoprogression, considering whether&#xD;
      oligometastatic disease is diagnosed during a treatment-free interval or during active&#xD;
      systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most common sites of metastases from PC are bones and lymph nodes. Different studies have&#xD;
      been already published for oligometastatic PC patients. Singh et al. reported that a number&#xD;
      of metastases limited to 5, developed during follow-up after curative treatment of primary&#xD;
      tumor, is significantly associated to a better 5-year survival rate (73% vs 43% of patients&#xD;
      with more than 5 metastases).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of limited number of metastases, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) seems to&#xD;
      be effective but its role in the management of metastatic PC is still debated, due to the&#xD;
      paucity of prospective and randomized trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We reported the outcome of 92 oligometastatic PC patients treated with SBRT, reaching 1 and 3&#xD;
      years control of treated lesions in 90.9% (95%CI 81.8 - 95.6) and 85.5% (95%CI 74.4 - 92.0),&#xD;
      and a median overall survival of 91.6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ost et al. conducted a randomized trial comparing surveillance versus metastases directed&#xD;
      therapy in a sample of 62 hormone naïve metastatic PC patients. With a median follow-up time&#xD;
      of 3 years, the median ADT-free survival was 13 months for surveillance group versus 21 for&#xD;
      the treatment group. In terms of PFS, the median time until progression was 6 months for the&#xD;
      surveillance group, as compared with 10 months for the MDT group (p = 0.03).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main benefits from SBRT in oligometastatic setting are potentially the increasing time of&#xD;
      freedom from systemic therapy in naïve patients the delay of the intensification of systemic&#xD;
      therapy in patients already under treatment. Moreover another relevant advantage from SBRT is&#xD;
      the ability to modulate the tumor immune microenvironment as showed by preliminary studies.&#xD;
      In particular, SBRT has been shown to induce immune responses in treated patients with&#xD;
      potentially improved tumor control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RT is able to elicit a potent anti-tumour immune response, driven by the activation of T&#xD;
      cells infiltrating the tumor and the increase of antigen-presenting cell cross-presentation,&#xD;
      and on the other hand, also seems to enhance immunosuppression in cancer, mainly mediated by&#xD;
      the recruitment and activation of anti-inflammatory and pro-tumorigenic myeloid cell subsets.&#xD;
      The immune landscape of patients may interfere with the efficacy of radiation therapy and, on&#xD;
      the other side, SBRT may modulate the immune response by driving immuno-tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of RT may vary depending on tumor type and time of delivery. In addition the&#xD;
      immune modulation determined by RT may depend on the dose per fraction. On this regard&#xD;
      ablative dose of fractionated radiations were shown to elicit an anti-tumorigenic response&#xD;
      mediated by T cell activation in a model of breast cancer, that was not observed at&#xD;
      conventional doses. So far, no relevant studies have been published regarding the role of&#xD;
      SBRT in the immune modulation of metastatic PC patients. Neither the combination of SBRT and&#xD;
      androgen deprivation has been explored prospectively in terms of immune response. This&#xD;
      however is an area of interest, considering that preclinical studies showed that hormonal&#xD;
      therapy seems to increase the numbers of circulating naive T cells shortly after beginning of&#xD;
      ADT, and decrease numbers of circulating CD4+ Treg. At the same time infiltrating myeloid&#xD;
      subsets have been reported to facilitate resistance to ADT in mouse models of PC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the moment there is a lack of data in the setting of oligometastatic PC in particular&#xD;
      regarding the interaction between ablative SBRT, ADT and patient's immune system response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis underlying this project consists in the idea that the patient's immunological&#xD;
      context, RT and ADT may interact in the context of metastatic PC. Indeed the immune landscape&#xD;
      of patients may interfere with the efficacy of SBRT and on the other side RT may modulate the&#xD;
      immune response by driving immunotolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scope of the study will be to investigate the immune modulation after SBRT in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients with diagnosis of oligorecurrence during a treatment-free interval&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients with oligoprogression or oligopersistance during hormonal therapy&#xD;

    <description>We will use the flow cytometer FACSymphony, to analyse multiple immune populations from a limited sample of blood. We will monitor the dynamics of most innate (monocytic and granulocytic cells, Natural killer cells) and adaptive (T cells, B cells) immune subsets in the peripheral blood of PC patients before and after RT. We will deeply characterize CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subpopulations circulating in the patients enrolled in the study. In this attempt our panel will include markers of T cell differentiation and activation, including CD25, CD39, PD-1, CTL4, KLRG1, TIM3. We will analyse neutrophils subpopulations and investigate the functional profile of granulocytes in enrolled patients. Markers such as CD66b, CD24, CD16, MHC-II, LOX1, CD36 and CD62L will be included in our analysis. In conclusion our experimental strategy will result in a comprehensive profiling of the immune landscape in PC patients at single cell level.</description>
