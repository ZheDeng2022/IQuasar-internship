  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess long-term (10 years post-CyPass implantation) status&#xD;
      of the corneal endothelium in subjects who were implanted with the CyPass Micro-Stent in the&#xD;
      COMPASS trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COMPASS Trial (TMI-09-01/NCT01085357) was a prospective, randomized, comparative&#xD;
      multicenter study to assess the safety and effectiveness of the CyPass Micro-Stent in&#xD;
      subjects with primary open angle glaucoma who were undergoing cataract surgery. In the&#xD;
      COMPASS Trial, 374 subjects undergoing cataract surgery were randomized to the CyPass group&#xD;
      and received the CyPass Micro-Stent, whereas 131 subjects underwent cataract surgery alone.&#xD;
      All subjects were to be followed for 2 years postoperatively. Four hundred eighty (480)&#xD;
      subjects completed this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COMPASS XT Trial (TMI-09-01E/GLD122b-C001/NCT02700984) was designed to collect safety&#xD;
      data beyond 24 months postoperatively for subjects who completed the COMPASS Trial. In&#xD;
      COMPASS-XT, clinical data was collected at 36 months, 48 months, and 60 months&#xD;
      postoperatively for a total of 5-year follow-up across the 2 studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, COMPASS XXT, clinical data will be collected annually for the subjects who&#xD;
      were implanted with the CyPass Micro-Stent in the COMPASS TRIAL until the subject reaches 10&#xD;
      years post-CyPass implantation. For some subjects, the first visit will be at or after 10&#xD;
      years post-CyPass implantation, and therefore the first visit may coincide with the Exit&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
