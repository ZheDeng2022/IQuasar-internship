  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep is a fundamental human need with large impact on both psychological and somatic&#xD;
      functioning. However, for patients with mental disorders, sleep is often disturbed. Across&#xD;
      all diagnostic groups, sleep disturbance is one of the most common and disruptive symptoms.&#xD;
      For decades it has been assumed that the sleep disturbance these patients experience was a&#xD;
      secondary symptom of a primary mental disorder, but recently this has changed. Experimental&#xD;
      and clinical data now suggest that there is a reciprocal relationship between sleep&#xD;
      disturbance and mental disorders where they perpetuate and aggravate each other. This makes&#xD;
      sleep disturbance a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of mental disorders.&#xD;
      Evidence emerging the last decade indicate that providing Cognitive Behavior Therapy for&#xD;
      Insomnia (CBT-I) to patients with mental disorders not only improves sleep, but also has&#xD;
      clinically meaningful effects on their primary mental disorder. However, a major problem has&#xD;
      been disseminating CBT-I and few therapists are trained in this intervention. Consequently,&#xD;
      most patients receive sleep medication although evidence clearly indicate that CBT-I is more&#xD;
      effective and should be the treatment of choice. In this study, the investigators will use a&#xD;
      fully automated digital version of CBT-I that might be used to treat a large number of&#xD;
      patients while they are still on the waiting list to receive ordinary outpatient treatment in&#xD;
      secondary mental health care clinics in Norway. The main goal is to test the effectiveness of&#xD;
      digital CBT-I for this patient group.&#xD;

      (27th May 2021) We have revised one of the study exclusion criteria. In the initial protocol&#xD;
      we reported that we would exclude individuals with clinical evidence of sleep apnea, namely,&#xD;
      we stated that: &quot;Sleep apnea screening: An Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score &gt;=13,&#xD;
      indicative of high levels of objective daytime sleepiness associated with organic sleep&#xD;
      disorders and/or positive endorsement of a screening question for sleep apnea (the item asks&#xD;
      if they &quot;usually or everyday snore and stop breathing and have difficulties staying awake&#xD;
      during the day&quot;).&quot; We have now modified the exclusion criterion, so that it is based on the&#xD;
      screening question alone. Our updated exclusion criterion is now stated as follows: &quot;Sleep&#xD;
      apnea screening: A positive endorsement of a screening question for sleep apnea (the item&#xD;
      asks if they &quot;usually or everyday snore and stop breathing and have difficulties staying&#xD;
      awake during the day&quot;).&quot; i.e. the ESS score is no longer part of the assessment for&#xD;
      eligibility for inclusion. The rationale for this change is that several publications and&#xD;
      international experts have questioned the reliability and validity of the ESS cut-off score&#xD;
      (&gt;=13) when the scale is used in psychiatric outpatient populations (psychometrics in&#xD;
      clinical samples are only modest when compared with ESS for screening community-based and/or&#xD;
      non-clinical samples). As such ESS score is no longer used as an exclusion criterion, but we&#xD;
      will continue to collect these data at baseline assessment and will report the ESS scores for&#xD;
      the recruited sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of making the amendment, 29 participants had been excluded on the basis of the&#xD;
      ESS score.&#xD;

    <description>Assessed with the Cognitive Complaints in Bipolar Disorder Rating Assessment (COBRA), a 16-item self-reported instrument of subjective cognitive dysfunctions including executive function, processing speed, working memory, verbal learning and memory, attention/concentration and mental tracking. Items are rated using a 4-point scale. The higher the score, the more subjective complaints. Although the assessment was initially introduced for use with individuals with bipolar disorders, the rating can be used ion other clinical populations</description>

    <description>Assessed with the Negative Effects Questionnaire (NEQ), a self-report measure that contains 20 items that are scored on a five-point Likert-scale (rated 0-4) where higher scores indicate higher levels of negative effects. After each item, the individual is asked whether they consider the effect to be caused by the intervention received or caused by other circumstances (yes/no), as well as one open-ended question</description>

    <description>This will be assessed post intervention with two items. The first will assess if this intervention has impacted motivation for face-to-face treatment for mental disorders, the second will assess if this intervention has impacted motivation for specifically working with sleep interventions at a later time (both scored on a 1 to 9 scale with 1=very unmotivated, 9=very motivated)</description>

    <time_frame>9 weeks after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed with the Use of Sleep Strategies (USS), a six item self-report questionnaire developed to measure how often individuals use six different therapeutic techniques (keep a stable rise time, refrain from sleeping during daytime, use the bed and bedroom only for sleeping, practiced sleep restriction, practiced stimulus control) and their perception of its utility. The techniques are integral to CBT-I but are also described in sleep psychoeducation or hygiene programmes</description>

    <description>dCBT-I during 9 weeks. Multicomponent intervention that includes the following: psychoeducation about sleep, sleep hygiene, sleep restriction therapy, stimulus control and challenging beliefs and perception about sleep. The digital CBT-I that will be utilized in this study is named Sleep Healthy Using The internet (SHUTi). The intervention is fully automated with no contact with health care personnel, it is interactive and adapts to input from the users. It comprises of the same elements included in face-to-face CBT-I, but the user gains access to a new educational, behavioral or cognitive module each week only after completion of digital sleep diaries. dCBT-I can be accessed on computers or hand-held devices</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) &gt; 11 We have used this cut-off score previously to&#xD;
             identify individuals who are likely to be experiencing clinical significant insomnia&#xD;
             and who will potentially benefit from the dCBT-I intervention. Kallestad et al 2018&#xD;
             and a trial from Norway (Filosa et al in press) suggest that this cut-off is the most&#xD;
             sensitive to detect a diagnosis of Insomnia Disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Sleep apnea screening: Positive endorsement of a screening question for sleep apnea&#xD;
             (the item asks if they &quot;usually or everyday snore and stop breathing and have&#xD;
             difficulties staying awake during the day&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Medical history indicative of (i) epilepsy plus self-report of &gt;=1 seizure &lt;12 months&#xD;

             (e.g. having a child aged&lt;12 months residing home).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Currently receiving psychological treatment for insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Not a patient at one of the participating clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Not having completed baseline assessment&#xD;
