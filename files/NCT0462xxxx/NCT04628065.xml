    <textblock>
      Black adolescents who are pregnant represent a high-risk and understudied perinatal&#xD;
      population in health research. Adolescent pregnancy (&lt;20 years) is disproportionately&#xD;
      prevalent among Blacks compared with Whites and is a prominent risk factor for obesity.&#xD;
      Fortunately, metabolic consequences of increasing physical activity coupled with minimal&#xD;
      sedentary time can mitigate biological imperils and behavioral interventions targeting&#xD;
      perinatal populations have demonstrated efficacy for this approach. Intervention studies to&#xD;
      promote physical activity and reduce sedentarism among Black, perinatal adolescents in&#xD;
      disadvantaged, rural settings may be a promising strategy to prevent obesity and reduce&#xD;
      disparities. In the proposed study, investigators will assess the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of #BabyLetsMove, a mobile health intervention targeting three behavioral&#xD;
      goals: (1) limit TV time to less than 2 hours a day (sedentary behavior); (2) take 10,000&#xD;
      steps or more per day (physical activity); and (3) do 20 minutes or more of structured&#xD;
      activity like prenatal yoga or dance videos per day (exercise). In the #BabyLetsMove&#xD;
      feasibility trial investigators aim to conduct a single-arm, 4-week pilot with 20 Black&#xD;
      adolescents (15- to 19-years) enrolled in Mississippi's Supplemental Nutritional Program for&#xD;
      Women, Infants and Children (WIC) to test the intervention's feasibility and acceptability.&#xD;
      Participants will receive one text message per day for 4-weeks targeting behavior change&#xD;
      strategies and two health coaching sessions via mobile phone; an introduction session in week&#xD;
      one and a problem-solving session in week three. Investigators will also use qualitative&#xD;
      interviewing with additional adolescents (n=20) to solicit user feedback regarding the&#xD;
      acceptability of intervention content and materials. Finally, in preparation for a pilot&#xD;
      study using an effectiveness-implementation hybrid study design, investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      pre-implementation evaluation using quantitative surveying (n=6 surveys) with WIC providers&#xD;
      (n=60) to better under the culture and climate of WIC. Investigators hypothesize the&#xD;
      #BabyLetsMove intervention will be acceptable to adolescents and a future pilot randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial will be feasible. Investigators also anticipate identifying modifiable&#xD;
      barriers and facilitators to implementing the intervention through WIC, which will help to&#xD;
      design an implementation strategy with a high likelihood for uptake by WIC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Formative research is needed to establish a foundation for obesity prevention research with&#xD;
      high-risk, disadvantaged, perinatal adolescents and their offspring. In particular, Black&#xD;
      pregnant adolescents in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities represent a high-risk and&#xD;
      understudied perinatal population in health research. Adolescent pregnancy (&lt;20 years) is&#xD;
      disproportionately prevalent among Blacks compared with Whites (27.6 and 13.4 per 1,000,&#xD;
      respectively) and is a prominent risk factor for obesity. Normal pubertal growth is&#xD;
      associated with increased weight in adolescence and Black female and rural adolescents are at&#xD;
      highest risk for excessive adiposity. Pregnancy exacerbates preexisting risks and predicates&#xD;
      a trajectory of maternal and child obesity. Fortunately, metabolic consequences of increasing&#xD;
      physical activity coupled with minimal sedentary behavior can mitigate biological imperils&#xD;
      and behavioral interventions targeting perinatal populations have demonstrated efficacy for&#xD;
      this approach. Intervention studies to promote physical activity and reduce sedentary&#xD;
      behavior among Black, perinatal adolescents in disadvantaged, rural settings may be a&#xD;
      promising strategy to prevent obesity and reduce disparities. To this end, investigators&#xD;
      conducted formative work in the Teen Mom Study, an exploratory investigation to identify&#xD;
      modifiable psychosocial, cultural and environmental determinants of physical activity among&#xD;
      pregnant and postpartum adolescents enrolled in Mississippi's Supplemental Nutritional&#xD;
      Program for Women Infants and Children (WIC) in the Mississippi Delta. WIC is a&#xD;
      federally-funded, state-run public health service providing healthy food and nutrition&#xD;
      counseling to low-income women, infants and children at nutritional risk. Public health&#xD;
      services like WIC are ideal settings for the prevention and treatment of obesity among&#xD;
      high-risk, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. The Mississippi Delta is a culturally&#xD;
      and geographically distinct 18-county rural region of Mississippi that is plagued by decades&#xD;
      of persistent poverty, poor health and the highest teen birth rate, which has not declined&#xD;
      since 2006, in the United States. Using data from the Teen Mom Study, investigators adapted&#xD;
      an existing mobile health (mHealth) intervention to achieve three behavioral goals: (1) limit&#xD;
      TV time to less than 2 hours a day (sedentary behavior); (2) take 10,000 steps or more per&#xD;
      day (physical activity; tracked using a FitBit provided to each study participant); and (3)&#xD;
      do 20 minutes or more of structured activity like prenatal yoga or dance videos per day&#xD;
      (exercise). In the #BabyLetsMove feasibility trial investigators aim to conduct a single-arm,&#xD;
      4-week pilot with 20 overweight or obese, Black, pregnant (&lt;16 weeks) adolescent (15 - 19&#xD;
      years) WIC clients to test the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention.&#xD;
      Participants will receive text messages aligned with theoretical behavior change strategies&#xD;
      every day of the week for 4-weeks including: 1) four skills texts, which may be a simple text&#xD;
      or a text with a link to either a PDF or video; 2) two goal monitoring text messages, which&#xD;
      will check-in on the three behavior change goals; and 3) and one text message for&#xD;
      participants to report their weight using a BodyTrace scale provided by the study. Text&#xD;
      messages will be supplemented with two health coaching telephone calls conducted by the&#xD;
      principal investigator; an introduction session in the first week, followed by a&#xD;
      problem-solving session in week three. While the study goal is to assess feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability, physical activity assessed using accelerometry, subjective psychosocial&#xD;
      constructs, and anthropometric and biomarker measures will be measured at pre- (week 1) and&#xD;
      post- (week 6) intervention. To gain additional insight, investigators will use qualitative&#xD;
      interviewing with additional adolescents (n=20) to solicit user feedback regarding the&#xD;
      acceptability of intervention content (text messages) and materials (PDFs and videos).&#xD;
      Finally, in preparation for a randomized pilot trial using an effectiveness-implementation&#xD;
      hybrid research design, investigators will conduct a pre-implementation evaluation using&#xD;
      quantitative surveying (n=6 surveys) with WIC providers (n=60) to better under the context,&#xD;
      culture and climate of WIC (implementation measures identified in the Consolidated Framework&#xD;
      for Implementation Research). Investigators hypothesize the #BabyLetsMove intervention&#xD;
      materials will be acceptable to adolescents and that conducting a future pilot randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial will be feasible. Investigators also anticipate identifying modifiable&#xD;
      barriers and facilitators to implementing the intervention through WIC, which will help to&#xD;
      design an implementation strategy with a high likelihood for uptake by WIC. If proven to be&#xD;
      effective, #BabyLetsMove mHealth intervention may be a scalable approach to increase physical&#xD;
      activity among socioeconomically disadvantaged adolescents at high risk for maternal and&#xD;
      child obesity.&#xD;
