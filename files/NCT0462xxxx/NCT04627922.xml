  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco and cannabis co-use is a common and growing public health problem, especially in&#xD;
      states that have legalized cannabis. There are no pharmacologic treatments for co-occurring&#xD;
      tobacco and cannabis use. Co-use may make quitting either substance more difficult, given the&#xD;
      synergistic effects of cannabis and nicotine on neurobiological systems that mediate reward&#xD;
      and shared cues reinforcing co-use. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an FDA-approved medication and&#xD;
      over-the-counter supplement, has shown promise in animal studies and randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials (RCTs) in reducing tobacco and cannabis craving and use.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an FDA-approved medication and over-the-counter supplement, has shown&#xD;
      promise in animal studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in reducing tobacco and&#xD;
      cannabis craving and use. NAC's efficacy in treating addiction may be attributable to its&#xD;
      central nervous system effects in reducing excessive glutamatergic activity, oxidative&#xD;
      stress, and inflammation. NAC has been shown to improve cognition and reduce impulsivity,&#xD;
      which in turn may strengthen inhibitory control when presented with contextual cues. To date,&#xD;
      no RCT has examined NAC for smoking cessation in the setting of tobacco-cannabis co-use. In a&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT, the investigators will examine a novel pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment, NAC, for concurrent tobacco use disorder (TUD) and cannabis use disorder (CUD) in&#xD;
      dual users of tobacco and cannabis. Sixty adult daily cigarette smokers who 1) use cannabis&#xD;
      regularly and 2) consent to receive interventions to stop smoking cigarettes and using&#xD;
      cannabis will be randomized to receive NAC 3600 mg per day or placebo over 8 weeks.&#xD;
      Participants in both groups will receive 8 weekly cognitive behavioral therapy sessions&#xD;
      addressing both tobacco and cannabis use. Outcomes will be assessed at Weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12.&#xD;
      Primary aims are to determine NAC's efficacy in decreasing cigarette use, nicotine dependence&#xD;
      levels, and craving; and cannabis use, CUD severity levels, and craving. Exploratory aims&#xD;
      include examination of changes in neurocognition with NAC and their potential mediational&#xD;
      effects on cigarette and cannabis use outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NAC SUB-STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the significant clinical and economic burden imposed by tobacco and cannabis use,&#xD;
      it is important to understand the mechanism underlying the progression of tobacco (TUD) and&#xD;
      cannabis use disorders (CUD) and any potential treatments. TUD and CUD are associated with&#xD;
      elevated oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. It has been suggested that patients&#xD;
      dependent on these substances have dysregulated markers of oxidation and inflammation,&#xD;
      including gluthathione, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-Reactive protein (CRP),&#xD;
      Interleukin-6 (IL-6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this sub-study, baseline levels of commonly utilized serum markers of oxidation status and&#xD;
      inflammation will be measured in 20 adults recruited under the main study, with the option of&#xD;
      being a part of the sub-study who also demonstrate concurrent TUD and CUD. The correlation&#xD;
      will be determined between changes in serum markers of oxidative stress and magnitude of use&#xD;
      of cigarettes and cannabis. If successful, the investigator will establish regulatory&#xD;
      patterns of oxidative stress and inflammation in co-occurring TUD and CUD for the first time,&#xD;
      and will implicate oxidative stress and inflammation as playing key roles in the progression&#xD;
      and severity of co-occurring TUD and CUD.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in Score on the Contemplation Ladder</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Contemplation Ladder is a visual analog comprised of 11 rungs and 5 anchor statements, representing stages of change. The response options (0) to (3) corresponded with the stage of precontemplation, (4) to (6) represented the stage of contemplation, (7) and (8) referred to the stage of preparation, (9) and (10) represented the stage of action and stage of maintenance respectively. It is a brief measure of motivation or readiness to change, where (0) is the least motivated and (10) is the most motivated. This measure has been validated for cigarette and other substance use. This measure will be administered twice at each time point both before and after an activity to assess motivation to stop 1) cigarettes and 2) cannabis.</description>

    <measure>Change in Scores on the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence is a standard instrument for assessing the intensity of physical addiction to nicotine. It contains six items that evaluate the quantity of cigarette consumption, the compulsion to use, and dependence. In scoring the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence, yes/no items are scored from 0 to 1 and multiple-choice items are scored from 0 to 3. The items are summed to yield a total score of 0-10. The higher the total Fagerström score, the more intense is the patient's physical dependence on nicotine.</description>

    <measure>Change in Scores on the Minnesota Tobacco Withdrawal Scale-Revised (MTWS-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MTWS-R features two separate measures for examining the severity of nicotine withdrawal symptoms in a participant: a self-report scale and an observer scale. The observer scale asks the scale-taker to rate the severity of four symptoms in someone the they know who is experiencing nicotine withdrawal: &quot;angry/irritable/frustrated,&quot; &quot;anxious/tense,&quot; &quot;depressed,&quot; and &quot;restless/impatient.&quot; The self-report version asks for rankings of the severity of those same four symptoms, plus eleven others that cannot be observed by outsiders (including such things as &quot;desire or craving to smoke,&quot; &quot;insomnia, sleep problems, awakening at night,&quot; or &quot;dizziness). Both scales use a Likert-type scale for the severity ratings, ranging from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;severe&quot;). These scores are tallied to calculate an a total withdrawal discomfort score.</description>

    <measure>Change in Scores on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a 21-item, self-report rating inventory that measures characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression. Each question had a set of at least four possible responses When the test is scored, a value of 0 to 3 is assigned for each answer and then the total score is compared to a key to determine the depression's severity. The standard cut-off scores were as follows: 0-9 minimal depression, 10-18 indicates mild depression, 19-29 indicates moderate depression, 30-63 indicates severe depression. Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms.</description>

Respondents answer each item on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Items 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10 make up the Cognitive Reappraisal facet.&#xD;
Items 2, 4, 6, 9 make up the Expressive Suppression facet and scores can be summed to create a total score. Higher scores indicate a greater ability for participants to regulate their emotions.</description>

    <measure>Change in Scores on the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MAAS is a 15-item scale measuring dispositional mindfulness by asking respondents' to indicate how frequently they experience mindlessness (i.e., &quot;I run through activities without being really attentive to them&quot;) on a 6-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (almost always) to 6 (almost never). To score the MAAS, a mean of the 15 items is calculated. Higher scores reflect higher levels of dispositional mindfulness. With these higher scores also come lower reported negative emotional states.</description>
