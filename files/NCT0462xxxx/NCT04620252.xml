  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The anticaries effect of fluoride is through the increase in fluoride presence and retention&#xD;
      in the oral fluids, reducing dental demineralization and enhancing remineralization. Previous&#xD;
      studies showed that a preapplication of calcium (in a rinse) prior to administration of&#xD;
      fluoride greatly enhances fluoride concentration in the mouth and the anticaries effect of&#xD;
      fluoride. The hypothesis of this study is that the same can be achieved by chewing a calcium&#xD;
      supplement prior to a fluoride rinse. The first goal is to determine if chewing these calcium&#xD;
      supplements will increase calcium concentration in the oral fluids above baseline levels.&#xD;
      Secondly, the calcium supplement with the highest calcium release will be tested before a&#xD;
      fluoride rinse to assess the increased retention of fluoride in the oral fluids when compared&#xD;
      with the fluoride rinse alone. In both parts, healthy volunteers will participate and saliva&#xD;
      will be collected to assess calcium and fluoride concentration.&#xD;
