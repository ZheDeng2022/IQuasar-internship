  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rehabilitation after primary knee or hip arthroplasty may include performing exercises with a&#xD;
      physiotherapist. For patients who can work well with a computer, tablet or smartphone, it is&#xD;
      now possible to use a mobile application (e.g. moveUp) to carry out a large part of the&#xD;
      exercises more independently. This is done with online guidance by a physiotherapist via a&#xD;
      mobile application that is CE marked in Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate whether the effect of the mobile application on knee or hip&#xD;
      rehabilitation and quality of life is equal to that of standard care (i.e. without the use of&#xD;
      a mobile application).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Via the moveUP Coach App, patients receive personalized rehabilitation for knee or hip&#xD;
      replacement, both before and after surgery. This mobile application is on the market, meets&#xD;
      the legal requirements in Europe and has been provisionally remunerated under an agreement&#xD;
      (convention) between the mandatory health insurance (NIHDI) and the hospital that participate&#xD;
      in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized to one of the three treatment options of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The &quot;usual care group&quot; will not be informed in detail about the mobile application and&#xD;
           will receive usual rehabilitation care for knee- or hip replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The group &quot;possibility to use the mobile application with a predefined number of&#xD;
           physiotherapy sessions&quot; will receive all necessary information on the mobile application&#xD;
           and can still decide whether or not to receive rehabilitation with online guidance by a&#xD;
           physiotherapist via the mobile application. A predefined number of traditional&#xD;
           physiotherapy sessions is combined with the use of the mobile app in this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The group &quot;possibility to use the mobile application without a predetermined number of&#xD;
           physiotherapy sessions&quot; will receive all necessary information on the mobile application&#xD;
           and can still decide whether or not to receive rehabilitation with online guidance by a&#xD;
           physiotherapist via the mobile application. No predefined number of traditional&#xD;
           physiotherapy sessions are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be asked to complete 2 questionnaires (KOOS-JR/HOOS-JR and EQ5D-5L) at&#xD;
      baseline, 6 weeks and 6 months after arthroplasty. These patient reported outcomes will give&#xD;
      an indication on the rehabilitation outcome and quality of life compared in the 3 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, a health economic evaluation is foreseen by the Federal Knowledge&#xD;
      Center for Healthcare (KCE). In this way the results can be helpful in getting a more&#xD;
      definitive refund for the mobile application in Belgium.&#xD;

             arthroplasty (TKA) or a total hip arthroplasty (THA).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The patient is not planned to have a peri-operative procedure (e.g. intra-articular&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. In the 6 months after arthroplasty the patient is not planned to have surgery that may&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. The patient is not suffering from a medical condition (e.g. Parkinson, multiple&#xD;
             sclerosis, cerebrovascular accident) that is expected to significantly impact the&#xD;
             rehabilitation or that constitutes a contra-indication for the use of the mobile&#xD;
             application.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The patient confirms to have easy and daily access to the internet, a mobile phone, a&#xD;
             personal email address and a computer, tablet or smartphone, until 8 months after&#xD;
             randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The patient does not upfront exclude the possibility whereby part of the&#xD;
             rehabilitation is performed without a physical therapist physically being present.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The patient is willing to complete online the patient reported outcomes and is aware&#xD;
             that if he/she fails in this computer literacy test (performed before randomization)&#xD;
             he/she will not be randomized and hence not included in the study. He/she will receive&#xD;
             usual rehabilitation care.&#xD;
