  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1a/b, first-in-human, multiple dose-escalation, randomized, double-blinded,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study is evaluating SYNB8802 in healthy volunteers (HV) and subjects&#xD;
      diagnosed with enteric hyperoxaluria (EH). Eligible subjects receive investigational product&#xD;
      (IP) and undergo safety monitoring, evaluations, and subsequent follow-up after IP&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2, all evaluations and assessments throughout this study may be conducted either at&#xD;
      the clinical site or by a home healthcare professional at an alternative location (e.g., EH&#xD;
      patient's home, hotel).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is evaluating the safety, tolerability, kinetics, and pharmacodynamics of SYNB8802&#xD;
      within the following 2 study parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 is an inpatient, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose (MAD) study in HV male&#xD;
      and female subjects in up to 5 dose cohorts (6 treated: 3 placebo) for 5 days of dosing to&#xD;
      identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 is a placebo-controlled crossover study in up to 20 adult male and female subjects&#xD;
      with EH secondary to Roux-en-Y bariatric surgery. Subjects will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      either SYNB8802 (at or below the MTD from Part 1) or placebo for six days before crossing&#xD;
      over to receive either placebo or SYNB8802 for another six days, respectively. This part of&#xD;
      the study has been designed with the flexibility of being able to be conducted either at the&#xD;
      clinical site or by a home healthcare professional at an alternative location (e.g.,&#xD;
      patient's home, hotel).&#xD;

    <description>Toxicity is graded in accordance with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0. Adverse events (AEs) are reported based on clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examinations, electrocardiograms, and any other medically indicated assessments from the time informed consent is signed through the end of the safety follow-up period.&#xD;
AEs are considered to be treatment emergent (TEAE) if they occur or worsen in severity after the first dose of study treatment. TEAEs are considered treatment-related if relationship to study drug is possibly related, probably related, or definitely related.</description>
