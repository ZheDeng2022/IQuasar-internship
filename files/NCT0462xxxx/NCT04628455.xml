      Two Millimetres needlescopic instruments induce minimal damage to the abdominal wall and have&#xD;
      excellent cosmetic results. However, these instruments are fragile and expensive with short&#xD;
      weak jaws. The aim of this study is to present a novel needlescopic approach using 1.6-mm&#xD;
      Suture Grasper Device [SGD], modified polypectomy snare and a home-made Snare (HMS) for the&#xD;
      treatment of congenital inguinal hernias [CIH] in girls. Over a period of one year from March&#xD;
      2018 to March 2019 a prospective study was conducted in three tertiary centres on 53 girls&#xD;
      presented with CIH. Preoperative inguinoscrotal U/S was done for all patients to confirm the&#xD;
      diagnosis and to measure the diameter of internal inguinal ring [IIR]. All patients were&#xD;
      repaired using needlescopic inversion and snaring of the hernia sac using 2-SGDs and a snare.&#xD;
      Follow up period ranged from 12 to 24 (Median 16.5) months. Fifty-three girls with 74 hernias&#xD;
      were included in this study. Their mean age was 37.8 months. Internal inguinal ring diameter&#xD;
      (IIR) ranged between 8-15 mm with a mean of 11.8±2.8mm. Mean operative time was 15.5 minutes&#xD;
      in bilateral and 11.4 minutes in unilateral cases. Mean operative time for inversion,&#xD;
      snaring, and sac extraction was 4.2±1.3 minutes. All cases were completed successfully&#xD;
      without conversion and without complications. Follow up period ranged from 12 to 24 (Median&#xD;
      16.5) months with non-visible scar and no recurrence among the studied patients. Needlescopic&#xD;
      inversion and snaring of inguinal hernia using 1.6mm instruments is a safe, rapid and&#xD;
      feasible method for CIH repair in girls with invisible scar and no short-term recurrence.&#xD;

      Operative details: Patient lies in supine position at upper part of OR table towards right&#xD;
      edge. Operating table is tilted to opposite side of hernia with 30-degree Trendelenburg&#xD;
      position. Operator stands on patient's right side during either uni-or bi-lateral hernia.&#xD;
      Camera man stands at table head and monitor facing patient's feet. Vertical trans umbilical&#xD;
      5-mm incision [Point A] was made and 5-mm trocar passed under vision using open technique.&#xD;
      Pneumoperitoneum is then established with CO2 flow of 1.5-2.5 L/min keeping intraabdominal&#xD;
      pressure between 8-12 mmHg according to patients' age and weight. Early in our experience, a&#xD;
      two-mm incision is done at a point located midway between umbilicus and symphysis pubis&#xD;
      [point B] for 2-mm port passed under direct vision and a tiny 11-blade scalpel puncture was&#xD;
      done at the corresponding Mac-Burney's [Point C] for SGD. Abdomen was then explored to&#xD;
      confirm the diagnosis and detect contralateral or other hernias if present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One SGD was introduced through point B (SGD-B) and another one through point C (SGD-C). Both&#xD;
      SGDs were used to invert the hernia sac by gradual sustained alternating traction on the&#xD;
      round ligament. Each SGD hands to the other one till complete inversion occurs, this is known&#xD;
      by the hernial sac hanging from internal ring without retracting-back inside the inguinal&#xD;
      canal. Occasionally, investigators had to fix the sac to the anterior abdominal wall by a&#xD;
      suture [Prolne 2/0 on a half circle 20-mm needle] placed percutaneously lateral to the&#xD;
      corresponding Mac-Berney's point to prevent its retraction. Then, the MPS was introduced via&#xD;
      the trocar at point B and opened inside the abdomen and SGD-C passed inside the loop of MPS&#xD;
      and re-catches the hernial sac, which is then twisted around its neck several times. MPS was&#xD;
      closed tightly at the proper neck and coagulation diathermy current is applied to it leading&#xD;
      to separation of the hernia sac. Detached sac (grasped by SGD-C) was then pushed antegradely&#xD;
      out through the umbilical port. In some cases, the Fallopian's tube was closely related to&#xD;
      the round ligament and investigators had to divide the round ligament with the long&#xD;
      microdiathermy needle introduced directly via point B before hernia sac snaring to avoid its&#xD;
      injury during the application of MPS. Deflation of the abdomen is done, and umbilical fascial&#xD;
      incision is closed using 2/0 or 3/0 Polygalctin suture and umbilical skin layers were closed&#xD;
      using 4/0 Polygalctin suture. Later in the study, we were able to innovate a HMS by using the&#xD;
      guide wire of central venous catheter looped through VAC and connected to a regular diathermy&#xD;
      probe and investigators modified our technique. An11-blade scalpel puncture is done at&#xD;
      point-B through which VAC is introduced directly instead of 2-mm trocar. This VAC is used for&#xD;
      the insertion of HMS and SGD-B. Then, complete inversion of the sac was done using 2 SGDs as&#xD;
      previously described. Followed by introduction of HMS through #14-G VAC at point-B and the&#xD;
      procedure completed as before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients received antibiotics and analgesics according to hospital protocols. Oral fluids&#xD;
      started 2 hours post operatively and diet was advanced gradually as tolerated. Patients were&#xD;
      discharged the same post-operative day. Follow up period ranged from 12 to 24 (Median 16.5)&#xD;
      months. with for recurrence and cosmetic results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last 2 decades, pediatric inguinal hernia repair witnessed a huge evolution with&#xD;
      laparoscopic approaches attracting more and more pediatric surgeons and laparoscopic hernia&#xD;
      repair became well-established and popular technique with comparable recurrence rates and&#xD;
      operative time. Moreover, laparoscopy allows diagnosis of contralateral and other coexisting&#xD;
      hernia with a chance for simultaneous repair. Early in the laparoscopic era, its drawbacks&#xD;
      were long learning curve, need for smaller instruments for younger kids, higher recurrence&#xD;
      rates, and to somewhat smaller but visible scars compared to conventional open hernia repair.&#xD;
      With time, regular use of laparoscopy, fine instruments, introduction of newer concepts and&#xD;
      techniques for tailoring which laparoscopic technique fits for each patient the results came&#xD;
      to be similar or even better than that of conventional repair. Laparoscopy for female&#xD;
      inguinal hernia repair was first introduced in 1997 by El Gohary. He described hernial sac&#xD;
      inversion and ligation in girls using 5-mm instruments and endo loop with excellent results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the evolution of laparoscopic repair of hernia, results improved very much by cautery&#xD;
      of the IIR enhancing peritoneal fibrosis hence reducing recurrence rates compared to simple&#xD;
      peritoneal closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Snaring is routinely used for colonic polypectomy with excision of polyps at its proper neck&#xD;
      using coagulation current without colonic wall perforation. In this study it is proposed that&#xD;
      inversion and snaring of the hernia sac results in a herniotomy with narrow raw area at its&#xD;
      neck of the hernia sac combining the benefits of both peritoneal disconnection and thermal&#xD;
      injury to prevent recurrence. Recently there is a report of early results of inversion, and&#xD;
      snaring of hernial sac using 3-mm instruments and commercial polypectomy snare in girls with&#xD;
      encouraging results and no recurrence. On application of monopolar diathermy current to the&#xD;
      snare itself, the hernial sac will shrink with almost closure of internal ring. No recurrence&#xD;
      was reported with no perioperative complications except for lymphocele developed at the level&#xD;
      of labium major 2 weeks postoperatively that completely resolved after 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Commercially available polypectomy snare length is 230-cm which imposed discomfort and&#xD;
      difficulty using it for hernial sac snaring. So, investigators opted to shorten it from&#xD;
      230-cm to 50 cm to facilitate its usage. The biomedical engineering department was contacted&#xD;
      and succeeded to shorten it to the required length. In this study, in the first 2 months&#xD;
      investigator used this modified snare successfully but it is still not fully satisfied as it&#xD;
      adds extra cost [needs 2-mm trocar for insertion], needs technical assistance for shortening&#xD;
      and re-sterilization. Investigator came into another innovation by developing a home-made&#xD;
      snare (HMS) made of central venous catheter guide wire looped through VAC and connected to a&#xD;
      regular diathermy probe. Each wire can be cut to make 2-3 snares. It is shorter, easy to use,&#xD;
      cheaper and avoided the use of expensive trocar 2-mm. This HMS was then applied for all&#xD;
      upcoming cases after that. It is well known that, one of the most annoying factors lead to&#xD;
      delayed acceptance of laparoscopic repair for CIH among pediatric surgeons is visible scars&#xD;
      even though they are smaller compared to the hidden skin crease scar of the open repair which&#xD;
      ultimately resulted in development of needlescopic repair. Chock et al. reported that despite&#xD;
      good cosmetic results, 2-mm instruments are expensive, delicate, flexible, and with short and&#xD;
      weak jaws limiting their use on a wide scale. Others reported that needlescopic instruments&#xD;
      can be used only by expert surgeons as it can be bended easily and its small jaws limit the&#xD;
      power of grasping the tissue with unsuitability for ideal retraction and tissue handling. In&#xD;
      contrary, SGD used for port closure is only 1.6 mm in diameter with adequate length, strong&#xD;
      shaft, ergonomic handle, cheap, wide jaw and offers a very good tissue grip. According to the&#xD;
      results of this study, needlescopic inversion, snaring and complete excision of the hernia is&#xD;
      a progress of minilaparoscopic surgery where two MSDs [1.6-mm diameter] were used instead of&#xD;
      2-3-mm instruments for the treatment of CIH in girls. It avoids the disadvantages of 2-mm&#xD;
      instruments.&#xD;
