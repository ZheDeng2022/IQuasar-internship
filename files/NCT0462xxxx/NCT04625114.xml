  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a pilot trial where they will study safety, efficacy and&#xD;
      compliance in a cohort of ambulatory patients in the Ghent region with confirmed COVID-19&#xD;
      infection, in both an early stage of disease, defined as less than 5 days of symptoms and who&#xD;
      at presentation do not meet any criteria for hospitalisation as well as asymptomatic&#xD;
      individuals with a PCR CT value below 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is to assess the efficacy of the drug in terms of change from day 0 to&#xD;
      day 5 in respiratory (oropharyngeal swab RT-PCR) log10 viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess whether Camostat, a serine protease inhibitor available in&#xD;
      an oral formulation has the potential to be studied as an antiviral drug in a large scale&#xD;
      ambulatory setting to prevent transmission by decreasing viral load, to prevent symptoms&#xD;
      after exposure (PEP) in asymptomatic individuals or to prevent disease progression in the&#xD;
      occurrence of early symptomatology.&#xD;

      Core study After eligibility assessment participants will be randomized and will receive the&#xD;
      study drugs. We will define D1 as the first dose of the medication which can be the morning,&#xD;
      midday or evening dose. They will be treated for 5 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with a positive PCR at D5 (CT value with threshold below 30) and/or presence of&#xD;
      clinical symptoms after exclusion of hospitalization criteria (flowchart emergency department&#xD;
      appendix 4), the treatment will be extended up to D10 at the same dosage in both treatment&#xD;
      arms for 5 consecutive days: D6 and D10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  D1-&gt;D14 (D28): The study participants will be asked to fill in daily questionnaires&#xD;
           assessing symptoms (cfr daily self-score). They will receive a kit enabling to monitor&#xD;
           heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), temperature and oxygen saturation 3 times per&#xD;
           day (every 4-8 hours, preferentially at the timing of medication intake at D1 to D5 or&#xD;
           D10).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compliance and tolerance will be assessed during the treatment period, D0-&gt;D5 (or&#xD;
           D0-&gt;D10 if the treatment is prolonged).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the study D1-D28: If indicated in the opinion of the investigator, a physical&#xD;
           exam and biochemistry will be performed through a consultation at the clinic. This can&#xD;
           be requested at any time during the study based on clinical symptoms or signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consultation at D0, D5, (D10) and D28 at our COVID consultation facility. This will be&#xD;
           done by a study nurse and/or a study physician.&#xD;

          -  Willing to take the parameters such as blood oxygenation and temperature&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to attend follow-up visits both by phone as at the clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of understanding the commitment in the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signs and symptoms suggestive of COVID disease in absence of hospitalization criteria&#xD;
             as defined by the flowchart used at the emergency department of our institution&#xD;
             (appendix 4), present for maximum 5 days and confirmed by PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  OR documented COVID-19 infection by PCR with CT value below the threshold of 30 in&#xD;
             asymptomatic individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For women of childbearing potential*: they should be willing to use highly effective&#xD;
             method of contraception during treatment and until the end of study defined as having&#xD;
             a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Such methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  associated with inhibition of ovulation: oral, intravaginal or transdermal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: oral,&#xD;
             injectable or implantable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  intrauterine device (IUD) and intrauterine hormone-releasing system ( IUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  bilateral tubal occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  vasectomised partner&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  sexual abstinence&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For men of reproductive potential**: condom should be used as contraception&#xD;
                  during treatment and until the end of study when having a partner of childbearing&#xD;
                  potential&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  a woman is considered of childbearing potential (WOCBP), i.e. fertile,&#xD;
                       following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless permanently&#xD;
                       sterile. Permanent sterilisation methods include hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
                       salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is defined&#xD;
                       as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high&#xD;
                       follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be&#xD;
                       used to confirm a post-menopausal state in women not using hormonal&#xD;
                       contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However in the absence of 12&#xD;
                       months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  a man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently sterile by&#xD;
                            bilateral orchidectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;

             department flowchart (cfr appendix 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  With regard to exclusion of women of child-bearing potential, women who tell us they&#xD;
             know they are pregnant are excluded. All women of child-bearing potential who test&#xD;
             positive for pregnancy by urine test at first visit are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe chronic pancreatitis requiring suction of gastric juice, fasting or abstention&#xD;
             from drinking&#xD;
