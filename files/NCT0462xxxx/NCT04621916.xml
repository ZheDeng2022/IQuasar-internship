    <textblock>
      This study will enroll children who have hemophilia A with inhibitors who successfully&#xD;
      completed immune tolerance induction per the ISTH criteria (negative inhibitor titer,&#xD;
      recovery &gt;66% of expected, and half-life of &gt;6 hours with their current FVIII concentrate).&#xD;
      Previous to emicizumab, there was only one option for these patients which was to continue&#xD;
      FVIII therapy in a prophylaxis mode to prevent bleeding. There was a sense that the ongoing&#xD;
      FVIII served to maintain tolerance however no evidence for this notion exists and in fact&#xD;
      what limited data is available suggests that continuing FVIII may not be necessary simply to&#xD;
      maintain tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To figure out this question, this will be a randomized, controlled 2 arm study which will&#xD;
      randomize patients post-successful ITI to emicizumab plus weekly FVIII (for maintenance of&#xD;
      tolerance) versus emicizumab alone. Patients will be followed for up to 2 years. We aim to&#xD;
      enroll 52 subjects. The FVIII weekly arm can use any factor VIII concentrate and emicizumab&#xD;
      is standard of care for inhibitor and non-inhibitor patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background &amp; rationale: Hemophilia A is a serious life-long genetic bleeding disorder&#xD;
      resulting from a mutation in the Factor VIII (FVIII) gene leading to abnormally low levels of&#xD;
      FVIII. Treatment consists of replacing the missing FVIII with FVIII clotting factor&#xD;
      concentrates (CFC). While FVIII CFC are very effective at preventing joint bleeding, they are&#xD;
      immunogenic such that ~30% of patients develop anti-drug antibodies which neutralize the&#xD;
      effect of the medications and are thus called inhibitors. Patients with inhibitors have worse&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality as a result of increased and more difficult to treat bleeding&#xD;
      episodes. Therefore, the major goal of therapy for patients who develop these antibodies is&#xD;
      eradication of the inhibitor. The only approach that has been shown to be effective is called&#xD;
      immune tolerance induction (ITI), and as its name implies, the purpose is to induce the&#xD;
      patient's immune system to no longer make the inhibitors. Immune tolerance induction involves&#xD;
      administering FVIII CFC on a regular and often intensive (daily) schedule for many months if&#xD;
      not years. It can be effective, however, with successful ITI ranging from 40-90% in numerous&#xD;
      previous studies. there exists a sizable minority of patients (~20-25% of all hemophilia A&#xD;
      patients) who are ITI successes. For these patients, ongoing FVIII therapy has been the&#xD;
      standard of treatment although once tolerization has been achieved, the treatment modality&#xD;
      reverts to prophylaxis, however the continued regular exposure to prophylaxis is felt to also&#xD;
      serve the purpose of maintaining tolerance.there is little to no data on whether ongoing&#xD;
      FVIII exposure is required to maintain tolerance, and it is entirely possible that patients&#xD;
      can discontinue routine factor therapy and not have a recurrence of their inhibitor. Only one&#xD;
      study has even addressed this issue, and it found that inhibitor recurrence rates were the&#xD;
      same among a group of tolerized patients who were subsequently adherent to a prophylaxis&#xD;
      regimen and another group who were not adherent and therefore not receiving regular FVIII&#xD;
      exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While historically, this was a moot issue since the only appropriate therapy for severe&#xD;
      hemophilia patients following successful ITI was to be prescribed FVIII prophylaxis, the&#xD;
      recent licensure of a new medication has now made this question and knowledge gap very&#xD;
      important. Emicizumab (Hemlibra, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) is a novel, bispecific,&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody which can substitute for the function of activated FVIII by bringing&#xD;
      activated factor IX and factor X into proper alignment and induce the formation of activated&#xD;
      factor X.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the high degree of efficacy of emicizumab for bleed prevention in inhibitor patients,&#xD;
      the hemophilia community has still largely taken the stance that inhibitor eradication is a&#xD;
      vital goal for any child who develops an inhibitor. The issue that the advent of emicizumab&#xD;
      has raised, however, is what to do following successful ITI. As stated, traditionally,&#xD;
      patients would continue FVIII therapy in the form of prophylaxis and the question of loss of&#xD;
      tolerance and inhibitor recurrence was moot, however given the advantages of emicizumab, it&#xD;
      is likely that many patients/parents will not accept continuing with the need for repeated&#xD;
      intravenous infusions (and central venous catheters in many children) when an alternative&#xD;
      agent with excellent efficacy and a much lower treatment burden exists. Thus, objective of&#xD;
      this study is to determine whether ongoing factor VIII therapy is required for maintenance of&#xD;
      tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: patients who have undergone successful ITI and are currently on emicizumab&#xD;
      or willing to be on emicizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study methodology: This will be a prospective, randomized trial of weekly FVIII CFC therapy&#xD;
      versus no routine FVIII therapy for patients who have undergone successful ITI and are&#xD;
      currently on emicizumab or willing to be on emicizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of study arms: Group 1 will receive ongoing once per weekly factor VIII therapy&#xD;
      along with emicizumab after completion of a successful ITI. Group 2 will discontinue FVIII&#xD;
      therapy and are on emicizumab for prophylaxis after completion of a successful ITI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study endpoints: Study endpoints are to find out the number of subjects that maintained&#xD;
      immune tolerance with/without FVIII exposure, understand the need for FVIII exposure for&#xD;
      maintaining immune tolerance and to estimate the treatment burden and the cost effectivity&#xD;
      for ongoing FVIII exposure after a successful ITI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: Patients will be seen every month for inhibitor recurrence until 4th month of the&#xD;
      study, and every two months until the first year of the study, at 18th month and at the end&#xD;
      of the study. If there is a bleeding episode or an inhibitor, then there will be an&#xD;
      unscheduled visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics: Patients will be categorized as either having a recurrence of an inhibitor or&#xD;
      not. Thus, a 2x2 Chi-square contingency table will be able to group the subjects into those&#xD;
      who received ongoing factor VIII and those who did not and those who did versus those who did&#xD;
      not have an inhibitor recurrence. Fisher's exact test will be used to calculate the&#xD;
      difference in proportion between the groups (inhibitor-positive and inhibitor-negative).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plans for analysis: Our goal is to complete the project including a submission for an&#xD;
      abstract and publication within 24 months from the start of patient accrual.&#xD;
