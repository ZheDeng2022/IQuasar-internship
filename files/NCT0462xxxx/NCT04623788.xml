    <textblock>
      Manganese is a calcium analogue which actively enters viable cells with intact&#xD;
      calcium-handling mechanisms and its uptake is evident by an increase in MRI-detectable T1&#xD;
      relaxivity of tissues. Mangafodipir is a novel manganese-based magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) contrast medium with unique biophysical properties that are ideal for application to&#xD;
      cardiac imaging. Recent studies in man have demonstrated the utility of manganese-enhanced&#xD;
      MRI (MEMRI) in assessing infarct size more accurately than with standard cardiac MRI&#xD;
      protocols using gadolinium enhancement and have shown reduced myocardial manganese uptake in&#xD;
      patients with cardiomyopathies suggesting abnormal calcium handling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding the potential for myocardial recovery is key in guiding revascularisation&#xD;
      therapies in ischaemic cardiomyopathy, in addition to novel therapies used in heart failure.&#xD;
      Being able to monitor calcium handling and therefore myocardial function in different types&#xD;
      of cardiomyopathies has the potential to guide management in these patients. The&#xD;
      investigators here propose an investigational observational study of MEMRI to assess&#xD;
      myocardial calcium handling in reversible causes of cardiomyopathy, namely ischaemic&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy, myocarditis and takotsubo cardiomyopathy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND Heart failure (HF) is a global pandemic affecting at least million people&#xD;
      worldwide. Despite the significant advances in therapies and prevention, mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity are still high and quality of life poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiomyopathy refers to diseases affecting the myocardium which can lead to heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) is the leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      in the United Kingdom (UK) and an important cause of reversible cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTS) is a form of stress cardiomyopathy that is characterised by&#xD;
      acute, transient left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. This typically affects the apex extending&#xD;
      beyond a single epicardial vessel with subsequent angiography revealing non obstructive&#xD;
      coronaries. It accounts for up to 2% of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) admissions and despite&#xD;
      being first described 20 years ago its pathophysiology is poorly understood. Typically&#xD;
      takotsubo resolves over time and is considered to have a benign prognosis however acutely it&#xD;
      can cause serious complications such as severe heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac&#xD;
      arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocarditis is an inflammatory cardiomyopathy with varying aetiology which comprises a wide&#xD;
      clinical spectrum from sub-clinical disease to severe heart failure. Currently myocardial&#xD;
      biopsy is considered the gold standard in diagnosis, although it is prone to sample error and&#xD;
      clinically indicated in only a few scenarios. Although in some cases cardiac MRI can reveal a&#xD;
      'typical' pattern of myocarditis based on T2 oedema imaging, the sensitivity and specificity&#xD;
      is unclear and not yet established giving a limited diagnostic yield. Myocarditis may resolve&#xD;
      spontaneously, recur or become chronic. In a third of biopsy-proven cases, it can lead to&#xD;
      heart failure, cardiac transplantation or death. As a result, it has significant contribution&#xD;
      to the global burden of cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Better understanding of underlying mechanisms and assessment of reversible myocardial injury&#xD;
      is vital in the diagnosis, risk stratification, treatment, and intervention with potential to&#xD;
      change clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delayed-enhancement MRI with Gadolinium Cardiac imaging using delayed-enhancement magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging with gadolinium (DEMRI) is the gold-standard method for non-invasive&#xD;
      characterisation of myocardial scar and function, and has become an invaluable tool in the&#xD;
      field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gadolinium (Gd) is an excellent blood-pool contrast agent. Despite some active uptake in&#xD;
      hepatocytes, Gd acts as a passive marker of the extracellular space. Chelated to&#xD;
      diethylenetriamine-pentacetic-acid (DTPA), Gd diffuses rapidly into the extra cellular space&#xD;
      but its molecular weight prevents it penetrating intact cell membranes. Many pathological&#xD;
      myocardial states have a greater extra cellular volume (ECV) and as a consequence, a greater&#xD;
      osmotic gradient relative to healthy tissue. These diseased tissues also result in the&#xD;
      delayed wash out of Gd-DTPA resulting in an increased signal seen in pathological areas on&#xD;
      DEMRI. However, the non-specific distribution of Gd within the extracellular space means&#xD;
      direct assessment of viability is not possible with DEMRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) Manganese (Mn) was the first clinical MRI contrast agent.&#xD;
      Cardiac, hepatic and renal uptake of Mn causes marked shortening of MRI T1 relaxation times&#xD;
      providing excellent tissue contrast imaging. Mn-based contrast media offer potential for a&#xD;
      wide range of MRI platforms having been applied to the assessment of neuronal activity and&#xD;
      function, detection and tracking of lymphocytes16 and pancreatic beta-cell activation as well&#xD;
      as evaluation of myocardial viability in the setting of ischaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms by which Mn provides contrast imaging in the heart depend on calcium (Ca)&#xD;
      handling in myocardial cells. During myocardial contraction, Ca2+ ions are taken up into&#xD;
      myocytes predominantly through voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels where they then trigger&#xD;
      further Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (excitation-contraction coupling). In&#xD;
      diastole, Ca2+ is actively transported into sarcoplasmic reticulum by Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a),&#xD;
      in addition to passage into the extracellular space via the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and uptake&#xD;
      into mitochondria. Alterations in this Ca2+ handling, by protein dysfunction and defective&#xD;
      regulatory mechanisms, impair the ability of the myocyte both to increase and decrease&#xD;
      intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, impacting on systole and diastole respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calcium plays a central role in excitation-contraction coupling and defective Ca2+cycling is&#xD;
      key in the pathophysiological and adaptive mechanisms of defective contractile function and&#xD;
      impaired relaxation in heart failure. Experimental reports have demonstrated reduced&#xD;
      sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+storage and release, with decreased SERCA2a activity and Na+- Ca2+&#xD;
      exchange up regulation. The altered expression and activity of voltage-gated L-type Ca2+&#xD;
      channels both in heart failure and hypertrophy observed in several studies is not yet fully&#xD;
      understood, although clearly highlights the centrality of calcium handling to this issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mn acts as a Ca2+ analogue allowing its uptake by voltage-gated Ca2+ channels therefore cells&#xD;
      with active calcium handling avidly take up Mn ions, in contrast to infarcted tissue which&#xD;
      lack the necessary viable mechanisms. The result is a marked shortening of the T1 relaxation&#xD;
      times in tissue with functioning calcium handling mechanisms. This has particular relevance&#xD;
      to myocardial tissue and mitochondria since it has the potential to identify viable&#xD;
      myocardium and provide a measure of myocardial function. In contrast to DEMRI with Gd, which&#xD;
      effectively functions as a marker for pathological myocardium, MEMRI highlights areas of&#xD;
      viable myocardium, marking non-viable myocardium by its absence of uptake. With its&#xD;
      paramagnetic properties also reducing the T1 relaxation times of water, Mn provides positive&#xD;
      image contrast in the tissues where it accumulates giving excellent anatomical delineation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T1 Mapping The majority of myocardial pathologies prolong T1 relaxation (infarction,&#xD;
      myositis, hypertrophy, ischaemia, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis), although lipid deposition&#xD;
      (arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia), iron deposition (haemachromatosis) and&#xD;
      lysosomal storage disorders (Fabry disease) shorten it. On account of its potent paramagnetic&#xD;
      properties, Gd shortens T1 in both normal and abnormal myocardium. A T1 map is generated by&#xD;
      combining multiple images obtained during diastole, but with different inversion times, to&#xD;
      assess T1 relaxation time for each voxel within the image. Each voxel intensity value&#xD;
      represents the T1 relaxation time for the voxel and is labelled with colour for ease of&#xD;
      visual differentiation. Different imaging protocols and techniques have been developed to&#xD;
      combine an even sampling of the T1 recovery curve whilst minimising artefact, maximising&#xD;
      precision and avoiding long breath holds. The principal potential advantages of T1 mapping&#xD;
      compared to late gadolinium enhancement relates to its ability to detect diffuse more subtle&#xD;
      forms of myocardial disease and to provide quantification rather than a binary &quot;black versus&#xD;
      white&quot; categorisation. Combined with manganese enhancement, and time-optimised T1 mapping&#xD;
      protocols, this should allow specific tissue characterisation rather than the more&#xD;
      generalised extracellular and intravascular assessment provided by late-gadolinium&#xD;
      enhancement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst T1 mapping eliminates errors introduced by windowing and variable signal enhancement,&#xD;
      post contrast T1 quantification can be affected by variable contrast kinetics and is heavily&#xD;
      reliant on precise timing of acquisition. The derivation of the partition coefficient and use&#xD;
      of plasma volume to calculate extracellular volume fraction (ECV) have been developed to&#xD;
      correct for these factors. Previous studies have demonstrated the value of ECV in the&#xD;
      assessment of myocardial fibrosis in aortic stenosis, shown excellent reproducibility at&#xD;
      3-Tesla (3T) , and have correlated these values with other important biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mangafodipir In its early development, Mn toxicity occurred in animal studies with&#xD;
      administration of magnesium chloride (MnCl2) because it competed too strongly with Ca2+ entry&#xD;
      into the myocardium. It caused decreased myocardial function, hypotension and cardiac&#xD;
      arrest.1 Two approaches were developed to circumvent these risks whilst maintaining the&#xD;
      desired magnetic and kinetic properties. These are (i) chelation to bind the Mn2+ ions&#xD;
      preventing competition with Ca2+, and (ii) co-administration of Ca2+ ions, effectively&#xD;
      competing with Mn and reducing its cardio-toxic potential.12 Mangafodipir utilises the first&#xD;
      of these two approaches, in a similar way to which Gd contrast agents mitigate against&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal limitation of Gd-based DEMRI imaging lies in quantifying the heterogeneous&#xD;
      peri-infarct zone, where it results in overestimation of the non-viable infarct region.33 To&#xD;
      date, there is no established imaging strategy to identify the viable and potentially,&#xD;
      salvageable cardiomyocytes within this key area of myocardium. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that Mn-enhanced MRI will provide a method of cellular imaging through specific,&#xD;
      non-perfusion dependent distribution due to active uptake by viable myocardial cells. The&#xD;
      potential clinical application of this novel contrast agent will be to assess manganese&#xD;
      uptake and therefore calcium handling in the myocardium of patients with reversible causes of&#xD;
      myocardial injury such as reversible ischaemia, myocarditis and takotsubo cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
      This will guide therapy and enable prognostication in these patient groups with high unmet&#xD;
      clinical need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE for STUDY Pre-clinical and clinical data Mangafodipir has been used in animal&#xD;
      models where it was compared to a non-chelated Mn-based contrast medium, EVP1001-1. Whilst&#xD;
      the latter agent uses co-administration with calcium to counteract toxicity, Mangafodipir&#xD;
      (Teslascan) employs chelation with dipyridoxyl diphosphate (DPDP) to counteract potential&#xD;
      toxic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study successfully assessed T1 shortening in the healthy rat myocardium using both Mn&#xD;
      contrast agents and demonstrated reduced T1 shortening (Mn uptake) with the simultaneous&#xD;
      administration of diltiazem by approximately one third.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spath et al have shown that manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance (MEMRI) is a better measure&#xD;
      of myocardial infarction size than late gadolinium enhancement. Data indicate two important&#xD;
      findings: (i) over-estimation of the scar by DEMRI (Gd) and (ii) quantitative differences in&#xD;
      the scar volume between MEMRI and DEMRI. Moreover, they have shown that MEMRI is superior in&#xD;
      assessment of viability as it gives a direct quantification of viable myocardium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, MEMRI with T1 mapping has shown altered manganese uptake and reduced rate of&#xD;
      extra-cellular re-distribution in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. In addition to better&#xD;
      quantification of myocardial infarct size and assessing viability, we hypothesise that MEMRI&#xD;
      will also allow the study of myocardial recovery in reversible cardiomyopathy such as&#xD;
      reversible ischaemia, myocarditis and takotsubo cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety data and clinical use Naturally occurring deficiency is rarely reported but toxic&#xD;
      effects of Mn have historically been recognised with Mn accumulating in the striatum and&#xD;
      globus pallidus, the predominant manifestations being headaches and emotional lability, with&#xD;
      parkinsonian extrapyramidal symptoms and gait-disturbance (manganism) developing with&#xD;
      increasing severity. These concerns have been overcome as described above with chelation and&#xD;
      calcium-competition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The manganese agent used in this study, Mangafodipir (now a generic product), has been widely&#xD;
      used in humans for the investigation of hepatic and pancreatic lesions. The agent has now&#xD;
      been patented for application to cardiovascular disease and shows great promise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extensive animal studies and use in humans have enabled Phase I, II and III trials of&#xD;
      Mangafodipir. In Phase III clinical trials, 624 patients were evaluable for adverse events.&#xD;
      Infusion associated discomfort was reported in 4% of patients (n=24) a feeling of warmth of&#xD;
      mild (n=22) to moderate (n=2) intensity. Six serious adverse events occurred. Of these, two&#xD;
      were considered possibly/likely to be drug related and occurred in one patient. These were&#xD;
      reported as a rash of the left arm in the presence of pre-existing lymphedema followed by a&#xD;
      septicaemia after a superficial cut of the left hand. Vital signs were monitored in 321&#xD;
      patients and clinically important changes in blood pressure were recorded in 2 of these, one&#xD;
      with an increased systolic blood pressure of 70 mmHg the other with increased&#xD;
      systolic/diastolic pressures of 50/40 mmHg respectively. Monitoring of blood chemistry&#xD;
      indicated increases in bilirubin levels in one patient and high total serum iron in 5&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Special populations: No specific interaction, renal impairment or high risk patient studies&#xD;
      were submitted. Subjects less than 18 years old were excluded in the trials. In the phase III&#xD;
      studies, 216 of the 624 patients were over 65. The rate of adverse events was lower in this&#xD;
      sub-group (4% vs. 9.3%). Bilirubin was measured in 257 patients and was abnormal in 30 of&#xD;
      them although severe obstructive hepatobiliary disease was an exclusion criterion. 138&#xD;
      patients were recorded as having cirrhosis. No increased adverse event rate was found in&#xD;
      either sub-group. 86 out of the 624 patients had unspecified cardiovascular disease. No&#xD;
      difference in adverse event rate was observed with this sub-group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most common adverse reactions reported were transient and of mild intensity, with headache,&#xD;
      nausea and flushing being most commonly reported (1-10%). Uncommonly reported adverse&#xD;
      reactions were skin reactions, rhinitis, pharyngitis, abdominal discomfort, palpitation,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disturbance, dizziness, paraesthesia, altered taste sensation, fever and&#xD;
      discomfort at injection site (0.1-1%). Other adverse reactions were very uncommon or rare.&#xD;
      The frequency of reactions was found to be increased with faster infusion rates&#xD;
      (4-6mls/minute).&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, clinical studies have focused on the application of Mangafodipir to human&#xD;
      cardiovascular imaging and disease, reinforcing this large body of safety data as applied to&#xD;
      a cardiovascular population as well as demonstrating the potential of the agent to&#xD;
      characterise myocardial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Data This study is designed to explore the application of this novel cardiac MRI&#xD;
      technique in reversible cardiomyopathy. Participants from the patient cohort will be compared&#xD;
      to a healthy volunteer group.&#xD;
