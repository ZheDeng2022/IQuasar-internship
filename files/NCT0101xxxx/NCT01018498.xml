  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malabsorption of certain foods (e.g. lactose) has been proposed as a cause of irritable bowel&#xD;
      syndrome in adults and children. Recently, a diet that lowers intake of a combination of&#xD;
      foods has been found to be effective in adults with IBS identified with fructose&#xD;
      malabsorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a restricted fermentable substrate diet is&#xD;
      effective in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome in children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 19% of school-aged children have recurrent abdominal pain (RAP), accounting for 5% of&#xD;
      all pediatric office visits and increased morbidity. The majority of children with RAP have&#xD;
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with up to 60% these children going on to develop IBS as&#xD;
      adults. IBS accounts for up to 8 billion dollars a year of healthcare costs in adults within&#xD;
      the United States. Successful interventions that ameliorate symptoms in childhood IBS may&#xD;
      have an impact into adulthood, however current clinical interventions are often ineffective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As in adults, the etiology of childhood IBS is multi-factorial, with food intolerance and&#xD;
      increased gastrointestinal inflammation being potential factors. Another factor, that of&#xD;
      malabsorption of fermentable substrates (e.g., fructose), has frequently been postulated as a&#xD;
      form of food intolerance that exacerbates IBS symptoms in adults and children. Studies&#xD;
      suggest up to 61% of children with RAP have fructose malabsorption. The interactions between&#xD;
      factors such as increased gastrointestinal inflammation and malabsorption of fermentable&#xD;
      substrates and they relate to an individual patient is currently unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a diet that lowers intake of a combination of foods has been found to be effective&#xD;
      in adults with IBS identified with fructose malabsorption. This diet has not been used in&#xD;
      children with IBS nor has its mechanism(s) of efficacy been explored. This pilot project&#xD;
      focuses on using a restricted fermentable substrate diet as a treatment in children with IBS,&#xD;
      while evaluating decreased bacterial fermentation gas production and decreased&#xD;
      gastrointestinal inflammation as mechanisms of its effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a prospective, open label design in children meeting Rome III childhood IBS criteria,&#xD;
      our Specific Aims are to: 1) Characterize the effectiveness of a restricted FODMAPs diet in&#xD;
      improving symptoms (number of abdominal pain episodes; primary endpoint); 2) To determine the&#xD;
      mechanisms by which a restricted FODMAPs diet may work. We Hypothesize that: 1) A restricted&#xD;
      FODMAPs diet will improve abdominal pain symptoms associated with childhood IBS and&#xD;
      identified fructose malabsorption; 2) A restricted FODMAPs diet will improve symptoms in part&#xD;
      by decreasing bacterial fermentation gas production amongst other potential mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this proposal may, if applied on a larger scale, aid a large number of&#xD;
      children with IBS and potentially provide insight into the mechanism(s) behind successful&#xD;
      dietary interventions for childhood IBS.&#xD;
