    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with umbilical cord blood stem&#xD;
      cells will improve blood flow to the most severely affected leg of a participant with&#xD;
      medically refractory and non-surgical peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Umbilical cord blood is a safe alternative source of stem cells used for decades in&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplants for malignancies. There is also a reported decreased&#xD;
      incidence of acute GVHD compared to matched unrelated donor transplants.A cord blood registry&#xD;
      will be searched for suitable units with compatibility in the ABO and HLA systems. The&#xD;
      minimum total nucleated cell dose required which would be 1.0 x 107/kg, and one unit of cells&#xD;
      will be procured to meet this requirement. Although it is likely that the transplanted cord&#xD;
      blood cells will be rejected over time, we hypothesize that while they remain in the host's&#xD;
      tissue these cells will be producing and releasing cytokines, growth factors and other&#xD;
      humoral factors that might promote vasculogenesis by stimulating endogenous stem cells and&#xD;
      endothelial cells. Since there is no need to collect the patient's own stem cells, the&#xD;
      patient's cardiovascular system will not be subjected to any stress due to the leukapheresis&#xD;
      procedure itself. No injections of exogenous growth factors, which have been associated with&#xD;
      thrombosis, would be required to mobilize the patient's own stem cells. The procedure could&#xD;
      conceivably even be performed in its entirety on an outpatient basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 25 patients will be enrolled in the study. Patients will be followed for 24 months&#xD;
      after the procedure with evaluation visits one day after the transplant and then at one&#xD;
      month, six, twelve and twenty four months post-treatment. The visit one day after the&#xD;
      transplant will involve a history and physical with a leg exam, a CBC and a chemistry panel&#xD;
      to evaluate for possible infection, or other adverse event.&#xD;

    <description>The cord blood stem cells will be simply injected intramuscularly in the leg. 30 minutes prior to stem cell injection the patients will receive Vancomycin 1 gram IVPB x1 as a prophylactic measure. Patients will also receive Ativan 0.5 to 1 mg PO x 1 and Dilaudid 0.5 to 1 mg IV x1 to alleviate the discomfort of the procedure.&#xD;
Cells will be injected by means of a 22 gauge sterile spinal needle after topical anesthesia of the injection site. The concentration will be at least 2 x 107 total nucleated cells per ml in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 5% human serum albumin (Baxter, Deerfield Illinois).</description>
