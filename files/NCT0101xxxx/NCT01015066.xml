  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine the relative effectiveness of buprenorphine/naloxone&#xD;
      (Suboxone) pharmacotherapy versus naltrexone pharmacotherapy for treatment retention, relapse&#xD;
      prevention and opioid craving reduction among opioid-dependent adolescents and young adults.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that naltrexone treatment is as effective as&#xD;
      buprenorphine/naloxone for these treatment outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Context: Standard treatment of opioid dependence in adolescents is detoxification and&#xD;
      counseling, which results in relapse in 20-50% of patients. Alternative medical treatments&#xD;
      include buprenorphine and naltrexone that have not been well investigated in adolescents and&#xD;
      young adults. Buprenorphine has previously been shown effective in the treatment of opioid&#xD;
      dependence in adolescents in one study in the United States as compared to detoxification.&#xD;
      Although naltrexone treatment results in low compliance in adults, it is effective in&#xD;
      combination with a strong social support network that exists in adolescents that live with at&#xD;
      least 1 parent/guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To compare the efficacy of buprenorphine/naloxone pharmacotherapy with naltrexone&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy on treatment retention, relapse prevention and craving reduction among&#xD;
      opioid-addicted adolescents and young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: 2-arm Randomized Comparative Effectiveness Pharmacotherapy Clinical Trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: The study will be conducted in an outpatient treatment facility Participants: The&#xD;
      participants will be those who 1) are between 16-25 years old, 2) have clear evidence of a&#xD;
      substance use disorder with opioid dependence, and 3) live with at least one parent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data collection: Data collected at baseline will include (with examples),&#xD;
      demographics (age, gender, race), substance use history (type of substances used, duration of&#xD;
      use, routes of abuse), co-existing medical problems (seizures, hepatitis C), prior mental&#xD;
      health problems (prior treatment, diagnoses), prior substance abuse treatment (outpatient,&#xD;
      inpatient), socioeconomic variables (educational level, occupation, employment history),&#xD;
      criminal history (number of arrests and convictions, total amount of time spent in jail or&#xD;
      prison), family history (first degree relatives with substance use disorders) and scores on&#xD;
      psychometric testing (DAST, opioid craving score).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome data: Four main outcomes will be examined: Retention in treatment, self-reported&#xD;
      opioid craving, self-reported drug use with urine toxicology confirmation. Retention in&#xD;
      treatment (1-180 days) will be measured by the date that participant was last seen by study&#xD;
      personnel or date when participant completes study following the date of enrollment. Opioid&#xD;
      carving (1-10) will be measured by a 10 point visual analog scale. Self-reported drug use&#xD;
      (days to first use and percent days abstinent) will be measured by time line follow back.&#xD;
      Urine toxicology (yes/no) will be determined at baseline and monthly at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6&#xD;
      months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: Outcome variables will be compared between the two groups using t-tests or&#xD;
      chi-square tests as appropriate. A Kaplan-Myer survival analysis will be used to describe&#xD;
      participant participation. Predictors of poor outcomes will be identified using a&#xD;
      case-control design in which those with poor outcomes (the &quot;cases&quot;) will be compared to those&#xD;
      with successful outcomes (the &quot;controls&quot;) using multivariate techniques (logistic&#xD;
      regression).&#xD;
