      1. HYPOTHESIS AND STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1. HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ingestion of bovine colostrum powder (BCP) from cows immunized to insulin will improve&#xD;
           non alcoholic steatohepatitis and the metabolic syndrome in patients suffering from&#xD;
           these conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2. PRIMARY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2.1 To determine the efficacy of BCP in improving liver enzyme levels in patients with&#xD;
           NASH.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2.2 To determine the safety of the administration of oral BCP to patients with NASH.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3.1. To determine whether the administration of BCP will improve the metabolic&#xD;
           syndrome in patients with NASH (namely insulin resistance).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1. BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1.1. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH is a common, often &quot;silent&quot; liver disease which&#xD;
           affects about 2%-5% of Americans4-6. NASH is strongly associated with the metabolic&#xD;
           syndrome, diabetes type-2 and obesity and can lead to cirrhosis, HCC, liver&#xD;
           transplantation or death. The only mean for proving a diagnosis of NASH and separating&#xD;
           it from simple fatty liver is liver biopsy (an invasive procedure which carries a&#xD;
           certain degree of risk). Currently, there is no effective treatment for NASH7.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1.2. The effect of Hyperimmune Bovine Colostrum on NASH&#xD;
&#xD;
           Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are recognized as an important immunomodulatory component of&#xD;
           the adaptive immune system. Immune dysregulation may lead to chronic inflammation,&#xD;
           triggering chronic insulin insensitivity and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The&#xD;
           role of Tregs in the adipose tissue in the regulation of NASH was not previously&#xD;
           studied. Aim: To assess the effects of Tregs stimulation on hepatic injury and insulin&#xD;
           resistance in NASH. Methods: Leptin deficient Ob/Ob mice were fed for 4 weeks with&#xD;
           colostrum derived solutions (CDS) enriched with anti insulin specific antibodies&#xD;
           (AIS-CDS, Immuron, Australia), or with purified anti insulin specific CDS (PAIS-CDS).&#xD;
           The immunologic effect on the adipose tissue was determined by flow cytometry performed&#xD;
           on the central adipose tissue and its stromal vasculature (SV), and compared with the&#xD;
           effect on immune system of the liver and the spleen. Hepatic injury and insulin&#xD;
           resistance was determined by glucose tolerance tests (GTT) and liver enzymes. Results:&#xD;
           Oral administration of anti-insulin antibodies promoted the SV CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ cells&#xD;
           (13.05 vs. 27.94 p=0.01). Treatment was associated with a decrease of the CD4+IL17+&#xD;
           lymphocyte subset in the adipose tissue (87.89 vs. 12.93, p&lt;0.01), the SV (61.86 vs.&#xD;
           14.99, p&lt;0.01), and in the liver (40.18 vs. 2.66, p&lt;0.01). The liver CD8+CD25+FoxP3+&#xD;
           lymphocyte subset was significantly increased (0.36 vs. 2.39, p&lt;0.05). The CD4/CD8+&#xD;
           lymphocyte ratio in the adipose tissue showed a mirror effect to that of the spleen and&#xD;
           liver suggesting an opposite effect on lymphocyte trapping. Promotion Tregs in the&#xD;
           adipose tissue was accompanied by a marked improvement in insulin resistance manifested&#xD;
           by decreased glucose and insulin serum levels, and improved glucose tolerance test&#xD;
           results (a decrease of 45%, in the area under the curve 23355 vs. 42448, in treated vs.&#xD;
           controls, respectively), along with decreased liver enzymes (ALT levels decreased from&#xD;
           743.4 to 379.8 IU, p&lt;0.05; and AST from 770.5 to 299IU, in controls vs., treated&#xD;
           respectively, p=0.07) without a change in body weight. Conclusions: The immune system of&#xD;
           the adipose tissue plays an important role in the regulation of the metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
           Decreasing TH17 in the liver, adipose tissue and SV, along with promotion of&#xD;
           CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ and CD8+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs (in the SC and liver respectively), by oral&#xD;
           administration of anti insulin CDS offers a new treatment modality for NASH and insulin&#xD;
           resistance, making Tregs in adipose tissue as a new therapeutic target for alleviation&#xD;
           of the liver damage in NASH.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1.3. BCP Has Been Shown to Be Safe and Well-tolerated in Humans&#xD;
&#xD;
           Over 80,000 packets of Anadis tabletted BCP product with the same active component has&#xD;
           been sold in Australia over 4 years. There have been no reported adverse events reports&#xD;
           to Anadis. BioGard itself as a higher dose separate product was approved in 2008.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Risk of microbiological contamination: The colostrum in the product is pasteurized;&#xD;
           strict procedures minimize risk of contamination, and tablet batches are tested for&#xD;
           yeast, mold, coliform bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci, Salmonella, and&#xD;
           Listeria. The cows for colostrum production are sourced only from bovine spongiform&#xD;
           encephalopathy (BSE)-free countries. Additionally, milk products are considered to have&#xD;
           no detectable infectivity and are considered unlikely to present any risk if sourced&#xD;
           from healthy animals under the same conditions as milk collected for human consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Lactose intolerance: Bovine colostrum extract generally contains &lt;10% lactose, compared&#xD;
           with about 50% in normal skim milk powder; therefore, lactose intolerance is unlikely to&#xD;
           be a major safety problem. Clinical signs can be expected in susceptible humans given&#xD;
           5-10g of lactose (Thorn et al, 1977). At a dose of bovine colostrum extract of 10g a day&#xD;
           (2.8g more than the dose proposed in this study), a maximum of 1 g would be lactose.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Side effects. No cases of death have ever been reported in studies of BCP. While the&#xD;
           typical dose is 10g/day [8-10] doses as high as 10 g four times daily have been&#xD;
           studied[11]. Adverse reactions have been few in number and slight in severity. In most&#xD;
           clinical studies on the efficacy of bovine colostrum there have been no demonstrable&#xD;
           adverse effects[9, 10, 12-15]. When they have occurred, they have mostly consisted of&#xD;
           nausea, emesis, flatulence, and mild diarrhea[8, 11, 14, 16, 17]. In one study,&#xD;
           transient moderate elevations in serum levels of hepatic transaminases were observed in&#xD;
           volunteers who received bovine immunoglobulin concentrates prepared against E. coli&#xD;
           (5/10) and rotavirus (2/10). This effect was attributed to diets high in protein&#xD;
           provided at the hospital (13). More recently, bovine colostrum was well-tolerated in&#xD;
           HIV-infected persons for the treatment of HIV-associated diarrhea (18).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Colostrum administration should be avoided in person allergic to cow's milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a single-arm, open label, before-and-after exploratory trial to evaluate the&#xD;
           effect of 4 weeks of BCP administration on serum liver enzymes and the metabolic&#xD;
           syndrome in patients with NASH. Candidates will be identified from among the patients&#xD;
           treated in the department of medicine and liver unit of the Hadassah Hebrew University&#xD;
           Medical Center and will be asked to sign an approved informed consent from before any&#xD;
           study activities are initiated. Participants will be followed on study with weekly&#xD;
           visits as well as for an additional 4 weeks after concluding treatment to assess safety.&#xD;
