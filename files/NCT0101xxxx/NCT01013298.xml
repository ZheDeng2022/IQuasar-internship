      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of an&#xD;
      endotracheal tube embedded with a mini video-camera as a guiding tool for percutaneous&#xD;
      tracheostomy.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percutaneous tracheostomy (PCT) is commonly used in the intensive care unit (ICU) for&#xD;
      critically-ill patients who require long-term mechanical ventilation. In experienced hands,&#xD;
      and with proper patient selection, it is safe, easy and quick, and the associated&#xD;
      perioperative complication rate can be reduced to approximately 4% [1-7]. However, skilled&#xD;
      intensivist may not always be available, and the procedure may sometimes entail&#xD;
      complications. These include paratracheal insertion of the tracheostomy tube, tracheal&#xD;
      injury; puncturing the cuff and transfixing the endotracheal tube (ETT) during the&#xD;
      transtracheal needle insertion; inserting the guide wire through Murphy's eye; or accidental&#xD;
      extubation while withdrawing the endotracheal tube during the procedure leading to loss of&#xD;
      the airway [8-13].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although using the fingertip to palpate the trachea and endotracheal tube is a useful&#xD;
      technique to locate the tip of the endotracheal tube during the procedure, it is unreliable,&#xD;
      particularly in patients with short and thick necks. Bronchoscopic guidance of PCT is&#xD;
      generally recommended to minimize the risk of unintentional tracheal injury. The use of a&#xD;
      fibreoptic bronchoscope may be helpful [14-18]. However, it is an expensive tool which is not&#xD;
      readily available in some centers. Video guidance provides a cost-effective alternative to&#xD;
      bronchoscopes, that may also reduce the risk of procedure-related complications such as&#xD;
      paratracheal insertion of the tracheostomy tube, tracheal injury or cuff puncture [19].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to observe and describe a simple and safe technique - Video-guided&#xD;
      PCT - that may overcome some of the limitations of percutaneous tracheostomy, to report any&#xD;
      potentially-related complications that may occur during or after the procedure, and to&#xD;
      portray a learning curve obtained with this technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The equipment used for this technique is the ETView TVTTM, a commercially available ETT,&#xD;
      embedded with a mini video-camera at the tip of the tube. It provides direct endoscopic&#xD;
      visualization of the larynx and tracheal mucosa, and thereafter allows the determination of&#xD;
      the tip of the transtracheal needle during percutaneous puncture of the trachea, and hence&#xD;
      may reduce the likelihood of paratracheal insertion, tracheal injury, or other technical&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ETView TVTTM device is compatible with any medical grade NTSC video monitor, thereby it&#xD;
      provides monitoring of the airways during the intubation and PCT procedure, as well as&#xD;
      continuous viewing of the airways as long as mechanical ventilation is required&#xD;
      (www.etview.com).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To observe a new bedside technique of video-guided PCT, to report any potentially-related&#xD;
      complications, and to construct learning curves based on the operative time and complication&#xD;
      rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as a prospective observational one. The setting will be the ICU&#xD;
      of the Sourasky medical center. 10 consecutive adult critically ill patients who require&#xD;
      elective tracheostomy will be recruited for the study. Informed consent will be obtained from&#xD;
      the families or next of kin of all study patients. In the absence of relatives, consent will&#xD;
      be given by an anesthesiologist/intensivist not related to the study. The procedure will be&#xD;
      performed by the same team of intensivists upon all study patients. During and following the&#xD;
      procedure we will assess the complication rate, operative time, and operability of the&#xD;
      procedure (see &quot;procedure &amp; follow-up&quot; section).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure will be performed by an ICU team which includes: an&#xD;
      anesthesiologist/intensivist who executes the procedure, another anesthesiologist who applies&#xD;
      anesthetics &amp; analgesia, a nurse, and a forth person who takes time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the procedures oxygen saturation, end tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2), ECG, blood&#xD;
      pressure, and arterial blood gases will be monitored continuously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The video-guided PCT procedure requires extubation and re-intubation with the TVTTM tube,&#xD;
      which will be mentioned in the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Re-intubation with the TVTTM tube will be performed as any commonly practiced intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ETView Tracheoscopic system (TVTTM) consists of an ETT, embedded with a video imaging&#xD;
      device and a light source at its tip and an integrated cable with a connector, that may be&#xD;
      wired to any video monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The imaging system will be used to monitor the airways while intubating and, beyond the vocal&#xD;
      cords, to locate the transtracheal insertion site and needle. In addition, the light source&#xD;
      will serve for transillumination of the neck soft tissues, in order to delineate the tracheal&#xD;
      curvature and identify anatomical deviations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia and analgesia will be routinely performed, and standardized for all the study&#xD;
      patients. Low doses of the opiate fentanyl (2-3 μg/kg) and the short-acting sedative propofol&#xD;
      (20 mg bolus, and 3-6mg/kg/h drip) will be administered at the beginning of the procedure.&#xD;
      Rocuronium bromide, a brief acting muscle paralyzer, 0.6mg/kg, will also be used in most&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      The executing physician will answer a questionnaire evaluating the intraprocedural&#xD;
      difficulties, complications, feasibility, confidence, and operability, and will follow-up the&#xD;
      patients during the first 6h after the procedure, or until discharge. Follow-up will include&#xD;
      documentation of any procedure-related complications, monitoring of respiratory/ventilatory&#xD;
      parameters and length of stay (LOS) in the ICU beyond 6h (due to medical circumstances&#xD;
      related to the procedure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study patients will be placed with arterial lines through which we withdraw blood before&#xD;
      and after the procedure, and when indicated by deterioration of respiratory parameters - for&#xD;
      blood gas analyses (PaO2/FiO2, PaCO2, pH and BE). In addition, saturation will be documented&#xD;
      hourly. All patients will also have chest x-rays performed immediately following&#xD;
      tracheostomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire will include a check-list listing procedure-related complications, through&#xD;
      which we will evaluate the total number of complications. These include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Technical complications: False route/paratracheal insertion, injury to a thoracic vessel,&#xD;
      tracheal/laryngeal/esophageal injury, accidental decannulation, puncturing the cuff,&#xD;
      inserting the guide wire through Murphy's eye, malpositioning or kinking of the tracheal&#xD;
      cannula, failed trachestomy, multiple punctures (≥3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Clinical complications potentially related to the procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      B.1. Intraprocedural: significant endotracheal bleeding and transfusion requirements (RBC,&#xD;
      FFP or platelets), transient hypoxia/hypoxemia, hemodynamic changes (e.g., transient&#xD;
      hypotension not related to anesthetics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B.2. Postprocedure: alterations in respiratory function (defined as &gt;15% reduction in&#xD;
      saturation or PaO2/FiO2, compared to baseline; Increased PaCO2 without change in saturation;&#xD;
      the need to change ventilatory settings and/or add PEEP within the first 24 hrs),&#xD;
      atelectasis, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, aspiration, early unexplained mortality (within&#xD;
      the first 24 hrs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other parameters they will be asked to evaluate will be: whether the transtracheal needle was&#xD;
      recognized via the TVTTM (yes/no); intraoperative difficulties; level of confidence; ease of&#xD;
      performance (&quot;best practice&quot;); and need to convert to surgical tracheostomy procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a member of the team will measure operative time, which includes the total&#xD;
      duration of the procedure; the time it took to recognize the tracheal insertion site and&#xD;
      needle; and the time since ETT placement and until successful tracheal placement is confirmed&#xD;
      via air bubbles or ETCO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The complication rate and operative time will be used to construct a learning curve for the&#xD;
      executing intensivist.&#xD;
