      The aim of the study is to compare patient outcome following standard of care (Hartmann's or&#xD;
      resection with anastomosis and defunctioning stoma) and a 'new therapy' (laparoscopic lavage&#xD;
      alone) for the treatment of acute perforated non-faeculant diverticulitis in Irish hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perforated diverticulitis requires emergency surgery. This carries significant risks and&#xD;
      mortality as high as 15% during the index admission has been reported. Our group has&#xD;
      established the safety of laparoscopic lavage alone on the largest cohort to date in a&#xD;
      prospective multi-institutional study of 100 patients, providing convincing evidence that&#xD;
      laparoscopic lavage alone is a reasonable alternative to resection for non-faeculant&#xD;
      perforated diverticulitis. Our aim now is to translate this well-established study design&#xD;
      into a protocol for a multi-institutional randomised control trial as direct comparison is&#xD;
      the only way to provide convincing evidence of one modality over another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed up for twelve months and primary (operative and in-hospital&#xD;
      mortality) and secondary (in-hospital and post-discharge morbidity; rates of stoma formation;&#xD;
      rates of re-presentation with diverticulitis with or without perforation.) end-points will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations reveal that a patient cohort of 100 in each arm will be sufficient&#xD;
      to detect a difference in morbidity and mortality between groups The ratio between Hinchey 3&#xD;
      and Hinchey 4 is estimated to be approximately 2:1. In order to guarantee sufficient sample&#xD;
      size, therefore, 300 patients must fulfil the study criteria allowing for exclusion of 100 at&#xD;
      time of operation&#xD;

      Background and Current Knowledge:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until recently, the natural history of diverticular disease was poorly understood and&#xD;
      evidence suggesting a link between recurrent presentations with diverticulitis and&#xD;
      perforation is almost forty years old rendering its relevance to modern day practice&#xD;
      questionable at best . More recently, these questions have been clarified and it seems that&#xD;
      risk of perforation following a single (treated) episode of diverticulitis is in the order of&#xD;
      2% per year with a risk of requiring an emergency Hartmann's procedure in this cohort being 1&#xD;
      in 2000 patient years of follow-up . As with all surgical interventions, there is a certain&#xD;
      risk profile associated with elective resection and morbidity is estimated at 25-50%&#xD;
      (including stoma formation in 10-14%) and mortality at 1-2% . The current vogue (despite some&#xD;
      dissention ) is towards a more conservative approach to management of non-perforated acute&#xD;
      diverticulitis and away from elective sigmoid colectomy in the absence of perforation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of perforated diverticulitis continues to evolve. The last 50 years has seen&#xD;
      standard of care shift from a three stage procedure (1.Drainage and defunctioning colostomy,&#xD;
      2.Excision of diseased segment, 3.Colostomy reversal and restoration of continuity) , to&#xD;
      Hartmann's procedure , to resection and primary anastomosis , to treatment with antimicrobial&#xD;
      therapy alone in a carefully selected (Hinchey Grade 2) population . Since the learning curve&#xD;
      for laparoscopic surgery has begun to plateau, resections for perforated diverticular disease&#xD;
      have been shown to be as safe and effective as conventional open techniques .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irish surgeons have pioneered the institution of laparoscopic lavage for acute non-faeculant&#xD;
      diverticulitis. The operative method described involves laparoscopy, copious washout, drain&#xD;
      placement and treatment with antimicrobial therapy (intravenous for 72hours followed by oral&#xD;
      for one week). Benefits include low mortality, stoma avoidance, minimal wound infection,&#xD;
      shorter operative time and no difference in recurrence when compared to primary resection and&#xD;
      anastomosis. Having demonstrated a clear clinical advantage of laparoscopic lavage over&#xD;
      standard of care (Hartmann's procedure or primary resection and anastomosis) for acute non&#xD;
      faeculant perforated diverticulitis, we feel the time is ripe to formalise these findings&#xD;
      through performance of a multicentre national randomised controlled trial- LapLAND&#xD;
      (LAParoscopic Lavage for Acute Non-faeculant Diverticulitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perforated diverticulitis requires emergency surgery . This carries significant risks and&#xD;
      mortality as high as 15% during the index admission has been reported . It appears that&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality related to resections in complicated and uncomplicated disease are&#xD;
      reduced in laparoscopic intervention when compared to open . The real question, however, is&#xD;
      whether or not there is necessity to perform any resection or whether lavage is sufficient.&#xD;
      Our group has established the safety of this procedure on the largest cohort to date24 in a&#xD;
      prospective multi-institutional study of 100 patients. We provided convincing evidence that&#xD;
      laparoscopic lavage is a reasonable alternative to resection for non-faeculant perforated&#xD;
      diverticulitis. We demonstrated a low mortality rate despite patient co-morbidity and disease&#xD;
      severity. Benefits of lavage alone included stoma avoidance and decreased wound infection. At&#xD;
      up to 36 months follow up it appeared that subsequent resection appeared unnecessary. These&#xD;
      findings were confirmed by a similar French trial published this year which demonstrated no&#xD;
      excess morbidity or mortality, a reduction in hospital stay and a lower rate of stoma&#xD;
      formation. Having established the safety of the new intervention (laparoscopic lavage), our&#xD;
      aim now is to translate this well established study design into a protocol for a&#xD;
      multi-institutional randomised control trial as we believe that direct comparison is the only&#xD;
      way to provide convincing evidence of one modality over another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge transfer/implementation/consolidation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence to date regarding the management of perforated diverticulitis is based on a&#xD;
      combination of eminence based opinion and outdated retrospective analysis. A true prospective&#xD;
      analysis comparing standard of care (Hartmann's or resection with anastomosis and&#xD;
      defunctioning stoma) and a 'new therapy' (laparoscopic lavage alone) is yet to be published.&#xD;
      Aims and Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare patient outcome following standard of care (Hartmann's or resection with&#xD;
      anastomosis and defunctioning stoma) and a 'new therapy' (laparoscopic lavage alone) for the&#xD;
      treatment of acute perforated non-faeculant diverticulitis in Irish hospitals. Specific&#xD;
      research questions include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Which treatment modality confers least mortality and morbidity in patients with&#xD;
           non-faeculant perforated diverticulitis?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does treatment influence length of hospital stay and return to activities of daily&#xD;
           living?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Do patients undergoing laparoscopic lavage alone require emergency sigmoidectomy at a&#xD;
           later date (within a one year period)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Does laparoscopic lavage alone confer any advantage in terms of stoma-free survival?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An Irish multi-centre trial will be performed with the aim of comparing two treatment&#xD;
      modalities for patients presenting acutely with perforated non-faeculant diverticulitis.&#xD;
      Pre-operative details, intraoperative findings and post-operative course will be&#xD;
      prospectively accrued by the operating surgeon. All patients will be followed up for twelve&#xD;
      months and primary (operative and in-hospital mortality) and secondary (in-hospital and&#xD;
      post-discharge morbidity; rates of stoma formation; rates of re-presentation with&#xD;
      diverticulitis with or without perforation.) end-points will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Outline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients demonstrating clinical signs of generalised peritonitis and radiological&#xD;
      evidence of intra-peritoneal free air (on erect chest radiograph or abdominal CT scan will be&#xD;
      eligible for the study. Individual patient consent will be sought. They will be given&#xD;
      intravenous fluids (standardised regime) and intravenous antibiotics (3rd generation&#xD;
      cephalosporin and metronidazole). All patients will be given prophylaxis against deep vein&#xD;
      thrombosis (compression stockings and low molecular weight heparin). When patients have&#xD;
      received adequate fluid resuscitation they will proceed to theatre on an emergency basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pneumoperitoneum will be established via a blunt entry umbilical port. Two 5mm ports will be&#xD;
      placed in the suprapubic and right lower quadrants to facilitate triangulation of instruments&#xD;
      during manipulation and lavage. The peritoneal cavity will be thoroughly examined and stage&#xD;
      classified according to Hinchey. All patients with faeculant peritonitis will undergo&#xD;
      Hartmann's procedure or primary resection and anastomosis according to local preference and&#xD;
      excluded from the study on that basis. In the absence of faeculant peritonitis, patients will&#xD;
      be randomised to undergo Hartmann's procedure or primary resection and anastomosis (depending&#xD;
      on standard practice in the individual unit) or laparoscopic lavage alone. Peritoneal lavage&#xD;
      will be performed in all four quadrants using at least 4 litres of warmed saline until the&#xD;
      drainage is clear. Intravenous antibiotics will be continued for a minimum of 72hours and&#xD;
      oral antibiotics will be continued for one week. Oral fluids will be commenced on the first&#xD;
      postoperative day and diet will be introduced subsequently, depending on clinical status.&#xD;
      Early mobilisation will be encouraged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicentre surgical clinical trial will be coordinated by the R&amp;D unit of the Colles&#xD;
      Institute at RCSI. The Colles Institute comprises of the National Surgical Training Centre,&#xD;
      the Centre of R&amp;D and Centre for Innovation in Surgical Technology. The Project Manager for&#xD;
      this trial will be Mr Kieran Ryan, who has over 10 years experience in running clinical&#xD;
      trials along with many years experience in the Irish Health System, including his role as a&#xD;
      former GCP inspector with the Irish Medicines Board. Kieran and his team will ensure that the&#xD;
      trial is carried out in accordance with the relevant regulations, GCP standards and the&#xD;
      requirements of the protocol. This will ensure the smooth running of the trial and the&#xD;
      integrity of the research data and management of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will also be a DSMB (Data &amp; Safety Monitoring Board) of external surgeons established&#xD;
      to oversee the progress of the study and ensure that the safety of patients are to the&#xD;
      forefront of this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will be performed by the operating surgeon or a designated member of the&#xD;
      surgical team (present at time of operation) and recorded on an electronic pro-forma or&#xD;
      electronic Case Report Form. It will include patient demographics (age, sex), previous&#xD;
      diverticular history American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) grade and specific&#xD;
      co-morbidities, intervention performed, operation performed, incidence of stoma formation,&#xD;
      re-intervention during index admission (radiological or operative) in-hospital morbidity&#xD;
      (myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, wound infection, abscess&#xD;
      requiring drainage, urosepsis, renal failure or respiratory insufficiency), mortality, time&#xD;
      to return to diet, time to discharge. Further details will be recorded at post-operative&#xD;
      visits- stoma-free survival at one year, number of days alive following discharge,&#xD;
      reinterventions within 12 months, patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardisation of treatment within trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may withdraw from the trial at any time if they so wish. Re-laparotomy may be&#xD;
      performed at the discretion of the operating surgeon but fixed indications include clinical&#xD;
      deterioration or failure to improve within 48-72 hours post-operatively. Potential foci of&#xD;
      concurrent sepsis should be out-ruled (respiratory, urinary) by clinical, biochemical or&#xD;
      radiological investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospital Inclusion and Patient Accrual:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible patients (see exclusion criteria) presenting to participating hospitals with&#xD;
      perforated diverticulitis will be recruited for the trial. They will be furnished with a&#xD;
      patient information leaflet and will have the implications of inclusion in the trial&#xD;
      explained to them by the operating surgeon. It will be explained that non-willingness to&#xD;
      participate in the trial will not have any negative impact on their treatment. If the patient&#xD;
      is willing to participate in the trial, verbal and written consent will be obtained prior to&#xD;
      transfer to the operating theatre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having performed an extensive literature review of studies comparing treatment entities for&#xD;
      perforated non-faeculant diverticulitis, sample size calculations reveal that a patient&#xD;
      cohort of 100 in each arm will be sufficient to detect a difference in morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality between groups (25% versus 10%; two sided significance 5% and a power of 80%). A&#xD;
      significance level of 0.05 on the two sided Likelihood ratio test was used and the&#xD;
      significance level achieved by this design is 0.04997.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to guarantee sufficient sample size, therefore, 300 patients must fulfil the study&#xD;
      criteria (allowing for exclusion of 100 at time of operation). Recruitment of patients is not&#xD;
      expected to be difficult because evidence to date is convincing of at least equivalent&#xD;
      outcome and we believe that most patients would hope to be assigned to the lavage group in&#xD;
      the hope of avoiding a stoma. From a surgeon's perspective, laparoscopic lavage is&#xD;
      technically less challenging and time consuming than traditional treatment modalities.&#xD;
