    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two widely used operative techniques on displaced&#xD;
      midshaft clavicular fractures. The hypothesis is that there is no difference in functional&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clavicular fracture is one of the most common fractures, accounting for about 4 % of all&#xD;
      fractures. Midshaft fractures account for approximately 80%. Traditionally, midshaft&#xD;
      fractures have been thought to have a good prognosis even when substantially displaced, and&#xD;
      most have been treated nonoperatively with a sling or a figure of eight bandage. Early&#xD;
      studies by Neer and Rowe in the 60´s demonstrated a very low non-union rate, with av&#xD;
      prevalence of 4 in a series of 566 patients, and 3 nonunions in 2235 in another. On this&#xD;
      basis, the general view has been that the vast majority of even severely displaced midshaft&#xD;
      fractures healed uneventfully, with a very low nonunion rate and a good functional result.&#xD;
      Operative results reported on the other hand bad results, especially concerning the risk of&#xD;
      infection. Recent studies, however, conclude differently, and suggest the outcomes of&#xD;
      displaced fractures might not be as favourable as once thought. Hill showed in a series of 52&#xD;
      completely displaced midclavicular fractures a nonunion rate of 15% (8 of 52 patients) and&#xD;
      31% (16 of 52) of patients were not satisfied with the end result. This correlated with a&#xD;
      shortening of more than 2 cm. In a prospective study of 222 patients by Nowak, 42% (93 of&#xD;
      222) were found to have persisting symptoms after 6 months wheras 15% were found to have&#xD;
      nonunion. These symptoms seem to persist even after 9 - 10 years reporting 29 % of 208&#xD;
      patients having pain during activity and 9% pain at rest. 46% did not consider themselves&#xD;
      fully recovered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar result were found in a systemic review of 2144 fractures. 15.1 % (24 of 159) of&#xD;
      nonoperative treated dislocated fractures resulted in nonuion, whereas 2,2% (10 of 460) and&#xD;
      2% (5 of 152) nonunions were found in fractures treated operatively with either plate or&#xD;
      intramedullary pins. On this basis, it is becoming more evident that conservative treatment&#xD;
      gives much inferior results compared to earlier reported results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operative approach to midclavicular fractures have traditionally been plate&#xD;
      osteosynthesis or intramedullary nailing. Poigenfürst in 1992 showed in a series of 122&#xD;
      patients a low nonunion rate and good functional results after plating. Likewise,&#xD;
      intramedullary nailing has been described as an alternative technique with good results.&#xD;
      Kettler demonstrated en a series of 87 patients a good functional results union in 97,7 % (&#xD;
      85 of 87) and no infections. Similar results were fond by Rehm in 2004, with one nonunion of&#xD;
      136 fractures treated and a constant score one year after implant removal of 97.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative treatment of displaced midclavicular fracture thus shows reliable good results&#xD;
      compared to earlier reported results. In 2007, the Canadian Orthopedic Trauma Society&#xD;
      published a prospective randomised controlled trial of 132 patients, randomised to either&#xD;
      conservative treatment with a sling, or plate fixation. The operative group showed clear&#xD;
      superiority in Constant and DASH scores, reduction in risk of developing non-union, earlier&#xD;
      return to work. With intramedullary nailing using ESIN technique, Smekal et al demonstrated&#xD;
      superior results in the operative group in a prospective randomised controlled trial of 60&#xD;
      patients. 30 patients were opereated with elastic stable intramedullary nailing, and 30&#xD;
      patients were randomised to conservative treatment with a sling. The operative group had&#xD;
      fewer complications, shorter time to union and a better functional outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It seems from the above, that it is reasonable to offer operative treatment to active adults&#xD;
      with displaced fractures of the middle third of the clavicle due to the risk of developing a&#xD;
      symptomatic non- or malunion. Both plate fixation and intramedullary nailing of displaced&#xD;
      fractures are described as safe methods of operative treatment. To our knowledge, there has&#xD;
      never been conducted a prospective randomised controlled trial that compares different forms&#xD;
      of the former mentioned operative alternatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On this basis, we plan to contuct a prospective randomised controlled trial comparing&#xD;
      operative plate fixation and intramedullary nailing with TEN.&#xD;
