  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vaccines induce protective immunity against numerous infectious diseases. However, current&#xD;
      vaccines have limited efficacy against challenging infections like tuberculosis, malaria and&#xD;
      HIV. Protein vaccines are safe but, typically, they induce weak T cell immunity when&#xD;
      administered alone. Therefore, special attention is being given to adjuvants, which are&#xD;
      enhancers of immunity, that mature antigen presenting immunostimulatory dendritic cells&#xD;
      (DCs). Our goal is to study in humans the mechanism whereby synthetic adjuvants, acting on&#xD;
      defined pattern recognition receptors (PRR), enhance T and B cell immunity. In preclinical&#xD;
      studies, the investigators' laboratory has found in mice that poly IC and its analog poly&#xD;
      ICLC are superior adjuvants for T cell mediated immunity relative to other agonists for PRR.&#xD;
      In this study the investigators propose to study the safety and the innate immune responses&#xD;
      to poly ICLC in multiple blood cell types, including three different subsets of DCs when&#xD;
      administered subcutaneously or intranasally to healthy volunteers. Poly ICLC is a stabilized&#xD;
      double stranded RNA which has been extensively studied in humans with a favorable safety&#xD;
      profile.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Healthy adult males and females, as assessed by a medical history, physical exam, and&#xD;
             laboratory tests&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age of at least 18 years on the day of screening and no greater than 60 years at time&#xD;
             of drug/placebo administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Willing to comply with the requirements of the protocol and available for follow-up&#xD;
             for the planned duration of the study (screening plus 4 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. In the opinion of the principal investigator or designee, has understood the&#xD;
             information provided. Written informed consent needs to be given before any&#xD;
             study-related procedures are performed&#xD;
