  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether subcutaneous immunoglobulin given in small&#xD;
      doses, is effective in maintaining the force, in patients with chronic inflammatory&#xD;
      demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy compared with placebo (saline infusions), and&#xD;
      intravenous immunoglobulin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CIDP is an autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system, responding well to treatment&#xD;
      with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), steroids and plasmapheresis. IVIg is effective in&#xD;
      treating patients with CIDP, but most of the patients need long time maintenance treatment,&#xD;
      which is associated with decreased autonomy and regular hospital admissions. Furthermore many&#xD;
      of the patients complain of infusion related side effects such as headache, chills and&#xD;
      fatigue, and over time there is problems obtaining intravenous entry because of occlusion of&#xD;
      the veins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is therefore a critical need for alternative methods to IVIg treatment. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability and safety of small doses of immunoglobulin&#xD;
      administered subcutaneously (SCIg), compared with placebo. At the same time we compare the&#xD;
      efficacy of SCIg with the regular IVIg treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore hypothesize, 1: SCIg is better than subcutaneous placebo infusions, and is as&#xD;
      good as IVIg in maintaining muscle function in patients with CIDP. 2: SCIg home treatment is&#xD;
      safe and tolerable. 3: SCIg home treatment is preferred to IVIg under hospital admission, by&#xD;
      the patients.&#xD;
