  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has not been any systemic therapy approved in the United States or in Europe for&#xD;
      treating advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer (EC). This study will evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and preliminary efficacy of XL147 in advanced or recurrent EC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Constitutively active phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/phosphatase and tensin homolog on&#xD;
      chromosome 10 (PTEN) pathway signaling is common in EC and involved in the development and/or&#xD;
      progression of the disease. PTEN deficiency and/or activating mutations/amplification in the&#xD;
      PIK3CA gene that encodes the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K have been frequently detected in&#xD;
      EC patients. XL147 is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of the Class I PI3K family of&#xD;
      lipid kinases. In addition, in vivo preclinical data have demonstrated that XL147 targets&#xD;
      both proximal and distal signaling in the PI3K/PTEN pathway. Therefore, XL147 may have&#xD;
      utility in the treatment of subjects with advanced or recurrent EC.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a histologically confirmed diagnosis of EC (endometrioid, serous,&#xD;
             clear cell adenocarcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, or mixed histology, any grade)&#xD;
             that is advanced (ie, persistent, locally advanced) or recurrent, and is incurable by&#xD;
             standard therapies and has received one platinum based chemotherapy regimen for EC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is at least 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0&#xD;
             or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has at least one measurable lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tissue samples from archival or fresh tissue, or a tissue block of the subject's tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has adequate organ and marrow function&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is capable of understanding the informed consent and complying with the&#xD;
