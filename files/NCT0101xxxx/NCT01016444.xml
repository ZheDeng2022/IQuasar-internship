      The hypothesis to be tested is that acutely ill asthmatics who do not resolve their attacks&#xD;
      following standard doses of albuterol and require admission to hospital have single&#xD;
      nucleotide polymorphisms of their B2 adrenergic receptors that lower B2 agonist responsivity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The most recently available statistics indicate that approximately 22.2 million people in the&#xD;
      United States have asthma. Of these, about 55% experienced at least one attack in the year&#xD;
      before the survey resulting in 1.9 million visits to emergency departments and 497,000&#xD;
      hospitalizations. The natural history of acute asthma is one of resolution and 70 to 80% of&#xD;
      people rapidly clear their airway obstruction following treatment with 7.5 to 10.0 mg of&#xD;
      nebulized albuterol. However, there is a subset of patients with recurrent severe episodes&#xD;
      that are poorly responsive to this treatment and require admission to hospital for&#xD;
      resolution. Although these patients represent a minority of asthmatics, they have persistent&#xD;
      disease that accounts for the vast majority of expenditures for urgent care. Yet virtually&#xD;
      nothing is known about them. In the present application, we wish to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      these individuals do poorly with albuterol because of genetic polymorphisms of their beta 2&#xD;
      adrenergic receptors (β2AR) that either influence severity and/or reduce responsiveness to&#xD;
      short acting bronchodilators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One possibility of great clinical significance is that the albuterol non-responders have&#xD;
      genetically determined differences in β2AR that down regulate effectiveness. Various&#xD;
      polymorphisms have been described in this receptor with the greatest attention being devoted&#xD;
      to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) substitutions at amino acid positions 16 (arginine&#xD;
      to glycine, Arg 16 Gly) and 27 (glutamine to glutamic acid, Gln 27 Glu). The Gly 16 receptor&#xD;
      exhibits enhanced down regulation in vitro after exposure to agonist while the Arg 16 allele&#xD;
      is more resistant. The Gly 16 allele is strongly associated with asthma destabilizations as&#xD;
      manifested by nocturnal symptom and an increased risk of severity. In contrast, Arg/Arg&#xD;
      homozygosity at position 16 has been associated with poorer outcomes in prospective studies&#xD;
      of regular use of short-acting β2 agonists. This phenomenon was not seen in asthmatics that&#xD;
      used albuterol on an as needed basis or those who were homozygous for glycine. Since over 90&#xD;
      % of the subjects in our studies, and those of others, on acute asthma take this drug&#xD;
      routinely and the vast majority are treated with it emergently, the presence of the Arg/Arg&#xD;
      allele could lead to poorer responses. It has also been suggested that this polymorphism may&#xD;
      also produce similar effects with long-acting β2 agonists. Again, since a large percentage of&#xD;
      asthmatic patients chronically use long acting sympathomimetics, this factor may have a&#xD;
      contributory effect. Alternatively, β2AR pharmacogenetics may be totally unimportant. Two&#xD;
      studies have implied that neither single genotypes at Codon 16, nor haplotypes in the β2AR&#xD;
      have any effect on the acute bronchodilator response to either albuterol or salbutamol.&#xD;
      However, since these trials were performed in stable patients, they may not be representative&#xD;
      of the non-responsive group described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study we propose to build upon previous methods we have used in the care of&#xD;
      acute asthma. Clinical assessments and treatment regimens are standardized using a care path&#xD;
      as in previous studies. Demographics, height, weight, race, symptoms, signs, past medical&#xD;
      histories, and routine medication use for the previous month prior to the index visit are&#xD;
      recorded on an intake sheet. We routinely obtain information on disease duration, frequency&#xD;
      of attacks, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, intubations, and a list of the general and&#xD;
      specific triggers for acute exacerbations. We also record asthma medications including oral&#xD;
      and inhaled steroids, short and long-acting beta-adrenergic agonists, antileukotriene drugs,&#xD;
      anticholinergics and methylxanthines. We include in our histories all of the concurrent&#xD;
      medications including eye drops (beta-blockers and prostaglandins), cardiac and&#xD;
      anti-hypertensive drugs, (beta-adrenergic active agents and ACE inhibitors. We ask people how&#xD;
      they are taking their asthma drugs, but have no way of knowing if they truly are using them&#xD;
      as prescribed. If their medications are obtained at our hospital it may be possible to&#xD;
      determine how many prescriptions are filled, but we still will not know use. We also record&#xD;
      the use of illicit drugs such as cocaine, heroine, and OxyContin, etc. Body mass index (BMI)&#xD;
      is calculated as weight in Kg divided by height in meters squared. Obesity is classified as a&#xD;
      BMI ≥ 30 Kg/M2. Arterial oxygen saturation is determined by pulse oximetry on room air and&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen is administered as necessary for values less than 90%. Before treatment,&#xD;
      the best of three peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) is taken as representing the patient's&#xD;
      initial state of flow limitation. The PEFR data is recorded in absolute terms as well as a&#xD;
      percentage of predicted normal. As in previous studies, if a patient's airway obstruction&#xD;
      prevented him or her from achieving the minimum level on the peak flow meter, a value of 10&#xD;
      is arbitrarily assigned to avoid dividing by zero when the percentage improvement following&#xD;
      albuterol is calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects receive either 2.5 mg of nebulized albuterol every 20 min for three doses or two&#xD;
      doses of 5.0 mg of albuterol 20 min apart. Albuterol non-responsiveness is defined as a&#xD;
      failure of the PEFR in an acutely ill asthmatic to exceed 40% of predicted following ≥7.5 mg&#xD;
      of albuterol (2.5 mg albuterol aerosols q.20 min x3). After completion of each schedule, PEFR&#xD;
      is repeated and the patients reexamined. Admission and discharge decisions are made according&#xD;
      to published predetermined criteria. Patients are considered ready to be sent home if they&#xD;
      are asymptomatic, free of accessory muscle use, have absent or diminished wheezing, and have&#xD;
      achieved a peak flow of 60% of predicted. Those not meeting these requirements are given&#xD;
      further treatment with adrenergic and anticholinergic bronchodilators and glucocorticoids at&#xD;
      the discretion of the ED physician and reassessed hourly. If they subsequently meet the&#xD;
      discharge criteria, they are released. If not, they are admitted to hospital. The&#xD;
      false-positive admission rate with these algorithms has been found to be less than 1% and the&#xD;
      24-hour relapse rate less than 2%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only individuals in whom the index ED visit was for the treatment of an acute asthma attack&#xD;
      are studied. Patients with histories suggestive of congestive heart failure, pneumonia,&#xD;
      chronic bronchitis, or emphysema are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous blood will be drawn from 1250 subjects. It is expected that 25% will have obstruction&#xD;
      that is poorly responsive to albuterol and require admission to hospital for resolution. The&#xD;
      other 75% will have obstruction that quickly resolves with albuterol and who are discharged&#xD;
      home. The DNA will be isolated and assayed blindly by the Center for Human Genetics Research,&#xD;
      Vanderbilt Medical Center for identification of β2 AR SNPs at positions 16 and 27 and&#xD;
      receptor haplotypes. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms will be genotyped by use of TaqMan&#xD;
      single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).&#xD;
      Eleven polymorphisms will be selected for genotyping from within the ADRB2 coding region and&#xD;
      up to about 5 kb 5' Codon 1 (rs11958940, rs17778257, rs2895795, rs2053044, rs12654778,&#xD;
      rs11959427, rs1042711, rs1042713, rs1042714, rs1800888, and rs1042718). Quality-control&#xD;
      measures include a genotype call rate of 95% and no significant departures from&#xD;
      Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium within each racial group (exact p value &gt; 0.01). Haplotypes will&#xD;
      be predicted with publicly available software (SNPHNP-a program for estimating frequencies of&#xD;
      large haplotypes of single-nucleotide polymorphisms [version 1.3]). Haplotype pairs 2/2, 2/4,&#xD;
      2/6, 4/4, 4/6 and 6/6 will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome variable will be the genetic patterns (SNPs and haplotypes) in each&#xD;
      population. We wish to evaluate SNP patterns and albuterol responsiveness using a case&#xD;
      control study. Between-group comparisons will be made by analysis of covariance. The&#xD;
      associations between baseline PEFR and the percent improvement following albuterol will be&#xD;
      stratified for SNP pattern and will be assessed by analysis of covariance. Single&#xD;
      polymorphisms may be insufficient and it has been suggested that haplotypes containing&#xD;
      multiple polymorphisms may be more informative. Drysdale and coworkers identified 13&#xD;
      polymorphisms and organized them into 12 haplotype groups with varying frequencies between&#xD;
      ethnic groups. The four most common were haplotypes 1, 2, 4 and 6. Haplotype 2, which&#xD;
      contains Gly16 homozygotes, was associated with the greatest FEV1, reversibility while&#xD;
      haplotype 4, which contains Arg16 homozygotes, was the least. Five haplotype pairs were&#xD;
      common in asthmatics. Homozygotes, haplotypes 2/2 had the greatest impact on FEV1 and protein&#xD;
      expression while haplotype pair 4/4 showed the least effect in both categories. Since no&#xD;
      isolated SNP may have any predictive utility, that is why we are measuring the haplotypes.&#xD;
      The haplotype combination 4/4 produces the smallest impact and may be operational in the&#xD;
      non-responders. The haplotype pair 4/6 produces the largest improvement with albuterol, and,&#xD;
      therefore, may be operational in the responsive group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will estimate haplotype frequencies across the pool of study patients. Using logistic&#xD;
      regression, we will calculate a global score statistic to rest for the overall association&#xD;
      between haplotypes and responsiveness to albuterol. Next, haplotype specific scores and&#xD;
      corresponding p-values will be calculated. Similar statistics will be calculated adjusting&#xD;
      for baseline covariates. These analyses will be carried out using R functions in haplo.stats.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will evaluate the associations of haplotypes 1-6 with response/non-response to adrenergic&#xD;
      agonists using a case-control study. Using the data in Table 1 and assuming that the cases&#xD;
      make up 25% of the study subjects, and using the function haplo.power.cc. We require a sample&#xD;
      size of 1243 patients to be able to detect at least a 40% increase in risk of non-responsive&#xD;
      to adrenergic agonists in patients with haplotypes containing Arg16Arg compared to haplotypes&#xD;
      without Arg16Arg with 80% power at 0.05 level of significance. Under similar assumptions, we&#xD;
      require a total sample size of 865 to be able to detect a 50% increase in risk of treatment&#xD;
      failure in patients with haplotypes containing Arg16Arg compared to patients without. The&#xD;
      number of subjects represents the total required to achieve sufficient power given a 75:25&#xD;
      treatment success-failure ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will demonstrate whether Gly16Arg or Gln27Glu genotypes and/or β2AR&#xD;
      haplotypes are associated with the response to albuterol in patients who experience acute&#xD;
      episodes of asthma and whether genotype pattern varies between different clinical phenotypes.&#xD;
      They will also provide insights into whether such polymorphisms determine the severity of the&#xD;
      episodes as measured by initial pulmonary function and symptoms. In this investigation, both&#xD;
      positive and negative results would be extremely important. Positive findings would suggest&#xD;
      that we can begin to make sense out of therapeutic responsiveness at a very basic level. They&#xD;
      also suggest that we need to begin to search for alternative treatments for a significant&#xD;
      segment of the asthmatic population when they become acutely ill. Equally important it means&#xD;
      that our efforts on asthma control need no longer be diffusely applied, but now can be&#xD;
      focused on prophylaxis in affected individuals. Negative findings will conclusively&#xD;
      demonstrate that genetically determined changes in B2AR cannot readily be translated into&#xD;
      clinical responses and that we need to look for other factors that determine severity and&#xD;
      resource utilization in the beta2 unresponsive population.&#xD;
