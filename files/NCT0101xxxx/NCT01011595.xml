    <textblock>
      The gold standard techniques to assess the extent of disease and decide on therapy for&#xD;
      patients with lung cancer consists of cervical mediastinoscopy, which is a surgical procedure&#xD;
      which entails an incision in the neck and the removal of lymph nodes from around the airway.&#xD;
      Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) are new, non-surgical&#xD;
      techniques that have been available for the past several years and are proving invaluable in&#xD;
      lung cancer evaluation. These techniques are minimally invasive and can be performed without&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there have been no head-to-head studies on the same group of patients using both the&#xD;
      old and new techniques. The study will consist of a study which compares traditional staging&#xD;
      techniques in lung cancer patients to new, less invasive techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The significance of the proposed project is tremendous. If the new strategies prove to be&#xD;
      equivalent (or superior) to traditional techniques, these techniques will be considered the&#xD;
      new gold-standard tests. This will change the way lung cancer is evaluated. An equivalent or&#xD;
      superior result will also significantly impact on patient care, cost and morbidity due to the&#xD;
      speed, convenience and lack of operating room requirement as well as the lack of general&#xD;
      anesthesia.&#xD;

      1. Problem:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The gold standard techniques to stage and diagnose the mediastinum in patients with lung&#xD;
           cancer consist of cervical mediastinoscopy (CM). CT, PET and PET-CT scans have improved&#xD;
           the radiological staging of the mediastinum; however these techniques are unable to&#xD;
           provide a tissue diagnosis and are inaccurate. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and&#xD;
           endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) have been available for the past few years and are proving&#xD;
           invaluable in the diagnosis and staging of the mediastinum. These techniques rely on&#xD;
           imaging of mediastinal lymph nodes (LN) through the airway (EBUS) and the esophagus&#xD;
           (EUS) using miniaturized ultrasound probes mounted on the tip of flexible bronchoscopes&#xD;
           (EBUS) and esophagoscopes (EUS). Once a LN is visualized and identified using either of&#xD;
           these techniques, a needle is passed through the airway (EBUS) or esophageal (EUS) wall&#xD;
           into the LN and biopsies are performed. These minimally invasive trans-luminal&#xD;
           techniques do not require general anesthesia and can be performed safely, rapidly,&#xD;
           accurately and at low cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Due to the cost, inconvenience and risks associated with traditional surgical&#xD;
           mediastinal diagnosis and staging, many physicians are foregoing tissue diagnosis of the&#xD;
           mediastinum, resulting in incomplete pre-operative staging for patients. The endoscopic&#xD;
           techniques are quickly replacing traditional techniques in some centers; however, when&#xD;
           replacing a gold standard test with a new modality, one must first prove equivalence in&#xD;
           safety and efficacy. Until such a study is completed, we do not have compelling data to&#xD;
           be able to offer these techniques as equivalent alternatives to patients. The proposed&#xD;
           project will be the first head-to-head comparison of both endobronchial (EBUS) and&#xD;
           endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in addition to transluminal biopsy with gold standard&#xD;
           invasive surgical staging techniques in the diagnosis and staging of NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Define and compare the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value,&#xD;
                negative predictive value, likelihood ratio and accuracies between traditional and&#xD;
                minimally invasive mediastinal diagnostic and staging techniques for lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Compare morbidity, convenience, cost and efficiencies between traditional and&#xD;
                minimally invasive diagnostic strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Examine the impact on decisions regarding changes in treatment plans (neoadjuvant&#xD;
                chemoradiotherapy, prevention of thoracotomy) based on minimally invasive&#xD;
                mediastinal staging compared to conventional staging strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study design consists of a prospective comparison of diagnostic test findings on a&#xD;
           consecutive case series with each subject serving as his or her own control. In order to&#xD;
           do this, we will enroll N subjects (N=166), and will subject each of the subjects to K&#xD;
           procedures (K=3). One of those procedures, the &quot;traditional&quot; one (K-1), is considered to&#xD;
           be the gold standard for comparison. We will compare the diagnostic findings from the&#xD;
           K-2 and K-3 alternative procedures (EBUS and EUS, respectively) with the gold standard&#xD;
           across the N subjects. We will compare them singly and in combination with the gold&#xD;
           standard. All patients with a new or suspected diagnosis of lung cancer will be&#xD;
           prospectively enrolled in the study. All patients will undergo standard mediastinal&#xD;
           staging, EBUS and EUS in the operating room, during one procedure. Patients will be&#xD;
           included in the study if they meet one of the following criteria: (A) Lung lesion with&#xD;
           mediastinal lymphadenopathy and/or positive PET scan in the mediastinum, (B) Lung lesion&#xD;
           without mediastinal lymphadenopathy or positive PET scan in the mediastinum. Sample size&#xD;
           has been calculated to be 166 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Results of traditional staging techniques will be considered as the &quot;gold standard&quot;&#xD;
           tests for mediastinal diagnosis and staging. These tests will be used as the standard to&#xD;
           which other modalities and combinations of modalities are compared. Data will be&#xD;
           collected and analyzed as a whole (all patients with mediastinal LN sampling) and&#xD;
           separately based on pre-biopsy diagnosis, post-biopsy diagnosis, mediastinal LN size (CT&#xD;
           scan), LN station and PET avidity. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative&#xD;
           predictive values, likelihood ratios and accuracies will be calculated and used to&#xD;
           compare EUS and EBUS (transluminal strategy) to traditional staging, EUS to EBUS, EUS to&#xD;
           traditional staging and EBUS to traditional staging. Subanalysis based on pre-biopsy&#xD;
           patient and imaging (CT and PET) characteristics as well as ultrasound imaging&#xD;
           characteristics during biopsy will be used to develop predictive models for minimally&#xD;
           invasive mediastinal diagnosis, in order to better define patients at increased or&#xD;
           decreased likelihood of successful diagnosis using these techniques. ROC curves will be&#xD;
           constructed and used to discriminate results between diagnostic tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary focus of this project and the hypothesis for which the sample size&#xD;
           calculations were designed around is whether or not minimally invasive trans-luminal&#xD;
           mediastinal LN biopsy is as accurate as traditional &quot;gold standard&quot; techniques in the&#xD;
           diagnosis and staging of the mediastinum. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive&#xD;
           value, negative predictive value and accuracy will be calculated for both strategies&#xD;
           (minimally invasive and traditional) and compared. Receiver operating curves will be&#xD;
           used to compare the two strategies at differing sensitivity and 1-specificity values.&#xD;
           Relative operating characteristic curves will be used to compare the two strategies at&#xD;
           different true positive and false positive rates. The study is estimated to be completed&#xD;
           in three years. Sample size calculation has determined that 166 patients are required&#xD;
           for the study. The thoracic surgery division at the CHUM estimates that accrual will be&#xD;
           approximately 1.5 patients per week (6 patients/month).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Expected Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect to find that minimally invasive mediastinal LN staging and diagnosis is not only&#xD;
      equivalent in terms of accuracy to traditional staging strategies, but is actually superior.&#xD;
      This superiority is possible, secondary to the additional LN basins accessible via these&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
