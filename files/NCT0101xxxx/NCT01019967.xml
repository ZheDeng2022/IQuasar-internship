      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common childhood disorder that often does not&#xD;
           respond to standard treatments. Researchers are exploring the role that a brain chemical&#xD;
           called glutamate plays in symptoms of OCD, and are testing a drug called riluzole that&#xD;
           reduces glutamate to see if changing the levels of glutamate in the brain will help&#xD;
           treat the disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers are interested in using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a type of&#xD;
           magnetic imaging, to take pictures of various chemicals in the brain. MRS images will be&#xD;
           used to detect changes in brain levels of glutamate in children taking riluzole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To use magnetic resonance spectroscopy to study the levels of glutamate in the brains of&#xD;
      children and adolescents who have been taking riluzole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Children and adolescents ages 7 to 17 who are enrolled in the current NIMH riluzole trial&#xD;
      protocol (05-M-0225), who are able to lie still in the scanner for about an hour each time,&#xD;
      and who are willing to have up to three MRS scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will study some children/adolescents before they begin to take the study&#xD;
           medication riluzole or placebo these children will have an MRS scan before starting the&#xD;
           study medication. The scan will take about an hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  About 2 weeks after reaching the full dose on the study medication, participants will&#xD;
           have a second hour-long MRS scan. Participants will have a third MRS scan after being on&#xD;
           the study medication for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some children who have already completed 12 weeks on riluzole or placebo, and are now&#xD;
           taking riluzole, will have only one MRS scan.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study uses magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure the neurotransmitter&#xD;
      glutamate in the anterior cingulate cortex (and, if tolerated, the left caudate nucleus and&#xD;
      possibly the thalamus) in children and adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the subjects will be participants in an ongoing double-blind placebo-controlled trial&#xD;
      (05-M-0225) of a glutamate antagonist, the drug riluzole, for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder&#xD;
      (OCD). The subjects are male and female children and adolescents, ages 7-17 years. They will&#xD;
      all have met criteria for clinically significant OCD and will have failed to benefit from&#xD;
      standard-of-care treatments or have been unable to tolerate the treatments. Some of the&#xD;
      subjects will also have a diagnosis on the autism spectrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      In one group of sixteen young people, glutamate will be measured in the anterior cingulate&#xD;
      cortex at three points in time:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  at baseline, before starting riluzole or placebo;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  within ten to fourteen days of the baseline evaluation, after reaching full dose of the&#xD;
           study drug (active drug or placebo) to which the sixteen subjects have just been&#xD;
           randomized;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  at the end of the twelve weeks of the double-blind phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a second group of sixteen young people, all of whom are subjects in the open-label phase&#xD;
      of the same study, glutamate will be measured (first) in the anterior cingulate cortex at a&#xD;
      single point in time when each subject has achieved steady state on the open-label drug&#xD;
      riluzole. If the subject tolerates additional time in the scanner, glutamate will also be&#xD;
      measured in the left caudate and possibly in the left thalamus. Glutamate levels in this&#xD;
      group will be correlated with change in OCD measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the first group, change in glutamate activity in anterior cingulate associated with&#xD;
           active drug (riluzole) administration, as compared with change in glutamate activity for&#xD;
           the subjects taking placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the second group, correlation between serum riluzole level, glutamate activity (or&#xD;
           flux) in anterior cingulate (and possibly in the caudate and thalamus), and therapeutic&#xD;
           effect.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects may be included in the study only if they meet all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female subjects, 7 to 17 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Female subjects of childbearing potential must be using a medically accepted means of&#xD;
             contraception or must remain abstinent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Each legal guardian must have a level of understanding sufficient to agree to all&#xD;
             required tests and examinations. Each legal guardian must understand the nature of the&#xD;
             study. Each legal guardian must consent to study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects must fulfill DSM-IV criteria for (OCD) and have a CY-BOCS score of greater&#xD;
             than 20. In the double-blind phase, subjects enrolled in the combined OCD and ASD&#xD;
             cohort must also meet DSM-IV criteria for Pervasive Developmental Disorder as well as&#xD;
             OCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Each subject already taking medicine must be taking usually effective doses of a&#xD;
             medicine demonstrated to be effective in childhood OCD, must have been stable on that&#xD;
             dose for at least six weeks, and must have no newly recognized or intolerable adverse&#xD;
             effects from that medicine. Subjects who are currently not taking such a medication&#xD;
             must have had adequate trial in the past of at least one medicine that has been shown&#xD;
             to be effective for the symptoms of childhood OCD, and must have failed to see&#xD;
             improvement or must have had intolerable adverse effects from the medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects must be able to swallow capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject in this protocol will all be enrolled in the riluzole for childhood OCD&#xD;
             protocol (NIH 05-M-0225).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be excluded from the study for any of the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;

             other psychotic disorder, or other serious unstable psychiatric illness. Medicially&#xD;
             unstable due to binging, purging, or starvation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Judged clinically to be at risk for suicide (suicidal ideation, severe depression, or&#xD;
             other factors). Diagnosis of DSM-IV Major Depressive Disorder is not necessarily an&#xD;
             exclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Disabling Tic Disorder requiring contraindicated medicines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Female subjects who are pregnant, nursing, or unwilling to use effective&#xD;
             contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Serious unstable illnesses, including gastroenterologic, respiratory, cardiovascular&#xD;
             (including ischemic heart disease), endocrinologic, neurologic, immunologic, or&#xD;
             hematologic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Renal or hepatic dysfunction that would interfere with excretion or metabolism of&#xD;
             riluzole as evidenced by increase above upper limits of normal for BUN/creatinine, or&#xD;
             more than two-fold elevation above upper limits of normal of serum transaminases&#xD;
             (ALT/SGPT, AST/SGOT), gamma glutamate (GGT), or bilirubin.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. DSM-IV Substance Abuse Disorder within the past 90 days or Substance Dependence&#xD;
             Disorder within the past 5 years, or any use of tobacco.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Taking contraindicated drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Unable to swallow capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. In addition, patients will not receive cognitive-behavior therapy during the period of&#xD;
