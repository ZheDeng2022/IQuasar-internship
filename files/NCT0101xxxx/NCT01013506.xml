      RATIONALE: Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using&#xD;
      letrozole +/- goserelin (the latter for pre-menopausal women only) may fight breast cancer by&#xD;
      lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes. OSI-906 and erlotinib hydrochloride may stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not&#xD;
      yet known whether hormone therapy and OSI-906 are more effective when given with or without&#xD;
      erlotinib hydrochloride in treating hormone-sensitive metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving hormone therapy together with&#xD;
      OSI-906 with or without erlotinib hydrochloride works in treating hormone-sensitive patients&#xD;
      with metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the antitumor activity of letrozole +/- goserelin (the latter for&#xD;
           pre-menopausal women only) in combination with IGF-1R inhibitor OSI-906 with or without&#xD;
           erlotinib hydrochloride, measured by time to progression, in patients with&#xD;
           hormone-sensitive metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety of these regimens in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the response rate in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure circulating C-peptide, IGF-1, and IGFBP-3 levels in patients treated with&#xD;
           these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate the expression of IGF-IR, EGFR, HER2, Y1316 and Y1131 pIGF-1R, PTEN, S473&#xD;
           pAkt, pMAPK, S118 (MAPK site), and S167 (Akt and S6 site) pER in formalin-fixed paraffin&#xD;
           blocks (FFPB) with clinical outcome and luminal A vs. luminal B subtypes of breast&#xD;
           cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate the mutational status of PI3K (E542K, E545K, H1047R) in DNA extracted from&#xD;
           FFPB or fresh biopsy with clinical outcome and luminal A vs. luminal B subtypes of&#xD;
           breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Stratification will be based on previous exposure to&#xD;
      endocrine therapy: (Arm I) no previous endocrine therapy or have completed adjuvant therapy &gt;&#xD;
      6 months prior to study enrollment; (Arm II) patients that had previous endocrine therapy in&#xD;
      the metastatic setting or had metastatic recurrence within 6 months of adjuvant endocrine&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral letrozole once daily on days 1-28 +/- subcutaneous&#xD;
           goserelin* on day 1 and oral IGF-1R inhibitor OSI-906 twice daily on days 1-28.&#xD;
           Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
           toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral letrozole +/- subcutaneous goserelin* and IGF-1R inhibitor&#xD;
           OSI-906 as in arm I. Patients also receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily on&#xD;
           days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
           unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *Goserelin will only be given to premenopausal patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor tissue samples from original diagnosis or from fresh biopsy tissue are collected for&#xD;
      biomarker analysis and other studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.&#xD;
