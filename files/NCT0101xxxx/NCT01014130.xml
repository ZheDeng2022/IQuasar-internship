  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether radiotherapy given as three large doses&#xD;
      over a period of two weeks (hypofractionated radiotherapy) is more effective than standard&#xD;
      radiotherapy for patients with non-small cell lung cancer that has not spread beyond the&#xD;
      lung. Although surgery is the most effective treatment for early lung cancer, many patients&#xD;
      are not fit enough for an operation. The alternative treatment to surgery is standard&#xD;
      radiotherapy which is normally 'fractionated' that is, given as a number of small doses over&#xD;
      a period of weeks. Experience has shown that many small treatments are safer than using a few&#xD;
      large doses (hypofractionation) because there is less risk of damage to normal tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent advances in technology have however resulted in greater accuracy and with it a&#xD;
      reduction in the amount of normal tissue affected by the radiation, so the risks of&#xD;
      hypo-fractionation damaging normal tissue are of less concern. Initial results obtained with&#xD;
      hypo-fractionated radiotherapy for early stage non-small cell lung cancer indicate that it&#xD;
      may be more effective in controlling the cancer. However, it has never been compared directly&#xD;
      with standard fractionation in a randomised trial, so this study aims to determine if&#xD;
      hypo-fractionation is more effective, results in longer life expectancy and if it is just as&#xD;
      safe as standard fractionation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre randomised phase III trial comparing hypo-fractionated (&quot;stereotactic')&#xD;
      radiotherapy with conventional radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy in patients with&#xD;
      inoperable stage 1 peripherally located non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The accepted standard of care for stage 1 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), that is, T1 or&#xD;
      T2 tumors that have not metastasised to the regional lymph nodes, is surgical resection.&#xD;
      However, many patients with lung cancer have significant cardiovascular and respiratory co&#xD;
      morbidities which render them unfit for an operation. For these patients, the standard of&#xD;
      care is radiotherapy - conventional fractionation (ConRT) which is administered as 20-30&#xD;
      fractions over a period of four to six weeks. This reduces the likelihood of long term damage&#xD;
      to incidentally irradiated normal tissues compared with non-fractionated treatment. Local&#xD;
      failure for this method, varies considerably between reports ranging from 6-70% with a median&#xD;
      value of 40% using a current best practice for inoperable NSCLC dose of about 60 Gy.&#xD;
      Concomitant chemotherapy in addition to CF improves local progression free survival by 16% at&#xD;
      two years compared with radiotherapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Highly conformal hypo-fractionated image guided radiotherapy is an emerging technically&#xD;
      complex method for precision irradiation of stage 1 NSCLC using doses with a higher&#xD;
      biological effect than can be achieved with standard treatment techniques. Although rates of&#xD;
      local control using hypo-fractionation appear greater, there are risks with serious late&#xD;
      toxicity. However, there is recent evidence that 54-57Gy delivered in 3 fractions can be&#xD;
      delivered safely with no excessive toxicity, provided the tumour has a peripheral location,&#xD;
      the chest wall is not included in the high dose volume and the treatment plan is highly&#xD;
      conformal. Although hypo-fractionation under the above conditions appears to be tolerable,&#xD;
      and is associated with high levels of local control, the results of a small number of phase&#xD;
      II trials cannot be regarded as sufficient evidence to recommend it as the standard of care&#xD;
      for inoperable stage I NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomised phase III trial tests whether highly conformal hypo-fractionated image guided&#xD;
      radiotherapy for peripherally located inoperable T1 and T2a NSCLC using a dose of 54 Gy in&#xD;
      three fractions results in superior control of disease at the primary site compared with&#xD;
      standard care consisting of conventionally fractionated radiotherapy with or without&#xD;
      concomitant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment summary: Investigational arm - radical radiotherapy to a total dose of 54 Gy in 3&#xD;
      fractions of 18 Gy each, delivered weekly on days 0, 7 and 14 with a maximum deviation of +/-&#xD;
      2 days from the specified time allowed. Conventional arm - radical radiotherapy to a total&#xD;
      dose of 60-66 Gy in 30-33 daily 2 Gy fractions over 6 weeks, with or without chemotherapy&#xD;
      consisting of weekly carboplatin at an AUC of 2 and paclitaxel 45 mg/m2.&#xD;
