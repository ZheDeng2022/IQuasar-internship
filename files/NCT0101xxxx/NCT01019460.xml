      The aim of this study is to evaluate three diagnostic methods for assessing small bowel&#xD;
      disease in patients with suspected or known Crohn's disease. All patients are examined with&#xD;
      ileo-colonoscopy, capsule endoscopy, MRI and CT of the small bowel within 14 days. However,&#xD;
      capsule endoscopy is not performed in patients with stenosis detected at ileo-colonoscopy,&#xD;
      MRI and/or CT. All investigations are described in a similar pre-defined and standardized&#xD;
      fashion and the radiologist and physician responsible for describing the findings at MRI, CT&#xD;
      and capsule endoscopy are blinded to the findings at ileo-colonoscopy. The physician in&#xD;
      charge of treatment receives a randomised result of either MRI, CT or capsule endoscopy.&#xD;
      Thereafter patients are followed during 12 months to evaluate differences in clinical outcome&#xD;
      depending on the randomized result. In combination with the diagnostic validity and&#xD;
      inter-observer agreement of MRI, CT and capsule endoscopy we seek to establish the optimal&#xD;
      diagnostic strategy in these two patient categories.&#xD;

      OVERALL AIM OF THE STUDY To evaluate three diagnostic methods for assessment of intestinal&#xD;
      disease in patients with suspected or newly diagnosed Crohn's disease and patients with known&#xD;
      Crohn's disease.&#xD;

&#xD;
      PROTOCOL A&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comparative study of capsule endoscopy, magnetic resonance imaging and computer tomography&#xD;
      scanning of the small bowel in patients with suspected or newly diagnosed Crohn's disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At inclusion all patients will have a standardised work-up including medical history,&#xD;
      physical examination, blood and faeces samples and ileo-colonoscopy. Within two weeks MRI and&#xD;
      CT scanning of the small intestine (on the same day and in randomised order) and subsequently&#xD;
      CE will be performed in all patients. All investigations are described in a similar&#xD;
      pre-defined and standardized fashion and the radiologist and physician responsible for&#xD;
      describing the findings at MRI, CT and CE are blinded to the findings at ileo-colonoscopy and&#xD;
      the other small bowel examinations. In the follow-up part of the study the physician in&#xD;
      charge of the patient will be randomised to receive the results of either MRI, CT or CE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is performed to improve evidence about what is the best primary investigation for&#xD;
      assessment of small intestinal involvement in patients with suspected Crohn's disease, to&#xD;
      evaluate if a combination of diagnostic modalities may improve our assessment of disease&#xD;
      burden for the individual patients, to study whether the initial diagnostic modalities affect&#xD;
      the handling of the patients and to study the interobserver variation of MRI and CT scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTOCOL B&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comparative study of magnetic resonance imaging, computer tomography scanning and capsule&#xD;
      endoscopy in patients with known Crohn's disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At inclusion all patients will undergo a standardised work-up including history, physical&#xD;
      examination, blood and faeces samples and ileo-colonoscopy. Within two weeks MRI, CT scanning&#xD;
      of the small intestine (on the same day in randomised order) and capsule endoscopy will be&#xD;
      performed in all patients. Capsule endoscopy will not be performed in patients with small&#xD;
      bowel stenosis confirmed at ileo-colonoscopy, MRI and/or CT. All three investigations will be&#xD;
      described in a similar predefined standardized fashion with the radiologist blinded to the&#xD;
      findings at ileo-colonoscopy. In the randomised part of the study the physician in charge of&#xD;
      the patient will be randomised to receive the result of either MRI, CT og capsule endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The best diagnostic method for evaluation of small intestinal involvement in patients with&#xD;
      known Crohn's disease may be different from patients suspected of Crohn's disease. Thus in&#xD;
      the current study we hope to provide evidence of whether MRI, CT scanning or capsule&#xD;
      endoscopy is the best diagnostic approach.&#xD;
