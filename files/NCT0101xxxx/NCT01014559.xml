    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to study the efficacy of oxycodone/naloxone prolonged&#xD;
      release tablets (OXN PR), compared to oxycodone prolonged release tablets (Oxy PR), for the&#xD;
      reduction of the intensity of opioid-induced constipation symptoms in patients treated for&#xD;
      cancer or non-cancer pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients with documented cancer or non-cancer pain, either currently receiving a WHO&#xD;
      step II opioid and requiring the initiation of a WHO step III opioid or currently receiving a&#xD;
      WHO step III opioid, and having opioid-related constipation defined by either a KESS score ≥9&#xD;
      or the current use of laxatives (≥3 times per week), will be randomly assigned to receive&#xD;
      either OXN PR or Oxy PR. Randomisation will be stratified on the cause of pain: cancer or&#xD;
      non-cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patient having completed the study and wishing to receive OXN PR afterwards may enter an&#xD;
      optional open extension phase. During this phase, all patients will receive OXN PR and be&#xD;
      managed as per the usual practice in the center until commercial OXN PR is available in&#xD;
      France (with a limit of 1 year after Day 28). Adverse events will be assessed at each visit.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female patient aged 18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. With cancer pain or non-cancer pain such as chronic low back pain, osteoarthritis or&#xD;
             other.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Either currently receiving a WHO step II opioid and requiring the initiation of a WHO&#xD;
             step III opioid (due to a lack of efficacy of the step II opioid) expected to last 28&#xD;
             days or more, or currently receiving a WHO step III opioid expected to last further 28&#xD;
             days or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Having opioid-related constipation defined by either a KESS score ≥ 9 or the current&#xD;
             use of laxatives (at least 3 times per week).&#xD;

             underlying cancer or disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Rheumatoid arthritis, as co-medication may have an impact on the study results,&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Cyclic chemotherapy in the two weeks before inclusion or planned during the study that&#xD;
             has shown in the past to influence bowel function. Patients having their first cycle&#xD;
             of chemotherapy during the 2 weeks before the inclusion visit or during the study they&#xD;
             should not be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Radiotherapy that, in the investigators opinion, would influence bowel function or&#xD;
             pain during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

             clinical trial is not permitted unless the sole purpose of the other trial at the time&#xD;
             of the OXN3505 inclusion visit is for long-term follow-up/survival data.&#xD;
