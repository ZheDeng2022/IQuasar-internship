    <textblock>
      The study drug bIAP, or matching placebo, will be administered as a bolus of 1000 Units bIAP&#xD;
      or matching placebo prior to anaesthesia (T = -15 minutes), directly followed by intravenous&#xD;
      continuous infusion of about 5.6 units per kg bodyweight/hr at pump rate 4 ml/hr for&#xD;
      approximately 36 hrs (total 200 IU/kg/36 hrs) into each of a total of 50 patients scheduled&#xD;
      for coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Risk of surgical complications and mortality&#xD;
      due to co-morbid conditions will be collected and the EuroSCORE will be used to screen&#xD;
      patients prior to surgery.&#xD;

             years. Women must be of non-childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass surgery with CPB.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have a EuroSCORE (Appendix I) of &gt;2 and &lt;6.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who have given written informed consent prior to participation in the trial&#xD;
             and who undertake to comply with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who are unwilling or unable to be fully evaluated for follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who undergo CABG for emergency due to complications from percutaneous&#xD;
             transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA)/ catheterization, unstable angina or ongoing&#xD;
             myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who have base alkaline phosphatase levels at &gt; 100 IU/l (70 IU/L as mean&#xD;
             concentration) levels, or levels &lt; 30 IUnits/L (ammediol, DEA units)&#xD;
&#xD;
             (values base levels in glycine units at pH9.6 and 25 C are respectively &gt;40 and &lt; 12&#xD;
             IU/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who show pre-operative infections or who are suspected of having endocarditis&#xD;
             or systemic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients who refuse to accept medically-indicated blood products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who have evidence of significant hepatic disease, including history of&#xD;
             clinical signs or laboratory values of total bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg/dL, ALT or AST&gt; 3X&#xD;
             upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who received investigational drugs in the 30 days prior to study drug&#xD;
             administration, or are currently participating in a study during which the&#xD;
             administration of investigational drugs within one month is anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients who require pre-operative ventilatory support.&#xD;

             renal failure requiring dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients who are planned to receive leukocyte-depletion filtration as part of the&#xD;
             bypass circuitry.&#xD;

             coronary artery bypass surgery is planned during the 30-day study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patients with a history of cancer who have received chemotherapy or radiation therapy&#xD;

             excluded. If the cancer has not resolved completely, the patient should not be&#xD;
             enrolled without permission of Alloksys.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Patients who are scheduled to receive &quot;stress doses&quot; of glucocorticoids (i.e., doses&#xD;
             &gt;2 mg/kg/day of methylprednisolone or equivalent) prior to, during or following the&#xD;
             operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Patients who are vegetarians or vegenists or those patients that may be expected not&#xD;
             to be tolerant for bovine proteins.&#xD;
