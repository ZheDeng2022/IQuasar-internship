  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients initially presenting with localized sarcoma the standard of care is surgery&#xD;
      followed by with radiation therapy (if feasible). Subsequent or adjuvant cytotoxic based&#xD;
      chemotherapy even for aggressive sarcoma histopathologies (as commonly done for colorectal&#xD;
      cancer or breast cancer) is controversial since over 20 individual adjuvant randomized&#xD;
      clinical trials have not been able to consistently demonstrate a statistically significant&#xD;
      improvement in overall survival. Maturation or differentiation therapy provides an&#xD;
      opportunity to fundamentally change the biology of the underlying cancer (and thus its&#xD;
      overall prognosis) by promoting cellular maturation within that cancer. A change from a&#xD;
      poorly 'differentiated/high grade' tumor to a well 'differentiated/low grade' tumor is&#xD;
      attainable and can change an individual's median time of survival from months to decades. The&#xD;
      investigators have significant preclinical data that differentiation therapy using a group of&#xD;
      drugs referred to as histone deacetylase inhibitors (such as Valproate, also a commonly used&#xD;
      and safe anti seizure medication) is feasible for sarcomas. This approach has not been&#xD;
      clinically addressed in solid tumors. Since adjuvant therapy is controversial for sarcomas,&#xD;
      and building on the investigators' preclinical data, adjuvant based differentiation therapy&#xD;
      using valproate would be predicted to be both safe and potentially extremely beneficial in&#xD;
      terms of a) increasing the time to disease recurrence, b) improving the histology upon&#xD;
      recurrence; and c) improving overall survival in patients with sarcomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with high grade sarcomas will receive Valproate in the adjuvant setting daily and&#xD;
      clinically/radiologically followed until recurrence. Relapse free survival, time to local&#xD;
      failure, time to distant failure, overall survival, and comparative histopathology of primary&#xD;
      and recurrence will be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adjuvant chemotherapy for high grade soft tissue sarcomas is controversial. Given the fact&#xD;
      that approximately 50% of patients receiving optimum treatment will recur in three years and&#xD;
      die of recurrence within five years, smarter adjuvant options are needed. One such treatment&#xD;
      option would be to &quot;differentiate&quot; the high grade sarcoma into a low grade sarcoma upon&#xD;
      recurrence. This differentiation effect will reduce the risk of subsequent death by 50% as&#xD;
      determined by the overall survival difference between high grade/poorly differentiated and&#xD;
      low grade/ well differentiated sarcomas. Given that differentiation takes place on a time&#xD;
      scale that is significantly longer than cytotoxic effects, the optimum time to initiate&#xD;
      differentiation therapy is in the adjuvant setting; when the time to disease recurrence is&#xD;
      measured in months to years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The histone deacetylase inhibitor, Valproate, has been shown to promote differentiation in&#xD;
      myeloid malignancies when administered in standard dosing regiments. We have recently shown&#xD;
      that sarcomas are conceptually similar to hematopoietic malignancies, in that both represent&#xD;
      diseases of aberrant development in which developing cells along their respective lineages&#xD;
      arrest and transform at various points of differentiation. We have recently shown in vitro&#xD;
      that, as for acute promyelocytic leukemia, sarcomas can be reprogrammed to reenter normal&#xD;
      differentiation via epigenetic modulation using histone deacetylase inhibitors. It is&#xD;
      therefore appealing to study Valproate based differentiation therapy in the adjuvant setting&#xD;
      for sarcomas.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 - 100 µg/mL).</description>
