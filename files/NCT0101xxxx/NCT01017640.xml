    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of veliparib when given with or&#xD;
      without mitomycin C in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other places&#xD;
      in the body, cannot be removed by surgery or have come back. Veliparib may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as mitomycin C, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Giving veliparib together with mitomycin C may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To screen cancer patients across different histological sites to identify those with&#xD;
      functional defects in the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway in their tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To establish the safety and practicality of treating patients with FA deficient tumors&#xD;
      with the poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor ABT-888&#xD;
      (veliparib) as protracted monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To establish the safety and practicality of treating patients with FA deficient tumors&#xD;
      with the combination of mitomycin C (MMC) and ABT-888.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To select a dose of ABT-888 protracted monotherapy and a dose-schedule of the combination&#xD;
      of mitomycin C and ABT-888 in patients with FA deficient tumors for phase 2 trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate for germ-line FA repair deficiency and BRCA mutations in peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear (PBMC) in patients receiving ABT-888 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate in PBMC samples for foci produced by the histone variant gamma-H2A histone&#xD;
      family, member X (H2AX) in patients receiving mitomycin C with or without ABT-888 in order to&#xD;
      assess any possible effect of ABT-888 in the cellular sensing and processing of mitomycin&#xD;
      C-induced deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) double strand breaks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Quantify the number of patients with antitumor responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of veliparib. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive veliparib PO BID on days 1-7, 1-14, or 1-21. Patients also receive&#xD;
      mitomycin C intravenously (IV) over 10-20 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 28 days in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 weeks.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a histologically confirmed solid malignancy that is metastatic, or&#xD;
             unresectable, or recurrent, for which no curative or standard of care exist, or this&#xD;
             standard of care is no longer effective&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumors have been shown to be deficient for the FA pathway, based on Fanconi anemia&#xD;
             triple stain immunofluorescence (FATSI) screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be consented to have their existing, or about to be obtained, paraffin&#xD;
             embedded tumor tissue screened for FA deficiency; screening will be performed on an&#xD;
             ongoing basis on the breast, thoracic, gastrointestinal (GI), Georgetown University&#xD;
             (GU), and gynecologic (GYN) Ohio State University (OSU) clinics, anteceding and&#xD;
             concurrently with the clinical trial; it will continue until the numbers of patients&#xD;
             required for the clinical trial are identified and enrolled; based on the estimation&#xD;
             from our preliminary data of 15 to 30% of patients, depending on the primary organ&#xD;
             site, having tumors deficient for the FA pathway we will need to screen around 300&#xD;
             patients' samples to identify 40-50 patients; none of the eligibility criteria defined&#xD;
             above or below will need to be met for the screening portion, since FA deficient&#xD;
             patients identified by screening may meet eligibility criteria for the clinical trial&#xD;
             at a later time; (e.g., patient is undergoing standard of care treatment at the time&#xD;
             of the screening); separate written consents for screening and for the clinical trial&#xD;
             will be obtained from patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Up to two chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease are allowed; in addition, prior&#xD;
             adjuvant/neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, molecular targeted therapy or&#xD;
             estrogen receptor B (Erb) inhibitor treatments (e.g., erlotinib, Herceptin, sorafenib,&#xD;
             sunitinib) will be allowed and will not count towards eligibility; at least 4 weeks&#xD;
             must elapse since prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy (two weeks for erlotinib,&#xD;
             hormonal therapy, or limited field palliative radiation to bone, brain, or&#xD;
             radiosurgery), 6 weeks if the last regimen included nitrosoureas or mitomycin C;&#xD;
             previous use of mitomycin C would be restricted to topical applications (bladder&#xD;
             cancer) or chemoembolization (e.g., liver tumors)&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Same eligibility as above, except that they will have no limitations related&#xD;
                  prior number of chemotherapy regimens given; patients could have received prior&#xD;
