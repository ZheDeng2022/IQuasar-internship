      The purpose of this study is to compare the feasibility, safety, efficacy and ease of&#xD;
      performance of a video-assisted PCT (via an endotracheal tube embedded with a mini&#xD;
      video-camera) with the standard (&quot;blind&quot;) PCT technique.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percutaneous tracheostomy (PCT) is commonly used in critically-ill patients who require&#xD;
      long-term mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU). While being effective and&#xD;
      safe, this technique has some complications. These include paratracheal insertion of the&#xD;
      tracheostomy tube, tracheal injury; puncturing the cuff and transfixing the endotracheal tube&#xD;
      (ETT) during the transtracheal needle insertion; inserting the guide wire through Murphy's&#xD;
      eye; or accidental extubation while withdrawing the endotracheal tube during the procedure&#xD;
      leading to loss of the airway [1-6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although using the fingertip to palpate the trachea and endotracheal tube is a useful&#xD;
      technique to locate the tip of the endotracheal tube during the procedure, it is unreliable,&#xD;
      particularly in patients with short and thick necks. There are reports of lower rates of&#xD;
      acute complications under endoscopic (bronchoscopic) guidance [7-11]. However, there is no&#xD;
      adequate controlled study showing that endoscopic-guided tracheostomy is superior to the&#xD;
      'blind' one. Moreover, it is an expensive tool which is not readily available in some&#xD;
      centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video guidance provides a cost-effective alternative to bronchoscopes, that may also reduce&#xD;
      the risk of procedure-related complications such as paratracheal insertion of the&#xD;
      tracheostomy tube, tracheal injury or cuff puncture [12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and operability of video-guided&#xD;
      PCT compared with standard PCT. Video-guided PCT, a bedside safe and simple technique that&#xD;
      can be performed in the ICU without the assistance of a pulmonologist, may overcome some of&#xD;
      the limitations of the standard percutaneous tracheostomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique is based on the ETView TVTTM, a commercially available ETT, embedded with a&#xD;
      mini video-camera at the tip of the tube. It provides direct endoscopic visualization of the&#xD;
      larynx and tracheal mucosa, and thereafter allows the determination of the tip of the&#xD;
      transtracheal needle during percutaneous puncture of the trachea, and hence may reduce the&#xD;
      likelihood of paratracheal insertion, tracheal injury, or other technical complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ETView TVTTM device is compatible with any medical grade NTSC video monitor, thereby it&#xD;
      provides monitoring of the airways during the intubation and PCT procedure, as well as&#xD;
      continuous viewing of the airways as long as mechanical ventilation is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives To compare video-guided PCT to the standard technique in terms of success&#xD;
      rate, efficacy, safety, and outcomes..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The study will be conducted as a comparative, semi-blinded, matched one&#xD;
      (according to sex, age and difficult airway - that will be assessed according to neck&#xD;
      diameter and anatomical parameters). The setting will be the ICU of the Sourasky medical&#xD;
      center. 60 consecutive adult critically ill patients who require elective tracheostomy will&#xD;
      be recruited for the study. Informed consent will be obtained from the families or next of&#xD;
      kin of all study patients. In the absence of relatives, consent will be given by an&#xD;
      anesthesiologist/intensivist not related to the study. Both procedures will be performed by&#xD;
      the same team of intensivists upon all study patients. During and following the procedure we&#xD;
      will assess all of the parameters mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure will be performed by an ICU team which includes: an&#xD;
      anesthesiologist/intensivist who executes the procedure, another anesthesiologist who applies&#xD;
      anesthetics &amp; analgesia, a nurse, and a forth person who takes time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the procedures (either standard PCT or video-guided PCT) oxygen saturation, end tidal&#xD;
      carbon dioxide (ETCO2), ECG, blood pressure, and arterial blood gases will be monitored&#xD;
      continuously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The video-guided PCT procedure requires extubation and re-intubation with the TVTTM tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Re-intubation with the TVTTM tube will be performed as any commonly practiced intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ETView Tracheoscopic system (TVTTM) consists of an ETT, embedded with a video imaging&#xD;
      device and a light source at its tip and an integrated cable with a connector, that may be&#xD;
      wired to any video monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The imaging system will be used to monitor the airways while intubating and, beyond the vocal&#xD;
      cords, to locate the transtracheal insertion site and needle. In addition, the light source&#xD;
      will serve for transillumination of the neck soft tissues, in order to delineate the tracheal&#xD;
      curvature and identify anatomical deviations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia and analgesia will be routinely performed, and standardized for all the study&#xD;
      patients. Low doses of the opiate fentanyl (2-3 μg/kg) and the short-acting sedative propofol&#xD;
      (20 mg bolus, and 3-6mg/kg/h drip) will be administered at the beginning of the procedure.&#xD;
      Rocuronium bromide, a brief acting muscle paralyzer, 0.6mg/kg, will also be used in most&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      The executing physician will answer a questionnaire evaluating the intraprocedural&#xD;
      difficulties, complications, feasibility, confidence, and operability. A second physician,&#xD;
      blinded to the procedure performed, will monitor the study patients during the first 6h after&#xD;
      the procedure, or until discharge. Follow-up will include documentation of any&#xD;
      procedure-related complications, monitoring of respiratory/ventilatory parameters and length&#xD;
      of stay (LOS) in the ICU beyond 6h (due to medical circumstances related to the procedure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study patients will be placed with arterial lines through which we withdraw blood before&#xD;
      and after the procedure, and when indicated by deterioration of respiratory parameters - for&#xD;
      blood gas analyses (PaO2/FiO2, PaCO2, pH and BE). In addition, saturation will be documented&#xD;
      hourly, and all patients will have chest x-rays performed immediately following tracheostomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed by the frequency of procedure-related complications. These include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Technical complications: False route/paratracheal insertion, injury to a thoracic vessel,&#xD;
      tracheal/laryngeal/esophageal injury, accidental decannulation, puncturing the cuff,&#xD;
      inserting the guide wire through Murphy's eye, malpositioning or kinking of the tracheal&#xD;
      cannula, failed tracheostomy, multiple punctures (≥3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Clinical complications potentially related to the procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      B.1. Intraprocedural: endotracheal bleeding (&gt;100cc) and transfusion requirements (RBC, FFP&#xD;
      or platelets), transient hypoxia/hypoxemia, hemodynamic changes (e.g., transient hypotension&#xD;
      not related to anesthetics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B.2. Postprocedure: alterations in respiratory function (defined as &gt;15% reduction in&#xD;
      saturation or PaO2/FiO2, compared to baseline; Increased PaCO2 without change in saturation;&#xD;
      the need to change ventilatory settings and/or add PEEP within the first 24 hrs),&#xD;
      atelectasis, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, aspiration, early unexplained mortality (within&#xD;
      the first 24 hrs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operability will be evaluated via a questionnaire answered by the executing intensivist&#xD;
      (enclosed within proposal documents). The main parameters they will be asked to evaluate will&#xD;
      be: whether the transtracheal needle was recognized via the TVTTM (yes/no); intraoperative&#xD;
      difficulties; number of technical complications; level of confidence; ease of performance&#xD;
      (&quot;best practice&quot;); and need to convert to surgical tracheostomy procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, another member of the team will measure operative time, which includes the total&#xD;
      duration of the procedure; the time it took to recognize the tracheal insertion site and&#xD;
      needle; and the time to perform the PCT, that we define as the time since ETT placement until&#xD;
      successful tracheal placement is confirmed via air bubbles or ETCO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study size&#xD;
&#xD;
      A power analysis for time to perform the PCT as the primary endpoint, with 80% power to&#xD;
      detect a 5 minute reduction in this outcome and significance of 0.05 or greater, indicates&#xD;
      that at least 17 patients would be required in each group. We wish to enroll 30 patients for&#xD;
      each group.&#xD;
