  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      XMT-1107 has been shown in nonclinical studies to slow the growth of tumors. These effects&#xD;
      may result from blocking the growth of new blood vessels that help the tumors survive.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, ascending-dose study of XMT-1107 administered intravenously over 90&#xD;
      minutes every 21 days (1 cycle). Blood sampling for PK analyses will be performed immediately&#xD;
      prior to dosing and after dosing. Adverse events will be graded according to the National&#xD;
      Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0)&#xD;
