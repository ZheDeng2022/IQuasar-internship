    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the Giro-couch, an innovative patient support device&#xD;
      for the application of prone RT for treatment of breast cancer. This study will assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of a new positioning approach to facilitate the delivery of external beam,&#xD;
      delivered to the lumpectomy cavity, (the boost dose, partial breast therapy).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatments are applied with the subject in the supine position, in ~50 Gy per treatment (~2GY&#xD;
      per fraction), over a period of five to six weeks. Energy in use is usually 6-15MV photons.&#xD;
      Following the whole breast irradiation, a boost dose is given to the lumpectomy cavity, in&#xD;
      order to further reduce the local recurrences in the immediate vicinity of the treated&#xD;
      breast. The boost dose is usually applied with electrons, 6-18MEV. Sixteen Gy is the usual&#xD;
      dose, 2 Gy/Fx, for 8 fractions.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women who satisfy all of the following conditions are the only patients who will be&#xD;
        eligible for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must consent to be in the study and must have signed an approved consent&#xD;
             form conforming to federal and institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be ≥ 40 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must have stage I or II breast cancer. If stage II, the tumor size must be&#xD;
             3 cm or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surgical treatment of the breast must have been lumpectomy. The margins of the&#xD;
             resected specimen must be at least 2mm. Re-excision of surgical margins is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gross disease must be unifocal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The target lumpectomy cavity must be clearly delineated and the target lumpectomy&#xD;
             cavity/whole breast reference volume must be ≤ 30% based on the treatment planning CT&#xD;
             scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The lumpectomy cavity must be delineated with surgical clips by the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are eligible if, based on the postoperative/ simulation CT scan, prone boost&#xD;
             RT is judged to be technically deliverable by a prone breast IMRT-IGRT technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of non-breast malignancies are eligible if they have been&#xD;
             disease-free for 5 or more years prior to randomization and are deemed by their&#xD;
             physician to be at low risk for recurrence. Patients with the following cancers are&#xD;
             eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: carcinoma in situ of the&#xD;
             cervix, carcinoma in situ of the colon, melanoma in situ, and basal cell and squamous&#xD;
             cell carcinoma of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men are not eligible for this study. Women with one or more of the following&#xD;
             conditions also are ineligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  T0, T2 (&gt; 3.0 cm), T3, stage III, or stage IV breast cancer (see Appendix A for TNM&#xD;
             nomenclature and staging).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suspicious microcalcifications, densities, or palpable abnormalities (in the&#xD;
             ipsilateral or contralateral breast) unless biopsied and found to be benign.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-epithelial breast malignancies such as sarcoma or lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Proven multicentric carcinoma (invasive cancer or DCIS) in more than one quadrant or&#xD;
             separated by 4 or more centimeters.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Paget's disease of the nipple.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Synchronous bilateral invasive or non-invasive breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surgical margins that cannot be microscopically assessed or are positive at pathologic&#xD;
             evaluation. (If surgical margins are rendered free of disease by re-excision, the&#xD;
             patient is eligible.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clear delineation of the extent of the target lumpectomy cavity not possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Breast implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior breast or thoracic RT for any condition&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Collagen vascular disease, specifically dermatomyositis, systemic lupus erythematosis,&#xD;
             or scleroderma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or lactation at the time of proposed randomization. Women of reproductive&#xD;
             potential must agree to use an effective non-hormonal method of contraception during&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other conditions that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, would preclude the patient from meeting the study requirements.&#xD;
