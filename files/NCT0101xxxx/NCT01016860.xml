      This study plans to learn more about an investigational drug called OSI-906. OSI-906 is being&#xD;
      looked at to see if it could be a treatment for advanced cancer. &quot;The FDA is the U.S.&#xD;
      government agency that reviews the results of research of drugs and decides if it can be sold&#xD;
      in the U.S. OSI-906 has been given to over 185 people with cancer.&#xD;

      This study plans to learn more about an investigational drug called OSI-906. OSI-906 is being&#xD;
      looked at to see if it could be a treatment for advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will also receive a drug called irinotecan (also called Camptosar®). This drug is&#xD;
      FDA approved for the treatment of metastatic colon cancer and some other types of cancer. The&#xD;
      study drug and irinotecan have never been tested together in humans. It is unknown if the&#xD;
      combination will be safe and/or effective in the treatment of human cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find the answers to the following research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the highest dose of the study drug that can be given to subjects in combination&#xD;
           with irinotecan without causing side effects that are too severe?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How is the combination of the study drug and irinotecan handled in the blood of subjects&#xD;
           with advanced cancer? Does either the study drug or irinotecan have an effect on how the&#xD;
           other works?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What are the most common side effects of the study drug and irinotecan when given&#xD;
           together to subjects with advanced cancer?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is the combination of the study drug and irinotecan effective in stopping the growth or&#xD;
           shrinking the size of your tumor?&#xD;

    <description>Dose Escalation Phase: Treatment for Cycle 1 will commence on Day -3 of a 21-day cycle (3 weeks) when a single dose OSI-906 is given with full pharmacokinetics(PK) sampling at predetermined time points. Irinotecan will be administered intravenously over 90 minutes on Day 1 and Day 8 with full PK sampling on Day 1. The institution of oral dosing of OSI-906 2-4, 8-10, 15-17 (for cycle 1 only) will be given followed by full PK sampling of both drugs on Day 8. Pre-dose samples of OSI-906 will be drawn on Cycle 1 Days 8, 10, 15, 17 and Cycle 2 Days 1, 8, 10, 15 and 17. For Cycle 2 and thereafter, both drugs will be administered starting on Day 1.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Dose Escalation Phase: Histological or cytopathological diagnosis of an advanced cancer&#xD;
        that is refractory to standard therapy or for which no standard therapy exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Irinotecan must be listed in the Compendia for reimbursement, ie. colorectal cancer; lung&#xD;
        cancer; gastric; esophageal, cervical and ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cohort Expansion Phase: Histological or cytopathological diagnosis of advanced&#xD;
             colorectal cancer with known Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) mutation status. All patients&#xD;
             must have received and progressed or be intolerable of first-line therapy with an&#xD;
             oxaliplatin-containing regimen. Patients must be screened using the OSI-906 integrated&#xD;
             classifier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cohort 1 (12 patients): Window of opportunity cohort: Patients with a score of at&#xD;
             least 4 out of 5 by the OSI-906 integrated classifier who are irinotecan-naive will&#xD;
             receive OSI-906 as a single agent until disease progression. Patients must be non&#xD;
             surgically resectable or not a surgical candidate because of comorbid conditions. At&#xD;
             disease progression, if the patient had a best response of at least stable disease for&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Cohort 2: (16 patients: 8 KRAS wild-type (WT) and 8 KRAS Mutant(MT). Patients who have&#xD;
             score of less than 4 by the OSI-906 integrated classifier will have OSI-906 added to&#xD;
             irinotecan on disease progression to irinotecan (patients that are KRAS WT will have&#xD;
             received cetuximab with irinotecan). Patients who are treated in the dose escalation&#xD;
             phase at the recommended phase II dose of the combination and meet the criteria for&#xD;
             Cohort 2 of the expanded phase may be counted towards the dose expansion patient&#xD;

        treatment and start of treatment. Patients must have recovered from any treatment-related&#xD;
        toxicities (except for alopecia, fatigue, and grade 1 neurotoxicity) prior to start of&#xD;
        treatment.&#xD;

        discontinued prior to start of treatment. However, patients with prostate cancer with&#xD;
        evidence of progressive disease may continue on therapy that produces medical castration&#xD;
        (eg, goserelin or leuprorelin), provided this therapy was commenced at least 3 months&#xD;
        earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Radiation: Patients may have had prior radiation therapy provided they have recovered from&#xD;
        the acute, toxic effects of radiotherapy prior to start of treatment. A minimum of 21 days&#xD;
