      Aim: This is a longitudinal cohort study to assess long-term clinical outcome of patients who&#xD;
      were admitted in our institution for a first episode of uncomplicated sigmoid diverticulitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: All patients who were diagnosed with a first episode of sigmoid diverticulitis will&#xD;
      be evaluated for inclusion in the study, pending informed consent. Those patients who have&#xD;
      evidence of complicated diverticulitis (fistula, abscess) will receive a recommendation to&#xD;
      undergo elective sigmoid resection, while those who have a simple attack will be recruited in&#xD;
      the cohort. Follow-up will be performed at yearly intervals through telephone interview with&#xD;
      the patient. The duration of study is expected to last 10 years (2010-2020), with &gt;50 new&#xD;
      patients/year, for a total of &gt;500 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the occurrence of a second episode of diverticulitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. severity and outcome of recurrent diverticulitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. evolution in digestive symptoms and quality of life (QoL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. need for subsequent elective or emergency sigmoid resection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: This study will help in determining the risk/benefit of the current approach for&#xD;
      this common condition, which is to manage patients conservatively with antibiotics and adopt&#xD;
      a wait-and-see attitude. Specifically, the following events will be assessed quantitatively:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the rate of relapse in an urban community.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the burden of this common disease on QoL and digestive function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the percentage of patients who may need emergency surgery&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Colonic diverticulosis is an increasingly common condition in the Western societies; in our&#xD;
      country, a third of the population is affected by the 6th decade and two-thirds by the 9th&#xD;
      decade. Fortunately, a majority of patients with diverticulosis remain asymptomatic;&#xD;
      diverticulitis, the most common presentation of diverticular disease, has an estimated&#xD;
      incidence of 10 patients per 100,000/year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of sigmoid diverticulitis is usually suspected clinically in a patient&#xD;
      presenting with acute lower abdominal pain, associated with an inflammatory syndrome with&#xD;
      elevated CRP and/or leukocytes count. The preferred imaging modality to establish definitive&#xD;
      diagnosis is computerized tomography (CT) scan with triple (oral, intravenous and&#xD;
      intra-rectal) administration of contrast. CT scan may also influence management by&#xD;
      demonstrating whether sigmoid diverticulitis is simple (phlegmonous, showing an infiltration&#xD;
      of pericolic fat and a thickening of intestinal wall) or complicated (abscess, fistula or&#xD;
      peritonitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A majority of patients present with simple diverticulitis, and will be conservatively and&#xD;
      successfully managed with antibiotics alone. Full colonoscopy is performed eventually, in&#xD;
      order to rule out an associated condition, most notably cancer and Crohn's disease. Colonic&#xD;
      diverticular disease is usually restricted to the sigmoid colon, and conservative treatment&#xD;
      with antibiotics is indicated in cases of a first attack of uncomplicated diverticulitis, the&#xD;
      rationale being that a majority of patients treated for a first episode of acute inflammation&#xD;
      will eventually recover and have no further problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elective sigmoidectomy is currently recommended in the following clinical situations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who had two episodes of uncomplicated diverticulitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who had one episode of complicated (perforated) diverticulitis, with either&#xD;
           pericolic of pelvic abscesses (Hinchey stage I and II respectively), fistula formation&#xD;
           and/or stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These guidelines, however, reflect expert consensus rather than scientific evidence;&#xD;
      currently, there is no way to predict for each patient the risk for developing subsequent&#xD;
      complications and recurrences. Thus, the important question is to determine whether a&#xD;
      conservative approach is not simply delaying definitive treatment and expose patients to&#xD;
      additional complications and alterations in quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to assess the natural history of sigmoid diverticulitis&#xD;
      in a cohort of patients living in an urban community, who had radiological and endoscopic&#xD;
      evidence of diverticular disease, who benefited initially from adequate antibiotherapy,&#xD;
      received dietary counselling, and were followed for a long period of time. In order to do&#xD;
      that, we will assess prospectively the following variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1. Primary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Annual rate of recurrent diverticulitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severity and timing of recurrent episodes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of Life and gastrointestinal symptoms assessed with the GIQLI questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2. Secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Risk for undergoing emergency surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical morbidity/mortality&#xD;

        This cohort study is designed in order to detect recurrent episodes of diverticulitis in a&#xD;
        population of patients who were previously admitted in our institution for a first episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4.1. Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
        The cohort will consist in the population of patients with CT-scan demonstrated,&#xD;
        endoscopy-proven sigmoid diverticulitis who will be admitted in the Department of Surgery&#xD;
        of the University Hospital Geneva from January 1st, 2010 to December 31st, 2019. At&#xD;
        baseline, participants are between the ages of 18 and 90, and medical information will be&#xD;
        updated every year until the end of follow-up, which is December 31st, 2020.&#xD;
