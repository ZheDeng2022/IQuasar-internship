    <textblock>
      Patients in Intensive Care Units are often extremely thirsty due to their medicines, illness,&#xD;
      treatments or medicines that they receive. This study will test whether patients who receive&#xD;
      a easy to implement intervention for thirst will have greater relief from thirst than a group&#xD;
      of patients who do not receive the intervention. The study will also identify the most&#xD;
      important factors that make ICU patients thirsty so that future research studies can test how&#xD;
      to relieve those factors and/or make interventions for thirst more readily available.&#xD;

      This study will test the efficacy of an innovative, inexpensive, resource-efficient treatment&#xD;
      for thirst -- one of the most pervasive, intense, unrecognized, and under-treated symptoms&#xD;
      suffered by critically ill patients in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). The first aim of this&#xD;
      single-blinded, randomized clinical trial is to test a non-pharmacologic intervention for&#xD;
      thirst in ICU patients. The intervention is a combination therapy treatment (CTT) for thirst&#xD;
      that includes the use of sterile water mouth sprays, sterile water swabs, and menthol-based&#xD;
      lip and tongue moisturizer. The second aim of the study is to examine demographic,&#xD;
      environmental, and health and illness factors that increase an ICU patient's risk profile for&#xD;
      thirst. Aim #1 hypotheses: (1) Thirst intensity and distress will decrease significantly in&#xD;
      ICU patients who receive a CTT for thirst compared to those who receive research team&#xD;
      observation. (2) Subjective (e.g., dry mouth) and objective (e.g., cracked lips)&#xD;
      thirst-related characteristics will decrease significantly in ICU patients who receive a CCT&#xD;
      for thirst compared to those who receive research team observation. Aim #2 hypotheses: (1) A&#xD;
      significant association will be found between presence of thirst and certain risk factors for&#xD;
      thirst, e.g., serum osmolality, hydration status, and administration of certain medications,&#xD;
      e.g., opioids. (2) A significant association will be found between the intensity of thirst&#xD;
      and certain risk factors for thirst, e.g., serum osmolality, hydration status, and&#xD;
      administration of certain medications, e.g., opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample will be 245 ICU patients in one Experimental and two Control groups. Those with&#xD;
      thirst will be randomized to either the Experimental or the Control 1 group. The Experimental&#xD;
      group will receive the CTT; the Control 1 group will receive research team observation. The&#xD;
      Control 2 group patients who reported no thirst will be compared to the Control 1 group on&#xD;
      characteristics associated with the presence and intensity of thirst.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multilevel linear regression models will be employed to test the difference in the linear&#xD;
      change trajectories between the treatment and control groups. Multiple logistic regression&#xD;
      analysis and multiple linear regression analysis will be used to determine association of&#xD;
      risk factors with the presence and intensity of thirst, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will contribute empirical data needed to stimulate a far overdue nursing practice&#xD;
      change for the treatment of thirst in ICUs. Results will also identify a risk profile for&#xD;
      thirst that will be an important target for future research of thirst in ICU patients.&#xD;
