    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ILV-095 when&#xD;
      it is given to individuals with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Another purpose&#xD;
      of the study is to observe how the drug enters the blood and tissues over time, how the body&#xD;
      breaks down the drug and whether or not the body will develop an immune reaction&#xD;
      (sensitivity) to the drug.&#xD;

      B1991002 study is a phase 1 adaptive design study which terminated on 14Mar2011. Regular&#xD;
      analyzes of psoriasis assessments conducted per the statistical plan indicate that even if&#xD;
      every patient enrolled for the rest of the study respond (up to 23 additional subjects), the&#xD;
      study can not meet its primary efficacy endpoint. Pfizer Inc. has terminated the trial and&#xD;
      clinical team is asking all clinical investigators to continue collecting safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics data until the last subject last visit for all subjects&#xD;
      who received test article. Last Subject Last Visit occurred 20May2011.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexually active men or women must agree to use a medically acceptable form of&#xD;
             contraception during the study and continue it for 16 weeks after investigational&#xD;
             product administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative urine pregnancy test result for all women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (BMI) &gt;=18 kg/m2 and body weight &gt;=50 kg. BMI is calculated by taking&#xD;
             the subject's weight, in kilograms, divided by the square of the subject's height, in&#xD;
             meters, at screening: BMI = weight (kg)/(height [m]).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must meet the following criteria for disease activity, at screening and/or at study&#xD;
             entry (subjects who washout from prior therapy may not meet this level of disease&#xD;
             activity at screening but must before being entered into the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have stable moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis covering &gt;=15% of body&#xD;
             surface area and be a candidate for systemic therapy or phototherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score of &gt;11.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Physician Global Assessment (PGA) of psoriasis score &gt;=3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Target lesion score &gt;=6 based on the physician rating of selected sites for erythema,&#xD;
             plaque elevation and scaling, with a minimum of 2 on the plaque elevation score.&#xD;
             A-12-point score will be used with a 1-4 scale for each domain. Target lesions should&#xD;
             not be on the scalp, axillae, face, or groin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence or history of any disorder that may prevent the successful completion of the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of unstable clinically significant disease (eg, unstable cardiovascular,&#xD;
             renal, respiratory, or psychiatric disease or any serious disorder that currently&#xD;
             requires physician care).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute disease state (eg, nausea, vomiting, fever, or diarrhea) within 7 days before&#xD;
             study day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of skin conditions (eg, eczema) other than psoriasis that would interfere&#xD;
             with evaluations of the effect of study medication on psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of guttate, erythrodermic, or pustular psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active severe infections within 4 weeks before study day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic malignancy within the past 5 years including melanoma. Treated skin cancer&#xD;
             (basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma) is excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Evidence of latent tuberculosis by purified protein derivative (PPD) screening. PPD&#xD;
        screening should be performed according to local standards using the tuberculin skin test&#xD;
        (TST). Any result &gt;5mm is considered positive. Prior Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) should&#xD;
        not be taken into account when interpreting a TST result. TST must be performed during the&#xD;
        screening period unless one has been performed within the previous 3 months and the results&#xD;
        are available.&#xD;
