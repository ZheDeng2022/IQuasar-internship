      A Study Of The Effect Of Hemodialysis Vascular Access Type On Markers Of Inflammation PI:&#xD;
      Michele H. Mokrzycki MD, MS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction/Background: The prevalence of chronic inflammation is high (35-65%) in end stage&#xD;
      renal disease (ESRD) patients and is associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis,&#xD;
      and overall and cardiovascular mortality in this population.(1-4) Stenvinkel et al observed&#xD;
      that a pre-HD C-reactive protein (CRP) level of &gt;10 was associated with a higher prevalence&#xD;
      of carotid plaques (p&lt;0.01), and clinical manifestations atherosclerotic cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (MI, CVA, PVD) (p&lt;0.05) in the ESRD population. (1) Zimmerman et al report a 2.7-fold&#xD;
      and 4.6-fold higher risk of 2 yr all-cause mortality associated with a CRP level between&#xD;
      7.5-15.7. and &gt;15.7, respectively. The cardiovascular mortality was similar (2.9-fold, and&#xD;
      5.5-fold). A single elevated CRP level has been shown to be a powerful indicator of mortality&#xD;
      in ESRD patients, even after 4-5 years of follow-up. (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRP is a sensitive major acute phase protein, synthesized by hepatocytes under&#xD;
      transcriptional control by IL-6. In the presence of human serum, CRP induces the expression&#xD;
      of MCP-1, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and E-selectin. (5). The interaction of CRP with monocytes in vitro&#xD;
      results in the release of IL-1 β, IL-6, TNF-α, and tissue factor.(6)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The origin of inflammation in the ESRD population is unclear, although the HD session per se&#xD;
      has been implicated. Korevaar et al studied the effect of the HD session on CRP level and&#xD;
      mortality in 186 pts. (7) Thirty-eight % of patients had a CRP level below detection (&lt;3&#xD;
      mg/L), and in those patients with detectable CRP levels pre-HD 37% had no increase with HD,&#xD;
      and 25% of patients had an increase (mean +2.3 (0.6-9.2)) in CRP level (adjusted for change&#xD;
      in blood volume) during HD. There was no difference in pre-HD CRP level between the latter 2&#xD;
      groups. A lower 2 yr survival was observed in the group in which CRP increased during HD, (44&#xD;
      vs. 66%, p=0.09). After adjusting for nutritional factors, age, comorbidity and primary&#xD;
      kidney disease, a rise of 1 mg/dl in CRP during a HD session, was associated with an increase&#xD;
      in mortality risk of 9% (Adjusted hazard ratio 1.09, 95%CI=1.09-1.16) Independent predictors&#xD;
      of high CRP levels during HD include patient age (β=0.07, p=0.05), pre-HD CRP (β=0.95,&#xD;
      p&lt;0.01), 2 needle dialysis (β=2.39, p=0.05, and cholesterol ((β= -0.92, p=0.04).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional possible reasons for increased markers of inflammation in the ESRD population&#xD;
      include 1) uremia-related alterations in immune/host defense systems, specifically increased&#xD;
      cytokine production, 2) increased oxidative stress (oxidized-LDL), advanced glycation end&#xD;
      products (AGEs) 3) the dialysis membrane (IL-6 and IL-1 β production by certain membranes),&#xD;
      4) contaminated dialysate, [ultrapure dialysate reduces CRP levels],5) intercurrent clinical&#xD;
      events, 6) and occult arteriovenous graft infection, 7) protein-energy malnutrition, and 8)&#xD;
      shorter time on hemodialysis (HD). (8-13). None of the above CRP associated mortality studies&#xD;
      controlled for type of vascular access. There are reports of an association of vascular&#xD;
      access type with other markers of inflammation. Kaysen et al report an association between&#xD;
      low levels of serum albumin with presence of an AVG, and Thadani et al recently reported&#xD;
      elevated WBC count and hemocatheters (14,15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polkinghorne et al studied the effect of vascular access in incident hemodialysis patients on&#xD;
      all-cause mortality using multivariate analysis.(16) In this adjusted analysis, catheter use&#xD;
      and AVGs were associated with significant excess mortality. Compared to AVFs, catheters were&#xD;
      associated with a 3.3-fold higher and AVGs with a 1.6-fold higher all-cause mortality after&#xD;
      120 days. However, the authors speculate that, in part, this may due to the higher risk of&#xD;
      infections. In fact the risk of infectious death was 1.7-fold higher with AVGs, and 2.7 fold&#xD;
      higher with catheters. The risk of the type of vascular access with inflammation, independent&#xD;
      of infection, is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question/Objective: To determine if the type of HD vascular access correlates with&#xD;
      markers of inflammation, namely CRP and IL-6, and with both access and patient survival in&#xD;
      the ESRD population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: A prospective study using a multiple group design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Incident ESRD patients. Patients with Stage IV and V (GFR &lt;30 ml/min using MDRD mod&#xD;
      equation) will be recruited from the renal clinics and private practices. Sites include both&#xD;
      the Moses and Weiler campuses of the Montefiore Medical Center in Bronx, NY. Type of vascular&#xD;
      access to be inserted will be determined on clinical grounds by the patient's nephrologist&#xD;
      and access surgeon, these include hemocatheter, arteriovenous graft, and arteriovenous&#xD;
      fistula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures: Blood samples (10 cc) will be drawn immediately (within 24 hours) prior to&#xD;
      access surgery, and 1 week, and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months, and upon dialysis initiation.(6&#xD;
      samples per subject over 1 year) Once the patient is on hemodialysis the blood samples will&#xD;
      be drawn pre-HD via the access. Samples will be centrifuged immediately (3000 rpm x 10&#xD;
      minutes), cooled within 1 hour, and stored at -80 degrees C. Pre-dialysis samples will be&#xD;
      tested for high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP) TNF-α and IL-6 (both ELISA assay,&#xD;
      plasma by sandwich-type immunoassay) levels. Patient demographic and other clinical data will&#xD;
      be recorded, This includes age, race, sex, body surface area, DM, SLE and other connective&#xD;
      tissue diseases, malignancy, history of atherosclerotic diseases (CAD, PVD, CVA), active&#xD;
      infection, history of viral infection with hepatitis B or C, human immunodeficiency virus.&#xD;
      Routine monthly lab results drawn pre-dialysis as part of clinical practice will be recorded,&#xD;
      these include serum albumin, complete blood count, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen,&#xD;
      creatinine, liver function tests, and lipid profile. Medications will be reviewed for the&#xD;
      presence of ACE-Inhibitors, ARBs, aspirin, NSAIDS, statins. A subjective global assessment&#xD;
      score (SGA) and comorbidity risk score will be performed. (17,18) Date of HD initiation, and&#xD;
      type of HD membrane will be recorded. Clinical events after vascular access surgery will be&#xD;
      monitored, including infection, hospitalization (reason), MI, CVA. Outcomes to be recorded&#xD;
      will include access survival (primary and secondary patency), patient mortality (all-cause,&#xD;
      infectious and cardiovascular).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management and Analysis: Differences in hs-CRP, TNF-α and IL-6 levels between the 3&#xD;
      vascular access groups for all time periods (baseline, 1 week, 1, 3, 6,12 months) will be&#xD;
      analyzed using a random effects (mixed) model, with time as a random effect. A Power analysis&#xD;
      was performed by Kathrine Freeman, PhD in the Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology at&#xD;
      Montefiore Medical Center, using multiple comparisons between groups. We hypothesize a 100%&#xD;
      increase in hsCRP level from baseline in the catheter group and a 10% increase in the AVF&#xD;
      group. We predict that the AVG group will have an increase in hs CRP between 10-100%. The&#xD;
      initial power analysis (80%, 2-tailed α=0.05) predicted that 51 subjects per group would be&#xD;
      needed. Anticipating a 20% dropout rate per year, we will recruit 61 subjects will be&#xD;
      required in each group. All hsCRP data will be transformed, most likely using a log scale, as&#xD;
      per prior studies and upon review of the distribution of the data. Dunnett's multiple&#xD;
      comparison procedure will be performed for the 2 contrasts (each group, ie. the AVF and AVG&#xD;
      groups, compared with the tunneled catheter group. A multivariate analysis using a mixed&#xD;
      effects model will be performed to determine the factors related to a change in CRP level at&#xD;
      baseline and at 1 week, 3, 6, 12 months. Patient and access survival will be analyzed using&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood specimens will be stored in a -70 freezer in Dr. Joel Neugarten's lab, Moses 6th floor&#xD;
      laboratories. Patient charts will be coded and stored in a locked file cabinet in Dr.&#xD;
      Mokrzycki's office, Centennial 4th floor at Montefiore Medical Center. One of the&#xD;
      co-investigators will perform the sandwich immunoassays for hsCRP, TNF-α and IL-6 in Dr.&#xD;
      Victor Schuster's lab, Ullman Building 6th floor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation plan/timetable: Enrollment of subjects by Dr. Mala Sachdeva, and Peter Durkin,&#xD;
      PA will begin once the protocol has been approved by the IRB. The sites of patient&#xD;
      identification and enrollment, and baseline specimens will be the Renal Clinics at Montefiore&#xD;
      and Weiler Hospitals, and from the Renal Faculty practices. Follow-up specimens will be drawn&#xD;
      at the above sites, while the patients are pre-hemodialysis, and will be drawn before the&#xD;
      dialysis session for patients already receiving hemodialysis. Both preliminary and follow-up&#xD;
      data entry will be performed by Dr. Mala Sachdeva using SPSS. Patient charts/records and&#xD;
      specimens will be coded to ensure confidentiality. Specimens and charts will be stored as&#xD;
      described above. Data analysis will be performed by Dr. Mokrzycki, Dr. Sachdeva and Dr&#xD;
      Kathrine Freeman. The anticipated duration of the study is 3 years: approximately 2 years for&#xD;
      patient enrollment and 1 year of follow-up data and time for data analysis.&#xD;
