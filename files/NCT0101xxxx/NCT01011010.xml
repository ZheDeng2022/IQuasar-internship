      RATIONALE: Sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride and mitomycin, work in different ways to stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.&#xD;
      Chemoembolization kills tumor cells by carrying drugs directly into the tumor and blocking&#xD;
      the blood flow to the tumor. Giving sorafenib tosylate together with chemoembolization may&#xD;
      kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of sorafenib tosylate when given&#xD;
      together with chemoembolization with doxorubicin hydrochloride and mitomycin in treating&#xD;
      patients with liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety of sorafenib tosylate when given in combination with&#xD;
           transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) comprising doxorubicin hydrochloride and&#xD;
           mitomycin C in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the time to progression (TTP) in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the overall survival (OS) of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore correlative relationships between measures of serum VEGF in the&#xD;
           peri-procedure TACE period and changes with TACE and sorafenib tosylate as well as&#xD;
           patient outcomes (TTP and OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 1-14. Patients then undergo&#xD;
      transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) comprising doxorubicin hydrochloride and mitomycin C&#xD;
      on days 17-19*. Patients then receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily beginning after&#xD;
      recovery from TACE and continuing in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *A second course of TACE may be administered within 8 weeks after the first TACE&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples may be collected periodically for biomarker and pharmacokinetic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3-4 weeks and then every 3&#xD;
      months for up to 3 years.&#xD;
