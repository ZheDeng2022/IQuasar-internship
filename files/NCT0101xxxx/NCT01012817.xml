    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of veliparib and topotecan&#xD;
      hydrochloride and to see how well they work in treating patients with solid tumors, ovarian&#xD;
      cancer that has come back or does not respond to treatment, or primary peritoneal cancer.&#xD;
      Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as topotecan hydrochloride, work in different ways&#xD;
      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving veliparib with chemotherapy may kill&#xD;
      more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of veliparib (ABT-888) and&#xD;
      weekly topotecan (topotecan hydrochloride) in adult patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
      (Phase I) II. To identify any anti-tumor activity of this treatment combination, as assessed&#xD;
      by objective response in patients with advanced solid tumors. (Phase I) III. To assess the&#xD;
      confirmed response rate for patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer or&#xD;
      primary peritoneal carcinoma treated with the combination of ABT-888 and weekly topotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the progression free response (PFS) for patients with epithelial ovarian&#xD;
      cancer, fallopian tube cancer or primary peritoneal carcinoma treated with the combination of&#xD;
      ABT-888 and weekly topotecan. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify any pharmacokinetic interactions between ABT-888 and topotecan. (Phase I) II.&#xD;
      To determine whether topotecan stimulates adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose polymer&#xD;
      formation in circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells. (Phase I) III. To determine&#xD;
      whether ABT-888 inhibits basal or topotecan-stimulated ADP-ribose polymer formation. (Phase&#xD;
      I) IV. To assess differences in the toxicity and/or efficacy of this regimen based on BRCA&#xD;
      1/2 mutational status. (Phase II) V. To determine whether pretreatment tumor cell levels of&#xD;
      topoisomerase I, poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), BRCA1, BRCA2, XRCC1,&#xD;
      tyrosyl-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1), P-glycoprotein or breast&#xD;
      cancer resistance protein (BCRP) predict response to this regimen. (Phase II) VI. To&#xD;
      identify, in an exploratory manner, any transcriptional profiles that may predict response to&#xD;
      this regimen. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of veliparib and topotecan hydrochloride&#xD;
      followed by a phase II study. (PHASE I DOSE-ESCALATION PART IS COMPLETED)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17 (veliparib is omitted on&#xD;
      days 1-3 of course 2) and topotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days&#xD;
      2, 9, and 16. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 months (Phase I) or every&#xD;
      3 or 6 months for 5 years (Phase II).&#xD;
