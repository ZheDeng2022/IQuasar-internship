&#xD;
          -  Evidence of central retinal vein occlusion, defined as documented retinal hemorrhage&#xD;
             into all four quadrants with dilated veins, or branch retinal vein occlusion, as&#xD;
             documented on clinical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 years or over&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Visual acuity ranging from 20/8000 to 20/40&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Media clarity and patient cooperation sufficient to allow adequate testing utilizing&#xD;
             OCT and FA&#xD;
