  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis being studied is that add-on arrhythmia surgery in patients with atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation (AF) undergoing valvular or coronary surgery improves quality of life, is&#xD;
      cost-effective, reduces perioperative and long-term morbidity associated with AF.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is connected with an increased morbidity and mortality. In addition,&#xD;
      quality of life is diminished due to palpitations, dyspnea, dizziness and syncope. AF is&#xD;
      frequently associated with valvular and coronary disease. In the AF patients undergoing&#xD;
      valvular or coronary surgery the arrhythmia almost always relapses. For symptom control&#xD;
      anti-arrhythmic drugs and cardioversion are used but breakthrough arrhythmias and side&#xD;
      effects of the drugs happen frequently. For more effective symptom control &quot;add-on&quot;&#xD;
      arrhythmia surgery is being advocated. However, at present we do not know whether add-on&#xD;
      arrhythmia surgery indeed affects morbidity and quality of life. In this respect the benefit&#xD;
      of chronic sinus rhythm has to outweigh the risks of a prolonged operation. In addition,&#xD;
      cardiovascular complaints unrelated to AF may persist even after successful operation, thus&#xD;
      offsetting the benefit of chronic sinus rhythm. Add-on surgery is more costly than standard&#xD;
      surgery but this may compare favourably with shorter hospital admission due to less frequent&#xD;
      post-operative AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Valvular heart disease is frequently associated with ventricular remodelling: a decreased&#xD;
      ventricular function and atrial dilatation. AF itself may worsen heart failure due to a&#xD;
      tachycardiomyopathy. Elimination of AF might therefore enhance recovery from structural and&#xD;
      functional remodelling and promote recovery of quality of life after the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PIAF, RACE and AFFIRM have shown that chronic sinus rhythm is not necessarily associated&#xD;
      with a reduced morbidity or enhanced quality of life. PIAF however showed that exercise&#xD;
      tolerance was better when rhythm control was achieved. Further analyses of RACE and AFFIRM&#xD;
      are pending. One drawback of the above studies is the fact that chronic sinus rhythm is&#xD;
      difficult to obtain. In PIAF, RACE and AFFIRM only 30 to 50% was in sinus rhythm at the end&#xD;
      of follow-up. By contrast, arrhythmia surgery is a highly effective treatment in this&#xD;
      respect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty patients underwent a (phase 1-study) coronary bypass- or valve surgery with add-on&#xD;
      arrhythmia surgery in the same way as in this protocol proposed. This means epicardial on&#xD;
      beating heart and without use of the heart-lung machine. In the last follow-up 80 % of the&#xD;
      patients not longer were in atrial fibrillation. With similar treatment procedures, but more&#xD;
      invasive, so on the arrested heart and endo cardially, success percentages reported varying&#xD;
      from 60 % till 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This large variance in success rate is probably related to the primary course of the disease&#xD;
      and the degree of the morphological abnormality. In spite of these meaningful results&#xD;
      ''add-on'' arrhythmia surgery is no general accepted treatment. The intended patient&#xD;
      population remains generally untreated. Historical data of patients from the university&#xD;
      hospital of Maastricht show that no add on treatment has a success rate of 25% of patients in&#xD;
      sinus rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the above a randomised comparison of add-on arrhythmia surgery and standard&#xD;
      surgery is warranted.&#xD;
