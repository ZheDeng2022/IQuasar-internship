      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers are studying how humans are able to move our eyes to a remembered region&#xD;
           even when the target has disappeared. The ability to do this suggests that the brain can&#xD;
           keep track of where the eyes have looked, without an external target for continued&#xD;
           reference. This is called corollary discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other research has indicated that patients with schizophrenia might have difficulty&#xD;
           monitoring their eye movements. The corollary discharge process may be defective in&#xD;
           patients with schizophrenia, and perhaps delayed in time. Researchers have developed a&#xD;
           test to examine this possibility in the hope of learning more about schizophrenia and&#xD;
           eye movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To assess whether there is a defect in internal monitoring of eye movements in patients&#xD;
      with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals over 18 years of age who are able to give informed consent and are able to&#xD;
           concentrate on a 20-minute task that involves following projected targets and moving&#xD;
           their eyes to remembered locations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals with schizophrenia will be recruited from an ongoing NIH protocol studying&#xD;
           schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition healthy will be recruited for this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will check participants' vision in each eye, and ask them to sit at a&#xD;
           machine that measures eye movement in order to complete research tasks. Researchers will&#xD;
           monitor participants ability to complete these tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first task involves simply following a target that jumps to different parts of the&#xD;
           screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second is a 2-step task, in which a participant is asked to look at two separate&#xD;
           light targets and then look at the remembered target positions when the lights are off.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This protocol does not provide treatment. Participants will remain under the care of&#xD;
           their own physicians during participation in this protocol.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study if there is a defect in internal monitoring of eye movements in patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with schizophrenia and normal controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and controls will be asked to follow targets to remembered locations and their eye&#xD;
      movements will be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eye movements will be examined for evidence of internal monitoring (corollary discharge)&#xD;
      defects which would result in mislocalizing remembered targets.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Adult subjects over 18 years of age who are able to give informed consent and are&#xD;
                  able to concentrate on a task for 20 minutes which involves following projected&#xD;
                  targets and moving their eyes to remembered locations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Large refractive error requiring strong glasses. Glasses may interfere with the video&#xD;
             eye movement recording system. However, participants may wear contact lenses. Subjects&#xD;
             with a history of eye disease affecting vision or eye movements will also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants with guardians will be excluded.&#xD;
