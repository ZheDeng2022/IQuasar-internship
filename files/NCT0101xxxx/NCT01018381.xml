  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide with an estimated&#xD;
      626,000 new cases per year worldwide, accounting for 5.7% of new cancer cases. Although&#xD;
      resection and transplantation offer the best 5-year survival rates, not all patients are&#xD;
      suitable surgery candidates. Other treatments include pericutaneous ethanol injection (PEI),&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and transarterial oily chemoembolization (TOCE), all of which&#xD;
      enhance the survival rate and aid in shrinkage of the tumor. The very low survival rate among&#xD;
      HCC patients, 3-5%, reflects the inadequacy of conventional therapies for the disease and&#xD;
      highlights the necessity of finding new treatments or modifying the current treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes liver disease that can range in severity from a mild&#xD;
      illness that lasts several weeks (acute hepatitis B) to a long-term chronic illness. An&#xD;
      estimated 2 billion people have been infected with HBV worldwide, resulting in more than 350&#xD;
      million individuals with chronic, long-term liver infections. Patients with chronic HBV&#xD;
      infection are at a great risk for the development of cirrhosis, hepatic failure, and HCC.&#xD;
      There is no cure for hepatitis B and care is mostly palliative. There are several anti-viral&#xD;
      and interferon drugs, such as Entecavir and Interferon α therapy, which can help some&#xD;
      patients. However, these drugs are costly, thousands of dollars per year, and are not widely&#xD;
      available in many countries, especially in the developing world. Vaccination is available and&#xD;
      effective and is recommended for all individuals at risk for HBV infection. However,&#xD;
      vaccination is only effective in individuals who have not been exposed to HBV. Hepatitis B is&#xD;
      closely linked to liver cancer, which is almost always fatal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MGN-3/Biobran is an arabinoxylan extracted from rice bran that is treated enzymatically with&#xD;
      an extract from Shiitake mushrooms. MGN-3 demonstrated anti-cancer activity in vivo in mice&#xD;
      and humans. The present study was carried out to examine whether combining the current&#xD;
      conventional treatment with a food supplement, arabinoxylan rice bran (MGN-3/Biobran), may&#xD;
      improve the outcome of the disease and increase the survival rate of patients with HCC or&#xD;
      HBV. We hypothesize that a combinatory treatment of conventional therapy with MGN-3/Biobran&#xD;
      will augment the therapeutic effect seen when patients are treated with conventional therapy&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Objective(s): The objective of this study is to analyze a data from a study that examined the&#xD;
      biotherapeutic effect of combining conventional therapy in the presence of MGN-3/Biobran. The&#xD;
      study focused on treatment of patients in Vietnam with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and&#xD;
      Hepatitis B and C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: The biotherapeutic effect of combining conventional therapy and a natural, non-toxic&#xD;
      arabinoxylan rice bran (MGN-3/Biobran) for the treatment of patients with HCC will be&#xD;
      examined. Parameters under investigation include, lifespan of the patient, progression of the&#xD;
      disease (tumor size), and recurrence of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: The biotherapeutic effect of combining conventional therapy and a natural, non-toxic&#xD;
      arabinoxylan rice bran (MGN-3/Biobran) for the treatment of patients with Hepatitis B virus&#xD;
      (HBV) will be examined. Parameters under investigation include alanine transaminase (ALT)&#xD;
      levels, HBV antigen levels, and HBV DNA levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analysis of data from &quot;The effects of Biobran/Lentin Plus in the adjuvant therapy&#xD;
      of hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic hepatitis B&quot; study. The study was a randomized&#xD;
      controlled design that was conducted from 6/2006 to 7/2008 at the 108 Military Central&#xD;
      Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam with Dr. Mai Hong Bang as the Principal Investigator. MGN-3/Biobran&#xD;
      was approved by Vietnam Ministry of Health with import VISA No.12577/2005/CBCL-YT. Therefore,&#xD;
      The 108 Military Central Hospital approved the study for treatment of patients with HCC and&#xD;
      hepatitis B too.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC): Sixty-eight patients of both sexes, male and female,&#xD;
           with HCC were divided into two groups: group 1 (38 patients) was treated with&#xD;
           conventional therapy plus MGN-3 for 3 years, and group 2 (30 patients) was treated with&#xD;
           conventional therapy alone. At various intervals and at the end of the study patients&#xD;
           were assessed for the following: lifespan of the patient, progression of the disease&#xD;
           (tumor size), and recurrence of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hepatitis B virus (HBV): Sixty-two patients of both sexes, male and female, with HBV&#xD;
           were divided into two groups: group 1 (32 patients) was treated with conventional&#xD;
           therapy plus MGN-3 for 3 years, and group 2 (30 patients) was treated with conventional&#xD;
           therapy alone. Conventional therapy given was the anti-viral drug, Entecavir.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data were collected every six months for two years. Parameters under investigation&#xD;
           included: alanine transaminase (ALT) levels, HBV antigen (HeBAg), and HBV DNA levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients were treated with standard treatment (transarterial oily chemoembolization&#xD;
           (TOCE) for HCC; Entecavir for HBV) in combination with the experimental treatment,&#xD;
           arabinoxylan rice bran (MGN-3/Biobran) and compared with a control group given standard&#xD;
           treatment alone. Standard treatment was administered for 3 years. The experimental&#xD;
           treatment (MGN-3/Biobran) was administered at a dose of 1g/day for 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  HBV-DNA level: 104 (log10 copies/ml) with HBeAg(-) patient and 105 (log10&#xD;
                copies/ml) with HBeAg(+) patient&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
           HCC patient Criteria of exclusion - Tumor size is too big (over 12 cm), multiple tumors&#xD;
           (over 3 tumors or diffuse tumor type) - Prothrombin under 60%&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Severe liver or/ and renal insufficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Portal vein body thrombosis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Chronic hepatitis B patient Criteria of exclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Used immunotherapy or corticotherapy for 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pregnant woman&#xD;
&#xD;
           Procedures: Upon approval by IRB, the data will be analyzed using statistical analysis&#xD;
           and the data will be published in a peer-reviewed journal, as this data has not yet been&#xD;
           published. We will receive the data from the PI (Dr. Mai Hong Bang, MD Ph.D., Associate&#xD;
           Professor, Department of Hepatogastroenterology). After receiving the IRB approval, we&#xD;
           will conduct secondary analysis of the data. We will receive the data as an electronic&#xD;
           file excel file format with the code book for all the variables. We will do frequency&#xD;
           and data checking and data management to prepare the data for analysis. We will do&#xD;
           recoding and create new variables from the existed variables as a way to prepare for the&#xD;
           data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Benefits to subjects: Conventional therapies for HCC and HBV, in addition to their&#xD;
           toxicity, do not substantially improve the survival rate of the patients. The&#xD;
           combination of MGN-3/Biobran with these conventional therapies may improve the survival&#xD;
           rate of the patients and decrease the rate of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Benefits to the Community: There is a disproportionately high incidence of HCC in&#xD;
           developing countries, and over 50% of HCC cases occur in Asia. Hepatitis B is closely&#xD;
           linked to liver cancer, which is almost always fatal. It is estimated that nearly 80% of&#xD;
           all liver cancer worldwide is caused by hepatitis B infection. Therefore, there is a&#xD;
           need for new treatments with minimal to no side effects to combat these diseases. This&#xD;
           study will determine the potential of MGN-3/Biobran combined with conventional therapy&#xD;
           to improve the outcome of these diseases.&#xD;
