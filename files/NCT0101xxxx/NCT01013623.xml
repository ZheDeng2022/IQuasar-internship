  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will establish the role of surgical versus nonsurgical approaches in patients&#xD;
      whose melanoma has spread to distant sites. Results will help clinicians develop a&#xD;
      standardized initial approach that prolongs survival and optimizes quality of life. Results&#xD;
      also will indicate whether Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) postoperative immunotherapy&#xD;
      significantly improves the outcome of patients treated with surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to examine the impact of surgical resection versus medical therapy as&#xD;
      initial treatment therapy for patients with Stage IV melanoma. Surgical resection is thought&#xD;
      to be efficacious in highly selected patients with solitary metastases, but not in patients&#xD;
      with multiple sites of metastases. Even in those with solitary metastases, there is&#xD;
      considerable debate among major melanoma centers over whether undergoing initial systemic&#xD;
      medical therapy prior to surgical resection should be preferred to initial surgical resection&#xD;
      upon Stage IV diagnosis. According to Dr. Dan Coit, Co-leader of the Melanoma Disease&#xD;
      Management Team at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute in New York, a trial of initial&#xD;
      medical therapy is their standard approach on the multidisciplinary melanoma service even for&#xD;
      patients with solitary distant metastases (personal communication, 15 Dec 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many who favor upfront medical therapy believe that delay before surgical resection may avoid&#xD;
      unnecessary surgery by identifying patients who progress early due to the outgrowth of occult&#xD;
      metastases at multiple sites, which may make the patient unresectable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase III, randomized, international, multicenter study of metastasectomy with or&#xD;
      without BCG versus best medical therapy as initial therapy in Stage IV melanoma. This study&#xD;
      has three arms: surgical resection plus BCG as an immune adjuvant, surgical resection plus&#xD;
      observation, and best medical therapy (BMT). Since no systemic medical therapy has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to be superior to DTIC and multiple new therapies are being evaluated, the&#xD;
      choice as to what constitutes best medical therapy will be determined by the individual&#xD;
      investigator based on the standard of care for systemic medical therapy at that particular&#xD;
      multicenter site. Best systemic medical therapy may include clinical trials of new agents or&#xD;
      standard non-protocol treatments (e.g., DTIC or Temodar according to the standard of care at&#xD;
      the multi-center site).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who progress on the best medical treatment arm may switch to a different medical&#xD;
      therapy or, if appropriate, have surgical therapy; similarly, surgery patients may have&#xD;
      additional surgical resection or receive medical therapy.&#xD;

    <description>Patients in the surgical resection + BCG arm will have an additional two visits to receive BCG. The first dose of BCG will be given no earlier than 4 weeks after surgery, and the second BCG dose will follow 2 weeks later. The actual doses are determined by the patient's pre-study tuberculin-reactivity status. Patients with a pre-study PPD induration of ≥10 mm will be given half the normal dose of BCG. Those with PPD induration of ≥20 mm will be given 25% of the normal dose.</description>
