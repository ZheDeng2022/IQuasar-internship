      RATIONALE: Acupuncture may help relieve moderate or severe joint pain caused by aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying acupuncture in treating women with stage&#xD;
      I, stage II, or stage III breast cancer with aromatase inhibitor-related joint pain.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall effect of acupuncture for reducing arthralgia among breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors (BCS) receiving AIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore the specific effect of acupuncture needling for reducing arthralgia among BCS&#xD;
      receiving AIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To elucidate the relationship between response expectancy measured by the Acupuncture&#xD;
      Expectancy Scale (AES) and clinical response to acupuncture defined as percent reduction of&#xD;
      BPI pain severity score at the end of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the effects of acupuncture on other common symptoms including fatigue,&#xD;
      insomnia, and psychological distress among BCS who experience joint pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the correlation among pain and fatigue, insomnia, and psychological distress&#xD;
      using previously validated instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore the effects of acupuncture on quality of life among BCS who experience joint&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore the effect of acupuncture on objective measure of sleep and activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To identify potential genetic determinants to response to acupuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I (Acupuncture): Patients undergo 10, 20-minute sessions of acupuncture over 8 weeks&#xD;
      (twice weekly for 2 weeks and 6 weekly treatments).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II (Placebo): Patients undergo 10, 20-minute sessions of sham acupuncture treatments over&#xD;
      8 weeks (twice weekly for 2 weeks and 6 weekly treatments) via Streitberger needles at&#xD;
      non-acupuncture points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM III (Control): Wait-list control patients are contacted by phone at the same frequency as&#xD;
      real and placebo acupuncture groups for data collection at weeks 1, 4, and 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks.&#xD;
