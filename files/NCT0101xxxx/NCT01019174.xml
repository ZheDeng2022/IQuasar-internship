      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of LEN/low-dose DEX&#xD;
      and continuous low-dose CY administered orally compared to LEN in combination with low-dose&#xD;
      DEX and single CY doses IV in patients with relapsed MM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open, randomized, multicenter, phase I/II study with a parallel group design&#xD;
      investigating an intravenous and an oral CY dosing schedule in combination with LEN and&#xD;
      low-dose DEX in patients with refractory or relapsed MM. In phase I MTD of CY will be&#xD;
      determined using a common dose escalation scheme with 3 to 6 patients per dose level. In&#xD;
      phase II, efficacy and safety of the treatment regimens at the MTD will be investigated in 20&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Agree to use, and be able to comply with, effective contraception without&#xD;
                  interruption, 4 weeks before starting study drug, throughout study drug therapy&#xD;
                  (including dose interruptions) and for 4 weeks after the end of study drug&#xD;
                  therapy, even if she has amenorrhoea. This applies unless the subject commits to&#xD;
                  absolute and continued abstinence confirmed on a monthly basis. The following are&#xD;
                  effective methods of contraception:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Implant&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (IUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Medroxyprogesterone acetate depot&#xD;

&#xD;
             Combined oral contraceptive pills are not recommended. If a subject was using combined&#xD;
             oral contraception, she must switch to one of the methods above. The increased risk of&#xD;
             VTE continues for 4 to 6 weeks after stopping combined oral contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
             Prophylactic antibiotics should be considered at the time of insertion particularly in&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Agree to have a medically supervised pregnancy test with a minimum sensitivity of&#xD;
                  25 mIU/ml not more than 3 days from the start of study medication once the&#xD;
                  subject has been on effective contraception for at least 4 weeks. This&#xD;
                  requirement also applies to women of childbearing potential who practice complete&#xD;
                  and continued abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Agree to have a medically supervised pregnancy test every 4 weeks including 4&#xD;
                  weeks after the end of study treatment, except in the case of confirmed tubal&#xD;
                  sterilization. These tests should be performed not more than 3 days before the&#xD;
                  start of next treatment. This requirement also applies to women of childbearing&#xD;
                  potential who practice complete and continued abstinence Male subjects must&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Agree to use condoms throughout study drug therapy, during any dose interruption&#xD;
                  and for one week after cessation of study therapy if their partner is of&#xD;
                  childbearing potential and has no contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Agree not to donate semen during study drug therapy and for one week after end of&#xD;
                  study drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  week following discontinuation of study drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Agree not to share study medication with another person and to return all unused&#xD;
                  study drug to the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Disease free of prior malignancies for ≥ 5 years with exception of currently treated&#xD;
             basal cell, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma &quot;in situ&quot; of the cervix&#xD;
             or breast&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Able and willing to take heparin (usually low-molecular weight - LMWH) or low&#xD;
