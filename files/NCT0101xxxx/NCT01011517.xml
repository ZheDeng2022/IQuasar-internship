  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators sought to evaluate the effect of muscadine grape seed supplementation on&#xD;
      brachial diameter and flow-mediated vasodilator responses in subjects with, or at risk for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial, 50 adults (25&#xD;
      men, 25 women) with one or more cardiac risk factors were randomized to muscadine grape seed&#xD;
      (MGS) supplement 1300mg daily vs.. placebo for 4 weeks each, with a 4-week washout between&#xD;
      study periods. Resting diameter and endothelial function measured using brachial&#xD;
      flow-mediated dilation (FMD) were determined at the beginning and end of each study period.&#xD;

      Study Participants Participants were adult male and non-pregnant female outpatients ages&#xD;
      18-65 with one or more of the following cardiovascular risk factors: hypertension (blood&#xD;
      pressure ≥ 140/90 or current treatment for hypertension); dyslipidemia (total cholesterol &gt;&#xD;
      220 mg/dL + LDL cholesterol &gt; 130 mg/dL, or current use of lipid-lowering medications); or&#xD;
      controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (glycated hemoglobin &lt; 8.0 % with or without medication).&#xD;
      Subjects with a history of coronary artery disease (any history of myocardial infarction or&#xD;
      coronary revascularization) were also eligible for participation. Subjects were excluded if&#xD;
      they had a history of congestive heart failure (any classification), unstable angina or acute&#xD;
      coronary syndrome within the last 30 days, uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure ≥&#xD;
      170/100 mm/Hg), type 1 diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (HbA1C ≥&#xD;
      8.0%), history of gastrointestinal disease or surgery affecting absorption, peripheral&#xD;
      arterial disease, diagnosis of active cancer (excluding squamous cell or basal cell skin&#xD;
      cancer), current use of long-acting nitrate compounds such as isosorbide dinitrate or&#xD;
      nitroglycerin, recent change in any medications (last 30 days), active plan to change diet or&#xD;
      exercise patterns, history of hypersensitivity to any compound in the intervention or&#xD;
      placebo, or history of intolerance to nitrates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design The study was a double-blind, randomized crossover design to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of muscadine grape seed supplementation (Nature's Pearl 650 mg, two capsules daily.)&#xD;
      The phytochemical profile of the supplement is presented in Table 1. The trial consisted of a&#xD;
      screening visit followed by baseline and closeout visits for two study treatment periods (4&#xD;
      weeks each), separated by a 4-week washout period (total of 5 visits over 14&#xD;
      weeks).Endothelial function was assessed at the beginning and end of each study period using&#xD;
      brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (brachial FMD - described below). A fasting blood&#xD;
      sample was obtained at the open and close of each study period for measurement of lipids,&#xD;
      inflammatory markers, and markers of antioxidant capacity and oxidative stress. Participants&#xD;
      were asked to abstain from red wine, antioxidant vitamin supplements (including vitamin E,&#xD;
      vitamin C, and beta-carotene supplements, more than 1 cup of black or green tea daily, and&#xD;
      other grape seed supplements. Multivitamin supplements were permitted as long as they were&#xD;
      taken for the study duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial Function Study Protocol Details for the brachial FMD protocol, automated analysis&#xD;
      and reproducibility have been published previously {Herrington 2001}. Briefly, subjects&#xD;
      rested in a quiet, temperature-controlled room for 15 minutes. A standard (pediatric) cuff&#xD;
      was placed on the right forearm 2 inches (5 cm) below the antecubital fossa. Once the&#xD;
      transducer position was established over the left brachial artery, continuous scanning of the&#xD;
      brachial artery was obtained for 2 minutes before the cuff occlusion, 4 minutes of cuff&#xD;
      occlusion, and 2 minutes immediately after cuff release. Data were analyzed with an automated&#xD;
      analysis system that determines changes in brachial artery diameter for 2 minutes after cuff&#xD;
      release.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis The effects of supplementation with muscadine grape seeds and placebo&#xD;
      were compared using paired t-tests and mixed linear models to take into account treatment&#xD;
      order and period effects. The mixed linear models were also used to formally test for a&#xD;
      residual effect of treatment in those subjects receiving active treatment in the first&#xD;
      treatment period. Stratified analyses were performed to look for evidence of differential&#xD;
      effects by age, gender, prevalent heart disease or heart disease risk factors. Nominal&#xD;
      2-tailed p-values are presented for the primary outcome (percent change in brachial diameter)&#xD;
      and for all secondary outcomes. All analyses were performed using SAS v. 9.1 (Cary, NC).&#xD;
