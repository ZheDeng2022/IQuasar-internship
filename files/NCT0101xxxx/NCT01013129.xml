      RATIONALE: Gathering information about genetic and environmental factors may help doctors&#xD;
      learn more about a person's risk for developing prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This research project is studying genes, environment, and prostate cancer risk in&#xD;
      patients with or without prostate cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the association between variation in genes involved in ROS detoxification,&#xD;
           oxidative stress response, and prostate cancer risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the association between fatty acid levels and prostate cancer risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Probands undergo blood and saliva sample collection for fatty acid, DNA, and&#xD;
      polymorphism analyses. Archived blood and tissue samples from probands who previously&#xD;
      participated in Dr. Shannon's Diet and Prostate Cancer Risk study are also analyzed. Medical&#xD;
      records of probands are reviewed for demographics, history and course of disease, and&#xD;
      clinical laboratory test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All probands completed the &quot;Genetic Risk Easy Assessment Tool Family History of Cancer&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;Diet History and Environmental Risk Factor&quot; questionnaires at baseline. If a proband&#xD;
      previously participated on our Diet and Prostate Cancer Risk study, he was asked to complete&#xD;
      the &quot;Changes in Diet, Prescriptions, Supplementals and Herbal Remedies&quot; questionnaire in&#xD;
      addition to the &quot;Genetic Risk Easy Assessment Tool Family History of Cancer&quot; questionnaire at&#xD;
      baseline for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 750 participants will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
