    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of a malaria vaccine, Ad35.CS.01, and how&#xD;
      the body reacts to vaccination. Participants will include 48 Berkinabè healthy males and&#xD;
      females ages 18-45 years in Burkina Faso. Volunteers for this study will be divided into 4&#xD;
      groups. Members of each group (12 per group) will receive an increasing dose of vaccine or&#xD;
      placebo (an inactive substance). Ten will receive the malaria vaccine and 2 will receive&#xD;
      placebo. Study procedures include: physical exam, urine sample, and blood samples.&#xD;
      Participants will be involved in study related procedures for about 13 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malaria currently represents one of the most prevalent infections in tropical and subtropical&#xD;
      areas throughout the world. Each year, malaria affects around 300 million people and kills 1&#xD;
      to 3 million people in developing countries. Malaria is caused by the mosquito-borne&#xD;
      hematoprotozoan parasites belonging to the genus Plasmodium (P.). Malaria parasites have a&#xD;
      life cycle consisting of several stages. Each one of these stages is able to induce specific&#xD;
      immune responses against the corresponding stage-specific antigens. Malaria parasites are&#xD;
      transmitted to man by several species of female Anopheles mosquitoes. Infected mosquitoes&#xD;
      inject the sporozoite form of the malaria parasite into the mammalian bloodstream. Before&#xD;
      invading hepatocytes, sporozoites remain for a few minutes in the circulation. At this stage&#xD;
      the parasite is located in the extracellular environment and is exposed to antibody attack,&#xD;
      mainly directed to the circumsporozoite (CS) protein, a major component of the sporozoite&#xD;
      surface. Once in the liver, the parasites replicate and develop into schizonts (up to 20,000&#xD;
      per infected cell). During this intracellular stage of the parasite, the main effectors of&#xD;
      the host immune response are T lymphocytes, especially CD8+ T cells. Ad35.CS.01 is a malaria&#xD;
      vaccine for which a codon optimized nucleotide sequence representing the P. falciparum&#xD;
      circumsporozoite (CS) surface antigen is inserted in a replication deficient Adenovirus 35&#xD;
      backbone. It is hypothesized that the Ad35.CS.01 vaccine will prevent the P. falciparum&#xD;
      parasite, which causes malaria, from entering and developing within the liver of those who&#xD;
      become infected. Ad35.CS.01 would therefore be expected to reduce malaria-attributable&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. The primary objective is to assess the safety and reactogenicity of&#xD;
      4 ascending dosages of Adenovirus Type 35 circumsporozoite malaria vaccine among healthy,&#xD;
      semi-immune, subjects given in 3 doses at 0, 1 and 3 months by intramuscular (IM) injection.&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity of the Adenovirus Type 35 based&#xD;
      circumsporozoite malaria vaccine through performance of Humoral Immune Assays (ELISA&#xD;
      [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay] for antibodies to circumsporozoite antigen and Adenovirus&#xD;
      Neutralization Assay for neutralizing antibodies to Adenovirus Type 35) and Cellular Immune&#xD;
      Assays (Elispot and Flow Cytometry) for CS-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses and a&#xD;
      whole blood ELISA assay to measure secreted cytokines. This is a phase I randomized,&#xD;
      controlled, double-blinded, dosage-escalation trial to evaluate the immunogenicity, safety,&#xD;
      and reactogenicity of an Adenovirus Type 35 based circumsporozoite malaria vaccine in&#xD;
      Burkinabè, in semi-immune, healthy adults 18 to 45 years of age. Researchers propose to&#xD;
      confirm the safety of each dosage of the new vaccine by assessing safety laboratory&#xD;
      parameters and reactogenicity for 14 days after the initial dose in the lower dosages before&#xD;
      escalating to the next dosage level. Each dosage level group will include 10 subjects given&#xD;
      vaccine intramuscularly. Two subjects in each dosage group will receive normal saline as&#xD;
      placebo control.&#xD;
