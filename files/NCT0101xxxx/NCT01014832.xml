    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of frequently modified&#xD;
      intensive insulin therapy in patients with Type-2 and Type-1 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insulin treatment is the mainstay of Type-1 diabetic management and one of the cornerstones&#xD;
      in Type-2 diabetes. This treatment is based on multiple daily injections of different types&#xD;
      of insulin. Patients follow their endocrinologists' directions by adhering to a set of&#xD;
      recommended dosages and formulas, calculated by repeated blood glucose measurements. In order&#xD;
      to maintain effective and safe management, glucose measurements are taken before meals and at&#xD;
      bedtime, albeit imposing a heavy financial burden on a patient and their support system. For&#xD;
      illustration, each disposable glucosemeter strip costs more than a dollar and needs to be&#xD;
      replaced routinely 4 times daily, yielding an annual cost of more than $1500 per patient.&#xD;
      Insulin dosages necessitate repeated adjustments to meet the patient's changing needs.&#xD;
      Variations in food intake, body weight, physical activity, on going medical conditions and&#xD;
      mood can impact a patient's insulin needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, at each diabetic clinic appointment, the endocrinologist reviews the patient's&#xD;
      glucose measurements and insulin doses to determine whether the insulin dosage needs to be&#xD;
      adjusted. Unfortunately, limited appointment availability restricts insulin dosages&#xD;
      adjustments to once every several months. Furthermore, as a result of the limited time&#xD;
      allotted for each patient, new dosing recommendations are based on a review of only the most&#xD;
      recent measurements. This drawback may be one of the chief causes of suboptimal management,&#xD;
      with merely 38% of diabetic patients able to achieve proper control and mitigate detrimental&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the discovery of insulin by Frederick Grant Banting in 1921, only stringent glucose&#xD;
      control by a regimen of multiple insulin injections has prevented microvascular and&#xD;
      macrovascular complications in Type 1 diabetic patients. Moreover, insulin treatment amongst&#xD;
      other treatment modalities has been shown to prevent microvascular and macrovascular&#xD;
      complications in Type-2 diabetic patients. Incidentally, as the Type-2 diabetic epidemic&#xD;
      expands, insulin treatment is becoming one of the main treatment modalities. Not taking into&#xD;
      consideration availability, it has been established that more frequent patient-clinic&#xD;
      interactions improve diabetic management in both Type-1 and Type-2 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a typical 3-6 month interval appointment, the endocrinologist would measure a patient's&#xD;
      hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) to determine the quality of the last 3 months control. This value, is&#xD;
      linearly correlated to mean glucose levels at that 3 months period and, therefore, can be&#xD;
      predicted according to the measurements. We used anonymous records of glucose measurements to&#xD;
      perform preliminary statistical analysis. Our results indicate that a patient's glucose level&#xD;
      is a highly non-stationary process, with strong variations in both mean and standard&#xD;
      deviation (SD) from one week to another. In many patients with excessive HbA1c, which are at&#xD;
      levels that diabetic complications are likely to ensue, the endocrinologist is obligated to&#xD;
      adjust the insulin dosage based on a review of the patient's most recent glucose values and&#xD;
      the values of the past several weeks. Furthermore, since appointment timing is random and&#xD;
      independent from the patient's measurements, random trends in glucose values may be&#xD;
      identified that lead to different conclusions. For illustration, if a patient's appointment&#xD;
      happens to occur when his glucose values randomly trend up, the endocrinologist may choose to&#xD;
      increase insulin doses. On the other hand, if the appointment occurs at a time when the&#xD;
      glucose levels trend down, he may act oppositely. The required frequency of follow-up and&#xD;
      dose adjustment that yields better patient control is yet to be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that case management in patients with Type-2 diabetes can allow better&#xD;
      control of HbA1c levels. These studies have involved using qualified medical professionals&#xD;
      (ie, nurses, pharmacists, physician's assistants) as intervention methods, as well as&#xD;
      providing counseling and follow-up calls to help patients with improved self-management of&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to show that weekly insulin dosage adjustments for intensive insulin&#xD;
      therapy are superior to conservative, infrequent adjustments during clinical appointments in&#xD;
      both Type-1 and Type-2 diabetes.&#xD;
