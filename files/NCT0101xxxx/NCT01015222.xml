  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the&#xD;
      combination of dasatinib, bevacizumab, and paclitaxel with or without Methylnaltrexone that&#xD;
      can be given to patients with advanced cancer. The safety of this drug combination will also&#xD;
      be studied.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dasatinib is designed to decrease the activity of one or more proteins that are responsible&#xD;
      for the uncontrolled growth of tumor cells. This may cause the tumor cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab is designed to block the growth of blood vessels that supply nutrients necessary&#xD;
      for tumor growth. This may prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paclitaxel is designed to block cancer cells from dividing, which may cause them to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methylnaltrexone is designed to block the constipating effect of opioid analgesics on the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract. It is also capable of blocking the growth of blood vessels that&#xD;
      supply nutrients necessary for tumor growth. This may prevent or slow down the growth of&#xD;
      cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose&#xD;
      level of dasatinib, bevacizumab, and paclitaxel based on when you join this study. Up to 8&#xD;
      dose levels of dasatinib, bevacizumab, and paclitaxel will be tested. Three (3) to 9&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants will&#xD;
      receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group&#xD;
      before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest&#xD;
      tolerable dose of the combination of dasatinib, bevacizumab, and paclitaxel is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The highest tolerable dose of the combination of dasatinib, bevacizumab, and paclitaxel that&#xD;
      was found will be given in combination with methylnaltrexone to up to 6 participants. If&#xD;
      intolerable side effects occur, the next group of up to 6 participants will receive a lower&#xD;
      dose of methylnaltrexone but the same dose of the combination of dasatinib, bevacizumab, and&#xD;
      paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose expansion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the highest safe dose of the combinations of dasatinib, bevacizumab, and paclitaxel with&#xD;
      and without methylnaltrexone are found, 14 additional participants will be enrolled and&#xD;
      receive the study drugs at each dose level combination. Participants with a tumor type (14&#xD;
      for each tumor type) that have responded to the study drug combination will receive the study&#xD;
      drugs at that dose level, as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study &quot;cycle&quot; is 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everyday, you will take dasatinib by mouth 1 time a day. You should take it at about the same&#xD;
      time each day with food and a cup of water (about 8 ounces).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1 and 15 of each cycle, you will receive bevacizumab by vein over 90 minutes. If the&#xD;
      first dose is well tolerated, you will receive the next dose over 60 minutes. If the second&#xD;
      dose is well tolerated, you will receive the next doses over 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle, you will receive paclitaxel by vein over 60 minutes. On&#xD;
      Days 1 and 15, your paclitaxel dose will be given after your bevacizumab dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 30 minutes before each scheduled dose of paclitaxel, you will also receive medications&#xD;
      (such as dexamethasone) to lower the likelihood of experiencing allergic reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you receive methylnaltrexone, you will receive it by injection under the skin either to&#xD;
      the upper arm, upper thigh, or stomach at the same time 2 times every day. The study doctor&#xD;
      or nurse will teach you how to give the injections yourself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At every study visit, you will be asked about any current health conditions you have, drugs&#xD;
      you may be taking, and if you have experienced any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Around Days 8 and 28 of Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Around Day 15 of Cycle 1, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Around Day 28 of Cycles 2 and beyond:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 4 weeks, you will have a blood (about 1 teaspoon) drawn or urine collected for&#xD;
      pregnancy test if you are able to become pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 8 weeks, you will have an x-ray, CT scan, MRI scan, and/or PET/CT scan to check the&#xD;
      status of the disease. If the study doctor thinks it is needed, they will be performed more&#xD;
      often.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may stay on study for as long as the disease does not get worse, you have not experienced&#xD;
      intolerable side effects, and if the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 28 days after the last dose of study drugs, you will have an end-of-study visit. At&#xD;
      this visit, the following tests or procedures may be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an x-ray, CT scan, MRI scan, and/or&#xD;
           PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Dasatinib is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. Bevacizumab is FDA approved and commercially&#xD;
      available for the treatment of colorectal, breast, lung, and brain cancer. Paclitaxel is FDA&#xD;
      approved and commercially available for the treatment of breast, lung, and ovarian cancer and&#xD;
      Kaposi's sarcoma. Methylnaltrexone is FDA approved and commercially available for the&#xD;
      treatment of constipation in patients with advanced illness who are receiving palliative&#xD;
      care. The combination of these drugs when given to patients with advanced cancer is&#xD;
      investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 218 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
