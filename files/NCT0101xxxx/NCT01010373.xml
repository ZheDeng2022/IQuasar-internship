  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether addition of AS101 to the standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen is effective in the treatment of newly diagnosed elderly (≥60) AML&#xD;
      patients and AML transformed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AML patients frequently develop cytopenia, which can result in life-threatening bleeding and&#xD;
      infections. Despite the administration of prophylactic platelet transfusions, these patients&#xD;
      remain at risk of clinically significant hemorrhage. There is a growing need for new,&#xD;
      innovative strategies, because the outcome for AML patients, particularly for the older ones,&#xD;
      has not substantially changed in the last three decades. Thus, novel compounds to target the&#xD;
      tumor cell's resistance to chemotherapeutic agents are essential for the improvement of&#xD;
      patients' prognoses. AS101 is a non-toxic, organic, tellurium-based small compound with&#xD;
      immunomodulating properties which have previously shown bone marrow sparing effect. In&#xD;
      addition in preclinical studies AS101 has shown synergistic effect with several cytotoxic&#xD;
      drugs. This study will investigate the safety and efficacy of AS101 formulation in&#xD;
      combination with the standard therapy for newly diagnosed elderly AML and AML transformed MDS&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

The patient will also receive AS101 infusions during the time break till the next chemotherapy course, as long as the patient does not achieve complete remission and the platelet count is &lt;20,000/μl; ANC &lt;1000. AS101 will be administered likewise up to two consolidation or equivalent chemotherapy courses (re-induction or salvage in the event that no CR is achieved following first induction chemotherapy), i.e., total of three chemotherapy courses.</description>
