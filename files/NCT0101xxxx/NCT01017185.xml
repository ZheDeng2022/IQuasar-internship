      The purpose of this study is to determine whether HF10 is safe and effective in the treatment&#xD;
      of head and neck cancer or solid tumors with cutaneous and/or superficial lesions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This is an open label, non-randomized, multicenter, two-stage, dose escalation Phase I study&#xD;
      evaluating single and repeated intratumoral injections of the oncolytic virus, HF10, in&#xD;
      patients with refractory head and neck cancer, or solid tumors with cutaneous and/or&#xD;
      superficial lesions (e.g., squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma of the breast, and&#xD;
      malignant melanoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1: Stage 1 of the study will investigate dose escalation of a single intratumoral&#xD;
      injection over the following dose levels: 1 x 10^5 TCID50, 3 x 10^5 TCID50, 1 x 10^6 TCID50,&#xD;
      and 1 x 10^7 TCID50. In Stage 1, it is planned that 3 patients will be enrolled per single&#xD;
      dose cohort. Within each single dose cohort, accrual will temporarily be suspended after the&#xD;
      first patient is entered and the patient will be followed for safety and for viral&#xD;
      distribution and elimination. The patients in Stage 1 must be seropositive for HSV-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: Stage 2 will evaluate repeated intratumoral injections of HF10 at dose levels of 1 x&#xD;
      10^6 TCID50/dose and 1 x 10^7 TCID50/dose. Three patients will be enrolled in each of the&#xD;
      repeated dose cohorts. In Stage 2, the first patient treated in each repeated dose cohort&#xD;
      must be seropositive for HSV-1. Patients in the repeated dose cohort will receive a total of&#xD;
      four intratumoral injections in the same lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of dosing in the repeated dose cohorts, an expansion cohort of three&#xD;
      additional patients will be treated at the highest tolerated dose level.&#xD;
