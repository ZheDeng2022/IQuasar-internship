      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Bisacodyl, 5 mg usage decreases the&#xD;
      incidence of nausea and abdominal pain after surgery, and also decreases the number of&#xD;
      hospitalization days.&#xD;

      Postoperative ileus is defined as a disturbance in bowel motility, clinically&#xD;
      indistinguishable from bowel obstruction, and resulting from noxious or injurious bowel&#xD;
      insult. During abdominal surgery, this could be due to bowel manipulation or its exposure to&#xD;
      irritants like blood or pus. This contributes to post-operative morbidity resulting in&#xD;
      significant patient discomfort and prolonged hospital stay. The clinical picture can be&#xD;
      variable in presentation and severity. Patients can be asymptomatic or complain of anorexia,&#xD;
      cramping, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and bloating. Severe cases can have bilious&#xD;
      vomiting. No diagnostic test can exclude the diagnosis with certainty and presence or absence&#xD;
      of bowel sounds on exam is unreliable. Therefore, symptoms are primarily relied on for&#xD;
      clinical management to promote patient comfort. Postoperative ileus can increase&#xD;
      postoperative morbidity and lengthen hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, patients are given nothing-by-mouth (NPO) after major abdominal or pelvic&#xD;
      surgery to allow rest for the dysfunctional bowel because of the concern of precipitating&#xD;
      postoperative ileus. Patients are started on a clear liquid diet and advanced accordingly&#xD;
      when there is documentation of bowel function such as passing flatus, presence of bowel&#xD;
      sounds, or no obvious evidence of bowel obstruction such as nausea and vomiting. This was&#xD;
      based on the fact that colonic motility is the last to recover after abdominal surgery&#xD;
      (usually 3-5 days) and this is less precise in patients who develop constipation. However,&#xD;
      the small bowel returns to normal peristaltic activity within 12-24 hours and the stomach&#xD;
      within 24-48 hours. In addition, large body of evidence indicates that early feedings and&#xD;
      early ambulation stimulates gastrointestinal motility, reduces overall complication rates as&#xD;
      well as improves patient comfort and satisfaction. Laxatives also increase GI motility, will&#xD;
      permit passage of flatus and/or stool, making the surgeon more comfortable in permitting&#xD;
      early oral feeds. This will increase patient satisfaction, increase comfort by decreasing&#xD;
      bloating and allow faster recovery. Bisacodyl is a mild laxative and so greatly suited for&#xD;
      study in the post-operative period. However, laxative use can itself cause cramping,&#xD;
      abdominal pain, and bloating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several studies found in the literature about the effect of early bowel stimulation&#xD;
      in postoperative care. However, there are only three studies related to the benefit of using&#xD;
      laxatives during postoperative care to improve bowel function and decrease incidence of&#xD;
      postoperative ileus. The Department of OB/GYN at Ohio showed earlier return to bowel function&#xD;
      and a decrease in hospital stay while using Fleets Phosphorate Soda (66% sodium phosphate) in&#xD;
      patients having a radical hysterectomy. Another study was done at Hvidovre University&#xD;
      (Demark) to identify the benefit of using Magnesium Oxide and Disodium Phosphate immediately&#xD;
      postoperatively in patients undergoing a hysterectomy. This study showed no difference on&#xD;
      postoperative nausea, vomiting, or pain, but decreased the length of hospitalization by one&#xD;
      day (N = 20). In July 2007, the Department of Surgery at Mahidol University (Thailand) used&#xD;
      Bisacodyl suppositories on the third postoperative day in patients who underwent a colectomy&#xD;
      for colon cancer. This study showed an increase incidence of postoperative ileus. All these&#xD;
      studies are limited by their small number of patient enrollment, and none were blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bisacodyl (Dulcolax) is an over-the-counter laxative. It is coated with a protective coating&#xD;
      so that it will not be digested in the stomach and small intestine. Therefore, Dulcolax only&#xD;
      takes effect in the large intestine, where the coating is dissolved. Dulcolax is metabolized&#xD;
      by the liver with CYP450 mechanism and excreted by stool and urine. Dulcolax works in the&#xD;
      large intestine by stimulating the nerve endings, causing muscles to contract and the&#xD;
      contents of the bowel to empty. Dulcolax is not used as the first treatment of bowel&#xD;
      stimulation due to the concern about imbalance of electrolytes as well as dependency. There&#xD;
      are few studies that document any adverse effect of Dulcolax. There are several studies&#xD;
      showing Dulcolax as one the best choices of bowel prep agents without significant discomfort&#xD;
      or imbalance of electrolytes.&#xD;
