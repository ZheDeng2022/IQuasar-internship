  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Swallowing implies the appropriate use and sufficient function of specific muscles that are&#xD;
      also used in speech. Theoretically, if these muscles are functionally affected then phonation&#xD;
      and vocalization should be impaired, as well. The purpose of this study is to examine the&#xD;
      relationship between functions of speech and risk of aspiration as defined by swallowing&#xD;
      function, and to investigate the diagnostic potential that functions of speech may have in&#xD;
      predicting the risk of aspiration. This could allow for earlier stratification of ICU&#xD;
      patients for aspiration risks. Aspiration pneumonia has been reported in more than 20% of&#xD;
      patients with health care-associated pneumonia. There are multiple tools to assess for risk&#xD;
      of aspiration in the ICU, yet these are time consuming, often delayed and involve advanced&#xD;
      testing that is performed by a certified speech-language pathologist and/or radiologist. A&#xD;
      novel 3-step phonetic evaluation was created and will be implemented on ICU patients at risk&#xD;
      for aspiration, and the results will be correlated to the standard swallowing tests. If&#xD;
      strong correlation is found in this pilot study, then formal clinical trial will follow to&#xD;
      confirm that the simple bed-side phonetic evaluation could allow for earlier identification&#xD;
      of patients at risk for aspiration, and more efficient management relative to time and&#xD;
      resources utilization.&#xD;

      Aspiration is defined as entry of a solid or liquid material into the respiratory tract,&#xD;
      below the vocal folds, or inhalation of fumes and vapors. Aspiration pneumonia is an&#xD;
      infectious process caused by aspirated oropharyngeal flora, while aspiration pneumonitis is&#xD;
      caused by a direct chemical insult due to the aspirated material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aspiration pneumonitis and pneumonia among hospitalized patients result in increased&#xD;
      morbidity, mortality and utilization of resources, with increased costs of care. Early&#xD;
      identification of patients at risk for aspiration is crucial to prevent this preventable and&#xD;
      often iatrogenic condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, the most common predisposing factors for aspiration in adults are alcoholism,&#xD;
      stroke, neuromuscular disorders, seizures, and loss of consciousness, and these patients are&#xD;
      usually cared for in the ICU setting. Furthermore, critically ill patients are also at risk&#xD;
      as they are frequently under varying degrees of sedation, especially early in the post&#xD;
      extubation period. Postoperative patients in addition may have prolonged functional dysphagia&#xD;
      due to lingering effect of neuromuscular blocking agents. However, risks of aspiration may&#xD;
      apply to any hospitalized patient and further studies with broader inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      needed based on the preliminary results of this pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are multiple tools to assess for risk of aspiration in the ICU. These include Dysphagia&#xD;
      Admission Screening Tool (DAST), Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of the Swallow (FEES) and&#xD;
      Modified Barium Swallow (MBS), which are routinely performed at our institution. The DAST is&#xD;
      relatively novel screening tool, brought up as an early method for identification of&#xD;
      dysphagia, as mandated by Joint Commission. This test has not been yet validated. It was&#xD;
      created in 2004 in order to reduce the risk of aspiration among new stroke patients, based&#xD;
      upon literature review, research and a strong foundation of knowledge and experience in&#xD;
      Speech-Language Pathology in evaluating dysphagia. The FEES and MBS are time consuming, often&#xD;
      delayed and involve advanced testing that is performed by a certified speech-language&#xD;
      pathologist and/or radiologist. MBS also requires transport of the patient from the ICU to&#xD;
      the radiology suite and back. These tests examine function of swallow mechanism in order to&#xD;
      predict individual patient's risk of aspiration. They are reported as pass or fail and graded&#xD;
      from 1-8, depending on the degree of the bolus penetration into the airway and/or expulsion&#xD;
      from the airway. The current &quot;gold standard&quot; to determine the risk of aspiration is&#xD;
      considered to be MBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that among critically ill, impairments in phonation correlate significantly to&#xD;
      impairments in deglutition. Since in current practice patient's risk for aspiration is judged&#xD;
      based on swallowing ability, strong correlation between impairments in speech and swallow&#xD;
      mechanisms may allow prognostication based on phonation assessment alone. As the phonetic&#xD;
      evaluation is simple, bedside test, it may result in earlier identification of the patient at&#xD;
      risk for aspiration and obviate need for additional, invasive and expensive tests, and&#xD;
      additional staff utilization for patient transport, testing and interpretation.&#xD;
