    <textblock>
      Most first trimester abortions are performed under local anesthesia using either manual or&#xD;
      electric vacuum suction aspiration. The majority of women undergoing these procedures&#xD;
      experience some amount of pain and anxiety. The investigators seek to understand if the&#xD;
      provision of music during first trimester abortion will reduce pain and anxiety associated&#xD;
      with this procedure. This study will involve the use of music during first trimester abortion&#xD;
      as an additional method of pain and anxiety control. The investigators will recruit women&#xD;
      seeking a first trimester suction aspiration procedure primarily for elective pregnancy&#xD;
      termination or for other related indications such as an abnormal pregnancy, inevitable&#xD;
      abortion, or retained products of conception. Participation will be voluntary and include&#xD;
      informed consent. Recruited women will be divided into two groups: control group (no music)&#xD;
      and intervention (music) group. All subjects will receive routine care and standard pain&#xD;
      control measures, including local anesthesia, during their procedure. Those assigned to the&#xD;
      intervention group will receive a portable digital music player (iPOD™ Nano) with headphones&#xD;
      to listen to during their procedure. All subjects will complete preoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative pain and anxiety questionnaires in addition to a patient satisfaction survey at&#xD;
      the end of their visit. The provider will also assess and record the subject's pain&#xD;
      experienced during the procedure. The investigators will also measure preoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative vital signs on all participants. Subjects will be compensated for their time&#xD;
      and study participation will not affect any care received at the clinic. Upon completion of&#xD;
      their visit, there will be no additional followup for this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 90% of abortions occur during the first trimester and a majority of these are&#xD;
      performed by suction curettage in an outpatient setting using local anesthesia (Grimes, 2007;&#xD;
      Lichtenberg, 2001). When only local anesthesia is used, 97% of women experience pain, and&#xD;
      anxiety level is a positive predictor of pain during abortion (Bélanger, 1989). Although&#xD;
      general anesthesia offers better agents for anxiety and pain management, this route is less&#xD;
      commonly used because of prohibitive costs and potential complications (Grimes, 2007).&#xD;
      Because many first trimester abortion providers utilize local anesthesia as primary pain&#xD;
      management during the procedure, multiple agents and techniques have been investigated to&#xD;
      supplement or enhance the effects of the local anesthetic. Investigated methods include time&#xD;
      delay between paracervical block administration and cervical dilation, intrauterine lidocaine&#xD;
      infusion, and various combinations of inhaled, oral, and intravenous analgesics and&#xD;
      anxiolytics. Additionally, complementary and alternative regimens such as relaxation,&#xD;
      distraction, hypnosis, and aromatherapy have also been evaluated as auxiliary analgesics and&#xD;
      anxiolytics during first trimester abortion. Despite these attempts to improve the anxiety&#xD;
      and pain associated with abortion under local anesthesia, the results and efficacy of these&#xD;
      methods is variable and inconsistent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Music therapy is classified as a cognitive-behavioral intervention that helps patients by&#xD;
      providing them with a greater sense of self-control in assessing and managing pain (AHCPR,&#xD;
      1992). In 1992, recommendations by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality included&#xD;
      music as one type of cognitive-behavioral intervention for pain management (AHCPR, 1992). The&#xD;
      exact mechanism as to how music impacts pain sensory systems has not been fully elucidated,&#xD;
      but it is thought to engage specific brain functions involved in memory, learning, and&#xD;
      multiple motivational and emotional states (Nilsson, 2008). As the most influential theory on&#xD;
      the nature of pain, the Gate Control Theory hypothesizes that cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      interventions work by closing the gate of nerve fibers that transmit ascending sensory&#xD;
      information to the brain while concurrently modulating input from inhibitory systems and&#xD;
      psychological factors, the sum of which leads to a reduction in the pain experience (Tse,&#xD;
      2005; Sendelbach, 2006). The Gate Control Theory posits that music acts as a distracter,&#xD;
      diverting attention away from a noxious stimulus by redirecting a person's attention or by&#xD;
      involving the individual in a distracting task (Tse, 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of music as an auxiliary analgesic and anxiolytic has been evaluated in such&#xD;
      outpatient procedures as colonoscopy, laceration repair, dental work, lithotripsy, nasal&#xD;
      surgery, breast biopsy, and colposcopy (Chan, 2003). In addition to other nonpharmacologic&#xD;
      approaches to pain management such as relaxation, distraction, and guided imagery, musical&#xD;
      interventions have demonstrated favorable effects upon pain, anxiety, wound healing, and&#xD;
      recovery among patients in the peri-operative setting (Laurion, 2003). Physiological&#xD;
      parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure, and stress hormone levels improve under the&#xD;
      influence of music (Leardi, 2007). A Cochrane Collaboration review on the use of music for&#xD;
      pain relief found that music reduced pain intensity levels but recommended that music not be&#xD;
      used for primary pain control (Cepeda, 2006). The authors also concluded that the impact of&#xD;
      music on anxiety has not yet been determined and needs to be further investigated. Given&#xD;
      music's demonstrated benefits as an auxiliary analgesic and anxiolytic in multiple operative&#xD;
      settings, its role in the abortion setting deserves further examination. The objective of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the role of music as an alternative agent for pain and anxiety&#xD;
      management during first trimester abortion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A systematic review of 42 randomized controlled trials evaluated the effects of music in&#xD;
      multiple peri-operative settings and found that the intervention had positive effects in&#xD;
      reducing patient pain and anxiety in approximately half of the reviewed studies (Nilsson,&#xD;
      2008). Many included trials were noted to be of &quot;insufficient quality&quot; and a meta-analysis&#xD;
      could not be performed due to variation in the types of music used, the duration of listening&#xD;
      time, and procedures investigated. Furthermore, some studies used non-validated&#xD;
      questionnaires and had other methodological limitations. Nonetheless, the author concluded&#xD;
      that peri-operative musical interventions are easy to implement and effective in reducing&#xD;
      patient pain, anxiety, and stress (Nilsson, 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 2006 Cochrane Collaboration review examined the effect of music on acute and chronic pain&#xD;
      in 51 randomized controlled trials. They calculated the mean difference in pain intensity&#xD;
      levels, percentage of patients with at least 50% pain relief, and opioid requirements among&#xD;
      3663 subjects. The authors concluded that listening to music reduced pain intensity levels&#xD;
      and opioid requirements but that the magnitude of these benefits is small with uncertain&#xD;
      clinical significance (Cepeda, 2006). Although the pooled results indicated statistical&#xD;
      significance in the reduction of post-operative pain intensity levels, the authors stated&#xD;
      that the role of music in pain relief warrants further investigation as does its role as a&#xD;
      potential anxiolytic. As musical interventions have not been shown to have adverse effects,&#xD;
      it is worth pursuing this nonpharmacologic agent as a supplemental resource for patients&#xD;
      undergoing medical procedures such as first trimester abortion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only one study, published in 1975, has examined music as an auxiliary analgesic during first&#xD;
      trimester abortion. This was a randomized controlled trial of 144 patients divided into 3&#xD;
      groups who all received oral diazepam and a paracervical block with mepivacaine in addition&#xD;
      to 1) no further anesthesia, 2) self-administered methoxyflurane, or 3) music via&#xD;
      stereophonic headphones. Patients who listened to music during suction curettage reported&#xD;
      less tension and less pain (Shapiro, 1975). Although this study showed a beneficial effect of&#xD;
      music, its findings are limited by poor study descriptors of patient characteristics, an&#xD;
      unspecified randomization procedure, and lack of appropriate statistical analysis. A&#xD;
      non-validated pain questionnaire was utilized and there is minimal description of procedural&#xD;
      methods, the intervention, and results. Given these limitations, its results may not be&#xD;
      applicable by current randomized trial guidelines. Nonetheless, this is the only published&#xD;
      study to examine the use music as an auxiliary analgesic during first trimester abortion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because pain perception is also thought to be highly associated with comorbid conditions such&#xD;
      as depression, anxiety, and substance abuse, the pain experience may influence overall&#xD;
      satisfaction outcomes related to a specific event (Guzeldemir, 2008; Bair, 2007). The&#xD;
      baseline presence of any of these conditions may impact one's response to pain management,&#xD;
      anxiety status, and satisfaction associated with a procedure. In addition to overall&#xD;
      satisfaction, we will assess for these comorbid conditions in our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, music has become very portable in the form of digital music players such as the iPOD™.&#xD;
      With 25% of Americans and 51% of American adolescents owning one of these devices, music is a&#xD;
      familiar part of many lives (Pew, 2006). Pain studies evaluating musical interventions as&#xD;
      auxiliary analgesia have used various types of music via different delivery systems (i.e.&#xD;
      cassette/CD player with headphones, loudspeakers, live music by a music therapist) in&#xD;
      different settings. Many of these trials have utilized self-selection of music and have&#xD;
      included a variety of musical genres, specific sounds, white noise, and vocal suggestions.&#xD;
      Although some studies indicate that slow and non-lyrical music of the patient's choice for at&#xD;
      least 30 minutes at 60 decibel volume is ideal for optimal pain relief and relaxation, it is&#xD;
      not known if these factors directly influence music's impact in reducing pain and anxiety&#xD;
      (Nilsson, 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, there is mixed evidence on the role of patient choice in music selection and&#xD;
      whether this affects the amount of pain or anxiety experienced. While some studies have&#xD;
      advocated the use of self-selected music to enhance pain and anxiety reduction (Hekmat, 1993;&#xD;
      Lee, 2004), the previously mentioned Cochrane review found that the decline in pain intensity&#xD;
      was similar among patients whether or not the music was self-selected (Cepeda, 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the data on music's potential ability to positively influence surgical experiences, we&#xD;
      believe that music as an auxiliary method of anxiety and pain management in first trimester&#xD;
      abortion warrants further investigation. The proposed study will evaluate music's impact on&#xD;
      anxiety and pain experienced during first trimester abortion performed with local anesthesia&#xD;
      and how this might influence overall satisfaction experienced with the procedure. Given that&#xD;
      50% of women who had abortions in 2005 were less than 25 years old (Gamble, 2008) and that&#xD;
      this younger age group likely has increased familiarity with portable digital music players,&#xD;
      this patient population may benefit from music as an auxiliary analgesic and anxiolytic&#xD;
      during pregnancy termination. This research has the potential to expand the arsenal of&#xD;
      low-cost, safe, and effective analgesics and anxiolytics available for surgical abortion, a&#xD;
      commonly performed procedure across the United States and worldwide. The addition of music to&#xD;
      first trimester abortion under local anesthesia provides an opportunity to improve the pain&#xD;
      and anxiety associated with this procedure, especially given that many women of reproductive&#xD;
      age utilize personal digital music players and may welcome this auxiliary analgesic and&#xD;
      anxiolytic to their experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will be a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the hypothesis that&#xD;
      intraoperative music reduces patient anxiety and pain during first trimester abortion. We&#xD;
      will examine the role of music as an auxiliary analgesic and anxiolytic in conjunction with a&#xD;
      standard pain control regimen used in first trimester suction aspiration procedures&#xD;
      consisting of preoperative oral ibuprofen and local anesthesia using a 1% lidocaine&#xD;
      paracervical block. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the control and&#xD;
      intervention groups.&#xD;
