  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the level of a specific protein (PTEN) in the cancer&#xD;
      cells of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) patients. This protein might be involved in&#xD;
      the transformation from normal blood cells to leukemia cells. The PTEN protein has not been&#xD;
      investigated in CMML specifically but it has been discovered in closely related cancers. If&#xD;
      this study demonstrates an abnormality in this protein, future testing will be designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the genetic abnormality that resulted in lack of the normal presence of this&#xD;
      protein. The goal is that the results of this study will help to develop new drugs and&#xD;
      strategies to treat the future patients with CMML by understanding the abnormality of the&#xD;
      disease at the cellular and molecular levels. The results of this study can also be utilized&#xD;
      by future studies to develop individualized treatment to patients who have abnormal levels of&#xD;
      this protein.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects ages 18 and older with a CMML diagnosis based on the WHO 2009 criteria, and who have signed an informed consent are eligible to participate in the study population of this clinical trial. A total of 12 patients will be consented.</description>

        During routine clinic visits, staff will present the option of participating in this&#xD;
        clinical trial to eligible patients with a diagnosis of CMML. Also, healthy control&#xD;
        patients will be asked to participate. The healthy control patients can be the subject's&#xD;
        family members, friends, or volunteers.&#xD;
