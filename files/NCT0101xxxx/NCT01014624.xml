  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to describe the cumulative proportion of participants&#xD;
      who return to baseline platelet P2Y12 receptor function over time (up to 12 days post last&#xD;
      maintenance dose) following discontinuation of prasugrel 10 mg daily x 7 days assessed by&#xD;
      Accumetrics VerifyNow P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) and described by Kaplan Meier curves. The&#xD;
      primary analysis is descriptive and is intended to provide information relating to the return&#xD;
      of baseline platelet function following discontinuation of maintenance therapy with either&#xD;
      prasugrel or clopidogrel.&#xD;

    <description>Time to return to baseline PRU (&lt;= 60 units of baseline) dependent upon baseline PRU and platelet % inhibition on Washout Period Day 1 but independent of treatment. The following regression model was derived for predicting number of days to return to baseline PRU where PI(1) represents platelet percentage inhibition on Washout Day 1. Number days to return to baseline PRU derived from: Number days to return to baseline PRU=-3.350+0.079*PI(1)+0.014*baseline PRU. The predicted number of days to return to baseline based on device-derived platelet percentage inhibition is reported for each treatment group.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were recruited at 4 sites in the US from 23 February 2010 to 24 May 2010 and 56 participants were randomized into the study. The study population consisted of male and female aspirin-treated participants with stable coronary artery disease, 18 to 75 years of age.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The Overall Study Period included a 1-day to 14-day Screening Period, a 7-day Active Treatment Period, and a Washout Period of up to 12 days. Following the 1-day to 14-day Screening Period, eligible participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either prasugrel or clopidogrel at Visit 2 (the first day of the Active Treatment Period).</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Inhibition of platelet aggregation was assessed by Accumetrics VerifyNow® P2Y12 reaction units (PRU). On the first day of the Washout Period (Visit 3), the blood draw for platelet function testing was obtained 24 hour (+/- 6 hours) after the last dose of study medication. Following Visit 3, platelet function testing was performed during each visit of the Washout Period until the participant met the following exit criteria: (Baseline PRU-PRU) less than or equal to 60 units and (Baseline PRU-PRU)/(Baseline PRU) less than or equal to 20%.</description>

        <description>Time to return to baseline PRU (&lt;= 60 units of baseline) dependent upon baseline PRU and platelet % inhibition on Washout Period Day 1 but independent of treatment. The following regression model was derived for predicting number of days to return to baseline PRU where PI(1) represents platelet percentage inhibition on Washout Day 1. Number days to return to baseline PRU derived from: Number days to return to baseline PRU=-3.350+0.079*PI(1)+0.014*baseline PRU.
