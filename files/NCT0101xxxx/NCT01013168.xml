      The purpose of this study is to collect further data for safety and feasibility for the use&#xD;
      of the medical device OncoSorb® in clinical routine for the treatment of patients with solid&#xD;
      metastatic cancer entities who have failed standard therapies. OncoSorb® device is intended&#xD;
      to specifically adsorb three soluble receptors (sTNF-R1, sTNF-R2 and sIL-2R α), which are&#xD;
      known to inhibit the natural immune response of cancer patients mediated via tumor necrosis&#xD;
      factor α (TNF- α).&#xD;

      STUDY PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to collect further data for safety and&#xD;
      feasibility for the use of the medical device OncoSorb® in clinical routine for the treatment&#xD;
      of patients with solid metastatic cancer entities who have failed standard therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEDICAL DEVICE: The medical device used in this clinical study is the OncoSorb® column. It is&#xD;
      used with a specially modified Fresenius ART apheresis machine, associated tubing sets and an&#xD;
      Albuflow plasma filter, also from Fresenius. These components comprise the extracorporeal&#xD;
      immune apheresis system. The OncoSorb® column was CE certified in April 2008. The OncoSorb®&#xD;
      device is intended to specifically adsorb three soluble receptors (sTNF-R1, sTNF-R2 and&#xD;
      sIL-2R α), which are known to inhibit the natural immune response of cancer patients mediated&#xD;
      via tumor necrosis factor α (TNF- α).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the use of OncoSorb® therapy in clinical practice in&#xD;
      terms of both safety and feasibility. This involves the evaluation of system-immanent issues&#xD;
      (particularly occurrence of possible catheter infections and suitability of citrate/heparin&#xD;
      anticoagulation) during the course of the clinical study prior the initiation of a phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Occurrence of&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Possible catheter infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suitability of citrate/heparin anticoagulation (with clogging of the extracorporeal&#xD;
           circuit or bleeding as potential consequences)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events/serious adverse events in general including changes of clinically&#xD;
           relevant laboratory parameters, changes of vital signs, ECG changes)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives Evaluation of clinical efficacy as defined as objective response to&#xD;
      treatment (according to RECIST), progression free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP),&#xD;
      clinical benefit, quality of life (QoL) and kinetics of soluble receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective response rate (ORR) to OncoSorb® therapy, defined as the proportion of&#xD;
           patients with a confirmed CR or PR according to RECIST at efficacy evaluations I, II and&#xD;
           III (after monthly Cycles 2, 4 and 6 and continuation until disease progression)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progression free survival (PFS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to progression (TTP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical benefit of OncoSorb® therapy (defined as the proportion of patients with&#xD;
           confirmed CR, PR and stable disease [SD]) in the evaluable patient population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QoL (as assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30 rev. 3.0)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kinetics of sTNF-R1, sTNF-R2 and sIL-2R α (concentration levels pre-/post-apheresis as&#xD;
           well as determination of receptor levels during treatments). Soluble receptor levels&#xD;
           will be measured in the first 3 recruited patients at day 4 to 5 (hourly for the first 3&#xD;
           hours, every 2 hours for the following 6 hours and every 3 hours until treatment start&#xD;
           on day 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION: A total of 5 evaluable patients will be recruited, aged 18 or older.&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be identified at the NCT, Department of Medical Oncology or Department&#xD;
      of Dermatology (Prof. Enk). Patient 5 will be a patient with cutaneous metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
      One tumor lesion will be biopsied (tumor excision) in order to evaluate the induction of&#xD;
      apoptosis triggered by TNF-α. The staging examination according to RECIST criteria will be&#xD;
      conducted at the radiological department of the University of Heidelberg. Patients will&#xD;
      receive a central venous catheter for the extracorporeal treatment at the site of Prof.&#xD;
      Quentmeyer (St. Josefskrankenhaus, Heidelberg). The OncoSorb® treatment of the patients with&#xD;
      OncoSorb® as extracorporeal immune apheresis device will be conducted either at the site of&#xD;
      Prof. Rohmeiss (ze:ro dialysis center Schwetzingen) or at the site of Prof. Zeier&#xD;
      (Nierenzentrum Heidelberg). For security reasons the recruitment of patients will be in&#xD;
      consecutive order for patients 1 and 2: Patient 2 can be recruited only in the case that&#xD;
      patient 1 has finalized OncoSorb treatments until the end of cycle 2. For the recruitment of&#xD;
      subsequent patients (patients 3 to 5), no consecutive recruitment is planned. Patient 5 will&#xD;
      optionally receive another biopsy (tumor excision) on day 5 of week 3 of the second treatment&#xD;
      cycle to evaluate the biological effect of the OncoSorb treatment with respect to induction&#xD;
      of apoptosis in response to TNF-α.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY TREATMENTS: The study will start with a screening visit (day -21 to day 0) after&#xD;
      obtaining informed consent of the patient. Patients screened for recruitment of patient 5&#xD;
      must give their consent for a baseline biopsy (tumor excision) and optional for a follow-up&#xD;
      biopsy (after end of week 3 of cycle 2; tumor excision). Patients, who qualify for&#xD;
      participation and are willing to participate, will receive in this period a central venous&#xD;
      catheter for the conduction of the extracorporeal OncoSorb® therapy. During the treatment&#xD;
      period all patients will receive OncoSorb® treatments consisting of daily immune adsorption&#xD;
      treatment procedures 5 days per week for 3 weeks, followed by a resting period of one week.&#xD;
      Due to safety reasons all patients will be hospitalized at the NCT during the first week of&#xD;
      OncoSorb® treatment. Since currently no information exists about the counterregulation&#xD;
      kinetics of sTNF-R1, sTNF-R2 and sIL-2Rα upon OnsoSorb® treatment, the collection of&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) data is planned for the first 3 recruited patients. Blood samples for PK&#xD;
      measurements of these patients will be taken between day 4 and 5 of the first treatment cycle&#xD;
      under hospitalized conditions. PK data will be essential for designing an optimized treatment&#xD;
      schedule (potential reduction of both frequency and apheresis time) of subsequent patients on&#xD;
      trial. The schedule of the first 3 patients constitutes a one monthly treatment cycle. For&#xD;
      the 2 remaining patients of this study the treatment plan will be re-designed according to&#xD;
      the PK data obtained from the first 3 patients on treatment. The efficacy evaluation will be&#xD;
      carried out 8 weeks after beginning of treatment. Patients with progression of disease may be&#xD;
      withdrawn from OncoSorb® treatment. Patients with complete response (CR), partial response&#xD;
      (PR) or stable disease (SD) will be offered to continue OncoSorb® treatments until disease&#xD;
      progression. In this case efficacy evaluation (CT scans) will be performed every 8 weeks.&#xD;
