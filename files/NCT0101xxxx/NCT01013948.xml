      This is a cross-sectional study to determine the prevalence of symptomatic airway obstruction&#xD;
      using the LFQ as a screening tool in primary care patients with a history of cigarette&#xD;
      smoking and to provide descriptive data of this patient population. The study design is&#xD;
      multicenter, cross-sectional, and involves a single visit. This study is not intended to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy or safety of any investigational products. Following completion of&#xD;
      written informed consent, eligible study subjects will complete a single study visit&#xD;
      encompassing all required study assessments. Study subjects will not receive blinded study&#xD;
      medication for evaluations of efficacy and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible patients will complete a self-administered Web survey that will include the LFQ.&#xD;
      To meet both the primary and secondary aims, all patients with LFQ ≤ 18 (current cut-off for&#xD;
      obstruction), as well as 5% of patients who score &gt; 18, will be candidates for spirometric&#xD;
      assessment. Only this subset of patients will undergo pulmonary function tests. Albuterol&#xD;
      will be self-administered for determination of post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume&#xD;
      in one-second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio and post-bronchodilator FEV1&#xD;
      percentage of predicted normal. The study will end when 800 patients have been assessed&#xD;
      spirometrically or 3,000 patients have completed the LFQ (whichever criterion is achieved&#xD;
      first).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to implementation of the full study, a pilot study will be conducted at two of the&#xD;
      chosen study sites to pretest the proposed study procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of COPD is increasing throughout the world, with the vast majority of patients&#xD;
      with the disease remaining undiagnosed (Coultas et al., 2001) and underreported (Frank et&#xD;
      al., 2006; Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD], 2003; Peña et al.,&#xD;
      2000; Takahashi et al., 2003; Van Weel et al., 2002). This is highlighted in a recent study&#xD;
      that found 63% of patients with a smoking history and spirometry-confirmed COPD had no&#xD;
      mention of COPD in their medical records (Frank et al., 2006). These findings are indicative&#xD;
      of a low awareness of the condition among patients with COPD (Stratelis et al., 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of patient-completed questionnaires to assess smoking history and status, respiratory&#xD;
      symptoms, and socioeconomic status is a reliable and valid method of screening for COPD&#xD;
      diagnosis and severity (Bednarek et al., 2008). The range of conditions described as COPD has&#xD;
      led to confusion about disease terminology and difficulty with diagnosis and communication,&#xD;
      particularly in primary care (Fukuhara et al., 2005; Kesten and Chapman, 1993). Considering&#xD;
      that approximately 80% of patients diagnosed with COPD are current and previous cigarette&#xD;
      smokers, mass screening of these populations using office-based spirometry becomes an&#xD;
      attractive option (Furguson et al., 2000). A questionnaire designed to capture patient&#xD;
      answers specific to their disease condition could provide invaluable information, which, if&#xD;
      it correlates adequately with spirometry, could markedly improve diagnosis and provide&#xD;
      avenues for appropriate treatment decisions. There are data supporting the argument that the&#xD;
      prevalence of physician-diagnosed COPD is much lower than the prevalence suggested by results&#xD;
      of population-based spirometric surveys (Chapman, 2004; Fukuchi et al., 2004; Peña et al.,&#xD;
      2000; Soriano et al., 2000). Evidently, the development of a practical and reliable tool&#xD;
      could help bridge the gaps in diagnosis and disease awareness. Moreover, prevalence studies&#xD;
      underscore the need to improve awareness of COPD among cigarette-smoking populations and to&#xD;
      provide information that could potentially lead patients to seek treatment. Hence, there is a&#xD;
      need to develop a screening questionnaire able to identify patients at risk of airflow&#xD;
      obstruction, for further evaluation. The LFQ, developed for this purpose, consists of a&#xD;
      series of questions pertaining to COPD risk factors and symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, this study will aim to identify patients at risk of airflow obstruction as&#xD;
      identified by the LFQ, the results of which will be followed for confirmation through&#xD;
      subsequent spirometry in a subset of subjects. The LFQ will be evaluated against the&#xD;
      spirometry results comparatively. A minimum age limit of 30 years is selected for subject&#xD;
      participation in this study for further validation of the LFQ and to ascertain the enrollment&#xD;
      of an adequately representative subset of subjects who may be bronchitic or asymptomatic for&#xD;
      COPD, for comparison purposes with subjects with COPD. The study of this subject population&#xD;
      may increase the sensitivity of COPD diagnosis and potentially provide information that could&#xD;
      improve disease awareness and, as a consequence, possibly lead to optimization of disease&#xD;
      management in primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cross-sectional study to determine the prevalence of symptomatic airway obstruction&#xD;
      using the LFQ as a screening tool in primary care patients with a history of cigarette&#xD;
      smoking and to provide descriptive data of this patient population. The study design is&#xD;
      multicenter, cross-sectional, and involves a single visit. This study is not intended to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy or safety of any investigational products. Following completion of&#xD;
      written informed consent, eligible study subjects will complete a single study visit&#xD;
      encompassing all required study assessments. Study subjects will not receive blinded study&#xD;
      medication for evaluations of efficacy and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible patients will complete a self-administered Web survey that will include the LFQ.&#xD;
      To meet both the primary and secondary aims, all patients with LFQ ≤ 18 (current cut-off for&#xD;
      obstruction), as well as 5% of patients who score &gt; 18, will be candidates for spirometric&#xD;
      assessment. Only this subset of patients will undergo pulmonary function tests. Albuterol&#xD;
      will be self-administered for determination of post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume&#xD;
      in one-second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio and post-bronchodilator FEV1&#xD;
      percentage of predicted normal. The study will end when 800 patients have been assessed&#xD;
      spirometrically or 3,000 patients have completed the LFQ (whichever criterion is achieved&#xD;
      first).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to implementation of the full study, a pilot study will be conducted at two of the&#xD;
      chosen study sites to pretest the proposed study procedures.&#xD;
