  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standard treatment for patients with diffuse pontine tumors is radiation therapy, but less&#xD;
      than 10% of patients are cured. Adding standard chemotherapy has not improved the cure rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard treatment for high-grade astrocytomas is surgery and radiation. The surgeon removes&#xD;
      as much of the tumor as she or he can. Radiation after that tries to kill any cancer cells&#xD;
      that are left. Some patients also get chemotherapy. These are anti-cancer drugs. They can be&#xD;
      given during or after radiation. Current standard treatments do not cure many patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the doctors are adding a new medication called cetuximab to the treatment and&#xD;
      will also use a chemotherapy medication (irinotecan) that has been promising for patients&#xD;
      treated for recurrent disease.&#xD;

          <description>This is a 2-group parallel (high-grade astrocytoma, diffuse pontine tumor), single stage study investigating cetuximab in conjunction with external beam radiation therapy, followed by cetuximab and irinotecan in pediatric and young adult patients. Optional exploratory components of the study include (1) correlation of tumor molecular markers with outcome, (2) CSF proteomics, and (3) assay of serum cytokine levels in patients who develop a cetuximab-associated rash.&#xD;
cetuximab in conjunction with external beam radiation therapy, followed by cetuximab and irinotecan: External beam radiation therapy (5940 cGy in 180 cGy fractions) with weekly cetuximab (250 mg/m2/dose).4-8 weeks rest, 10 cycles of irinotecan (16 mg/m2/day x 5 consecutive days x 2 weeks) with weekly cetuximab (250 mg/m2/dose) at about 21 day intervals. Research biological evaluations will be performed in consenting patients as an optional portion of the study. Cetuximab is to be given every 7 days (+/- 2 days). Cetuximab does not need to be given on Day 1 of each week.</description>

Optional exploratory components of the study include (1) correlation of tumor molecular markers with outcome, (2) CSF proteomics, and (3) assay of serum cytokine levels in patients who develop a cetuximab-associated rash.&#xD;
cetuximab in conjunction with external beam radiation therapy, followed by cetuximab and irinotecan: External beam radiation therapy (5940 cGy in 180 cGy fractions) with weekly cetuximab (250 mg/m2/dose).4-8 weeks rest, 10 cycles of irinotecan (16 mg/m2/day x 5 consecutive days x 2 weeks) with weekly cetuximab (250 mg/m2/dose) at about 21 day intervals. Research biological evaluations will be performed in consenting patients as an optional portion of the study. Cetuximab is to be given every 7 days (+/- 2 days). Cetuximab does not need to be given on Day 1 of each week.</description>

            <description>This is a 2-group parallel (high-grade astrocytoma, diffuse pontine tumor), single stage study investigating cetuximab in conjunction with external beam radiation therapy, followed by cetuximab and irinotecan in pediatric and young adult patients. Optional exploratory components of the study include (1) correlation of tumor molecular markers with outcome, (2) CSF proteomics, and (3) assay of serum cytokine levels in patients who develop a cetuximab-associated rash.&#xD;
cetuximab in conjunction with external beam radiation therapy, followed by cetuximab and irinotecan: External beam radiation therapy (5940 cGy in 180 cGy fractions) with weekly cetuximab (250 mg/m2/dose).4-8 weeks rest, 10 cycles of irinotecan (16 mg/m2/day x 5 consecutive days x 2 weeks) with weekly cetuximab (250 mg/m2/dose) at about 21 day intervals. Research biological evaluations will be performed in consenting patients as an optional portion of the study. Cetuximab is to be given every 7 days (+/- 2 days). Cetuximab does not need to be given on Day 1 of each week.</description>
