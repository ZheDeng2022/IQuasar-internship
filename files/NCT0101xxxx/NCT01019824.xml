    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine if an experimental drug, ralfinamide, relieves your&#xD;
      neuropathic low back pain, and if it demonstrates superiority to placebo, a &quot;dummy&quot; or sugar&#xD;
      pill that contains no active medication. Ralfinamide, given as either 160 mg/day or 320&#xD;
      mg/day, taken in a divided dose twice-a-day, will be compared with placebo. If you are&#xD;
      randomly (by chance) selected to receive placebo, you will receive this medication throughout&#xD;
      the treatment period of the study. Data from this study will provide essential information&#xD;
      for choosing the doses of ralfinamide to be used in the treatment of this type of pain and&#xD;
      potentially other types of pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ralfinamide has been shown to be an effective analgesic in a number of animal models of&#xD;
      neuropathic pain. These observed effects of ralfinamide may have been achieved by targeting&#xD;
      both hyperactivity of peripheral sensory neurons, through voltage-dependent, Na+-channel&#xD;
      blockade [Stummann et al., 2005] and Ca++-channel blockade, and sensitization of central&#xD;
      neurons, through NMDA-receptor modulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence of efficacy in mixed peripheral neuropathic pain syndromes has been demonstrated in&#xD;
      Study 001 [Anand et al., 2008]. In particular patients with neuropathic pain due to nerve&#xD;
      compression (e.g., compression radiculopathy, lumbar spinal stenosis, sciatic nerve&#xD;
      compression, spinal root compression, intercostal neuralgia) showed response to ralfinamide&#xD;
      treatment. In this sub-population, statistically significant improvements in severity of&#xD;
      pain, as measured on the VAS and 11-point Likert scales, as well as a greater proportion of&#xD;
      patients meeting &quot;responder&quot; criteria, compared to the placebo group, were noted with&#xD;
      ralfinamide treatment. Similarly, patients in the study classified as having neuropathic low&#xD;
      back pain also showed significant benefit from treatment with ralfinamide; therefore, the&#xD;
      focus of the current study is on this indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and analgesic efficacy of&#xD;
      ralfinamide in patients with chronic neuropathic low back pain due to nerve compression,&#xD;
      i.e., compression radiculopathy or post-traumatic/post-surgical lumbar radiculopathy. It&#xD;
      should also be noted that no current drug therapy has global regulatory approval for treating&#xD;
      this type of chronic neuropathic low back pain; therefore, should ralfinamide prove effective&#xD;
      in this patient population, it would be satisfying an unmet medical need.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for&#xD;
             enrolment into the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patient presents in the physical/neurological examination with low back pain with&#xD;
                  or without radiation into the lower limb that must display a topography&#xD;
                  compatible with the L1 to S1 territory and/or respective sensory or motoric&#xD;
                  impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patient must have chronic neuropathic low back pain with a minimum intensity of&#xD;
                  &quot;40 mm&quot; (moderate) or greater on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS; 100-mm) at&#xD;
                  screening, and an average of &quot;40 mm&quot; or more at baseline (based on prior 7 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. The onset of pain has occurred at least three months, but not longer than 3&#xD;
                  years, prior to the screening visit, as assessed by the investigator in the&#xD;
                  patient's medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Patient is affected by current neuropathic pain (pain provoked by a lesion of the&#xD;
                  peripheral nervous system). The diagnosis should be made by a&#xD;
                  neurologist/anaesthesiologist/pain specialist and based on history, clinical&#xD;
                  evaluation and/or laboratory findings (rule out systemic cause, e.g.,&#xD;
                  hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, nephropathy, diabetes [MNSI score &gt;2]) in&#xD;
                  accordance with the taxonomy of the diagnostic criteria documented in the&#xD;
                  International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) Classification of Chronic&#xD;
                  Pain. A neurological disease must be directly correlated with pain, including&#xD;
                  pain due to spinal root compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  If radiologic data supporting the diagnosis had been obtained previously it&#xD;
                  should be documented in the patient's records. In case radiologic examinations&#xD;
                  are not available, the Investigator should consider performing these&#xD;
                  examinations, if necessary to support the diagnosis, during the screening phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Patient has one of the following causes of neuropathic low back pain: Non-cancer&#xD;
                  lumbar pain due to compression radiculopathy or post-traumatic/post-surgical&#xD;
                  lumbar radiculopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Patient's low back pain has a clear neuropathic component, as indicated by a&#xD;
                  rating on the Pain Detect Questionnaire (PD-Q) of greater than 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Patient is 18-85 years of age, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Patient is willing and able to understand and sign an approved Informed Consent&#xD;

             aged &lt; 50 years and post-menopausal condition started less than 24 months prior,&#xD;
             and/or post-menopausal status has not been confirmed by determination of the serum&#xD;
             levels of FSH and 17-β estradiol; or fecund and not practicing double contraception&#xD;
