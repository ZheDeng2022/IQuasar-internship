      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infections caused by viruses are common causes of illnesses: the common cold, many ear&#xD;
           infections, sore throats, chicken pox, and the flu are caused by different viruses.&#xD;
           Usually, these illnesses last only few days or, at most, a few weeks. Some virus&#xD;
           infections like influenza are cleared from the body, and others such as the chicken pox&#xD;
           virus remain in the body in an inactive state. However, some people may become quite ill&#xD;
           when they are infected with a particular virus, possibly because part of their immune&#xD;
           system does not respond properly to fight the virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers have discovered some reasons why a person may not be able to clear an&#xD;
           infection caused by a virus. Some persons have changes in the genes that involve the&#xD;
           immune system that result in the inability to properly control infection with a&#xD;
           particular virus. Identifying changes in genes that involve the immune system should&#xD;
           help scientists better understand how the immune system works to protect people from&#xD;
           infection and may help develop new therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study possible immune defects that may be linked to a particular severe viral&#xD;
           infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if identified immune defects are genetic in origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals of any age who have or have had a diagnosis of a virus infection that&#xD;
           physicians consider to be unusually severe, prolonged, or difficult to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relatives of the participants with a severe viral infection may also participate in the&#xD;
           study. We will use their blood and/or skin specimens to try to determine if identified&#xD;
           immune defects are hereditary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior to the study, the participant's doctor will give researchers the details of the&#xD;
           infection, along with medical records for review. Eligible participants will be invited&#xD;
           to the NIH Clinical Center for a full evaluation as an outpatient or inpatient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the Clinical Center, participants will be treated with the best available therapy for&#xD;
           the particular viral infection, and researchers will monitor how the infection responds&#xD;
           to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will take intermittent blood samples and conduct other tests (such as skin&#xD;
           biopsies) to evaluate the immune system. - During and after the illness, researchers&#xD;
           will conduct follow-up visits to determine the course of infection and response to&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Viral infections in the normal host are usually self-limited as the innate and acquired&#xD;
      immune systems mount successful antiviral responses. However, in some instances, apparently&#xD;
      immunocompetent persons manifest infections with viruses that would otherwise be observed&#xD;
      only in severely immunocompromised hosts. For example, cases of herpes simplex virus (HSV)&#xD;
      encephalitis, esophagitis orgastritis, cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis, adenovirus hepatitis or&#xD;
      pneumonitis, recurrent or persistent skin infections caused by HSV or varicella zoster virus&#xD;
      (VZV), severe warts caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), recurrent respiratory&#xD;
      papillomatosis caused by HPV, severe influenza or respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia, and&#xD;
      progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) due to JC polyomavirus have been described&#xD;
      in apparently immunocompetent patients. While a variety of case reports have described severe&#xD;
      viral infections in immunocompetent hosts, the pathogenesis of the vast majority of these&#xD;
      cases is not understood, and therapy can be unsuccessful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this protocol, we will evaluate patients without known immunocompromise, who have severe,&#xD;
      persistent, or treatment-refractory viral infections caused by herpesviruses, adenoviruses,&#xD;
      polyoma viruses, papillomaviruses, or other viral infections. We will investigate whether&#xD;
      certain host or virologic factors predispose these individuals to severe disease. We will&#xD;
      also determine the usefulness of various microbiologic tests (e.g., cultures, serology,&#xD;
      molecular assays) for following the course of infection in these patients. The physicians in&#xD;
      the Clinical Center will provide optimal therapy for these patients, as part of standard of&#xD;
      care. Identification of virologic or host factors that predispose these patients to severe&#xD;
      viral infections may have important implications for elucidating the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      infection and for the development of novel therapies.&#xD;

        The study population will be drawn from referrals from the Clinical Center staff,&#xD;
        physicians at outside medical facilities, and self-referrals. Patients or relatives who&#xD;
        meet the inclusion and/or exclusion criteria, but who are not able to travel to the NIH&#xD;
        Clinical Center, may be enrolled in the study and will be evaluated for immune defects&#xD;
        using mailed-in blood samples or clinical specimens (i.e. previously obtained biopsy&#xD;
        specimens).&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        (Participants)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants must meet all the following inclusion criteria in order to participate in this&#xD;
        study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Children or adults (regardless of age) without a known or fully defined&#xD;
             immunodeficiency and with a definitively diagnosed severe viral infection, including&#xD;
             infection caused by herpesviruses (HSV-1, HSV-2, CMV, EBV, VZV, HHV-6, HHV-7, HHV-8),&#xD;
             human papillomavirus (e.g., severe recalcitrant warts), adenovirus, polyomavirus (such&#xD;
             as JC virus and BK virus), or influenza virus. Viral infections that would be&#xD;
             considered &quot;opportunistic-like&quot;, such as herpesvirus esophagitis, herpesvirus&#xD;
             encephalitis, CMV colitis, or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (caused by&#xD;
             the JC polyoma virus), will be of particular interest in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
             OR&#xD;
&#xD;
             Children or adults with a well-documented prior, severe, persistent, or treatment&#xD;
             refractory viral infection(s), who have clinically recovered from the viral infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Ongoing care by a referring physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Willingness to allow storage of blood and tissue samples for future analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        (Relatives)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Relatives (2 years or above) may be recruited to establish the genetic origin of immune&#xD;
        defects that may be identified in the study subjects. We may obtain blood, buccal swabs or&#xD;
        a skin biopsy from the relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Males and females will be accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Adult relatives or the guardians of minor relatives must be willing and capable of&#xD;
             providing informed consent after review of protocol procedures that are described in&#xD;
             the consent form with an appropriate study team member.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participating relatives agree to have blood stored for future studies of the immune&#xD;
             system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants meeting any of the following exclusion criteria at baseline will be excluded&#xD;
        from study participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with previously diagnosed conditions associated with immunodeficiency (e.g.,&#xD;
             a history of HIV infection or a positive test for HIV) or patients with conditions&#xD;
             requiring either daily systemic corticosteroids exceeding a dose equivalent to10&#xD;
             mg/day of prednisone or other significant immunosuppressant therapy (e.g., organ or&#xD;
             stem cell transplant recipients).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Patients will be included if treatment with steroids or other immunosuppressive&#xD;
             medication was begun to reduce disease associated with the infection and instituted&#xD;
             AFTER the viral disease began.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Women who are pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any condition or major comorbidity that the study investigators believe will&#xD;
             compromise the patient's ability to comply with the requirements of the study.&#xD;
