      1. This study will evaluate the association between changes in basic cognitive and&#xD;
           behavioral functioning by the end of chemotherapy treatment, and the later development&#xD;
           of higher order executive functions in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The association between acute treatment-related changes in brain integrity and&#xD;
           subsequent brain maturation in long-term survivors of pediatric ALL will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The association between patterns of behavioral and executive dysfunction and brain&#xD;
           maturation in long-term survivors of pediatric ALL will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The association between genetic polymorphisms in key enzyme pathways and higher order&#xD;
           brain development in long-term survivors of pediatric ALL will be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The associations between biologic and behavioral indices of fatigue/sleep and higher&#xD;
           order brain development in long-term survivors of pediatric ALL will be explored.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Survival rates for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) now exceed 80%. With this&#xD;
      growing population of long-term survivors comes recognition that a considerable proportion&#xD;
      experience one or more significant late effects. For children undergoing central nervous&#xD;
      system (CNS) treatment, common late effects include neurocognitive impairment and&#xD;
      neurobehavioral problems. Although these problems first manifest as subtle difficulties with&#xD;
      attention and processing speed, they can evolve into deficits in higher order brain functions&#xD;
      that significantly impact functional skills in a subset of long-term survivors. There&#xD;
      currently is no method to accurately identify patients at greatest risk for these long-term&#xD;
      behavioral and neurocognitive problems. Through this proposal, this study plans to utilize&#xD;
      existing data collected during acute treatment to identify predictors of long-term&#xD;
      neurocognitive and brain maturation outcomes. The study also proposes to collect data on&#xD;
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and associated comorbidities, higher order&#xD;
      executive functions, and structural and functional brain imaging in survivors who are at&#xD;
      least 8 years of age and greater than 5 years from diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo a single neurocognitive evaluation focused on assessment of higher&#xD;
      order executive functions. Patients will be evaluated during their regularly scheduled annual&#xD;
      follow-up visit, when health-related monitoring will also occur. Parents of participants will&#xD;
      be asked to complete questionnaires designed to assess the family environment and the impact&#xD;
      of cancer diagnosis on family functioning and parent stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain Imaging: To better demonstrate untoward treatment effects upon cortical brain&#xD;
      development, quantitative MR imaging of myelin integrity using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)&#xD;
      and cortical thickness assessment using high resolution volumetric imaging will be utilized.&#xD;
      All patients will also be evaluated using functional MRI (fMRI) procedures during resting&#xD;
      state and participation in attention and working memory tasks. fMRI and DTI data will be&#xD;
      de-identified then analyzed at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas.&#xD;

    <description>The primary neurocognitive outcome will be performance on measures of cognitive flexibility and cognitive fluency. Functional behavior will be evaluated via the child or adult version of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, using parent respondent for each version. The presence of ADHD and common comorbid conditions (i.e. depression, anxiety) will be determined with structured diagnostic interviews. Quality of life will be re-assessed with the PedQL.</description>
