      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as conatumumab, can block tumor growth in different&#xD;
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and&#xD;
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      gemcitabine hydrochloride and capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy&#xD;
      may uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving conatumumab together with gemcitabine&#xD;
      hydrochloride, capecitabine, and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of conatumumab when&#xD;
      given together with gemcitabine hydrochloride, capecitabine, and radiation therapy and to see&#xD;
      how well they work in treating patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the maximum tolerated dose of conatumumab up to a target dose of 10 mg/kg&#xD;
           given concurrently with capecitabine and radiotherapy following induction therapy&#xD;
           comprising conatumumab and gemcitabine hydrochloride in patients with locally advanced&#xD;
           pancreatic cancer. (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety profile in patients treated with this regimen. (Phase I and II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase&#xD;
           II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the primary tumor response rate in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
           (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To generate translational research hypotheses. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I dose-escalation study of conatumumab, followed by a&#xD;
      phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive conatumumab IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 15&#xD;
           and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats&#xD;
           every 28 days for 2 courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conatumumab and chemoradiotherapy: Beginning 14-42 days after the last course of&#xD;
           induction therapy, patients undergo 3-dimensional radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a&#xD;
           week, for 5½ weeks (28 treatments). Patients also receive conatumumab IV over 30-60&#xD;
           minutes on days 1, 15, and 29 and oral capecitabine twice daily, 5 days a week, for 5½&#xD;
           weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maintenance therapy: Beginning 28-56 days after completion of chemoradiotherapy,&#xD;
           patients receive conatumumab IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 15 and gemcitabine&#xD;
           hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in&#xD;
           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;
