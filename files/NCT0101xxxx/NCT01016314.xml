      This is a multi-center, prospective randomized clinical study to evaluate the clinical&#xD;
      outcome of subjects with DDD who are treated with ALIF and supplemental posterior fixation&#xD;
      using Aspen compared to pedicle screw instrumentation. The study will involve up to&#xD;
      approximately 25 investigational sites and enroll up to 156 67 subjects. The randomization&#xD;
      ratio of two Aspen subjects to one pedicle screw subject (2:1) will be utilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with lumbar DDD who are candidates for ALIF at a single level will be screened for&#xD;
      inclusion in the study. If the subject meets all of the eligibility criteria, they will be&#xD;
      enrolled and randomized to either the Aspen or pedicle screw group. Subjects will continue to&#xD;
      be followed by the guidelines set forth in this clinical protocol, which include: a&#xD;
      postoperative discharge exam; six week, three month, six month, and one year post-op visits;&#xD;
      and, concludes with a two year post-op visit. The follow-up is counted from the day of&#xD;
      surgery. The enrollment period is expected to be approximately 12 months and subjects will be&#xD;
      followed for 2 years post-op for the duration of the clinical investigation. The anticipated&#xD;
      duration of the study is approximated to be 3 years.&#xD;
