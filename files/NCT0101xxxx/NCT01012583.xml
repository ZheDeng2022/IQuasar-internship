      BACKGROUND Treatment of coronary atherosclerotic disease has been significantly advanced by&#xD;
      interventional cardiology, and the advent of coronary arterial stents. In comparison to&#xD;
      angioplasty alone, stents have reduced the incidence of angiographic as well as clinical&#xD;
      restenosis, the recurrence of angina, the need for coronary arterial bypass graft (CABG)&#xD;
      surgery, repeat revascularization and the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events&#xD;
      (MACE).However the long-term success of this therapy has been limited by the occurrence of&#xD;
      in-stent restenosis. Despite the effectiveness of intracoronary stents in maintaining a&#xD;
      larger luminal diameter, as compared to angioplasty alone, in-stent restenosis occurs within&#xD;
      6 to 9 months after stent placement in 15% to 35% of patients. While stents can reduce&#xD;
      restenosis by blocking vascular recoil and remodeling, mechanical intervention alone has been&#xD;
      incapable of treating this biological problem of neointimal hyperplasia, particularly in the&#xD;
      subset of patients with diabetes, long lesions or small vessel disease.Drug-eluting stents&#xD;
      (DES) were developed as a viable method for focused delivery of anti-restenosis compounds to&#xD;
      target lesions for the reduction of restenosis. Of the DES available and with the results of&#xD;
      up to six (6) years clinical follow-up, the sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) has become the&#xD;
      current gold standard for stent implantation. With the advent of using DES to treat complex&#xD;
      lesions such as longer lesions requiring the use of multiple stents and the use in&#xD;
      bifurcation lesions, the risk of stent thrombosis has increase.Late stent thrombosis has also&#xD;
      been reported following DES implantation.Long term treatment with dual anti-platelet therapy&#xD;
      following stent implantation has become the solution used to counteract the risk of stent&#xD;
      thrombosis, this solution does not come without it's own risks and is an expensive therapy.&#xD;
      Another specific problem of DES is delayed endothelization, and this may be and attributing&#xD;
      factor in prolonging the period of thrombotic risk as shown by pathological findings at&#xD;
      autopsy following SES implantation. These examinations have shown that even after 16 months,&#xD;
      neointimal healing is still incomplete with approximately 20% of stent struts being found&#xD;
      uncovered. Questions have arose that the problems of late thrombosis and delayed&#xD;
      endothelization of stent struts with DES could be the result of the permanent polymer that is&#xD;
      used as the bonding agent for the anti-restenosis compounds to the stents.Intravascular&#xD;
      Ultrasound (IVUS) along with angiography has been the techniques used to gain data on DES to&#xD;
      this point. Angiography is a 2 dimensional tool that gives a view of the vessel and IVUS&#xD;
      gives a more 3 dimensional view of the vessel. IVUS does have its limitations, as stent&#xD;
      struts are reflectors of sonic waves, shadowing around and behind the struts occurs. IVUS is&#xD;
      also limited in detecting malapposition of the struts to the vessel wall especially if the&#xD;
      area between the vessel wall and the strut in very small.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is an optical analogue of IVUS that uses an&#xD;
      infrared light source and measures the backscatter of the light. With this technique a higher&#xD;
      level of resolution compared with IVUS has been reported.OCT has been reported as being able&#xD;
      to visualize and detect atherosclerotic plaques and assess more accurately strut&#xD;
      malapposition and the presence or thickness of neointimal hyperplasia as compared to IVUS.&#xD;
      With the question of delayed endothelization due to the permanent polymer being a probable&#xD;
      risk for late stent thrombosis, it is felt that OCT post stent implantation may give a more&#xD;
      accurate assessment of stent strut endothelial coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to compare the intimal hyperplasia following implantation of the Excel&#xD;
      DES with a biodegradable polymer vs. the Cypher DES with a permanent polymer using OCT.&#xD;
