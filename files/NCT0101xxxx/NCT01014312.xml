      This research study develop a collaborative depression care management model (C-DCM) that&#xD;
      encourages collaboration between primary care physicians (PCPs) and trained social workers&#xD;
      employed by community-based, public and nonprofit mental health clinics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depression affects 5%-9% of older primary care patients, is often chronic or recurrent&#xD;
      and disabling, and leads to frequent use of medical services. Most depressed elders are&#xD;
      treated by primary care physicians (PCPs) and prior research has shown that collaboration&#xD;
      between primary care physicians and depression care managers is effective in treating&#xD;
      depression. The challenge has been in securing third-party reimbursement for such services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study will address this barrier by developing a collaborative depression care&#xD;
      management model (C-DCM) that encourages collaboration between PCPs and trained social&#xD;
      workers employed by community-based, public and nonprofit mental health clinics. In addition&#xD;
      to developing C-DCM, a total of 112 primary care outpatients will participate in this study&#xD;
      to test whether C-DCM is more effective than the standard of care in decreasing the severity&#xD;
      of depression and disability experienced by older adults. Each subject will be randomized&#xD;
      into either Usual Care or C-DCM. All subjects will be assessed at Baseline and at 2 and 4&#xD;
      months while the C-DCM subjects will also meet with social worker depression case managers&#xD;
      bi-weekly over four months. If shown effective, C-DCM may bring to bear an available, yet&#xD;
      untapped resource in the care of depressed elders.&#xD;

    <description>Depression Care Management (DCM) includes: 1. Monitoring the course of the depressive disorder; 2. Contacting the referring primary care physician (PCP) and offering information on the patients' current psychiatric status and medical complaints and the treatment recommended by published pharmacotherapy guidelines; 3. Determining the nature and extent of stressors affecting the patients' clinical status and functioning; 4. Psychoeducation concerning depression and depression treatment, working with the patient to select an appropriate treatment based on informed treatment preferences, and emphasizing treatment adherence; and 5. Supportive psychotherapy.</description>

    <description>Primary Care Physicians will be informed by letter from a study psychologist of the participants' depression diagnosis and of suicidal ideation when present. They will have no direct assistance regarding depression treatment, but they will be educated on guideline-based antidepressant treatment recommendations. Moreover, research assistants will use a suicide risk protocol at baseline and at all follow-up assessment periods that mandates immediate contact with PCPs by telephone or beeper in cases with significant risk.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 60 years and older: This study focuses on the clinical complexities of late-life&#xD;
             depression and its treatment. Family Services of Westchester (our partner community&#xD;
             mental health agency) offers geriatric mental health counseling services to adults age&#xD;
             60 and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of unipolar major depression&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MADRS score &gt;=18: Depression of such severity in primary care patients requires&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CANE score &gt;0: Reflects the presence of at least one unmet need in the domains of&#xD;
             housing, self-care, safety, finances, benefits, legal matters, transportation, etc.&#xD;
             and thus need for social services.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capacity to provide written consent for both research assessment and depression care&#xD;
             management: PCPs will be asked to clinically evaluate prospective participants'&#xD;
             capacity to consent and document it in their medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Working knowledge of English: Command in English sufficient for comprehending&#xD;
             questionnaires of the study and/or for understanding the DCM therapists. English does&#xD;
             not have to be the subject's first language.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychotic depression: This will be determined by the Structured Clinical Interview for&#xD;
             DSM Disorders(SCID) assessment; presence of delusions and or hallucinations. This is a&#xD;
             severe disorder typically referred for treatment to mental health specialists.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active suicidal ideation: This will be determined by the SCID and MADRS assessments.&#xD;
             Older patients at these levels of risk for self-harm typically are referred to mental&#xD;
             health specialists.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Antisocial personality by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&#xD;
             (DSM)IV: This disorder will possibly interfere with adherence to research procedures&#xD;
             and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant Cognitive Impairment (MMSE score &lt;24) or clinical diagnosis of dementia by&#xD;
             DSM-IV: These conditions may limit the patient's ability to participate in treatment&#xD;
             and require social service interventions exceeding those available through the&#xD;
             proposed depression care management models.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current participation in specialist psychiatric care: Such patients will require the&#xD;
             development of collaborative arrangements for depression care management which differ&#xD;
             from those being tested in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute or severe medical illness: i.e., delirium, metastatic cancer, decompensated&#xD;
             cardiac, liver or kidney failure, major surgery, stroke or myocardial infarction&#xD;
             during the three months prior to entry; or drugs often causing depression, e.g.,&#xD;
             steroids, reserpine, alpha-methyl-dopa, tamoxifen, vincristine.&#xD;
