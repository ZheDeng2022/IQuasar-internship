    <textblock>
      Myopia is the main reason of vision loss in the world which is seen in 30.4 million adults in&#xD;
      USA (1). In a myopic eye, images are focused in front of retina because, cornea and&#xD;
      crystalline lens become more powerful in focusing the image or the eye axis become too long&#xD;
      (axial myopia) (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myopia prevalence in adolescents has been raised in recent years and nowadays it has reached&#xD;
      to 10-25% and 60-80% in western and eastern countries respectively (3). Tehran eye study&#xD;
      showed that the prevalence of myopia in Tehran is 21.8% and 17.2% based on manifest and&#xD;
      cycloplegic refraction respectively (4). One study in Dezful, Iran showed that 3.7% of 7-15&#xD;
      years old children are myopic (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today potential role of early life nutrition in myopia development in later life is becoming&#xD;
      an attractive field of study. It has been shown that until weaning; breast milk is the main&#xD;
      source of many nutrients [such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)] which are important for&#xD;
      photoreceptors and cortical neuronal development (6). But results about the relationship&#xD;
      between breastfeeding and likelihood of childhood myopia are controversial. A&#xD;
      hypothesis-generating study (7) showed an independent and inverse relationship between&#xD;
      breastfeeding and likelihood of myopia in 10-12 year old Singaporean children. However, data&#xD;
      pulled from three English birth cohorts done in 10-11y and 15-16y children did not show any&#xD;
      effect (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the association between breastfeeding pattern and likelihood of myopia in 6-7y&#xD;
      children, a retrospective case-control study is designed in National Nutrition and Food&#xD;
      Technology research Institute of Iran. This study will try to assess breastfeeding pattern&#xD;
      and almost all cofactors which may relate to myopia.&#xD;

      For proper vision, eyes need to focus exactly on images. The two main determinants of&#xD;
      refraction are focus power of cornea and the eye's axis length. In normal eyes, images are&#xD;
      formed exactly on retina (emmetropia), but farsightedness (hyperopia) is the situation in&#xD;
      which, the eye forms images in the backside of retina and nearsightedness (myopia) is a&#xD;
      situation in which images are formed in front of retina, and it may have two reasons: 1) the&#xD;
      lens convexity is more powerful than normal and 2) the eye axis is longer than normal (axial&#xD;
      myopia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Refractive errors are measured in diopter (D), and myopia is specified with a negative sign.&#xD;
      Severity of myopia is categorized into 3 levels. 1) Mild (0 to -1.5D), 2) moderate (-1.5D to&#xD;
      -6.0D) and 3) and severe myopia (-6.0D or above). Pathogenic myopia develops, when this&#xD;
      condition advances to -8.0 D and above. Visual disorders - moderate retina disorders,&#xD;
      cataract, and glaucoma - may be seen in patients with moderate and severe myopia. At birth,&#xD;
      most infants are hyperopic but this condition lowers when they grow up and by the age 5-8,&#xD;
      eyes must be emmetropic (normal and without any refractive error) (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nearsightedness is seen in 30.4 million adults in USA (1). It's prevalence in adolescents is&#xD;
      remarkably increased in last decades and today its prevalence in industrialized western and&#xD;
      eastern societies are increased into 10-25 and 60-80 percent respectively (3). For American&#xD;
      society, 60 percent of myopia can be categorized as early myopia (in childhood/school ages)&#xD;
      which is usually in ages 9-11 years, and increases in adolescence years, and decreases in&#xD;
      late adolescence and beginning of 20th decade of life, and usually stops at -3 to -4 D(9,10).&#xD;
      A study in Tehran (4) showed that prevalence of myopia is 21.8 and 56.6 percent based on&#xD;
      manifest and cycloplegic refraction respectively. Another study showed a high prevalence of&#xD;
      myopia in schoolchildren from Kashan, Iran (11). Also a study in Dezful, Iran showed that&#xD;
      prevalence of myopia in 7-15y and 14-18y children are 3.4 and 33 percent respectively (12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Factors related to myopia can be divided into two groups: 1) hereditary and 2) environmental.&#xD;
      Relationship between heredity and likelihood of myopia has been shown in many studies (13,&#xD;
      14). These studies obviously showed the effect of parental myopia on moderate levels of&#xD;
      childhood myopia. Today different areas on several chromosomes are known for severe myopia&#xD;
      (such like 18p, 12q, 7q36, TGIF) (15-17). Although it seems that two of these chromosomes&#xD;
      (18q, 12q) do not have any relationship with childhood myopia (18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Environmental factors which studies have shown that may be in relation with myopia are: near&#xD;
      work (19, 20), stature (21, 22), night time light exposure (10) [however this relationship&#xD;
      was not confirmed neither in American (20) and English children and nor in Indian monkeys&#xD;
      (23, 24)], day time light exposure (25), refined sugar consumption [It has been shown that&#xD;
      carbohydrate consumption can stimulate a series of events which lead to eye's axial length&#xD;
      increase and consequently myopia. So refined sugar consumption which has been increased&#xD;
      nowadays may play a role.] (26), IQ (Intelligence quotient) (27-33), birth weight, social and&#xD;
      economic condition (7), physical activity (32), and breastfeeding (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasing prevalence of myopia, particularly in Asian urban children, confirms that life&#xD;
      style in childhood and infancy may play a role (3). Today potential effect of early life&#xD;
      nutrition on myopia development in later life is becoming an attractive field of study.&#xD;
      Breastfeeding has been related to neural development which affects visual acuity. Up to&#xD;
      weaning, breastfeeding is the main source of many micronutrients [including docosahexanoic&#xD;
      acid (DHA)], which are important for light receptors and brain neural development (6). A&#xD;
      study which was done in Singapore showed that breastfeeding is independently related to&#xD;
      likelihood of myopia after controlling for cofactors (7). But this study had some limitations&#xD;
      which may affect the results. This study had a small population size and its participants&#xD;
      were from one school. All factors relating to myopia were not controlled by this study.&#xD;
      However, data pulled from three English birth cohorts done in 10-11y and 15-16y children did&#xD;
      not show any effect (8). Hence, results about the relationship between breastfeeding and&#xD;
      likelihood of childhood myopia are controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the association between breastfeeding pattern and likelihood of myopia in 6-7y&#xD;
      children, a retrospective case-control study is designed in National Nutrition and Food&#xD;
      Technology research Institute of Iran. This study will try to assess almost all cofactors&#xD;
      which may relate to myopia; such as child's age, sex, height, birth weight, maternal age at&#xD;
      delivery, IQ (intelligence quotient), near work, parental education and ethnicity, parental&#xD;
      myopia, child n-3(omega-3) fatty acid and refined carbohydrate intake, maternal n-3 fatty&#xD;
      acid intake, n-3 fatty acid intake while infancy, physical activity and other confounding&#xD;
      factors which may have an effect on the relationship among breastfeeding pattern and myopia.&#xD;
