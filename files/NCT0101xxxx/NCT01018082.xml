  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this 2-year pilot project is to utilize interdisciplinary strategies to&#xD;
      determine the prevalence and type of neurodevelopmental impairment in PHACE syndrome, a rare&#xD;
      vascular syndrome, and to rapidly translate discovery into clinical care guidelines that will&#xD;
      identify at risk infants so early intervention can be initiated. Infantile hemangioma is the&#xD;
      most common benign tumor of infancy, with an incidence estimated between 4-5%. A subgroup of&#xD;
      patients with infantile hemangiomas exhibits additional associated structural anomalies of&#xD;
      the brain, cerebral vasculature, eyes, aorta, heart, and chest wall in the rare&#xD;
      neurocutaneous disorder called PHACE syndrome (OMIM 606519). PHACE refers to Posterior fossa&#xD;
      anomalies, Hemangioma, Arterial lesions, Cardiac abnormalities/aortic coarctation, and&#xD;
      abnormalities of the Eye. Affected children have multi-organ involvement, and an increasing&#xD;
      number of cerebral, cerebellar, and cerebrovascular anomalies are being described; however,&#xD;
      the significance of these neuroradiologic findings is not known. As the investigators'&#xD;
      neonates with hemangiomas have grown into young children, neurodevelopmental impairment has&#xD;
      become more evident, even among patients without MRI evidence of stroke or structural brain&#xD;
      anomalies. Some infants develop progressive cerebral arterial disease leading to a&#xD;
      moyamoya-like vasculopathy and ischemic stroke. An interdisciplinary research project&#xD;
      studying brain and cerebral vascular imaging in concert with neurological, psychological,&#xD;
      behavioral, neurodevelopmental, and quality of life outcome measures has never been&#xD;
      conducted. Diagnostic and management guidelines are also lacking. The investigators'&#xD;
      long-term goal is to develop medical and/or surgical therapeutic interventions that improve&#xD;
      the overall health of children with PHACE syndrome. This novel project constitutes the first&#xD;
      study of the most devastating feature of PHACE syndrome: the neurodevelopmental sequelae.&#xD;

      Aim 1) Establish a cohort of 30 well-characterized patients with PHACE syndrome and enhance&#xD;
      existing tissue and DNA banks to facilitate future investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use rigorous phenotyping strategies to establish a cohort of 30 patients with PHACE&#xD;
      syndrome 4-6 years of age, and collect neuroimaging studies and patient tissue and DNA&#xD;
      samples to enhance an existing tissue repository to facilitate future studies, such as&#xD;
      validation of biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2) Determine the prevalence and describe the spectrum of neurodevelopmental impairment in&#xD;
      a cohort of patients 4-6 years of age with PHACE syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the multiple risk factors for neurodevelopmental deficits in PHACE patients, we propose&#xD;
      a comprehensive assessment of a cohort of patients 4-6 years of age, this age range&#xD;
      represents a critical period, as it is the time that most children enter the formal&#xD;
      educational system and it allows for a more thorough evaluation of neurodevelopmental skills.&#xD;
      Upon completion of this 2-year study we expect to have immediate impact on clinical care by&#xD;
      identifying specific deficits in this cohort. Once identified and quantified, we will publish&#xD;
      the data with clinical guidelines for patient management including age and frequency of&#xD;
      neuroimaging, frequency of neurologic evaluation, and age and utility of neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      assessment. We anticipate that these guidelines will identify at risk infants and early&#xD;
      intervention can be initiated, resulting in improved functional outcomes. In addition, this&#xD;
      data will provide a cost-effective functional outcome methodology that can be used for&#xD;
      clinical trials and to validate biomarkers identified in this pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3) Identify potential clinical, molecular, biochemical, and imaging biomarkers aimed at&#xD;
      early detection and risk stratification of cerebrovasculopathy and neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that certain risk factors including, but not limited to, genotype, hemangioma&#xD;
      size, hemangioma location, cerebral anomalies, cerebellar anomalies, and cerebrovascular&#xD;
      anomalies predispose patients to progressive vasculopathy. We will determine risk factors and&#xD;
      identify biomarkers for progressive cerebrovascular disease. Based on this information we&#xD;
      will establish guidelines for serial and diagnostic cerebrovascular imaging and develop a&#xD;
      method of risk-stratification that will allow for early clinical prediction and intervention&#xD;
      of long-term neurodevelopmental prognosis. Specific Aims&#xD;
