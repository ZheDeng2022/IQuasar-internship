      Introduction: Administration of radiographic contrast agents often result in a reversible&#xD;
      acute reduction in renal function that begins soon after contrast dye administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of contrast induced nephropathy varies from 5% to 50% depending on the&#xD;
      patients' population and the criteria for contrast induced nephropathy (CIN), definition used&#xD;
      and it is considered as one of the leading causes of hospital acquired acute renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of contrast-induced nephropathy is uncertain. There are two main theories.&#xD;
      According to the first one a possible influence on renal hemodynamics, mainly&#xD;
      vasoconstriction, resulting in medullary ischemia possibly mediated by an alteration in&#xD;
      endothelin and adenosine. In addition to direct vasoconstriction of renal vessels, iodinated&#xD;
      contrast agents also block an important pathway for vasodilation and autoregulation possibly&#xD;
      by reducing the production of nitric oxide. And according to the other main theory contrast&#xD;
      agents exert direct toxic effects on tubular epithelial cells. It seems that reactive oxygen&#xD;
      species have a role in CIN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A lot of studies had examined the incidence of contrast agent-associated nephrotoxicity&#xD;
      mainly in stable patients undergoing elective radiographic procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous agents have been examined for their ability to prevent contrast-induced decreases in&#xD;
      renal function. Among them the use of low-osmolarity, non anionic contrast agents, and&#xD;
      prophylactic hydration have reduced the incidence of CIN. Administration of drugs such as&#xD;
      calcium antagonists, theophyllin, dopamine and atrial natriuretic peptide does not prevent&#xD;
      CIN. In some studies antioxidant agents like acetylcysteine and ascorbic acid seem to reduce&#xD;
      the incidence of CIN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critically ill patients represent an absolutely discrete group because they may have acute&#xD;
      decrease in renal function, multiple organ failure and they often receive multiple&#xD;
      potentially nephrotoxic agents like antibiotics, vasoconstrictives, NSAIDs etc. Critically&#xD;
      ill patients frequently required radiographic studies with contrast agent administration in&#xD;
      order to improve diagnostic accuracy in the detection of abscesses, or in the diagnosis of&#xD;
      suspected embolism. Radiographic studies are often done on an emergent or urgent basis so&#xD;
      there is not enough time for patients to receive prophylactic regiments. Despite improvements&#xD;
      in supportive care, acute renal failure increases the morbidity and mortality rates in&#xD;
      critically ill patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We think that it is important initially to investigate the incidence of CIN in critically ill&#xD;
      patients a fact that is not established (there is only one retrospective cohort study) and&#xD;
      after that to see the impact of a combination of prophylactic strategies in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to prevent CIN in high risk patients will result in significant public health&#xD;
      benefits by reducing in-hospital mortality, the hospital stay and the need for dialysis and&#xD;
      subsequent the devastating cost of hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      N-acetylcysteine is a reduced thiol, which is a potent antioxidant that may scavenge a wide&#xD;
      variety of oxygen derived free radicals. Ascorbic acid is a potent antioxidant capable of&#xD;
      scavenging a wide array of reactive oxygen species and additionally it can regenerate other&#xD;
      antioxidants. Acetylcysteine and ascorbic acid are inexpensive treatments with generally mild&#xD;
      adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods: This study represent a prospective randomized open label controlled&#xD;
      trial. The study will take place in the intensive care unit of the University Hospital of&#xD;
      Larissa. Consecutive sampling will be used to recruit patients hospitalized in the ICU&#xD;
      department between October of 2009 and October of 2010. The patients who undergo radiographic&#xD;
      studies with the administration of contrast agent will be randomly assigned to receive IV&#xD;
      either 1200mg acetylcysteine and 2g ascorbic acid or placebo at least 2 hours before the&#xD;
      start of the index procedure, followed by 1200mg acetylcysteine and 1,5g ascorbic acid or&#xD;
      placebo the night and the morning after the examination. All the patients independently from&#xD;
      the randomization will receive hydration with at least 100ml/h IV 0,9% or 0,45% sodium&#xD;
      chloride in water, from randomization until at least 6 hours after the examination. The&#xD;
      variation of the hydration type and rate allowed for adjustment according the special needs&#xD;
      of every patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An acute contrast induced reduction in renal function was defined as an increase in the serum&#xD;
      creatinine concentration of at least 0,5mg/dl at 72 hours after the injection of the&#xD;
      radiocontrast medium or a relative rise of at least 25% fro baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline serum creatinine and urea concentration will be measured from blood sample drawn at&#xD;
      the time of randomization, and the follow-up serum urea and creatinine concentration will be&#xD;
      measured the 1st, the 2nd and 3rd day after the examination. At the same time intervals we&#xD;
      will study the renal function using more sensitive tests like serum cystatin and serum&#xD;
      lipocalin (NGAL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also will examine the plasma total antioxidant status from blood and urine samples drawn&#xD;
      at the time of randomization at the beginning of the procedure and during the following&#xD;
      morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The daily urine output will also be registered the day before the study and the three&#xD;
      subsequent days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Authorization has been given from the Scientific Council and the Ethical Committee of our&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and biochemical characteristics of the study patients will include demographic data,&#xD;
      diagnosis on admission in ICU, APACHE II score on admission and before randomization, medical&#xD;
      history as the presence of cardiac insufficiency, hypertension, coronary disease, hepatic&#xD;
      insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, nephrotoxic medications which patients&#xD;
      receive like antibiotics, NSAID, chemotherapeutic agents, diuretics, inotropic and&#xD;
      vasopressor agents, ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonists,mechanical ventilation during ICU,&#xD;
      ICU length of stay, and ICU outcome, the need for renal replacement therapy, the quantity of&#xD;
      received radiocontrast agent and the route of administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis. All analysis will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis and&#xD;
      probability values will be 2-sided. Data will presented as mean +/- SD and 95% CI for&#xD;
      continuous variables and as percentage for discrete variables. Analysis will performed using&#xD;
      statistical software, SISS 15 for Windows. Data will be compared between the two groups.&#xD;
      Characteristics will be compared using the x2 test and the t-test.&#xD;
