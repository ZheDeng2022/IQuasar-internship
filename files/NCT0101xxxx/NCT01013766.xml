  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is the second administration of GSK1362885 in humans. GSK1362885 is a novel,&#xD;
      potent inhibitor of human glycogen phosphorylase (GP) under development for the treatment of&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study will investigate the compound's safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics in subjects with Type 2 Diabetes&#xD;
      Mellitus.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is the first administration of single doses of GSK1362885 to the target population with&#xD;
      T2DM. Based on the mechanism of action which involves reducing hepatic glucose output, it is&#xD;
      possible that day time (AM) or night time (PM) dosing of GSK1362885 could produce different&#xD;
      plasma glucose lowering effects, acting either on prandial or post-absorptive elevations of&#xD;
      HGO. This study is designed to compare glucose profiles following AM and PM doses to&#xD;
      determine if there is any advantage to either one. This study will compare glucose profiles&#xD;
      following a single dose of GSK1362885 in the morning before breakfast (AM) to a single dose&#xD;
      administered at night (PM). These two dosing periods will be randomized and each subject will&#xD;
      receive both dosing regimens. A third dosing period (BID) is not randomized, but is included&#xD;
      to explore the effects of GSK1362885 on glucose profiles when administered twice daily in a&#xD;
      24 hour timeframe.&#xD;
