      Heart failure patients with left bundle branch block have a poor prognosis. Biventricular&#xD;
      pacing which synchronize the heart pump action is associated with improved functional&#xD;
      capacity. This study aims to evaluate the basic changes in skeletal muscle functioning after&#xD;
      a period of biventricular pacing in 21 patients with heart failure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Congestive heart failure (CHF) is the most common hospital discharge diagnosis in elderly&#xD;
      patients . Fatigue and dyspnea with exercise intolerance and a poor quality of life are the&#xD;
      main characteristics of this syndrome , and it is associated with substantial mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity , .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the systolic dysfunction has been recognized as the primum movens of CHF, it is now&#xD;
      generally accepted that the progression of the syndrome is not solely related to the pump&#xD;
      failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neuro-endocrine model has reached a wide consensus as one of the basic mechanisms for&#xD;
      progressive heart failure based on the good results obtained by ACE-inhibitor therapy . A&#xD;
      decade ago the cytokine model was added to explain the syndrome of heart failure . The&#xD;
      cytokines are highly potent endogenous peptides produced by different cell types . Elevated&#xD;
      levels might be markers for cardiac cachexia, but they may also play an important role in the&#xD;
      mechanism of CHF progression . Subsequently, the muscle hypothesis was proposed as an&#xD;
      explanation for the deconditioning in CHF patients . In skeletal muscle from healthy&#xD;
      individuals there is a balanced distribution between type I fibres (aerobic), type IIA fibres&#xD;
      (both aerobic and anaerobic) and type IIB fibres (mostly anaerobic). In CHF a shift to type&#xD;
      II fibres and a reduced capillary density as well as a reduced cytochrome oxidase activity is&#xD;
      observed, but the mechanisms leading to such a shift have not been clarified . Deconditioning&#xD;
      may be an important factor aggravating the underlying pathophysiology in CHF and exercise&#xD;
      training has been shown to improve exercise performance and to reduce symptoms in this&#xD;
      population . This is partly mediated by activation of the Protein PGC-1, a critical factor&#xD;
      coordinating the activation of metabolic genes required for substrate utilization and&#xD;
      mitochondrial biogenesis . The increase in this enzyme has been highly correlated to increase&#xD;
      in peak VO2 after a aerobic interval training program in heart failure .&#xD;
&#xD;
      One would expect that an improvement in exercise performance following improvement in central&#xD;
      hemodynamics with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) would be associated with improved&#xD;
      muscular blood flow and energy metabolism. However, so far no reports have been published on&#xD;
      the skeletal muscle response to CRT. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      6 months CRT pacing on skeletal muscle histology and mitochondrial mass and the association&#xD;
      of these changes to alterations in functional capacity as measured with peak VO2. Moreover,&#xD;
      we also sought to assess the relationship between changes in skeletal muscle and alterations&#xD;
      in the inflammatory response in serum and in skeletal muscle.&#xD;
