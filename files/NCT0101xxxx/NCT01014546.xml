      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of arsenic trioxide with or without&#xD;
      ascorbic acid in treating patients with myelofibrosis. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      arsenic trioxide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by&#xD;
      killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving&#xD;
      arsenic acid together with ascorbic acid may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of oral arsenic trioxide with or&#xD;
      without ascorbic acid in subjects with myelofibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the incidence, severity, and attribution of treatment-emergent adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the rate of complete or major clinical-hematological response from treatment&#xD;
      with arsenic trioxide and ascorbic acid in this subject population as measured by the&#xD;
      International Working Group for Myelofibrosis Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) response&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To measure arsenic trioxide levels in the plasma of patients treated with and without&#xD;
      ascorbic acid on this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To estimate the efficacy of arsenic trioxide with ascorbic acid in subjects with&#xD;
      myelofibrosis, as determined by a reduction in Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) V617F, JAK22T875N, and&#xD;
      mutations of the thrombopoietin receptor (MPL515L/K) allele frequency in peripheral blood&#xD;
      neutrophils.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To examine the effect of treatment on biological markers of myeloproliferation, cytokine&#xD;
      production and hematopoietic stem cell mobilization. In particular, the following markers of&#xD;
      disease will be measured: cluster of differentiation (CD)34+ cell count in peripheral blood&#xD;
      measured by cytofluorimetry, plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming&#xD;
      growth factor-beta (TGF-B), stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), neutrophil elastase levels&#xD;
      by commercial assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To examine single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the arsenic trioxide pathway in&#xD;
      subjects with myelofibrosis treated with arsenic trioxide and ascorbic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of arsenic trioxide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive arsenic trioxide orally (PO) once daily (QD) in orange juice on days 1-21.&#xD;
      Patients may also receive ascorbic acid PO QD on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days&#xD;
      for up to 168 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 4&#xD;
      months for 1 year.&#xD;
