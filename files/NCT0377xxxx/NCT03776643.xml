  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have reported a deficit and/or a defect in regulatory T cells in allergic&#xD;
      subjects, which can be correlated with the immune dysfunction of allergic responses,&#xD;
      especially for respiratory allergies. Low-dose IL-2 (ld-IL2) acts to specifically target and&#xD;
      activate regulatory T cells, which are cells that exert targeted immunosuppressive action.&#xD;
      Thus by stimulating regulatory T cells, ld-IL2 would restore a balance of allergic responses&#xD;
      and protection by controls of allergic mechanisms.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      Main objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the safety and efficacy of ILT-101 (ld-IL2) in patients with allergic rhinitis and&#xD;
      apple Oral Allergic Syndrome (OAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conduct of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of patients is performed based on medical history and disease history. The&#xD;
      selection visit takes place at the time of the previous allergic season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion visit (V0) will take place within the framework of consultation. Before any&#xD;
      examination or any acts related to the research, the investigator will check that the written&#xD;
      consent has been received from the patient undergoing the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During inclusion (V0), different tests are performed to check selection criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biological analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All following visits in hospital include evaluations wich will be carried out to insure&#xD;
      patient safety: physical examination, Temperature, Pulse, blood pressure, respiratory&#xD;
      frequency, oximetry, AE and SAE recording if any, concomitant medications, rhinitis episodes&#xD;
      will be recorded. Different specific tests will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immunological explorations;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allergologic tests;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Combined Symptom and Medication Score (CSMS);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biological analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the induction course, the first injection will be performed in the hospital (V1), and&#xD;
      every day from V2 to V5 for the following 4 injections will be performed at home by a&#xD;
      research nurse, or in hospital according to physician and patient decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following visit (V6) will take place during a consultation at hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the maintenance course (V7 to V15), injections ld-IL2 or PLACEBO injection will be&#xD;
      performed at home by a research nurse or in hospital according to physician and patient&#xD;
      decision. Except V12 that will be performed at hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up period (V16) and end of research V17 will be performed in the hospital.&#xD;
