      This study will be conducted at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, in Atlanta, Georgia for a&#xD;
      total duration of 24 months. The electrical neuromuscular stimulation device used in this&#xD;
      study is the VitalStim 400, which has been used in multiple previous clinical studies for&#xD;
      modulation of pain and has received FDA approval. A total of 15 pediatric chronic&#xD;
      inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) patients will be included in the study.&#xD;
      Study participants will have baseline EKG. The electrodes for the device will be placed on&#xD;
      the subjects left cervical (neck) region. The stimulators are battery-powered and allow&#xD;
      configuration of the stimulation parameters to the comfort of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be requested to deliver stimulations two times per day for two years. Study&#xD;
      outcomes would include quantification of the functional changes in motor nerve conduction&#xD;
      studies, hand held grip strength, Rash-built Overall Disability Scale (R-ODS) and changes in&#xD;
      serum cytokine profiles at baseline and on regular follow-up visits.&#xD;

      I. Background and Purpose Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a&#xD;
      chronic immune-mediated disease of the peripheral sensory motor nerves characterized by motor&#xD;
      weakness, sensory loss, muscle wasting and loss of motor ability. Majority of CIDP cases are&#xD;
      idiopathic with insidious onset, relapsing remitting course and prolonged (over years)&#xD;
      clinical course. CIDP incidence is unknown in pediatric population however it is a rare&#xD;
      treatable cause of neuromuscular weakness in children. Treatment of CIDP involves chronic use&#xD;
      of steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and rarely plasma exchange (PLEX). Outcome&#xD;
      measures such as patient reported motor disability scores, electrophysiology parameters,&#xD;
      functional motor strength testing are available to look for interval change. Despite above&#xD;
      mentioned treatments majority of patients have tremendous disease burden. There is a need for&#xD;
      alternative/adjunctive therapies that can decrease chronic inflammation effectively and&#xD;
      safely in pediatric CIDP patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vagus nerve stimulation has received significant scientific and clinical attention and has&#xD;
      been shown to effectively reduce systemic inflammation. Results from early clinical trials&#xD;
      for treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis (NCT01552538, NCT01552941, ClinicalTrials.gov) have&#xD;
      demonstrated significant lifestyle benefits and reduced symptoms in RA patients. Similar&#xD;
      benefits of VNS have been observed in Crohn's patients (NCT02311660). In these studies,&#xD;
      patients are surgically implanted with a stimulator and electrodes directly on the nerve.&#xD;
      Preliminary results have demonstrated safety and efficacy in patients that previously were&#xD;
      unresponsive to traditional pharmacological therapies. Unfortunately, surgical implantation&#xD;
      of a device is difficult and costly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent investigations have significantly increased our understanding of nVNS. Compared to&#xD;
      traditional implanted vagus nerve stimulation devices, nVNS uses electrodes placed on the&#xD;
      skin surface to stimulate the vagus nerve. Non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) has&#xD;
      shown promise in animal and human models to reduce chronic inflammation in multiple disease&#xD;
      states. By delivering electrical pulses at the skin surface above the vagus nerve, neural&#xD;
      pathways involved in regulating systemic inflammation are activated. Using a handheld device,&#xD;
      patients apply brief durations of stimulation multiple times per day to achieve therapeutic&#xD;
      benefit. nVNS is currently FDA approved for clinical use in the treatment of migraines and&#xD;
      cluster headaches, with on-going clinical studies on epilepsy and systemic inflammation.&#xD;
      Preliminary published results have demonstrated significant therapeutic benefit to the&#xD;
      patients with minimal side-effects such as a feeling of paresthesia at the site of the&#xD;
      electrodes which subsides after turning the stimulation off.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that nVNS therapy can reduce systemic inflammation in CIPD patients,&#xD;
      functionally halting degradation of motor nerve conduction and hand grip strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this proposal are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quantify functional changes in motor nerve conduction studies, hand held grip strength,&#xD;
           and Rash-built Overall Disability Scale (R-ODS) in CIDP patients receiving standard of&#xD;
           care treatment and daily nVNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Characterize changes in serum cytokine profiles in patients receiving standard of care&#xD;
           treatment and daily nVNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate observing a reduction in serum TNF-Î± levels after nVNS therapy, consistent with&#xD;
      previously published clinical results. Serum cytokine levels will be statistically analyzed&#xD;
      on a per patient basis, with each patient's baseline measurements used for comparison. will&#xD;
      be used to determine statistically significant differences between subsequent serum cytokine&#xD;
      profiles for the entire patient population and NCS metrics. Pearson's correlation coefficient&#xD;
      will be used to understand the relationship between changes in serum cytokine levels and NCS&#xD;
      metrics. Pearson's correlation coefficient will also be used to assess the relationship&#xD;
      between number of therapy session (as reported by the patient) and serum cytokine levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Summary of Procedures All proposed studies will be conducted at Children's Healthcare of&#xD;
      Atlanta (Atlanta, GA) for a total duration of 24 months. Local institution review board&#xD;
      approval would be obtained prior to the study. The table below (Table 1) provides an overview&#xD;
      of the timeline and specific tasks to be completed upon each visit. Baseline represents the&#xD;
      initial visit after the patient has been screened and meets the inclusion criteria (EKG&#xD;
      results may take 24-48 hrs and study participant will be advised to start the study&#xD;
      intervention once confirmation of normal EKG is obtained) Patients will be scheduled to visit&#xD;
      the clinic for follow up visits at the pre-set time points shown. A total of 15 subjects,&#xD;
      from age 5 years to 21 years, will be included in the study. The stimulation devices used in&#xD;
      this study are VitalStim 400, electrical neuromuscular stimulators, which have been used in&#xD;
      multiple previous clinical studies for modulation of pain and have received FDA approval. The&#xD;
      (2) electrodes for the device will be placed on the subjects left cervical (neck) region. The&#xD;
      stimulator will be placed in a comfortable position, such as next to the pillow. The&#xD;
      stimulators are battery-powered and allow configuration of the stimulation parameters to the&#xD;
      comfort of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will be trained on where to place electrodes, how to ensure that the electrodes make&#xD;
      a good contact with the skin, and how to set the stimulation parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1. Study outline for nVNS in CIDP patients. Patients will be followed for two years&#xD;
      with nVNS as an adjunctive to standard IVIG therapy. Patients will be validated against the&#xD;
      stated inclusion criteria prior to enrollment in the study. Baseline measurements before nVNS&#xD;
      is added will be taken to determine change in physiological and functional outcomes over&#xD;
      time. All procedures other than in-home vagus nerve stimulator therapy will take place at&#xD;
      CHOA under the direct guidance of the PI. Parents will be trained on where to place&#xD;
      electrodes, how to ensure that the electrodes make a good contact with the skin, and how to&#xD;
      set the stimulation parameters. Patient is not required to have anyone sit with them during&#xD;
      the stimulation procedure. At the end of two years, we will understand the benefits (or not)&#xD;
      of nVNS in CIDP and the compliance of nVNS therapies in pediatric patients.&#xD;

      Specific Aim 1: Quantify functional changes in motor nerve conduction studies, hand held grip&#xD;
      strength, and Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale (R-ODS) in CIDP patients receiving&#xD;
      standard of care treatment and daily nVNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  nVNS Therapy. The nVNS therapy will be delivered using a handheld electrical&#xD;
           neuromuscular stimulator (VitalStim 400) device. It is safe, effective at stimulating&#xD;
           the vagus nerve, and easy to use by patients outside the clinic. Electrical&#xD;
           neuromuscular stimulator devices have been used for years in pain-related preclinical&#xD;
           and clinical research. Patients will be requested to deliver nVNS 2 times per day for 60&#xD;
           minutes each time for at least 5 days per week. The stimulation frequency (number of&#xD;
           pulses) and amplitude (amount of current) will be set during the initial baseline&#xD;
           session in the clinic and will be set to prevent discomfort to the patient or impact&#xD;
           cardiorespiratory parameters. Initial stimulation parameters will be guided by previous&#xD;
           reports of nVNS in patients. Patients will be trained on all appropriate methods for&#xD;
           using the devices and asked to report the number of daily therapy sessions completed.&#xD;
           Patients will be asked to continue their standard medication regimens which include in&#xD;
           majority of cases 3 weekly IVIG (1 gm/kg) infusions, with or without steroids and plasma&#xD;
           exchange.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Handheld dynamometer: In the pediatric NM clinic we use a Jamar Handheld Dynamometer&#xD;
           with reference range (in kilograms and pounds) for children ages 5-18 years. Both right&#xD;
           and left hand grip strength would be measured. Best of the three attempts will be used&#xD;
           in each hand. We routinely use dynamometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  R-ODS: Twenty four item motor scale based on day to day activities with a score of 0-48.&#xD;
           The scale was designed for adult CIDP subjects however based on our experience in&#xD;
           children the scale captures pediatric motor disability as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NCS metrics: Motor nerve conduction studies are well tolerated in children. We routinely&#xD;
           study median, ulnar, common fibular and tibial nerves on one side of the body. Distal&#xD;
           and F wave latency, conduction velocity and amplitude will be recorded in all nerves. In&#xD;
           addition, drop in motor amplitude and or temporal dispersion on proximal stimulation&#xD;
           will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Characterize serum cytokine profiles in CIDP patients receiving standard of&#xD;
      care treatment and daily nVNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      â¢ Stimulation of the vagus nerve has been shown to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in&#xD;
      both animal and human investigations just after one session. In addition to evaluating&#xD;
      functional changes in CIDP patients, we will quantify pro-inflammatory cytokine levels known&#xD;
      to be elevated in CIDP patients. Serum cytokine assay available at Children's Healthcare of&#xD;
      Atlanta laboratory will be used (https://www.testmenu.com/choa/Tests/671572). The assay&#xD;
      contains 13 cytokines (interleukin 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 17, interleukin 1 beta, tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, interleukin 2 receptor (SD25) soluble). Available&#xD;
      normative laboratory values for above-mentioned cytokines will be compared with the CIDP&#xD;
      subject values. Blood samples will be collected at baseline and each subsequent follow up&#xD;
      visit as shown in Table 1 for profiling of serum cytokine levels. By correlating&#xD;
      physiological (changes in cytokine levels) and functional effects (NCS, R-ODS, grip&#xD;
      strength), we will develop a mechanistic basis for how and why nVNS benefits pediatric CIDP&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Risks Pediatric CIDP is a rare condition and disease course if often prolonged with&#xD;
      relapse and remissions. The subject sample size is small and meaningful clinical/biochemical&#xD;
      changes following an intervention in CIDP patient population takes months to years. In&#xD;
      general, these limitations are true for the majority of rare pediatric neuromuscular&#xD;
      conditions. Alternative approaches include comparing the study population with historical&#xD;
      controls however well-done natural history studies in pediatric CIDP are missing. We also&#xD;
      anticipate patient compliance challenges. The usage monitor on the nVNS device will allow us&#xD;
      to account for that in the data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      nVNS at the level of the neck in children has been used in multiple studies. Patients may&#xD;
      experience irritation at the site of stimulation; however this typically subsides within&#xD;
      10-15 minutes post-stimulation. In addition, patients may experience soreness in the neck due&#xD;
      to activation of muscles, which is expected to be temporary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rarely, EKG changes have been described with nVNS. The study design includes regular EKG&#xD;
      checks and if any changes or abnormalities are noted, this will be deemed as serious adverse&#xD;
      event (SAE) and lead to termination of device use in the study participants. A follow-up&#xD;
      visit and EKG will be performed for these subjects and if EKG abnormalities persist,&#xD;
      pediatric Cardiology evaluation will be requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Potential Benefits Reduction of systemic inflammation in CIDP patients will halt&#xD;
      degradation of motor nerve conductions and improve functional outcomes such as hand grip&#xD;
      strength/ disability scores. Furthermore, nVNS therapy may lead to significant cost&#xD;
      reductions in treatment and life-long healthcare costs of CIDP patients. Benefits of nVNS to&#xD;
      patients will also reduce the disease burden on the patient's family by easing the treatment&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;

F waves are used to assess polyneuropathy and F wave latency can be extended or even absent in persons with CIDP.</description>

    <measure>Change in nerve conduction study conduction velocity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12, Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>Motor nerve conduction studies are used to examine conduction of electrical impulses along nerves. Electrodes are placed on the skin in specific areas to evaluate peripheral nerves. An electrode will stimulate a nerve while the receiving site records how well electrical impulses are being conducted along the nerve. Conduction velocity measures the rate of impulse conduction (distance/time) and is often decreased in patients with CIDP as myelination is affected.</description>

    <description>Motor nerve conduction studies are used to examine conduction of electrical impulses along nerves. Electrodes are placed on the skin in specific areas to evaluate peripheral nerves. An electrode will stimulate a nerve while the receiving site records how well electrical impulses are being conducted along the nerve. Conduction amplitude is the size of the response to electrical stimulation, measured in millivolts (mV). Reduced amplitude indicates axon loss.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6, Month 12, Month 18, Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale (R-ODS) used for those with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome (GBS), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP), and gammopathy-related polyneuropathy (MGUSP) is a 24-item scale asking respondents to rate how greatly polyneuropathy impacts activities. Responses are on a scale of 0 to 2 where 0 indicates it is not possible for the respondent to perform the task and 2 means that the task can be performed without difficulty. Total scores range from 0 to 48 and higher scores indicate greater ability to perform daily and social tasks.</description>

    <description>The stimulation devices used in this study are VitalStim 400, electrical neuromuscular stimulators, which have been used in multiple previous clinical studies for modulation of pain and have received FDA approval. The (2) electrodes for the device will be placed on the subjects left cervical (neck) region. The stimulator will be placed in a comfortable position, such as next to the pillow. The stimulators are battery-powered and allow configuration of the stimulation parameters to the comfort of the patient.&#xD;
Parents will be trained on where to place electrodes, how to ensure that the electrodes make a good contact with the skin, and how to set the stimulation parameters.</description>

    <description>The nVNS study intervention will be delivered using a handheld electrical neuromuscular stimulator device (VitalStim 400). Participants will deliver nVNS twice per day for 60 minutes each time for 2 years. The two electrodes for the device are placed on the left cervical (neck) region or on the left ear. Parents will be trained on where to place electrodes, how to ensure that the electrodes make a good contact with the skin, and how to set the stimulation parameters. The stimulation frequency (number of pulses) and amplitude (amount of current) will be set during the initial baseline session in the clinic at a level that prevents discomfort and does not impact cardiorespiratory parameters.</description>
