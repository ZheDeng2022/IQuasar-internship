  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy has helped many cancer patients in the last 5 years by enhancing a patient's&#xD;
      immune system to fight cancer. Anti-Programmed Death (PD-1) immunotherapy drugs such as&#xD;
      pembrolizumab and nivolumab remove the breaks from cancer-fighting immune cells and have been&#xD;
      effective in treating some melanoma patients. Despite the major breakthrough of immunotherapy&#xD;
      in oncology treatment, many patients do not respond to this new class of anti-cancer drugs.&#xD;
      Recently, evidence suggests that the microorganisms living in a patient's intestines play a&#xD;
      major role in modifying the response to anti-PD-1drugs. Patients who respond to these drugs&#xD;
      have a unique and healthy group of microorganisms in their gut. Therefore, positive&#xD;
      modification of a cancer patient's gut microorganisms to create a more diverse and healthy&#xD;
      microbiome may improve the response to immunotherapy. One method of modifying the microbiome&#xD;
      is Fecal Microbial Transplantation (FMT) that is already being successfully used in the&#xD;
      clinic to treat non-cancer patients with persistent bacterial infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will combine FMT with the approved immunotherapy drugs&#xD;
      pembrolizumab or nivolumab that are the standard of care for the treatment of advanced&#xD;
      melanoma. The purpose of this study is to examine the safety of combining these two therapies&#xD;
      in melanoma patients. The investigator will use fecal material from a healthy donor selected&#xD;
      via our stringent protocol that is Health Canada approved. In addition to assessing the&#xD;
      safety of the combination, the investigator will also study the effect of FMT on the immune&#xD;
      system and microbial ecosystem of the gut.&#xD;

    <description>All patients in this trial will receive FMT at least one week prior to treatment with approved immunotherapy (either pembrolizumab or nivolumab). Samples for FMT are sourced at and by the microbiology group under the supervision of Dr. Silverman at St Joseph's Hospital. Donor screening procedures are described in appendix 4. Transplant will be from one single donor for all participants unless Dr. Silverman's lab considers the need for more than one donor based on availability of donors. There will be no &quot;mixture&quot; of donor samples.&#xD;
Donor samples are manufactured into capsules according to Kao et al, 2017.</description>
