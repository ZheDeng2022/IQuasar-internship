  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients over the age of 65 who are admitted to the Juravinski Hospital for treatment of hip&#xD;
      fractures will be invited to take part in the study. An activity monitor (a Fitbit® Alta HR)&#xD;
      will be attached to the participant post-operatively, to record quality of sleep and amount&#xD;
      of activity for the duration of hospital stay. The time spent in hospital and whether&#xD;
      complications or confusion develops will also be recorded. The aim is to determine whether&#xD;
      poor sleep affects recovery after hip fracture surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of sleep duration and quality on&#xD;
      post-operative mobility in older adults admitted to hospital with a hip fracture. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that poor sleep will independently predict low post-operative mobility&#xD;
      (measured by number of steps). Recent developments in activity monitor technology allow for&#xD;
      the collection of reliable assessments of movement and sleep rhythm during surgical recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Fitbit® Alta HR activity monitor will be used for this study. When the participant is&#xD;
      awake and alert after surgery and informed consent has been obtained, a study team member&#xD;
      will fasten the Fitbit® device on the wrist of the participants' non-dominant hand.&#xD;
      Investigators will monitor sleep quality and daily steps taken for the duration of&#xD;
      hospitalization, with the option to discontinue if clinically required or requested by the&#xD;
      patient or provider. At the time of discharge, the wearable biosensor will be reset and the&#xD;
      information will be erased from its memory. The wearable biosensors will be cleaned with&#xD;
      disinfectant used for durable medical equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include patients aged 65+ admitted with hip fracture to the&#xD;
      orthopedic ward (E2) at the Juravinski Hospital. Descriptive data on patients admitted with&#xD;
      hip fracture will be collected including age, gender, Charlson comorbidity index, diagnosis&#xD;
      of dementia, pre-hospital living accommodation, mobility aids, level of pre-admission&#xD;
      mobility using the functional independence measure (FIM), and number of beds per room. Timing&#xD;
      of surgery (within 24 hours, 48 hours, or more than 48 hours) after admission, highest&#xD;
      reported daily pain score and foley catheter use will also be collected from the medical&#xD;
      record. The use of sleep medications will be tracked each night during the study period. The&#xD;
      physiotherapy notes will be screened for information on total distance ambulated in meters&#xD;
      and in-hospital mobility progression. Post-operative complications such as Stroke, Cardiac&#xD;
      event, Pneumonia, Venous thromboembolism, GI tract bleed, Urinary tract infections,&#xD;
      Postoperative anemia, Acute Kidney Injury, and Pressure sores will be tracked from the&#xD;
      medical record. Investigators will also contact participants by phone after 30 days have&#xD;
      elapsed since discharge to inquire about mortality, FIM score and location of disposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the total number of steps taken by participants during each 24-hour&#xD;
      period after surgery for hip fracture. Mean daily steps will be calculated based on the&#xD;
      number of days the activity monitor was worn. Secondary outcomes will be delirium prevalence,&#xD;
      hospital length of stay, post-operative complications, 30-day post-discharge mortality,&#xD;
      mobility status (FIM - locomotion subscale score), and location of disposition. The primary&#xD;
      behavioural exposure is monitoring of sleep duration (measured by total sleep time in&#xD;
      minutes) and quality (number of awakenings per night). Daytime naps will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the key strengths of this study is that both the primary outcome and the key exposure&#xD;
      are measured using a single device, which improves the reliability and efficiency of data&#xD;
      collection&#xD;
