  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with aphasia have difficulty with writing and often struggle to use electronic&#xD;
      communication that connects people to one another. The goal of this project is to evaluate&#xD;
      the extent to which a novel treatment (T-WRITE) improves written language function and the&#xD;
      use of text messaging; we also evaluate whether there are subsequent positive effects on the&#xD;
      participant's social connectedness and ultimately health-related quality of life (HRQOL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      T-WRITE involves choral reading and repeated writing of sentences via texting. Participants&#xD;
      work intensively and independently at home on a laptop computer. A virtual therapist directs&#xD;
      the participant to practice copying and independently writing phrases and short sentences&#xD;
      using the typing feature on a cellular phone. The specific objective of this randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial is to compare T-WRITE to ORLA+WTG, a similar treatment that targets written&#xD;
      expression using handwriting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An acquired impairment in writing, also known as agraphia, is a characteristic symptom of&#xD;
      aphasia, i.e., a language disorder resulting from damage to the language centers of the&#xD;
      brain. Written communication via text and instant messaging, electronic mail, and various&#xD;
      types of social media has become an increasingly important part of everyday life in our&#xD;
      technology driven society. Consequently, difficulty with written expression can significantly&#xD;
      restrict people with aphasia from participation in community life, including social,&#xD;
      professional, and educational realms. Improving writing in persons with aphasia could improve&#xD;
      communication, increase access to information, reduce isolation and facilitate social&#xD;
      connectedness. Furthermore, delivering writing treatment via an electronic modality, such as&#xD;
      texting, could be particularly advantageous given the increasing reliance on electronic&#xD;
      communication. This study investigates the efficacy of T-WRITE, a computer-based writing&#xD;
      treatment for aphasia that targets phrase/sentence level writing using texting. Its aims are&#xD;
      to: 1) evaluate the efficacy of computer-based texting treatment for improving written&#xD;
      communication in persons with aphasia and 2) assess the extent to which improvements in&#xD;
      electronic written communication impact social connectedness and health-related quality of&#xD;
      life (HRQOL). This will be accomplished via a randomized controlled trial across two sites&#xD;
      that compares computer-based texting treatment (T-WRITE) to a control group that receives a&#xD;
      hand-writing treatment (ORLA+WTG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is delivered via computer using state-of-the-art virtual therapist&#xD;
      technology. A perceptive, life-like animated computer agent (virtual therapist), using&#xD;
      visible speech, guides the participant so he or she can independently work through the set of&#xD;
      choral reading and writing activities (see figure above showing a screen shot of the virtual&#xD;
      therapist). The objective is to assure an optimal learning experience in the comfort of the&#xD;
      participant's home by using a virtual therapist with accurate visible speech feedback. The&#xD;
      virtual therapist reads aloud, speaks with accurate visible speech, highlights and repeats&#xD;
      words and sentences, directs the participant to copy/write phrases or sentences, and provides&#xD;
      guidance much like a real therapist. The sequence of steps in the ORLA+WTG and the T-WRITE&#xD;
      treatments are identical. The output modality for participants randomized to T-WRITE is&#xD;
      texting using a cellular phone whereas participants in the ORLA+WTG will hand-write their&#xD;
      responses using pen and paper. Participants will practice their writing for 90 minutes a day,&#xD;
      6 days a week for 4 weeks.&#xD;
