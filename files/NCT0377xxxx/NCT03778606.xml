  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clostridium difficile causes ~453,000 infections and ~29,300 deaths per year in the US,&#xD;
      making it the most common hospital acquired infection in the country. C. difficile is an&#xD;
      anaerobic bacterium that has the capacity to inhabit the colon of humans and other mammals.&#xD;
      Initially thought to be a commensal, it was later found to be associated with antibiotic&#xD;
      induced enterocolitis. Since then, it has gradually become one of the most important&#xD;
      healthcare associated pathogens. C. difficile infection (CDI) causes colitis, which is&#xD;
      inflammation of the colonic mucosa with a spectrum of severity from mild to more protracted&#xD;
      diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, toxic megacolon, sepsis, and in some instances death.&#xD;
      Mortality occurs despite the existence of three antibiotic options. CDI is also associated&#xD;
      with higher hospital readmission rates, and associated healthcare costs in the US are&#xD;
      estimated at 4.8 billion dollars annually. Due to the significance of C. difficile in&#xD;
      healthcare, hospital level C. difficile rates are publically reported and closely scrutinized&#xD;
      by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. Standard infection control bundles are proving to&#xD;
      be insufficient for controlling the national C. difficile problem. Better understanding of&#xD;
      the biological steps preceding clinical infection and reversal of the underlying gut&#xD;
      dysbiosis will allow us to curtail our C. difficile epidemic. The present study aims to&#xD;
      manipulate the gut microbiota to halt the biological progression of C. difficile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CDI is a serious problem in hematology-oncology patients. The incidence of CDI in the&#xD;
      hematology-oncology population is much higher than in other populations and&#xD;
      hematology-oncology inpatient units frequently have the highest incidence of CDI cases within&#xD;
      an institution. Additionally, hematology-oncology patients have high rates of C. difficile&#xD;
      colonization upon hospitalization and more than 50% of patients detected with C. difficile&#xD;
      colonization before bone marrow transplantation end up diagnosed with hospital associated&#xD;
      CDI. This finding is not trivial as CDI treatment with oral vancomycin causes major and&#xD;
      prolonged perturbations of their intestinal microbiota, which has been associated with higher&#xD;
      mortality. In addition to the usual complications of CDI, a higher incidence of&#xD;
      graft-versus-host-disease has been described in patients with CDI.&#xD;

      Aim 1/Objective 1. Establish the feasibility of oligosaccharide supplementation and twice a&#xD;
      week stool collections among 12 C. difficile colonized hematology-oncology inpatients. It&#xD;
      will be determined if at least 70% of the oligosaccharide dosages are taken by at least 8&#xD;
      (&gt;=66%) of the 12 enrolled patients. Additionally, the ability to collect at least 50% of the&#xD;
      scheduled stool samples will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 will provide important information about the ideal food/drink to mix the potato starch&#xD;
      supplemented in this study. The knowledge gained in this pilot will be used to design a&#xD;
      future phase II or III clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Explore the impact of oligosaccharide supplementation on C. difficile loads and&#xD;
      relative abundance of Firmicutes. All stool samples will undergo 16S ribosomal ribonucleic&#xD;
      acid (rRNA) and bioinformatics at the MCW's Genomic and Precision Medicine Center and C.&#xD;
      difficile quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) at the PI's research laboratory.&#xD;
      Historical controls will be obtained from a group of over 450 hematology-oncology inpatients&#xD;
      who underwent at least one C. difficile surveillance test and whose stool samples are&#xD;
      currently being processed for 16S rRNA by the PI's team. Controls at a 3:1 ratio with cases&#xD;
      will be matched based on underlying disease, unit of admission, antibiotic use, baseline C.&#xD;
      difficile fecal loads, and baseline relative abundance of Firmicutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2a. Evaluate the impact of oligosaccharide supplementation on the change of C.&#xD;
      difficile fecal loads when compared to historical controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2b. Explore the effect of oligosaccharide supplementation on the change in relative&#xD;
      abundance of Firmicutes when compared to historical controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected a reduction will occur in C. difficile fecal loads during oligosaccharide&#xD;
      supplementation when compared to matched controls. Conversely, it is expected an increase in&#xD;
      the relative abundance of Firmicutes (or some of its operational taxonomic units; OTUs)&#xD;
      during oligosaccharide replacement will occur when compared to matched controls. The&#xD;
      knowledge gained with Objectives 2a and 2b will be used to determine the sample size needed&#xD;
      to design future phase II or phase III clinical trials.&#xD;
