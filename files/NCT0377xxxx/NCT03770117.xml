    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess whether prehabilitation supervised by an appropriate&#xD;
      multimodality team improves indices of sarcopenia in patients scheduled to undergo&#xD;
      pancreatoduodenectomy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cachexia is a hallmark feature of pancreatic cancer. Patients with features of cachexia have&#xD;
      worse clinical outcomes. This includes a reduction in quality of life, reduced tolerance of&#xD;
      therapy and a poorer prognosis . Specifically related to patients undergoing pancreatic&#xD;
      surgery clinical evidence of cachexia is associated with higher perioperative complication&#xD;
      rates. Sarcopenia, defined as a decreased muscle mass independent of fat mass, is a feature&#xD;
      of the cachexia associated with pancreatic cancer. Patients with sarcopenia have progressive&#xD;
      and generalised reduced muscle mass and function In patients undergoing surgery for&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer sarcopenia has been associated with increased rates of complication and&#xD;
      worse survival . Treatment of sarcopenia is difficult but includes nutritional support and&#xD;
      pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) aimed at reducing malabsorption. Whether&#xD;
      measures aimed at combating sarcopenia can improve clinical outcomes following pancreatic&#xD;
      surgery is currently unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prehabilitation is a multimodal therapeutic regimen aimed at improving the overall physical&#xD;
      condition of patients prior to surgery with the intention of reducing the incidence of&#xD;
      perioperative complications. Emerging evidence suggests that exercise prior to surgery for&#xD;
      high risk patients scheduled to undergo major abdominal surgery improves aerobic capacity and&#xD;
      can reduce the incidence of perioperative complications . The impact of prehabilitation&#xD;
      undertaken prior to pancreatic surgery on perioperative complication rates has not yet been&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess whether prehabilitation supervised by an appropriate&#xD;
      multimodality team improves indices of sarcopenia in patients scheduled to undergo&#xD;
      pancreatoduodenectomy.&#xD;

    <description>In this arm of the study, participants will undergo prehabilitation prior to surgery. This is intended to increase the participants overall health prior to surgery to try and increase their general well-being during and after surgery.&#xD;
Prehabilitation is multimodal therapy comprising:&#xD;
Assessment for malnutrition and nutritional support dependent on the outcome&#xD;
Optimisation of management of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency&#xD;
Assessment of muscle mass and strength&#xD;
Individually tailored, goal directed exercise regimen under the care of physiotherapy</description>
