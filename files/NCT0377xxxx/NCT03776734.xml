  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is of utmost importance to determine the individual upper limits in the recommended&#xD;
      exercises for increasing the level of physical activity and for developing the cardiovascular&#xD;
      system. Cardiovascular exercise tests are used in determining the exercise capacity and&#xD;
      performance. Cardiovascular exercise tests allow maximal and submaximal loadings to determine&#xD;
      the person's body temperature, oxygen consumption, fatigue, interpretation of cardiac&#xD;
      responses, and exercise capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thermal equilibrium is achieved by the activation or inhibition of autonomic and behavioral&#xD;
      thermocouples in order to generate, dissipate or protect heat. These thermocouples act&#xD;
      together and allow precise control of body temperature, which is arranged in a narrow range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under certain conditions, such as body temperature, systemic inflammation, extreme&#xD;
      environmental conditions, and exercise performance, it falls outside this narrow range.&#xD;
      Metabolic heat production is 15 to 20 times greater than resting during exercise. In exercise&#xD;
      performed under hot ambient conditions, the rate of heat production will exceed the rate of&#xD;
      heat loss and cause it to rise rapidly before reaching a plateau. The increase due to the&#xD;
      exhalation of body heat initiates two autonomous thermodynamics for heat dissipation:&#xD;
      sweating and cutaneous vasodilatation. Although both mechanisms help prevent exaggerated&#xD;
      increase in body temperature, they cause stress for the cardiovascular system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise performance and level of physical activity are influenced by individual&#xD;
      characteristics such as personality adjustment and mediocre adjustment. Adaptation is defined&#xD;
      as adaptation under natural conditions. Robinson showed that the individual salt losses are&#xD;
      higher in individuals who exercise in a hot environment and cannot adapt to the temperature,&#xD;
      a decrease in both urine and sweat salt contents with temperature compliance. One research&#xD;
      has shown that exercise performance is influenced by heat-induced muscle cramps and&#xD;
      cardiovascular function disorders due to this significant increase in salt loss. An increase&#xD;
      in body temperature caused by exercise can have a negative impact on exercise performance and&#xD;
      may lead to the development of conditions associated with increased body temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although many studies in literature have shown positive effects of performance of&#xD;
      pre-exercise cold exercise on performance, there is no consensus on the use of cold&#xD;
      applications.&#xD;

      In our study, changes that may arise from individual differences will be tried to be&#xD;
      controlled using repetitive measurements in the same individuals. Evaluation results will be&#xD;
      recorded without any cold application in order to determine the circumstances prior to the&#xD;
      application. In the following weeks, doses to both Quadriceps muscles will be recorded&#xD;
      immediately after cold application of 5 minutes, 10 minutes and 20 minutes. Each of the&#xD;
      applications will be held on the same day of the week and at the same time in 4 consecutive&#xD;
      weeks. Nutritional and fluid trains (such as stimulant substances, amount of coffee tea),&#xD;
      ambient conditions (temperature and humidity) that may affect individual performance will be&#xD;
      recorded. Keeping room conditions under control will benefit from air conditioning.&#xD;
      Individuals will be informed about the equipment and test protocol to be used in the tests. A&#xD;
      sufficient number of trials will be done before the test so that the participants are&#xD;
      familiar with the equipment and test protocol. All assessments will be performed by the same&#xD;
      physiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body composition will be assessed by height, weight, body fat percentage and skin&#xD;
           thickness measurements. (TANÄ°TA and Skinfold measurements)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bruce protocol with the aim of determining the exercise capacity (Bruce protocol&#xD;
           installed on the treadmill), fatigue (lactate measurement device), heart rate (Polar&#xD;
           wireless heart rate index), blood pressure (manual sphygmomanometer), saturated oxygen&#xD;
           level (pulse oximetry) and oxygen consumption (metabolic gas analyzer) measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiratory Function Test (Spirometer, FEV1, FVC, FEV1 / FVC, FEF (25-75), PEF, MVV)&#xD;
           should be performed for evaluation of respiratory functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiratory muscle strength will be assessed by in-mouth pressure measurements (MIP-MEP&#xD;
           device) during inhalation and exhalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The application area will be assessed by dual laser infrared non-contact superficial&#xD;
           temperature measurement thermometer and general body temperature infrared in-ear&#xD;
           thermometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of muscle strength and muscular endurance will be assessed with an isokinetic&#xD;
           dynamometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application Program:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Keeping room conditions, temperature and humidity under control will benefit from air&#xD;
      conditioning. Temperature and humidity percentage indicator will be used when room conditions&#xD;
      are monitored. Cooled ice packs of gel will be used to cool the quadriceps muscles. The&#xD;
      amount of heat of the gel packets, before and after application of the application area, will&#xD;
      be recorded by measuring with an infrared non-contact thermometer.&#xD;
