  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1.1. Background 1.1.1. Perioperative ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury during liver&#xD;
      transplantation is strongly associated with early allograft dysfunction, graft loss, and&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1.2. Hepatic I/R injury also causes remote damage to other organs including the renal and&#xD;
      pulmonary systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1.3. Dexmedetomidine, a selective α2-adrenoceptor agonist which is widely used as an&#xD;
      adjuvant to general anaesthesia, has been widely shown in preclinical studies to provide&#xD;
      organoprotection by ameliorating the effects of I/R injury in a range of tissues (including&#xD;
      the liver). However, prospective clinical evidence of any potential benefits in improving&#xD;
      outcomes in liver transplantation is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2. Objectives 1.2.1. To investigate the hypothesis that perioperative treatment with&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine reduces the incidence of early allograft dysfunction and primary graft&#xD;
      non-function in deceased donor liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2.2. The impact of dexmedetomidine on postoperative renal and pulmonary function will also&#xD;
      be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3. Study Design This is a prospective, single-centre, randomised, parallel-group study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4. Setting Departments of Anesthesiology, Renji Hosptial, Shanghai Jiao Tong University&#xD;
      School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.5. Patients 200 patients (18-65 years) scheduled to undergo liver transplantation under&#xD;
      general anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.6 Intervention 1.6.1. For the patients in the treatment group, a loading dose of&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine will be given after induction of anaesthesia (1μg/kg over 10 min) followed by&#xD;
      a continuous infusion (0.5μg/kg /h) until the end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.6.2. For patients in the placebo group, an equal volume loading dose of 0.9% saline will be&#xD;
      given after the induction of anaesthesia followed by an equal volume continuous infusion&#xD;
      until the end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.6.3. All other supplements, e.g. opioids, sedatives and muscle relaxant, will be identical&#xD;
      in the both arms and administered according to routine clinical practice.&#xD;
