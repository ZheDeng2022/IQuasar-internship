  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We study the efficacy of Norepinephrine boluses on prevention of postreperfusion syndrome&#xD;
      during living donor liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NE and Post-reperfusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On portal vein declamping, we will start rapid 500 ml 4% albumin infusion or packed RBCs&#xD;
      (according to the anhepatic hemoglobin level 5 min before declamping) through 14 Gauge&#xD;
      peripheral venous cannula in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NE boluses technique; We will inject NE boluses in the C.V.P port of the pulmonary artery&#xD;
      catheter with 5 ml saline flushing after each. After reperfusion, we will start bolus&#xD;
      noradrenaline 20 µg if mean arterial blood pressure (mABP) decreases by 10 % or more of the&#xD;
      basal reading (immediately before portal vein declamping after ensuring withholding of the&#xD;
      surgical manipulation). Additional NE boluses will be given as follow;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If mABP rises to 65 mmHg (lowest target level), we will hold NE boluses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If mABP remains constant or begins to rise but did not reach 65 mmHg, we will give 20 µg&#xD;
           after 10 seconds from the previous bolus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If mABP continues to drop, we will add 10 µg to the previous dose after 10 seconds and&#xD;
           can be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If mABP remains below 65 mmHg more than 1 minute, we will give the scheduled bolus NE&#xD;
           with adding 10 µg adrenaline boluses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Anesthesia technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On admission to the pre-anesthetic room, patients will receive intravenous pantoprazole&#xD;
      sodium 40 mg, midazolam 0.02 mg/kg and the prophylactic antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the operating room, we apply standard monitors in the form of pulse oximetry, non-invasive&#xD;
      blood pressure, and electrocardiography. Induction of anesthesia will be fentanyl 2 µg/kg,&#xD;
      propofol 1-2 mg/kg, and rocuronium bromide 0.8 -1 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After tracheal intubation, we will insert an arterial catheter in the radial artery of the&#xD;
      non-dominant hand after performing modified Allen's test. Then, we will insert five port&#xD;
      pulmonary artery catheter for continuous cardiac output monitoring (the equipment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia will be maintained by sevoflurane in 40% oxygen with infusion of fentanyl 0.5-1&#xD;
      µg/kg/h and rocuronium bromide 200-400 µg /kg/h. We adopt goal directed fluid replacement&#xD;
      protocol keeping the target mABP of 65 mmHg using norepinephrine in fluid non-responders with&#xD;
      low SVR (German medical association 2009). Crystalloids will be Ringer's Acetate and the&#xD;
      colloid will be albumin 4% in Ringer Acetate solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will keep the intraoperative and the two-day postoperative glucose between 110 and 180&#xD;
      mg/dl by intravenous insulin infusion or glucose 10% or 25% boluses as appropriate. We&#xD;
      monitor UO hourly in the intraoperative and ICU periods and only administer frusemide to&#xD;
      prevent volume overload.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The donor surgical team will excise the right liver lobe (without inclusion of the middle&#xD;
      hepatic vein). They will flush the graft with 3-4 liters of cold&#xD;
      histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) (Custodial, Bensheim, Germany) via antegrade&#xD;
      flushing of the portal vein to get completely clear fluid without flushing via the hepatic&#xD;
      artery. Both recipient and donor operations will be synchronized to minimize graft&#xD;
      preservation time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The right hepatic vein will be unclamped then the portal vein and the graft preservative&#xD;
      contents will be washed into the systemic circulation by the portal blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NE and Post-reperfusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On portal vein declamping, we will start rapid 500 ml 4% albumin infusion or packed RBCs&#xD;
      (according to the anhepatic hemoglobin level 5 min before declamping) through 14 Gauge&#xD;
      peripheral venous cannula in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NE boluses technique; We will inject NE boluses in the C.V.P port of the pulmonary artery&#xD;
      catheter with 5 ml saline flushing after each. After reperfusion, we will start bolus&#xD;
      noradrenaline 20 µg if mean arterial blood pressure (mABP) decreases by 10 % or more of the&#xD;
      basal reading (immediately before portal vein declamping after ensuring withholding of the&#xD;
      surgical manipulation). Additional NE boluses will be given as follow;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If mABP rises to 65 mmHg (lowest target level), we will hold NE boluses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If mABP remains constant or begins to rise but did not reach 65 mmHg, we will give 20 µg&#xD;
           after 10 seconds from the previous bolus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If mABP continues to drop, we will add 10 µg to the previous dose after 10 seconds and&#xD;
           can be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If mABP remains below 65 mmHg more than 1 minute, we will give the scheduled bolus NE&#xD;
           with adding 20 µg adrenaline boluses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunosuppression:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive intravenous 0.5 gm methylprednisolone at the start of the warm&#xD;
      ischemia. After hepatic artery anastomosis and declamping, we will administer 500 mg&#xD;
      mycophenolate mofetil through the nasogastric tube and i.v. 20 mg basiliximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the ICU, patients will receive oral tacrolimus starting the day after the operation&#xD;
      (adjusting the dose targeting serum level of 5-10 ng/ml) and mycophenolate mofetil 500 mg 4&#xD;
      days after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the ICU:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We adopt early ICU tracheal extubation once the patient is hemodynamically stable and pH &gt;&#xD;
      7.3 with adequate consciousness and muscle power (guided by neuromuscular monitoring).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will keep the pulmonary artery catheter in place for hemodynamic monitoring in case of&#xD;
      instability and will exchange it by central venous catheter after 48 hours postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1- Preoperative data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age, sex, weight, height, BSA, MELD score and Child-Pugh classification&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medical co-morbidities: hypertension, cardiac diseases, Diabetes Mellitus&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cause of the end stage liver disease (ESLD), and the donor age and gender&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Liver tests: serum albumin, bilirubin, INR, AST, ALT&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. S.Cr&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. C-reactive protein We will collect the preoperative data 24 hours before the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2- Intra-operative and Post-operative data: The primary outcome will be the incidence of PRS.&#xD;
      We will record the lowest mABP, the duration of hypotension (below 20% from the basal value&#xD;
      or below 65 mmHg). We will record significant arrhythmias, ischemia (ST depression more than&#xD;
      1mV in lead II) during reperfusion and NE boluses. We will report the need and duration of&#xD;
      pre-reperfusion and post-reperfusion NE infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will record the intraoperative CI, SVI, mABP, mPAP, PAOP, SVR, PVR, and serum Na, K,&#xD;
      ionized Ca and Cl at six times;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  immediately before skin incision,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  at the beginning of the anhepatic (portal vein clamping),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 minutes before portal reperfusion,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 min after portal unclamping,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 min after hepatic arterial declamping and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  at the time of skin closure. The incidence of the AKI defined as 50% increase in the&#xD;
           S.Cr or 0.3 mg/dl increase from the baseline S.Cr in the early 48 post¬operative hours.&#xD;
           In the postoperative period, S.Cr will be measured at arrival to ICU, 1st, 2nd, 7th,&#xD;
           28th and at three-month postoperative with measuring of the 24 hour-urine output in the&#xD;
           first 2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will stage AKI as follow: stage 1 when S.Cr = 1.5-1.9 times baseline or &gt; 0.3 mg/dl&#xD;
      increase from the baseline, stage 2 when S.Cr = 2-2.9 times baseline and stage 3 when S.Cr =&#xD;
      3 times baseline or increase to &gt; 4 mg/dl or initiation of renal replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will record warm ischemia, cold ischemia, the total ischemia and the operative times. We&#xD;
      will mention the blood transfusions (before and after reperfusion), UO in the anhepatic phase&#xD;
      and the total intraoperative amounts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory assessment of the graft function will include pH, serum lactate, INR, AST, ALT,&#xD;
      GGT, albumin and bilirubin at the 1st, 2nd and 7th days postoperatively. We will report early&#xD;
      postoperative surgical complications (7 days) especially vascular insufficiency of the graft&#xD;
      detected by the ultrasound Doppler evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of persistent graft dysfunction, graft rejection and ischemia- reperfusion injury&#xD;
      will be diagnosed and graded by histopathological examination of liver biopsy performed by&#xD;
      consultant liver pathologist.&#xD;
