      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of pivotal response training (PRT)&#xD;
      in an intensive center-based preschool environment to treat social communication deficits in&#xD;
      children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The study will compare Pivotal Response&#xD;
      Treatment (PRT) to a delayed treatment group (DTG). PRT is a naturalistic behavioral&#xD;
      intervention based on the principles of applied behavior analysis which has shown to be&#xD;
      effective in treating the core deficits in children with ASD. The study will compare the&#xD;
      combination of parent training with intensive center-based PRT (PRT-C) to a DTG and will&#xD;
      include 44 children ages 2 to 3.11 years with ASD and social communication deficits.&#xD;
