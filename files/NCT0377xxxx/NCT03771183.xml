  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no strict recommendations for the management of patients who have received&#xD;
      at least one or two lines of anthracyclines-based chemotherapy and taxane therapy for&#xD;
      advanced breast cancer. However, Halaven® can represent a therapeutic alternative at this&#xD;
      stage of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, since march 2011, Halaven® has been granted Marketing Authorization (MA) for patients&#xD;
      with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer, whose disease has progressed after at&#xD;
      least two lines of chemotherapy for advanced disease (3rd line). In these patients, the&#xD;
      indication for marketing authorization specifies that the previous treatment must have&#xD;
      included an anthracycline and a taxane except in patients who can not receive these&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An extension of indication was obtained on 27/06/2014 with a marketing authorization obtained&#xD;
      in the treatment of locally advanced or second-line metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the Transparency Commission of the High Authority of Health (HAS dated September&#xD;
      23, 2015), Halaven® (Eribulin), administered as monotherapy, in the third line of treatment&#xD;
      and beyond, represents a therapeutic option, because it brings an improvement of medical&#xD;
      service rendered compared to Capecitabine (XELODA®) and Vinorelbine (NAVELBINE®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, Halaven® (Eribuline) administrated as monotherapy in second-line of treatment is&#xD;
      an alternative to other monotherapies recommended for the treatment of locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic relapsed breast cancer, such as Capecitabine (XELODA®). and Vinorelbine&#xD;
      (NAVELBINE®). But, no improvement of medical service rendered has been reported in second&#xD;
      line of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to these results, it would be interesting to have additional data concerning the&#xD;
      use of Halaven® (Eribulin), in the second and third lines, but also in the fourth line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, the investigators propose to perform a study in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer who have failed treatment after the first line and beyond.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will be particularly interested in &quot;long-responder&quot;&#xD;
      patients, that is to say, in objective response or with stability for 6 months or more under&#xD;
      Halaven®, in order to better characterize these patients. Patients must have been treated by&#xD;
      Halaven between September 2011 and December 2016, to have a sufficient follow-up for the&#xD;
      survival data of the patients.&#xD;

      The investigators will perform a cross-sectional study in patients with metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer who have failed treatment after the first line and beyond.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will be particularly interested in &quot;long-responder&quot;&#xD;
      patients, that is to say, in objective response or with stability for 6 months or more under&#xD;
      Halaven®, in order to better characterize these patients. Patients must have been treated by&#xD;
      Halaven between September 2011 (the year of obtaining the MA in the 3rd line of treatment)&#xD;
      and December 2016, to have a sufficient follow-up for the survival data of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also focus on patients with liver metastases because there is limited&#xD;
      data in this population.&#xD;
