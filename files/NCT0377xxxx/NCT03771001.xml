  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study refines a wellness program designed for caregivers of autistic children&#xD;
      called 5Minutes4Myself and further investigates its feasibility. Participants will attend a&#xD;
      workshop to consent, participate in focus groups on lifestyle issues, and complete a baseline&#xD;
      survey. Participants will have an individualized consultation with a coach to develop their&#xD;
      tailored wellness program and be introduced to an app that support habits to build wellness&#xD;
      activities into their daily life. The app provides the participant with their goal profile,&#xD;
      tailored reminders, weekly check-ins, and delivers a micro-mindfulness program. Coaches will&#xD;
      check-in monthly with participants and work together to modify their program as desired.&#xD;
      After 4-6 months, participants will gather for a closing workshop to discuss their lifestyle&#xD;
      and to evaluate the program. Pre-/post-surveys will examine health, well-being, stress,&#xD;
      depression, and mindfulness. The app usability will be assessed using the Modified Systems&#xD;
      Usability Scale (MSUS) as well as usage data.&#xD;

      This study is designed to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conduct focus groups with caregivers of autistic children to understand specific&#xD;
           stressors that they experience;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Gather baseline data including surveys of health and well-being;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Administer an individualized wellness program by using motivational interviews (MI) to&#xD;
           individually tailor the program for each participant, train participants to use an app&#xD;
           designed to support the adoption of lifestyle changes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Coach participants over the 4-6 months of their program; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Assess the usability of the app and the impact of the wellness program on caregiver's&#xD;
           health and well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be invited to the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus or participate&#xD;
      online where they will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. complete baseline surveys of physical and mental health, mindfulness, stress, and&#xD;
           wellbeing (Center for Epidemiology Depression Scale -Revised; Five Facet Mindfulness&#xD;
           Questionnaire; Perceived Stress Scale; Psychological Well-being Scale; Rand Short&#xD;
           Form-36),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. get introduced to the study procedures and research team (Principal Investigator,&#xD;
           Researcher, and MI-trained Masters-level occupational therapy and counseling graduate&#xD;
           students); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. participate in focus groups to introduce the 5Minutes4Myself program, offer data on&#xD;
           current lifestyles, and receive training on how to use the app&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned coaches. They will work together in an initial lifestyle&#xD;
      coaching session and continue meeting monthly for 4-6 months. To assess the fidelity of the&#xD;
      coaching sessions, motivation interviewing sessions (initial and monthly) will be audio-- or&#xD;
      video--taped to assess fidelity via the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity tool&#xD;
      (MITI). Participants will be asked to complete an assessment of their satisfaction with the&#xD;
      coaching. Data will be archived for the ongoing project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coaches will use Motivational Interviewing strategies to identify barriers to&#xD;
      implementing the mindfulness program, foster commitment talk, and elicit the participant's&#xD;
      strategy for implementing the mindfulness program in their daily life. Participants may&#xD;
      request additional consultation through the weekly app goal check-in or via email.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The app will host all baseline surveys allowing them to be completed electronically. The&#xD;
      baseline surveys will be completed prior to the first coaching session. The app will also be&#xD;
      used as a &quot;habit builder&quot; providing personalized notifications as to when a goal activity&#xD;
      will be created, will have goal check ins for each goal, and will collect usage data for&#xD;
      audio mindfulness podcasts that are part of the program. Usage data will show how often and&#xD;
      for how long participants listened to a podcast during the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the 4-6 month intervention, participants will return for another workshop&#xD;
      that will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Completion of Focus Group;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Re-administration of 'baseline' surveys (now considered 'post-intervention');&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assessing the usability of the app via the MSUS; and&#xD;

    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale is a measure of the degree to which the participant perceives their life as stressful. A series of 10 questions are asked to which the participant answers either: 0 = Never; 1 = Almost Never; 2 = Sometimes; 3 = Fairly Often; 4 = Very Often. The scoring for positively worded questions is calculated by reversing the response (0=4, 1=3, 2=2, 3=1, 4=0). Higher total scores indicate more perceived stress.</description>
