  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Communication is one of the greatest health needs for high quality end-of-life (EOL) care in&#xD;
      the intensive care unit (ICU), especially when patients are too ill to speak for themselves&#xD;
      and rely on surrogates to make EOL decisions. Yet, there is no effective nursing intervention&#xD;
      designed to improve communication between surrogates and clinicians. In order to enhance&#xD;
      understanding of the surrogates' needs in the transition to EOL, this study will propose a&#xD;
      new theory-grounded communication intervention, Nurse-Led Communication Strategy (NLCS) and&#xD;
      will evaluate its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: In 2014, 14.7% of Americans died using intensive care unit (ICU) services. It is&#xD;
      a clinical imperative to provide high quality EOL care. Strong communication with surrogates&#xD;
      is vital for high quality EOL care due to the fact that seriously ill patients often cannot&#xD;
      talk, and they rely on surrogates (often family members) to make EOL decisions. There have&#xD;
      been many studies conducted in the past, trying to improve EOL communication. Yet, evidence&#xD;
      shows that communication remains poor in the ICU. To date, there is lack of evidence for a&#xD;
      particular nursing strategy that effectively improves communication and the quality of EOL&#xD;
      care in the ICU. The goal of this proposed study is to develop a new nurse-led communication&#xD;
      strategy (NLCS). Specific Aim: To assess the NLCS's feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      preliminary effects among surrogates of patients who are unable to communicate in the ICU.&#xD;
      Theory: NLCS is grounded in the state-of-the art framework &quot;COMFORT&quot; which has guided a&#xD;
      validated and effective communication training for nurses in the care of patients with&#xD;
      life-threatening illness and their families. NLCS applies 'COMFORT' into a usable nursing&#xD;
      communication strategy that research nurses use the framework to engage one communication&#xD;
      session per day with surrogates during the ICU stay. Methods: A single-center pilot&#xD;
      two-groups comparison study. The study design involves the recruitment of surrogates in the&#xD;
      ICU to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of the NLCS.&#xD;
      Analysis: To assess feasibility, we will use descriptive statistics and a COSORT&#xD;
      (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) flow diagram to determine recruitment and&#xD;
      attrition. For acceptability, we will use an unpaired (independent) t test to compare the&#xD;
      scores of the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8)and between intervention and control&#xD;
      groups. To evaluate preliminary effects of the intervention, we will compare the pre- and&#xD;
      post-test scores of the Quality of Communication (QOC) questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and&#xD;
      Depression Scale (HADS), and Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) between intervention and control&#xD;
      groups. It determines whether the NLCS is perceived as appropriate, acceptable, and&#xD;
      potentially effective. The by-product analysis uses a linear regression to determine which&#xD;
      factors are associated with the scores of the . This proposal provides an opportunity for the&#xD;
      first time to develop a theory-grounded nursing communication strategy that is feasible,&#xD;
      acceptable, and poses low cognitive load for surrogates in the ICU, and it enhances the&#xD;
      understanding of surrogates' needs in the transition to EOL and thereby potentially improves&#xD;
      the quality of EOL care. This research training will take place at the University at Buffalo&#xD;
      School of Nursing, an exceptional research-intensive university, under the mentorship of Dr.&#xD;
      Chang and Dr. Lorenz (methodology), Dr. Sullivan (EOL studies), and Dr. Wittenberg&#xD;
      (communication theory). The training plan will provide the investigator with research skills&#xD;
      and the preliminary data.&#xD;

    <time_frame>During ICU stay, approximately 5 days</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility is measured by the number and timing of actual versus planned recruitment. Checklist is used to calculate the weekly recruitment rate which is the ratio of the enrollment out of the total number screened. The dropout rate is used to examine attrition of the intervention.</description>

    <description>All participants will complete the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) at the time of ICU discharge to assess the acceptability of Nurse-Led Communication Strategy (NLCS) and Treatment as Usual (TAU) communication. The CSQ-8 include eight items assessing whether the intervention is perceived as appropriate, acceptable, and effective in improving communication in the ICU and whether participants are willing to participate if a similar study is offered. Their responses are scored from 1 to 4, and thus the possible total scores range from 8 to 32. Higher scores indicate greater satisfaction.</description>

    <measure>Pre- and post-intervention scores of the Quality of Communication (QOC) questionnaire between intervention group and control group.</measure>
    <time_frame>During ICU stay, approximately 5 days</time_frame>
    <description>The QOC has 13 items with two subscales (general communication skill and end-of-life scales). Each item score ranged from 0 to 10. Higher score of QOC indicated a more favorable perception of physician-family communication.</description>

    <time_frame>During ICU stay, approximately 5 days</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS is a 14-item/4-point Likert self-administered scale and consists of two subscales (depression and anxiety). The subscale total scores range from 0 (no distress) to 21 (severe distress), and a score above 11 indicates clinically significant symptoms of anxiety or depression.</description>

    <measure>Pre- and post-intervention scores of the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) between intervention group and control group.</measure>
    <time_frame>During ICU stay, approximately 5 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Decisional Conflict Scale has 10 items with three subscales: (a) uncertainty in choosing options, (b) factors influencing uncertainty in decision making, and (c) effective decision making. The Decisional Conflict Scale been frequently used among surrogate decision makers to evaluated decisional conflict or uncertainty. The score ranges from 0 (no decisional conflict) to 100 (extremely high decisional conflict).</description>
