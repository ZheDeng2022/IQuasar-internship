             (2K), (SLEDAI 2K) score of ≥ 4 points. The &quot;clinical&quot; score is the SLEDAI 2K&#xD;
             assessment score without the inclusion of points attributable to any blood laboratory&#xD;
             results including immunologic measures. Neurologic descriptors of the SLEDAI 2K are&#xD;
             not counted towards the SLEDAI 2K study entry criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received all scheduled vaccines according to local guidelines and Investigator&#xD;
             judgement. Live or live-attenuated virus vaccines are not permitted within 1 month&#xD;
             prior to screening or during screening. For all other vaccines there must be at least&#xD;
             2 weeks between the vaccination(s) and the date of randomization at Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For male patients: Men who are permanently sterile by bilateral orchidectomy are not&#xD;
             required to use contraception. Men whose partner (or potential partner) is a women of&#xD;
             childbearing potential*, for the duration of the study (including 30 days after the&#xD;
             last dose of study drug) must use a condom. For female patients: Women of childbearing&#xD;
             potential* must be willing and able to use a double-barrier contraception (barrier in&#xD;
             the meaning of method) with at least one highly effective method of birth control per&#xD;

             consistently and correctly for the duration of the study including 4 weeks after the&#xD;
             last dose of study drug. Medically accepted methods of contraception in this study&#xD;
             are:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Combined (oestrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal birth control associated&#xD;
                  with inhibition of ovulation in combination with male condom.&#xD;

                       least 1 year prior to enrolment), Or&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  The patient must follow true abstinence from male-female sex. This is&#xD;
                       defined as being in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
                       patient. Periodic abstinence e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                       post-ovulation methods; declaration of abstinence for the duration of&#xD;
                       exposure to IMP; and withdrawal are not acceptable.&#xD;
