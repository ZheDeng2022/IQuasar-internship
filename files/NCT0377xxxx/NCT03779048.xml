  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-phase study. Phase 1 will evaluate obesity-related behavioral and biological&#xD;
      characteristics as potential predictors of response to behavioral treatment (BT) for weight&#xD;
      loss. Phase 2 is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, RCT to test whether adding weight loss&#xD;
      medication to BT improves 24-week weight loss, as compared to BT with placebo, in subjects&#xD;
      identified as having suboptimal early weight loss after 4 weeks of individual behavioral&#xD;
      weight control. All participants, regardless of their early weight loss, will receive the&#xD;
      same BT program of diet, physical activity, and behavior therapy for weight loss for an&#xD;
      additional 24 weeks (28 total weeks of treatment).&#xD;

      Subjects will be a total of 150 adults, aged 21-70 years, with a body mass index (BMI) of 31&#xD;
      kg/m2 or above (28 kg/m2 with an obesity-related comorbidity). In phase 1, eligible subjects&#xD;
      will complete questionnaires and an in-person baseline assessment of obesity-related&#xD;
      behavioral characteristics (satiety, hunger, the relative reinforcing value of food&#xD;
      [RRVfood], and impulsivity [delay discounting]), neuropeptides, and gastric emptying. After&#xD;
      this baseline assessment, participants will begin an initial 4-week behavioral treatment (BT)&#xD;
      &quot;run-in&quot; delivered individually in 20-30 minute weekly sessions (delivered virtually).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of phase 1 will be to evaluate baseline satiety, postprandial change in&#xD;
      GLP-1, and gastric emptying as predictors of percent weight loss after 4 weeks of BT. We will&#xD;
      also examine whether these variables predict categorization as a suboptimal early responder&#xD;
      to BT (e.g., &lt;2.0% loss; co-primary outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints of phase 1 are percent weight loss from the start of the BT run-in (week&#xD;
      -4) to randomization (week 0) and categorization as a suboptimal early responder, as&#xD;
      predicted by additional behavioral characteristics (hunger as measured by VAS ratings,&#xD;
      RRVfood as measured using a computer task, and impulsivity as measured using a delay&#xD;
      discounting computer task) and neuropeptides (higher fasting ghrelin, lower fasting leptin,&#xD;
      and lower postprandial changes in insulin and PYY).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase 2, suboptimal early responders (based on weight loss during the BT run-in) will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to 24 weeks of: 1) BT plus placebo (BT+P); or 2) BT plus medication (BT+M;&#xD;
      phentermine 15.0 mg). Both treatment groups will continue to attend 20-30 minute individual&#xD;
      BT sessions (delivered virtually), weekly for the first 12 weeks and every other week for the&#xD;
      last 12 weeks (total of 18 visits). Both treatment groups will also take once daily study&#xD;
      medication (placebo or phentermine 15.0 mg) for the duration of the intervention period.&#xD;
      Early BT responders identified during the run-in will receive the same 24-week BT program,&#xD;
      but will not receive study medication or be included in the randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessments administered at baseline - questionnaires, including behavioral testing,&#xD;
      blood draws, and measurements of body weight - will be repeated at randomization (week 0) and&#xD;
      at week 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of phase 2 is change in body weight (i.e., % reduction in initial&#xD;
      weight), as measured from randomization to week 24, among suboptimal early responders&#xD;
      assigned to BT+P vs. BT+M. A randomized sample size of 50 non-responders (25 per group),&#xD;
      assuming a 20% attrition rate, will give us 81.5% power to detect between-treatment group&#xD;
      differences at week 24 of 4.5% (effect size: d = 0.82).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints of phase 2 will include change in body weight in kg from randomization to&#xD;
      week 24, as well as the portion of suboptimal early responders who achieve a&#xD;
      post-randomization loss of ≥ 5% and ≥ 10% of initial body weight. We will also examine&#xD;
      differences between suboptimal early responders treated with BT+M vs. BT+P in changes in&#xD;
      hunger, satiety, the reinforcing efficacy of food, and impulsivity between randomization and&#xD;
      week 24. A comparison will also be made in percent weight loss from randomization to week 24&#xD;
      between suboptimal early responders treated with BT+M and early responders treated with BT&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
