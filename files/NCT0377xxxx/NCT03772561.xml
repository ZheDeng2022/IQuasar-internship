  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      combination treatment of AZD5363 + Olaparib + Durvalumab and to determine the RP2D in&#xD;
      patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumor malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this trial is to determine if combination treatment of drugs, Olaparib,&#xD;
      AZD5363 and Durvalumab has beneficial effects in advanced or metastatic cancers and to&#xD;
      determine the effects it has on patients and their cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ To evaluate the safety and tolerability of combination treatment AZD5363 + Olaparib +&#xD;
      Durvalumab and determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs),&#xD;
      and Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) for patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumor&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the pharmacodynamics (PDn) of combination treatment AZD5363 + Olaparib +&#xD;
           Durvalumab in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumor malignancies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe anti-tumor response using immune RECIST of combination treatment AZD5363 +&#xD;
           Olaparib + Durvalumab in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumor malignancies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate anti-tumour response using RECIST v1.1 for combination treatment AZD5363 +&#xD;
           Olaparib + Durvalumab in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumor malignancies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore molecular correlates of the relationship between mutations in Akt/&#xD;
           PIK3CA/PTEN pathway and response to AZD5363 +Olaparib+ Durvalumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To understand the role of tumour microenvironment in regulation of intratumoral immune&#xD;
           regulators (i.e. T-regulatory cells) in improving response to Durvalumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To understand the role of AZD5363 as an immunomodulator&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the role of PD-1 and PDL-1 immunohistochemical and tumour MMR status in&#xD;
           predicting response to immune check point inhibitors.&#xD;

      This study is divided into 3 different periods: Screening, Treatment, and End of Treatment&#xD;
      Before taking the treatment, patients will have some tests and procedures done to make sure&#xD;
      they are eligible for the study (Screening). Then they will enter the Treatment period, where&#xD;
      Durvalumab, Olaparib and AZD5363 will be administered to them. If they stop taking your study&#xD;
      medication for any reason, an End of Treatment visit will be conducted within 30 days after&#xD;
      the last doze of study medication.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Adequate hematologic function defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  (i) platelets &gt;= 100 x 109/L in dose escalation phase, (ii) hemoglobin &gt;= 6.21&#xD;
                  mmol/L or 10 g/dL, (iii) ANC &gt;= 1.5 x 109/L, (iv) WBC &gt;= 3.0 x 109/L. Up to 5%&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Hepatic function: bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), ALT and&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Adequate renal function: estimated creatinine clearance of &gt;= 60 mL/min,&#xD;
                  calculated using the formula of Cockcroft and Gault: (140-Age) â€¢ Mass (kg)/(72 â€¢&#xD;
                  creatinine mg/dL); multiply by 0.85 if female.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Amylase and lipase &lt;= 1.5 x ULN;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Alkaline phosphatase limit &lt;= 2.5 x ULN (&lt;= 5 x ULN for patients with liver&#xD;
                  involvement of their cancer);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  International normalization ratio (INR) (if not on anticoagulation therapy) and&#xD;
                  partial thromboplastin time (PTT) &lt;= 1.5 x ULN;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Normal TSH and ACTH&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non sterilized male&#xD;
             partner must use at least 2 highly effective method of contraception from the time of&#xD;
             screening and must agree to continue using such precautions for 180 days after the&#xD;
             last dose of durvalumab + any drug combination therapy or 90 days after the last dose&#xD;
             of durvalumab monotherapy. Non-sterilized male partners of a female patient must use&#xD;
             male condom plus spermicide throughout this period. Cessation of birth control after&#xD;
             this point should be discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual&#xD;
             activity for the total duration of the drug treatment and the drug washout period is&#xD;
             an acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the&#xD;
             withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control. Female subjects should&#xD;
             also refrain from breastfeeding throughout this period. Acceptable methods of&#xD;
             contraception are as below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male partner sterilisation (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of&#xD;
                  the absence of sperm in the ejaculate).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  True abstinence&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  It is not known whether AZD5363 has the capacity to affect the metabolism of&#xD;
                  hormonal contraceptives, so hormonal contraception should also be combined with a&#xD;
                  barrier method of contraception or patients must have evidence of&#xD;
                  non-child-bearing potential by fulfilling one of the following criteria at&#xD;
                  screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Post-menopausal: defined as aged more than 50 years and amenorrhoeic for at&#xD;
                       least 12 months following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Documentation of irreversible surgical sterilisation by hysterectomy,&#xD;
                       bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy, but not tubal ligation&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Non-sterilized males who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing&#xD;
             potential must use a male condom plus spermicide from screening through 180 days after&#xD;
             receipt of the final dose of durvalumab + any drug combination therapy or 90 days&#xD;
             after receipt of the final dose of durvalumab monotherapy. Not engaging in sexual&#xD;
             activity is an acceptable practice; however, occasional abstinence, the rhythm method,&#xD;
             and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception. Male patients&#xD;
             are required to use barrier methods of contraception and refrain from sperm donation&#xD;
             throughout the study and for 180 days after the last dose of study drug. Male patients&#xD;
             wishing to father children should be advised to arrange for freezing of sperm samples&#xD;
             prior to the start of study treatment. Breastfeeding women are also excluded from&#xD;
             study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. At time of registration, if the patient has had previous treatment it must have been&#xD;
             at least 4 weeks since major surgery or radiation therapy; four weeks from any other&#xD;
             previous anti-cancer therapy including biologics. Patients must have recovered from&#xD;
