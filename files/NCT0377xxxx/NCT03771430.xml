  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy&#xD;
      delivered as an e-therapy program, combined with physical exercise delivered by&#xD;
      physiotherapists, for patients on waiting list for total knee arthroplasty. The patients will&#xD;
      be randomized to either 1) a non-surgical program consisting of web-based cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy combined with physiotherapy, 2) total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery&#xD;
      followed by web-based cognitive behavioral therapy combined with physiotherapy, or 3) a&#xD;
      control group who undergo TKA followed by standard physiotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multidisciplinary trial testing an intervention delivered by physiotherapists.&#xD;
      Up to 20% of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients continue to experience moderate/severe&#xD;
      pain 12 months after TKA. While physical therapy (PT) and cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT)&#xD;
      have shown promise for improving outcomes, they have not been evaluated in combination or in&#xD;
      patients at risk for chronic pain after TKA. This trial will evaluate PT+CBT combined, either&#xD;
      as a substitute for or as a supplement to TKA for patients at risk for chronic pain after&#xD;
      TKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot/Feasibility study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include a feasibility/pilot study with 15 patients to be performed from&#xD;
      November 2018. The intervention and study procedures may be modified based on results from&#xD;
      the feasibility/pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full scale Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The full-scale RCT will include 282 patients scheduled for TKA. Patients will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of three groups: 1) non-surgical intervention (i.e., PT+CBT), 2) a&#xD;
      combination of TKA with pre- and postoperative PT+CBT, or 3) A control group receiving TKA&#xD;
      and usual care follow-up. Primary outcome: The Pain subscale from the KOOS. The intervention&#xD;
      has the potential to improve outcomes for patients who currently obtain little benefit from&#xD;
      standard TKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross-sectional observational study: Patients declining to participate in the RCT will be&#xD;
      offered the option to participate in a separate cross-sectional study. The inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be identical to the RCT. Patients who agree to participate in the&#xD;
      cross-sectional study will complete the same baseline questionnaires as in the RCT and are&#xD;
      asked about the reasons they did not want to participate in the RCT.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in the knee injury and osteoarthritis score (KOOS) pain subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>Before randomization, 12 months after treatment start. Also measured at 3, 6, and 24 months after treatment start.12 months after treatment start will be the primary outcome.</time_frame>
    <description>KOOS is a knee-specific, patient administered questionnaire developed to evaluate short- and long-term symptoms and functioning in subjects with knee injury and osteoarthritis. KOOS is validated for use in total knee arthroplasty and has been shown to be a valid, reliable and responsive measure. KOOS is a patient-administered questionnaire.&#xD;
The KOOS is a knee joint specific questionnaire with 42 items designed to assess patients' opinions about their difficulties with activity due to problems with their knees during the past week. The pain subscale of the KOOS consists of 9 items that assess frequency of pain and pain severity in different situations. Each of the 42 items carries equal weighting (0-4), with higher scores indicating better functioning. The pain subscale score will be transformed to a 0-100 scale, with 0 representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no problems.</description>

Higher scores indicate higher levels of catastrophic thinking related to pain. A total score can be computed by summing responses to all 13 items. PCS total scores range from 0-52. Higher scores indicate higher levels of catastrophic thinking related to pain.</description>

    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Before randomization. 3, 6, 12 and 24 months following treatment start</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality index (PSQI) is a widely-used self-report measure of sleep disturbance during the past month. The PSQI consists of 19 items that measures different aspects of sleep. The 19 items produce 7 component scores (i.e., duration of sleep, sleep disturbance, sleep latency, day dysfunction due to sleepiness, sleep efficiency, overall sleep quality, need for sleep medications) each ranging from 0-3 where higher score indicate poorer sleep. All component scores can be summarized to a global score that range from 0 to 21 where higher scores indicate poorer sleep quality. The PSQI has good validity and reliability.</description>

    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) will be used to measure self-reported psychological distress (depression and anxiety). The scale consists of 14 items, 7 on the depression subscale and 7 on the anxiety subscale. The Norwegian version has excellent psychometric properties. Each subscale range from 0-21 where higher scores indicate higher levels of anxiety or depression. A total score (range 0 - 42) can be calculated from summarizing all the 14 items. Higher scores indicate higher levels of anxiety/depression.</description>

The instrument consists of 2 subscales, fear-avoidance beliefs for work, and fear-avoidance beliefs for physical activity (FABQ-PA). Only the FABQ-PA subscale will be used in this study. The FABQ-PA consists of 4 items where patients rate their agreement with 5 statements about pain and physical activity. The FABQ-PA range from 0-24 and higher scores indicate higher levels of pain-related fear of movement.</description>

    <description>The Health Locus of Control Scale (HLCS) will be used to measure patients' anticipations between own health and disease behavior and consequences of the behavior. The scale consists of 18 statements. Patients rate their agreement on a 6 point likert scale ranging from disagrees completely to agrees completely. Scoring: The scoring system consists of 3 subscales: The Internal Locus of Control, the Powerful Others Health Locus of Control, and the Chance Health Locus of control. The scores are obtained by summing items for each subscale. Higher scores indicate stronger agreement or inclination towards that particular subscale.</description>
