      Purpose of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To improve the upper extremity motor functions of patients with adolescent cerebral&#xD;
           palsy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prevent treatment interruptions as age progresses,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increase the hand functions of children with cerebral palsy and to increase their living&#xD;
           standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hand functions will be assessed with MACS (Manual Ability Classification System), hand&#xD;
      dynamometer, box-block test, 9 hole peg test, pressing velocity measured with Cubase MIDI&#xD;
      (musical instrument data interface) program. Patients will receive 2 days of 40 minutes per&#xD;
      week, total 3 months of customized piano training. Each session will be started with finger&#xD;
      warming exercises, then with the right hand, left handed and with both hands, a simple&#xD;
      pentatonic array will be played. In the following lessons, notes will be marked with colors&#xD;
      and simple songs will be taught. At the end of 3 months, the tests will be repeated.&#xD;

      Cerebral palsy is the development, movement and posture disorder that causes the limitation&#xD;
      of activity which is thought to be caused by non-progressive disorders in the fetal or infant&#xD;
      brain. Intensive rehabilitation program begins in early childhood; However, adults with&#xD;
      cerebral palsy are less likely to receive rehabilitative interventions. There is a great need&#xD;
      for effective upper extremity rehabilitation studies that motivate the patient in CP&#xD;
      (cerebral palsy) rehabilitation after childhood. Therapeutic Instrumental Music Performance&#xD;
      (TIMP) is one of the three techniques of neurological music therapy techniques for motor&#xD;
      rehabilitation. This technique uses instruments to strengthen functional motor patterns.&#xD;
      There are very few studies on TIMP in individuals with cerebral palsy and these studies have&#xD;
      not been performed on patients with adolescent cerebral palsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To improve the upper extremity motor functions of patients with adolescent cerebral&#xD;
           palsy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prevent treatment interruptions as age progresses,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increase the hand functions of children with cerebral palsy and to increase their living&#xD;
           standards.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Not have been previously trained piano&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To have enough cognitive function to perform commands&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Accepted to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for not being included in research:&#xD;
