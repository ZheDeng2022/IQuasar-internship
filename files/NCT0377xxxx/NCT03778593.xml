    <textblock>
      Biliary tract cancer (BTC) is rare in the West, but it is relatively high in Asia, including&#xD;
      Korea. Currently used as the standard primary treatment in metastatic or locally advanced BTC&#xD;
      is gemcitabine/platinum combination chemotherapy.There is no standard secondary chemotherapy&#xD;
      recognized after the failure of the gemcitabine/platinum first line treatment. The&#xD;
      investigators try to evaluate role of 5-FU, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin&#xD;
      combination chemotherapy (FOLFIRINOX) for the patients who progressed after&#xD;
      gemcitabine/cisplatin first line chemotherapy.&#xD;

      &lt;Biliary tract cancer&gt; Biliary tract cancer (BTC) is a common term for malignant tumors that&#xD;
      occur in gallbladder and bile duct, the path in which bile is released. According to the&#xD;
      anatomical location, biliary tract cancer is divided into intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and&#xD;
      extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is classified as&#xD;
      perihilar cholangiocarcinoma and distal cholangiocarcinoma. Biliary tract cancer is rare in&#xD;
      the West, but it is relatively high in Asia, including Korea. Biliary tract cancer occurs&#xD;
      annually in Korea, accounting for about 5,600 cases, 2.4 percent of the total cancer, and&#xD;
      ranks sixth in deaths from cancer. Biliary tract cancer is a type of cancer that is difficult&#xD;
      to treat because most patients are diagnosed with progressive diseases that cannot be&#xD;
      operated. Only about a quarter of patients are diagnosed with surgical-ready conditions as a&#xD;
      treatment where full surgical operation can be expected to complete, but the five-year&#xD;
      survival rate for operation is poor at 8-44% due to a high recurrence after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;Metastatic or relapsed biliary tract cancer treatment&gt; Chemotherapy is the main treatment in&#xD;
      BTC, which is relapsed or metastatic status. 5- Fluorouracil (5-FU)-based treatment has been&#xD;
      shown to improve the survival period for pancreatic and bile cancer patients compared to the&#xD;
      optimal supportive care (5-FU/leucovorin Â± etoposide 6.0 vs. 2.5 months, p &lt;0.01). Also,&#xD;
      chemotherapy helped maintain the quality of life. The improvement in quality of life over a&#xD;
      period of at least four months showed a significant difference compared to 10% in the group&#xD;
      that received only optimal supportive care for 36% of the chemotherapy group. (p &lt; 0.01).&#xD;
      Currently used as the standard primary treatment in metastatic or locally advanced BTC is&#xD;
      gemcitabine/platinum combination chemotherapy. In a large phase III study,&#xD;
      Gemcitabine/cisplatin significantly improved the median value of the progressive free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) period from 5.0 months to 8.0 months, and the overall survival (OS) period&#xD;
      from 8.1 months to 11.7 months, compared to the gemcitabine alone. If Cisplatin is not&#xD;
      available, oxaliplatin can be considered as a merger with gemcitabine. The&#xD;
      Gemcitabine/oxaliplatin regimen reported in the phase II and phase III studies PFS was&#xD;
      4.2-5.5 months, median for the OS period was 9.5-12.4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;Salvage treatment of biliary tract cancer&gt; To date, there is no standard secondary&#xD;
      chemotherapy recognized after the failure of the gemcitabine/platinum primary treatment.&#xD;
      Since BTC usually occurs at an advanced age and shows a low frequency of occurrence in the&#xD;
      West, there are practical limitations to conducting large-scale clinical research. So far,&#xD;
      there is no large three-phase study proving the benefits of secondary chemotherapy after the&#xD;
      failure of gemcitabine/platinum chemotherapy. Implementation of secondary chemotherapy in&#xD;
      actual clinicians is known to vary from country to country, depending on the medical judgment&#xD;
      of the responsible clinician. In a large-scale retrospective study by the Association des&#xD;
      Gastro-Enterologies Oncology (AGEO) group in France, 32.5% of the patients were treated with&#xD;
      second line therapy, and 75% of the patients were reported in Japan. A retrospective study&#xD;
      and a two-phase study and systematic literature review suggest that there will be a benefit&#xD;
      from the treatment if second line treatment is selected for patients whose general health is&#xD;
      relatively well maintained. Results of single or combination therapy using drugs such as&#xD;
      Irinotecan, oxaliplatin, 5-FU, S-1, and capecitabine were reported in phase II and&#xD;
      retrospective studies, yielding an average of 3.2 months of PFS, 7.7% of mean response rate,&#xD;
      and 7.2 months of OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 5-FU/leucovorin/irinotecan (FOLFIRI) therapy, along with the capecitabine/irinotecan&#xD;
      therapy, is reported as the most commonly used secondary chemotherapy in the AGEO group in&#xD;
      France. A treatment strategy for continuous use of FOLFIRI as a secondary treatment after the&#xD;
      failure of Gemcitabine/oxaliplatin showed the median value for OS period of 21.9 months, and&#xD;
      the median value for the PFS period. The PFS and OS due to the FOLFIRI was found to be 3.2&#xD;
      months and 8.4 months, respectively. On the other hand, the FOLFOX therapy, which combines&#xD;
      oxaliplatin with 5-FU, showed a response rate of 21.6 % when administered as a secondary&#xD;
      treatment after the failure of gemcitabine/cisplatin, and a median PFS of 3.1 months. A phase&#xD;
      III study is currently underway that compares the administration of FOLFOX as a secondary&#xD;
      treatment with the optimum support. In Korea, there is a problem with the standard&#xD;
      reimbursement for applying to drugs prescribed to cancer patients, and in particular, cancer&#xD;
      drugs that can be used as secondary therapy in metastatic BTC patients are limited. There is&#xD;
      a need to improve the prognosis of BTC patients by expanding the use of various drugs that&#xD;
      have been proven through external clinical research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;5-FU, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin combination chemotherapy (FOLFIRINOX) regimen&#xD;
      for other cancer of BTC&gt; In a pre-clinical experiment, oxaliplatin and irinotecan have&#xD;
      synergistic effects and are known to have relatively no overlap of toxic effects among, 5-FU,&#xD;
      leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin. The combination treatment of&#xD;
      5-FU/leukovorin/irinotecan/oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) had a high therapeutic effect on&#xD;
      progressive pancreatic cancer and colon cancer. In a phase III study comparing FOLFIRINOX and&#xD;
      gemcitabine as a first line treatment in metastatic pancreatic cancer, the objective response&#xD;
      rate (32 vs. 9%), PFS (6.4 vs. 3.3 months) and OS (11.1 vs. 6.8 months) were significantly&#xD;
      higher in FOLFIRINOX. On the other hand, treatment-related toxicities, with a grade 3/4 of&#xD;
      neutropenia (46 vs. 21%), febrile neutropenia (5.4 vs. 1.2%), thrombocytopenia (9.1 vs.&#xD;
      3.6%), sensory neuropathy (9 vs. 0%), vomiting (23 vs. 18%), and diarrhea (113 vs. 2%) were&#xD;
      more common in FOLFIRINOX. In a phase III study comparing the&#xD;
      5-FU/leukovorin/irinotecan/oxaliplatin(FORFOXRI) and the 5-FU/leukovorin/irinotecan(FORFIRI)&#xD;
      as a first line treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer, the FORFOXRI group was objective&#xD;
      response (66 vs. 41 %), the PFS (9.8 vs. 6.9 months) and the OS (2.6 vs. 16.7 months) showed&#xD;
      significant improvements. In pancreatic cancer, FOLFIRINOX was a treatment that was limited&#xD;
      in patients with good general condition due to its high level of toxicity, including&#xD;
      neutropenia, but the dose-reduction proved to be applied not only as a primary treatment but&#xD;
      also as a secondary treatment. In a phase II study of pancreatic cancer patients in China,&#xD;
      there was a 29% of grade 3/4 neutropenia were reported due to the treatment of modified&#xD;
      FOLFIRINOX using oxaliplatin 68 mg/m2, irinotecan 135 mg/m2, and 5-FU injection of 2,400&#xD;
      mg/m2 for 46 hours, and there was no increase in mortality and febrile neutropenia. Other&#xD;
      major grade 3 or higher toxicity levels showed improved safety profiles with thrombocytopenia&#xD;
      (4.8%), anemia (8.1%), infection (4.8%), and elevated liver enzyme (14.5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;Rationale of this trial&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a 2nd line treatment for metastatic BTC the assessment of modified FOLFIRINOX is supported&#xD;
      by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The prognosis for metastatic BTC, which fails first line therapy, is poor and has no&#xD;
           standardized treatment. Therefore, better treatment modalities are required to improve&#xD;
           the survival of patients who no longer respond to first line treatment and to maintain&#xD;
           the quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatments that use irinotecan or oxaliplatin as secondary therapy for metastatic BTC&#xD;
           have been shown in retrospective and phase II studies and are actually used in clinical&#xD;
           practice of other countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oxaliplatin and irinotecan have synergistic effects and the FOLFIRINOX therapy, which&#xD;
           uses both drugs together in 5-FU/leucovorin, has been shown to increase efficacy in&#xD;
           pancreatic and colon cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The modified FOLFIRINOX, which was used with reduced dosage, indicates an acceptable&#xD;
           toxic profile while maintaining its efficacy&#xD;
