  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the capability of a patient with Chronic&#xD;
      Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) or Waldenström Macroglobulinemia (WM) to generate an immune&#xD;
      response to the Shingrix vaccine under first-line BTK inhibitors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) are known risk&#xD;
      factors for zoster reactivation, commonly called shingles. Although a recently FDA-approved&#xD;
      recombinant, adjuvanted herpes zoster vaccine (Shingrix) is currently being offered to these&#xD;
      populations, no study has specifically evaluated them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to complete a single-arm trial evaluating if patients with CLL or&#xD;
      WM, while on treatment with first-line BTK inhibitors, can achieve immunologic response to&#xD;
      Shingrix. If effective, this will result in a new, well-tolerated shingles prevention&#xD;
      strategy for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the capability to mount a humoral immune response to&#xD;
      Shingrix in patients with CLL or WM under first-line BTK inhibitors.&#xD;
