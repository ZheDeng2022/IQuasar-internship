  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mast cells help the body fight disease and heal wounds. People with indolent systemic&#xD;
      mastocytosis (ISM) make too many mast cells. This causes pain, tiredness, digestive problems,&#xD;
      and other symptoms. Researchers think the drug sarilumab could help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if sarilumab is a safe and effective treatment for people with ISM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18-75 with ISM who are enrolled in NIH study 02-I-0277&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow removed by a needle inserted into the hip bone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasound of the abdomen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photographs of the skin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will repeat some screening tests at study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a baseline visit in the hospital for 3 days. They will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be assigned to get either the study drug or a placebo. They will not know which one they&#xD;
           get.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a skin punch biopsy: An instrument will remove a small piece of skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Get their first drug dose injected under their skin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will keep a side effect and medication diary during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will visit the clinic to get a drug dose every 2 weeks, for a total of 8 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a visit 2 weeks after their final dose. It will last up to 2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have another visit 12 weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may then continue this study for 1 more year. Those who continue will get&#xD;
      sarilumab, even if they previously got the placebo, every 2 weeks. They will have visits&#xD;
      every 6 weeks, and then every 3 months.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic mastocytosis is a disorder caused by clonal mast cell proliferation and release of&#xD;
      mast cell mediators including tryptase. As a result, mast cell numbers may increase and&#xD;
      affect target organs including the dermis (maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis/urticaria&#xD;
      pigmentosa, flushing), gastrointestinal tract (abdominal pain, diarrhea), skeletal system&#xD;
      (osteoporosis), hematological system (anemia, thrombocytopenia), and spleen and liver&#xD;
      (organomegaly). Patients with indolent (non-aggressive) systemic mastocytosis (ISM) are not&#xD;
      candidates for cytoreductive therapy and are generally treated with symptomatic therapy that&#xD;
      only partly decreases symptoms. There is, however, a documented association between severity&#xD;
      of mastocytosis and elevated serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6. Furthermore, mast cells have&#xD;
      been shown to double their rate of division and exhibit increased reactivity and release of&#xD;
      mediators when cultured in the presence of IL-6. In addition, in an animal model of&#xD;
      mastocytosis, anti-IL-6 has been shown to slow disease progression. In this study, adults&#xD;
      with ISM will thus be randomized and treated with sarilumab, a recombinant monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody directed against the IL-6 receptor, or receive placebo. Sarilumab is marketed in the&#xD;
      United States as Kevzara (Sanofi/Genzyme [Cambridge, MA, USA ]) and is approved by the Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Binding of sarilumab to&#xD;
      the IL-6 receptor inhibits IL-6-associated human mast cell signaling and proliferation with a&#xD;
      resultant decrease in proliferation and reactivity (decreased mediator release), and&#xD;
      therefore is a rational choice for the treatment of ISM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, participants will be randomized with approximately half of the participants&#xD;
      receiving study drug, which will be administered at 200 mg via subcutaneous (SC) injection&#xD;
      once every 2 weeks (Q2W) for a total of 16 weeks. The other participants will receive a&#xD;
      placebo administered via SC injection Q2W for 16 weeks. Participants will return for a&#xD;
      follow-up visit 2 weeks after the final dose (treatment peak), and then again 12 weeks later.&#xD;
      Evaluations at study visits will include quality of life and symptom assessments and&#xD;
      measurement of serum tryptase levels. Bone marrow examination will be performed at the onset&#xD;
      and conclusion of the study. After the week 28 visit, all participants will have the option&#xD;
      to continue sarilumab for 52 more weeks, at 200 mg administered via SC injections.&#xD;
      Participants will continue to be monitored on a regular basis for safety concerns, as&#xD;
      instructed in the study drug s package insert.&#xD;
