    <textblock>
      The purpose of this first-in-human study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of single intravitreous injections,single ascending doses, of RC28-E(a&#xD;
      chimeric decoy receptor trap fusion protein by dual blockage of VEGF and FGF-2) in subjects&#xD;
      with wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized,double-center phase 1 study evaluating&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of single intravitreal injections of RC28-E in the&#xD;
      patients with AMD.RC28-E is recombinant dual decoy receptor IgG1 Fc-fusion protein,can block&#xD;
      VEGF-A and FGF-2. In preclinical studies suggested that RC28-E might be more effective in&#xD;
      inhibiting pathological angiogenesis than other VEGF antagonists on CNV. Every subject will&#xD;
      only accept one dose. In addition to safety and preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of RC28-E will be evaluated as well.&#xD;
