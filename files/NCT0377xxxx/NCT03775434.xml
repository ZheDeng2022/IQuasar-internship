      An open-label, multicenter, Phase Ib study of B244 delivered as a topical spray to assess&#xD;
      safety in pediatric subjects aged 2 to 17 years with atopic dermatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Condition or disease Intervention/treatment Phase Atopic Dermatitis (Eczema) Biological: B244&#xD;
      Phase 1b&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, open-label, single arm, multiple site study assessing twice daily B244&#xD;
      application for 28 days in pediatric subjects with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 36 subjects in 3 cohorts of 12 subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: subjects aged 2 to 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: subjects aged 6 to 11 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3, subjects aged 12 to 17 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Screening and Baseline, all subjects must have confirmed diagnosis of atopic dermatitis,&#xD;
      as defined by the Hanifin and Rajka criteria, which involves a minimum of 10% but no more&#xD;
      than 60% body surface area and a Validated Investigator Global Assessment for Atopic&#xD;
      Dermatitis (vIGA-AD) scale of 2 or 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study will be approximately 7 weeks. Subjects will attend for a Screening&#xD;
      visit between Days -21 and -14. If all eligibility criteria and none of the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria are met, subjects will be enrolled into the study and will be required to undergo a&#xD;
      14 day washout period (Days-14 to -1). Subjects will attend the study center on Day 1 and the&#xD;
      Baseline assessments will be performed before application of the first dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On confirmation of continued eligibility the subject and parent or guardian of the subject&#xD;
      will be coached on how to apply medication, depending on the affected areas. They will be&#xD;
      instructed to apply B244 twice daily (approximately 12 hours apart) for 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first dose will be applied in the clinic under the supervision of clinical staff. Details&#xD;
      of dose administration will be recorded in the study diary provided. The subjects with their&#xD;
      parent or guardian will return to the study center on Days 7, 14, and 21 for completion of&#xD;
      study assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a final study visit on Day 28, this will be defined as the end of the study for&#xD;
      the subjects. A time window of ±2 day will be permitted for these 4 visits. There will not be&#xD;
      a period of confinement in the study center all visits will be outpatient visits. Safety&#xD;
      monitoring will include review of TEAEs, vital signs and physical examination. Efficacy will&#xD;
      be assessed using EASI, vIGA-AD scale, POEM and ItchMan scores.&#xD;
