  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to investigate any difference of insertional torque strength for&#xD;
      osteoporotic patients with preoperative 1-month teriparatide injections versus those without.&#xD;
      The increased insertional torque of pedicle screws during surgery after only 1 month of&#xD;
      teriparatide use has also been studied. However, the effect of teriparatide on vertebral body&#xD;
      bone mineral density (BMD) prior to and after fusion surgery has not been studied. The&#xD;
      effects on screw insertional torque has also not been studied via a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial method.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For this project, adult patients (&gt;40 years) undergoing lumbar spinal fusion will be&#xD;
      randomized to undergo teriparatide treatment for 1 month prior to surgery. Patients will have&#xD;
      their baseline BMD assessed by DEXA scan must be considered as osteoporotic (&gt;2.5 SD from&#xD;
      sex-matched young adult, or previous vertebral and/or femoral fractures) and indicated for&#xD;
      spinal fusion surgery to undergo study. Exclusion criteria included Paget disease of bone,&#xD;
      high laboratory tests for serum alkaline phosphatase or calcium, previous radiation treatment&#xD;
      or fusion surgery to lumbar spine, bone tumors, metabolic bone disease, and hypersensitivity&#xD;
      to teriparatide. Surgery involving single- or multi-level lumbar spinal fusion for any of the&#xD;
      conditions: lumbar spinal stenosis, degenerative/isthmic/congenital spondylolisthesis,&#xD;
      degenerative scoliosis. Only the surgeon and assessors will be blinded as patients will know&#xD;
      their treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo a quantitative CT prior to initiation of teriparatide treatment. After one&#xD;
      month of Teriparatide treatment, the drug is discontinued with another DEXA scan to see the&#xD;
      changes in BMD. A quantitative CT will be performed after surgery and at 6 months&#xD;
      postoperatively. Follow-up schedules include preoperative, immediate postoperative,&#xD;
      postoperative 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and at 24 months. At all follow-up&#xD;
      timepoints, any complications, fusion demonstrated by cross-trabeculation on x-rays (with&#xD;
      final confirmation at the 6 month CT), and objective questionnaires for quality of life&#xD;
      including the EuroQoL 5 dimensions 5-level questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L), back pain numeric rating&#xD;
      scale (NRS), osteoporosis assessment questionnaire-physical function (OPAQ-PF) and ambulatory&#xD;
      status assessment (ASA) questionnaires will be recorded. Other quality-of-life scores include&#xD;
      ODI and SF-36, along with adherence evaluation of osteoporosis treatment (ADEOS),&#xD;
      osteoporosis attitude questionnaire and osteoporosis knowledge questionnaire. Once a patient&#xD;
      is identified to be suitable for this protocol, they will need to be assessed by a medical&#xD;
      social worker to be unable to afford this entire treatment regimen before institutional&#xD;
      support for the drug treatment is provided.&#xD;

    <description>This is a self-perceived severity of back pain. The scores range from minimum 0 (no pain) to maximum 10 (most painful) in a scale of severity. Hence, a higher value represents worse outcome. There are two subquestions: 1) What the patient indicates as the most severe pain in the past 24 hours of answering the questionnaire; 2) The patient indicates the score of the usual pain status in the past 24 hours. 0 represents no pain, 1-3 represents mild pain (nagging, annoying, interfering little with ADLs), 4-6 represents moderate pain (interferes significantly with ADLs), and 7-10 represents severe pain (disabling; unable to perform ADLs).</description>

    <description>This is a general osteoporosis score with 15 questions split into three categories (mobility, balance and transfer). A Likert scale of 6 answers are possible for each question from &quot;no difficulties&quot; to &quot;unable to perform&quot; in a scale of severity. A total score can be tabulated from adding all domain scores. Higher values indicate better outcome. A 0-100 scale provides a total score, where 0 indicates the worst health status and 100 no difficulties.</description>
