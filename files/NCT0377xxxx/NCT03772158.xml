  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine and compare the amount of study drug that gets into&#xD;
      your blood after the administration of each of the three formulations of cetirizine under&#xD;
      different conditions. Another objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of food on&#xD;
      the amount of study drug that gets into your blood after the administration of the&#xD;
      investigational formulation. Other objectives of this study are to determine the sensory&#xD;
      experience and ease of swallowing the investigational formulation, as well as to determine&#xD;
      the safety of test and reference formulations of cetirizine.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to establish bioequivalence of a cetirizine 10 mg chewable&#xD;
      tablet manufactured at Johnson &amp; Johnson Consumer Inc. (McNeil LLC) with two commercially&#xD;
      marketed cetirizine 10 mg immediate release (IR) tablets (ZYRTEC®, US reference) and&#xD;
      (Australian/EU reference), establish bioequivalence between the two commercial products&#xD;
      (ZYRTEC®, US reference and REACTINE®, Australian/EU reference), and to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      food on bioavailability of the cetirizine 10 mg chewable tablet compared to the&#xD;
      bioavailability of cetirizine 10 mg chewable tablet administrated with water only. In&#xD;
      addition, subject's sensory experience and ease of swallowing of the test product will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomized, single-dose, four-treatment crossover bioequivalence and food effect study of Cetirizine Chewable Tablets versus ZYRTEC® Immediate Release (IR) Tablets (US reference) and REACTINE® IR Tablets (EU and Australian marketed reference product).&#xD;
The study will be conducted in two parts. Part 1 of the study will have a randomized, four way crossover study design in which 40 healthy subjects, ages 18 to 55 years, will be randomized to four sequences of Treatments A, B, D and E over consecutive periods. No less than approximately 40% of either gender will be represented in the study population. Part 2 of the study will assess a potential food effect in which all subjects will be administered Treatment C in the fifth period.</intervention_model_description>
    <primary_purpose>Other</primary_purpose>
    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Blinding of the test and reference products to study subjects is not feasible, because the products are different dosage forms (chewable tablets and IR tablets) and administered in different ways (with or without water and fasted or fed). Personnel conducting the bioanalyses of samples will not know the treatment sequence. The randomization code will not be available to them until the analytical tables have been finalized and audited by the Algorithme Pharma (An Altasciences Company) Quality Assurance (QA) department.</masking_description>

             Investigator, sub-Investigators, study coordinators, other study personnel, employees&#xD;

             urinalysis at screening. Laboratory values will generally be within the normal ranges,&#xD;
             although minor deviations in tests (except those explicitly specified in the inclusion&#xD;
             criteria) that are not considered clinically important by the Investigator are&#xD;

&#xD;
         20. Has a positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1 and 2 antibodies,&#xD;
