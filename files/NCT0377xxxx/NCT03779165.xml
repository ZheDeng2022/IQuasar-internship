  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sustained, monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) is most commonly encountered in patients&#xD;
      with structural heart disease, usually with ischemic aetiology. It has been proven that&#xD;
      repeated episodes of sustained VT contribute to the mortality of patients with structural&#xD;
      heart disease. These patients are usually implanted with implantable cardioverter&#xD;
      defibrillator without (ICD) or with cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT-D). According to&#xD;
      the current guidelines 3D mapping with radiofrequency (RF) ablation of the tachycardia&#xD;
      substrate is an established therapeutic option. As part of the clinical follow-up of patients&#xD;
      implanted with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED), CIED function parameters are&#xD;
      monitored every 6 months, which is always done before and after any procedure involving RF&#xD;
      ablation. Furthermore, a transient drop of R wave sensing has been demonstrated after the&#xD;
      atrioventricular (AV) node ablation in patients with single-chamber pacemakers and fast&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation. The aim of this study is to assess the change in R wave sensing after&#xD;
      the RF ablation of VT substrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be performed as a clinical, prospective, multi-centre, observational cohort&#xD;
      study with a structured follow-up period of 12 months. All consecutive patients with&#xD;
      sustained VT implanted with ICD or CRT-D undergoing RF ablation procedure of myocardial&#xD;
      substrate, who are able to understand and sign informed consent, will be enrolled. Primary&#xD;
      objective is a R wave sensing drop &gt; 30% after VT substrate ablation procedure. Recruiting&#xD;
      should not exceed 12 months with the minimal follow-up period of 12 months (24 months in&#xD;
      total). Standardized statistical methods and test will be done using SPSS Software Version&#xD;
      22.0 or newer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This unique study offers the possibility to show the impact of RF ablation on short-term and&#xD;
      long-term R wave sensing change assessed by ICD or CRT-D's ventricle electrode in patients&#xD;
      with sustained VT and structural heart disease undergoing ablation procedure. This&#xD;
      observational data is needed to further refine the treatment of these patients and to prevent&#xD;
      possible ICD/CRT-D dysfunction which could endanger this patient population.&#xD;

      Sustained, monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) is most commonly encountered in patients&#xD;
      with structural heart disease, usually with ischemic aetiology. It has been proven that&#xD;
      repeated episodes of sustained VT contribute to the mortality of patients with structural&#xD;
      heart disease. These patients are usually implanted with implantable cardioverter&#xD;
      defibrillator without (ICD) or with cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT-D) as part of&#xD;
      sudden cardiac death (SCD) prevention and have had activation of the device due to the&#xD;
      sustained VT episodes. According to the current guidelines 3D mapping with radiofrequency&#xD;
      (RF) ablation of the tachycardia substrate is an established therapeutic option. As part of&#xD;
      the clinical follow-up of patients implanted with cardiac implantable electronic devices&#xD;
      (CIED), including ICDs and CRT-Ds, function parameters are monitored every 6 months. The same&#xD;
      check-up is done before and after any procedure involving RF ablation. Furthermore, a&#xD;
      transient drop of R wave sensing has been demonstrated after the RF ablation of the&#xD;
      atrioventricular (AV) node in patients with uncontrollable fast atrial fibrillation implanted&#xD;
      with single-chamber pacemakers. The above mentioned have not been studied yet in patients&#xD;
      ablated due to sustained VT. Hence, the aim of this study is to assess the change in R wave&#xD;
      sensing after the RF ablation of VT substrate in patients with structural heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be performed as a clinical, prospective, multi-centre, observational&#xD;
      (analytic, longitudinal) cohort study with patient enrolment in 4 electrophysiology centres&#xD;
      in Croatia and Switzerland and a structured follow-up period of 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consecutive patients with sustained VT implanted with ICD or CRT-D undergoing RF ablation&#xD;
      procedure of myocardial substrate, who are able to understand and sign informed consent, will&#xD;
      be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with combined mechanical aortic and mitral valve prostheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with RF ablation of VT done in the last 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with known damaged ICD/CRT-D electrode or battery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients undergoing VT ablation who have not been implanted with ICD or CRT-D&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients not willing or able to undergo clinical follow-up of ICD/CRT-D device&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with life expectancy &lt; 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not able to understand or willing to sign informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age &lt; 18 years Primary objective is a R wave sensing drop &gt; 30% after VT substrate&#xD;
           ablation procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific (secondary) end-points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  incidence of VT recurrence after the ablation procedure;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  risk factors for R wave sensing drop (&gt; 30%) after the RF ablation of VT substrate;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  time needed for R wave sensing recovery after the RF ablation procedure. Recruiting&#xD;
           should not exceed 12 months with the minimal follow-up period of 12 months (24 months in&#xD;
           total).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk categorisation of the study was done and the study was awarded a risk category A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was chosen according to annual procedure volumes in Croatia and Switzerland. In&#xD;
      addition, it is confirmed by power test (number needed to recruit: 52). Recruiting should not&#xD;
      exceed 12 months. Categorical variables will be presented by contingency tables in absolute&#xD;
      values and percentages. Categorical variables will be compared by the chi-square with Yates&#xD;
      corrections or Fisher's exact test. Continuous data will be expressed as means and standard&#xD;
      deviations or median with corresponding interquartile range. The differences in quantitative&#xD;
      variables will be tested by Mann-Whitney U-test (non-parametric test for independent&#xD;
      samples). Logistic regression will be used to analyse the association between all variables&#xD;
      of interest and the R wave sensing drop. Multivariate logistic regression will be used to&#xD;
      adjust for confounding factors. Predictors of the R wave sensing drop will be assessed in a&#xD;
      univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. The statistical analysis will be&#xD;
      done using SPSS Software Version 22.0 or newer (IBM SPSS Statistics, New York, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This unique study offers the possibility to show the impact of RF ablation on short-term and&#xD;
      long-term R wave sensing change assessed by ICD or CRT-D's ventricle electrode in patients&#xD;
      with sustained VT and structural heart disease undergoing ablation procedure. This&#xD;
      observational data is needed to further refine the treatment of these patients and to prevent&#xD;
      possible ICD/CRT-D dysfunction which could endanger this patient population. Despite a high&#xD;
      number of cohort registries for cardiovascular diseases (e.g. Danish heart registry,&#xD;
      ORBIT-AF, GARFIELD AF registry, Swiss AF registry), there are scarce data on patients with&#xD;
      structural VT and no data regarding R wave sensing changes influenced by RF energy&#xD;
      application in ventricles. In addition, this could influence obligatory rhythm-monitoring&#xD;
      duration and consequently hospitalization duration of patients with VT undergoing RF ablation&#xD;
      procedures. Apart from the above mentioned, in those patients with non-optimal preprocedural&#xD;
      R wave sensing, this could mean contraindication for procedure or having the need to do&#xD;
      postprocedural defibrillation testing. It is likely, that data from our study will lead to&#xD;
      future changes in periprocedural planning and modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in compliance with the current version of the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki, the ICH-GCP or ISO EN 14155 (as far as applicable) as well as all national legal&#xD;
      and regulatory requirements. According to ethical regulations, the study plan with the&#xD;
      proposed participant information and consent form as well as other project-specific documents&#xD;
      will be submitted to Ethic committee of the participating centres.&#xD;
