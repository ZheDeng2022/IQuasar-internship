    <textblock>
      The primary objective of Phase I is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      ruxolitinib in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone. The primary objective of phase&#xD;
      II is to evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) at 4 months in multiple myeloma subjects&#xD;
      who receive the combination treatment carfilzomib, dexamethasone, and ruxolitinib.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase I/II study of carfilzomib, ruxolitinib, and low-dose&#xD;
      dexamethasone for carfilzomib-refractory multiple myeloma. Phase I is designed to evaluate&#xD;
      overall maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ruxolitinib in combination with carfilzomib and&#xD;
      dexamethasone in the following cohorts: Cohort 1) 5mg ruxolitinib, Cohort 2) 10mg&#xD;
      ruxolitinib, Cohort 3) 15mg ruxolitinib. Phase II is designed to evaluate 4-month&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) in the following cohorts: Cohort A) non-responders to Phase I&#xD;
      regimen, Cohort B) responders to Phase I regimen. Up to 18 evaluable subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled in Phase I over approximately 12 months. An additional 30 evaluable subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled in Phase II over 24 months.&#xD;
