      This study aim to investigate the characteristics, complications and perinatal outcomes in&#xD;
      pregnant women with placenta previa.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Placenta previa (PP) is defined as the placenta overlying the endocervical os and grades&#xD;
      according to the relationship and the distance between the lower placental edge and the&#xD;
      internal os of the uterine cervix: low-lying previa, marginal previa, partial previa, and&#xD;
      complete previa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cesarean delivery and assisted reproductive technology are associated with an increased risk&#xD;
      of placenta previa in subsequent pregnancies. Other risk factors for previa include previous&#xD;
      spontaneous, elective pregnancy terminations, previous uterine surgery, increasing maternal&#xD;
      age and maternal parity, multiple gestations, smoking, cocaine use, and prior previa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is associated with numerous adverse maternal and fetal-neonatal complications, such as&#xD;
      perinatal hemorrhage, preterm birth, blood transfusion, hysterectomy, maternal intensive care&#xD;
      unit admission, disseminated intravascular coagulation, septicemia, thrombophlebitis, and&#xD;
      even fetal-neonatal and maternal death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 1:2 prospective, matched and hospital-based case-control study to investigate the&#xD;
      characteristics, complications and perinatal outcomes in pregnant women with placenta previa.&#xD;
      For each placenta previa women, the investigators selected two none-placenta previa pregnant&#xD;
      women as control from the same department matched on the mode of delivery, using simple&#xD;
      random selection when excess matches are available. The date of their admission is limited to&#xD;
      two days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This hospital is a tertiary university-affiliated medical center with a stable number of&#xD;
      approximately 12,000 deliveries per year. Placenta previa is diagnosed by experienced&#xD;
      ultrasonologists based on a transabdominal ultrasonic finding of placental tissue covering&#xD;
      the internal cervical os before delivery, and further confirmed by obstetricians at delivery.&#xD;
