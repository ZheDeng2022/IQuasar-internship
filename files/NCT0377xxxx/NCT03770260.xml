      This phase Ib trial studies side effects and best dose of pevonedistat when given together&#xD;
      with ixazomib in treating patients with multiple myeloma that has come back or does not&#xD;
      respond to treatment. Pevonedistat and ixazomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of MLN4924&#xD;
      (pevonedistat) in combination with MLN9708 (ixazomib citrate [ixazomib]) in relapsed and/or&#xD;
      refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) patients after more than one previous line of treatment.&#xD;
      (Dose-escalation phase) II. Describe the safety profile and tolerability of the combination&#xD;
      of MLN9708 (ixazomib) and MLN4924 (pevonedistat) in the proteasome inhibitor (PI)-sensitive&#xD;
      and PI-refractory populations. (Dose-expansion phase) III. Determine the anti-tumor activity&#xD;
      and overall response rates (ORR) in patients with RRMM with the use of MLN9708 (ixazomib) and&#xD;
      MLN4924 (pevonedistat) in combination. (Dose-expansion phase)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Attain pharmacokinetic (PK) characterization of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) in combination with&#xD;
      MLN9708 (ixazomib) for the purpose of understanding concentration-effect relationships of&#xD;
      both agents. (Dose-escalation phase)&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To correlate and predict disease response using the following tests: NAD(P)H dehydrogenase&#xD;
      (quinone) 1 (NQO1) and cystine/glutamate transporter (SLC7A11) (nuclear factor&#xD;
      [erythroid-derived 2]-like 2 [NRF2] target genes): evaluated on whole blood as markers of&#xD;
      MLN4924 (pevonedistat) activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of pevonedistat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ixazomib citrate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1, 8, and 15, and&#xD;
      pevonedistat intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Cycles repeat every 28&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 2-3&#xD;
      months for up to 2 years.&#xD;

A two-sided 95% exact binominal confidence intervals (CI) will be calculated for each category. The myeloma response rate (responses &gt;= PR) will also be tabulated by dose cohort and overall.

    <time_frame>Cycle 1, day 1 pre-dose at 0.5, 1, 2, 2.5, 5, 8, and 21 hours (each cycle = 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Descriptive statistics will be provided for selected PK data by dose and time as appropriate. Pevonedistat concentrations in these samples will be quantitatively measured using a liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (liquid Chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry [LC/MS/MS]) method in place at Covance under contract with Takeda. For pevonedistat, the individual PK parameters from a single dose will be estimated for maximum concentration (Cmax), area under the curve (AUC), half-life (t1/2), apparent CL/F, and apparent volume of distribution (V/F) using non-compartmental or compartmental PK methods with the software WinNonlin. Advanced population PK methods may be employed to assess the link between drug exposure and biological effects and efficacy.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Biomarker analysis of NQO1 and SLC7A11</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Descriptive statistics will first be used to summarize their gene expression in whole blood by Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Biomarker data will also be displayed graphically, where appropriate. Depending on whether data is normally distributed, Person or Spearman's correlation coefficient will be used to measure the correlations of NQO1 and SLC7A11 with the dosage of pevonedistat, and then tested with Wald's test. General Linear Model (GLM) will be used to compare each of the biomarkers (NQO1 and SLC7A11) between different dose levels of pevonedistat with and without adjusting for other factors. Logistics regression model will be further employed to test the adjusted effect of each biomarkers (NQO1 and SLC7A11) on the response rate after adjusting for dosage of pevonedistat as well as other factors.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Patients with known central nervous system involvement should be excluded from this&#xD;
             clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop&#xD;
