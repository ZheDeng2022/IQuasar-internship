    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single dose, pharmacokinetic (PK) study conducted at 1 study center in&#xD;
      the United States (USA). This study will evaluate the absorption, distribution, metabolism,&#xD;
      and elimination (ADME), mass balance, safety, and tolerability of a single dose of&#xD;
