  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main risk factor for development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is cirrhosis of any&#xD;
      etiology, with an annual incidence risk between 1-6%; currently the leading cause of death in&#xD;
      patients with cirrhosis and the 2nd cause of death by cancer worldwide. Chronic hepatitis C&#xD;
      (HCV) is the first single cause associated to cirrhosis and HCC in the Western world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the advent of new direct antiviral agents (DAA) of chronic HCV infection, virological&#xD;
      cure generally exceeds 90% of the cases. Previous studies have shown that the incidence of&#xD;
      HCC is lower in patients with virologic cure after treatment with pegINF schemes. However,&#xD;
      recently published data, open up more controversy regarding the incidence of HCC after&#xD;
      virologic cure with DAA. An increasing incidence of HCC after virologic cure in patients&#xD;
      treated with DAA has been observed, opening a paradox yet unexplained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project proposes to answer the following clinical research question: in patients with&#xD;
      HCV cirrhosis treated with DAA, is there a change in the incidence of hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma? To answer this question a prospective longitudinal cohort study of patients with&#xD;
      Child Pugh A-B cirrhosis will be held at 3 years minimum follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 210 patients will be included with clinical or histological or non-invasive&#xD;
      diagnosis of cirrhosis Child Pugh A or B, with HCV treated with DAA and without&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma at the time of enrollment. From this cohort, patients who develop&#xD;
      HCC during follow-up will be identified. Routine screening will be done through ultrasound&#xD;
      every 6 months in all subjects enrolled and the diagnosis of HCC will be according to&#xD;
      recommendations of European and American guidelines.&#xD;

      Name of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCIDENCE OF HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA IN CIRRHOTIC PATIENTS WITH HEPATITIS C INFECTION,&#xD;
      TRETAED WITH DIRECT ANTIVIRAL AGENTS IN LATIN AMERICA: A MULTICENTER PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the advent of new direct antiviral agents (DAA) of chronic HCV infection, virological&#xD;
      cure generally exceeds 90% of the cases. Previous studies have shown that the incidence of&#xD;
      HCC is lower in patients with virologic cure after treatment with pegINF schemes. However,&#xD;
      recently published data, open up more controversy regarding the incidence of HCC after&#xD;
      virologic cure with DAA. An increasing incidence of HCC after virologic cure in patients&#xD;
      treated with DAA has been observed, opening a paradox yet unexplained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project proposes to answer the following clinical research question: in patients with&#xD;
      HCV cirrhosis treated with DAA, is there a change in the incidence of hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma? To answer this question a prospective longitudinal cohort study of patients with&#xD;
      Child Pugh A-B cirrhosis will be held at 3 years minimum follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 210 patients will be included with clinical or histological or non-invasive&#xD;
      diagnosis of cirrhosis Child Pugh A or B, with HCV treated with DAA and without&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma at the time of enrollement. From this cohort, patients who develop&#xD;
      HCC during follow-up will be identified. Routine screening will be done through ultrasound&#xD;
      every 6 months in all subjects enrolled and the diagnosis of HCC will be according to&#xD;
      recommendations of European and American guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, preliminary results presented at the last European Congress of Hepatology in&#xD;
      Barcelona, Spain, and early published in Journal of Heaptology, open up more controversy&#xD;
      regarding the incidence of HCC after virologic cure post DAA. An unexpected higher incidence&#xD;
      and recurrence of HCC after treatment with these new drugs has been observed, opening a&#xD;
      paradox yet unexplained. Of particular interest then, is to clarify and find if there is a&#xD;
      change in the incidence of HCC in HCV cirrhosis after treatment with DAA in our region. It is&#xD;
      relevant on the other hand; that this study would be the first longitudinal cohort study&#xD;
      evaluating the development of HCC in patients with cirrhosis in Latin America. It is then&#xD;
      expected that the results would be extremely important to the medical science from this&#xD;
      region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Research Question In patients with HCV cirrhosis treated DAA, is there a change in&#xD;
      the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma? Primary Objective To evaluate the incidence of HCC&#xD;
      after treatment with DAA in patients with Child Pugh A or B cirrhosis and chronic HCV&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives will be related to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of HCC between cured and uncured of HCV with DAA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Impact of routine screening on survival in patients with HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Risk factors for development of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with HCV treated&#xD;
           with DAA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events and incidence of cirrhosis decompensation after DAA.&#xD;
