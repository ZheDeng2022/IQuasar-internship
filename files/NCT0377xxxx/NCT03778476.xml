      The purpose of this study is to identify the acute effects of isometric exercise on the&#xD;
      inhibition of pain in individuals with fibromyalgia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a chronic pain condition that is characterized by widespread&#xD;
      pain which affects 5-8% of the general population. Past research has shown that people with&#xD;
      FMS demonstrate enhanced pain facilitation and reduced pain inhibition in the central nervous&#xD;
      system. Incorporating a biopsychosocial model of pain may help develop strategies to prevent&#xD;
      the functional decline and alleviate the suffering that occurs in this population. Exercise&#xD;
      is a mainstay of pain rehabilitation with multiple health benefits, one of which is&#xD;
      decreasing pain; a phenomenon known as exercise induced hypoalgesia (EIH). Emerging evidence&#xD;
      has shown that exercise decreases pain facilitation in healthy adults and in some individuals&#xD;
      with FMS. However, it's unclear whether exercise improves pain inhibition in individuals with&#xD;
      FMS. The purpose of this study is to investigate endogenous pain inhibition, measured by&#xD;
      conditioned pain modulation (CPM), following isometric exercise of the quadriceps muscle in&#xD;
      individuals with FMS. In addition, factors that might affect this response such as physical&#xD;
      activity, body composition, and psychosocial issues will be examined. Understanding how&#xD;
      exercise impacts pain and the contributing factors will help guide the prescription of&#xD;
      exercise to optimize pain rehabilitation.&#xD;

    <time_frame>baseline, immediately after exercise or quiet rest</time_frame>
    <description>the change in pressure pain threshold (kPa) during or after the immersion of the foot in a cold water bath (approximately 6 degrees) compared with baseline (before foot submersion) constitutes the measure of conditioned pain modulation in this study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vibration Perception Threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, immediately after exercise or quiet rest</time_frame>
    <description>a biothesiometer will be used to measure sense of vibration (threshold) local and distal from the exercising muscle.</description>

    <measure>Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, during exercise, and immediately after exercise or quiet rest</time_frame>
    <description>in both sessions, pain intensity will be evaluated during ice water bath immersion (i.e. before and after exercise or quiet rest) and during exercise using an 11-point NPRS with 0 being no pain and 10 worst pain possible.</description>
