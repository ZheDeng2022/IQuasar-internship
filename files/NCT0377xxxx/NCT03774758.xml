  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study that will follow patients who undergo lung cancer&#xD;
      screening at the San Francisco VA Medical Center, University of California, San Francisco&#xD;
      (UCSF) Medical Center, and the San Francisco General Hospital. The proposed study will&#xD;
      comprise of two primary populations to determine the ctDNA assay performance in a variety of&#xD;
      clinical settings.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study objectives and statistical approaches to achieve those objectives are determined at the&#xD;
      level of the populations described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population 1: Sensitivity and Specificity Thresholding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this phase, the technical feasibility of the intended use case will be assessed in the&#xD;
      intended use population relative to known cancer status as established by standard clinical&#xD;
      methods. ctDNA samples from enrolled patients will be assessed in each of the following&#xD;
      cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1A: High-risk patients negative for lung cancer by CT screening and clinical&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1B: Patients with lung nodules ≥6 mm by CT but negative for lung cancer by extended (3&#xD;
      years) CT screening follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1C: Patients with lung cancer (histologically proven or by consensus tumor board&#xD;
      opinion of ≥90% probability of cancer) prior to definitive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population 2: Clinical Intended Use Performance. In this phase, the clinical performance of&#xD;
      the ctDNA assay will be evaluated in patients with high clinical suspicion for lung cancer.&#xD;
      ctDNA will be compared to the clinical diagnosis made according to the standard of care (e.g.&#xD;
      biopsy, CT surveillance, etc.). ctDNA samples from enrolled patients will be assessed in each&#xD;
      of the following cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2A: High-risk patients newly positive (Lung imaging Reporting And Data System&#xD;
      (Lung-RADS) &gt;=3) by CT screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2B: Patients with &gt;= 6 mm lung nodules suspicious for lung cancer by treating&#xD;
      physician judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2C: Patients with a personal history of lung cancer after completion of curative&#xD;
      intent treatment but without evidence of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To estimate the ctDNA assay sensitivity and specificity requirements in the&#xD;
      specific clinical use populations using patients with known non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To prospectively estimate the ctDNA assay clinical performance in the&#xD;
      clinical application of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENDPOINTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Estimation of the ctDNA assay's clinical sensitivity and specificity in&#xD;
      patients with lung cancer as proven by histology or tumor board consensus opinion* and in&#xD;
      patients with lung nodule ≥6 mm but without cancer as proven by extended CT screening&#xD;
      follow-up**.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Patients may be treated with curative-intent Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) without&#xD;
      tissue confirmation IF pretest probability for lung cancer by tumor board consensus opinion&#xD;
      is ≥90% and the biopsy risk is high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      **Extended CT screening follow-up defined by documentation of ≥3 years of radiographic&#xD;
      stability and consensus clinical opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Estimation of the ctDNA assay's clinical predictive value relative to&#xD;
      standard of care diagnostic work-up in suspicious nodule adjudication in both the high-risk&#xD;
      and general populations (the clinical applications of interest).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlation of the ctDNA assay performance with Lung-RADS radiographic criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlation of Lung-RADS with disease truth defined by clinical follow up as the&#xD;
           definite gold standard&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlation of plasma and tissue genotyping results&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlation of the ctDNA assay with orthogonal reference technologies (e.g. ddPCR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlation of the ctDNA assay performance with histologic sub-type and clinical course&#xD;
           (e.g. aggressive vs. indolent disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlation of the ctDNA assay performance with clinical lung cancer risk factors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlation of the ctDNA assay results pre-and post-resection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlation of follow-up the ctDNA assay results and kinetics vs. clinical recurrence&#xD;
           post-resection or radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimation of theoretical biopsy avoidance rate in clinical use population.&#xD;

      The goal of this study is to evaluate the ability of cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)&#xD;
      using Guardant Health's LUNAR technology to detect early stage in lung cancer as compared to&#xD;
      healthy volunteers and those patients at high risk for lung cancer, but without a lung cancer&#xD;
      diagnosis. ctDNA arises when DNA fragments are released into the bloodstream after cell death&#xD;
      and is distinguished from non-cancerous cell-free DNA (cfDNA) by the presence of somatic&#xD;
      alterations, e.g. mutations, gene amplifications, and fusions. In advanced stage non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC), evaluation of ctDNA in plasma can be used detect the presence of&#xD;
      resistance mutations and ultimately guide treatment while obviating the need for tissue&#xD;
      biopsy.&#xD;
