      This phase 2 multicenter, open-label clinical trial will evaluate safety and efficacy of two&#xD;
      of three potential doses/schedules of oral seliciclib in patients with newly diagnosed,&#xD;
      persistent, or recurrent Cushing disease. Up to 29 subjects will be treated with up to 800&#xD;
      mg/day oral seliciclib for 4 days each week for 4 weeks and enrolled in sequential cohorts&#xD;
      based on efficacy outcomes. The study will also evaluate effects of seliciclib on quality of&#xD;
      life and clinical signs and symptoms of Cushing disease.&#xD;
