  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For diseases that cause excessive daytime sleepiness (such as narcolepsy and idiopathic&#xD;
      hypersomnia), there are several medications that can be used to treat sleepiness. However, it&#xD;
      can be difficult to decide which medication to use for a particular individual for several&#xD;
      reasons: 1) there are very few studies that directly compare two medications to see which&#xD;
      works best; 2) there are very few studies that include people with a disorder of sleepiness&#xD;
      called idiopathic hypersomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this gap in knowledge, the researchers propose a randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      comparing modafinil and amphetamine salts in patients with narcolepsy type 2 or idiopathic&#xD;
      hypersomnia. All participants will either receive modafinil or amphetamine salts -- no&#xD;
      participant will receive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate which medication works better to improve sleepiness. The researchers&#xD;
      will also see which medication is better for other symptoms including difficulty waking up&#xD;
      and difficulty thinking, as well as seeing which medication causes fewer side. Finally, this&#xD;
      study will see if any information about patients (such as age or sleep study features)&#xD;
      predicts responding better to one medication or the other.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there are insufficient data to guide clinical practice regarding the use of&#xD;
      amphetamines for the treatment of narcolepsy. This may be particularly important in the case&#xD;
      of narcolepsy type 2, for which randomized, controlled trial data show that other treatments&#xD;
      are less beneficial than they are for participants with narcolepsy type 1. For the closely&#xD;
      related disorder of idiopathic hypersomnia, clinical trial data to guide treatment&#xD;
      decision-making are even more limited, with only three published controlled trials ever&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these evidence gaps, the researchers propose a randomized, active-treatment&#xD;
      controlled trial comparing modafinil and amphetamine salts for the treatment of narcolepsy&#xD;
      type 2 and idiopathic hypersomnia. The primary outcome will be reduction in excessive daytime&#xD;
      sleepiness, as measured by change in Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores from baseline to week 12&#xD;
      on treatment. Other important patient-reported outcomes will be considered as secondary&#xD;
      outcomes, including Patient Global Impression of Change for sleep inertia, cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction, and sleepiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to directly comparing the efficacy of these two medications for hypersomnolent&#xD;
      patients, this study will also evaluate for relatively safety in this population. Further,&#xD;
      this study will assess clinical predictors of treatment response. All three of these aims&#xD;
      will be complementary in informing shared decision-making about whether to treat with&#xD;
      modafinil or amphetamine salts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty-four adult patients seeking evaluation at the Emory Sleep Center for narcolepsy type 2&#xD;
      or idiopathic hypersomnia will be invited to participate and will be randomized to one of the&#xD;
      treatment arms upon consent. Participants will receive study treatment for 12 weeks.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) asks respondents to indicate how likely they are to doze off or fall asleep during daytime situations such as reading or talking to someone. There are 8 items which are answered on a scale of 0 to 4 where 0 = would never doze and 4 = high chance of dozing. Total score can range from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating more sleepiness. A score of 0 to 5 can be interpreted as &quot;lower normal daytime sleepiness&quot;, a score of 6 to 10 is &quot;higher normal daytime sleepiness&quot;, score between 11 to 12 are &quot;mild excessive daytime sleepiness, scores of 13 to 15 are &quot;moderate excessive daytime sleepiness&quot; and scores of 16 to 24 indicate &quot;severe excessive daytime sleepiness&quot;.</description>

    <description>The PGIc for Sleepiness asks respondents to rate their sleepiness compared to baseline. Responses are indicated on a scale of 1 to 7 where 1 = very much improved and 7 = very much worse.</description>

    <measure>Change in Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIc) for Sleep Inertia Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 4, 8, 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PGIc for Sleep Inertia asks respondents to rate their sleep interia compared to baseline. Sleep inertia is defined for participants as &quot;difficulty waking up and getting out of bed in the morning because of sleepiness&quot;. Responses are indicated on a scale of 1 to 7 where 1 = very much improved and 7 = very much worse.</description>

    <description>The PGIc for Cognitive Dysfunction asks respondents to rate their cognitive dysfunction compared to baseline. Cognitive dysfunction is defined for participants as &quot;difficulty with thinking, problems with attention or concentration, and/or brain fog&quot;. Responses are indicated on a scale of 1 to 7 where 1 = very much improved and 7 = very much worse.</description>
