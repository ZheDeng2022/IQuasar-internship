  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate whether the impact of PEMF and RF therapies is safe and&#xD;
      efficacious for the treatment of pain associated with soft tissue injuries as compared to&#xD;
      treatment with ultrasound, and to show the effects of PEMF and RF therapies on range of&#xD;
      motion and blood flow associated with soft tissue injuries as compared to ultrasound therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled study of the safety and efficacy of a radiofrequency (RF)&#xD;
      and pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) device compared to ultrasound (US) for the treatment&#xD;
      of pain associated with soft tissue injuries, and to show the comparative effects on blood&#xD;
      flow (BF) and range of motion (ROM). Total expected duration of the clinical study is&#xD;
      approximately 6 months (enrollment period of 4 months and a follow-up period of 3 weeks)&#xD;
      while individual participation will take three weeks.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Reduction in BPI-SF Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>Reduction in pain severity during daily activity at Visit 4 compared to Baseline as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (Short Form) - Severity. BPI-SF assesses pain at its 'worst', 'least', 'average', and 'now' (current pain) and is rated on a scale of 0-10, where 0 represents 'No pain' and 10 represents 'Pain as bad as you can imagine'.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Reduction in BPI-SF Interference Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>Reduction in pain interference during daily activity at Visit 4 compared to Baseline as measured by the BPI-SF Interference score. BPI-SF Interference score measures how much pain has interfered with seven daily activities, including general activity, walking, work, mood, enjoyment of life, relations with others, and sleep. The 0-10 scale is also used for pain interference, where 0 represents 'does not interfere' and 10 represents 'completely interferes'. BPI pain interference is typically scored as the mean of the seven interference items.</description>

          <description>The Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (BPI-SF) is a self-administered questionnaire made up of the response to 2 components: a) BPI-SF Severity which is the severity of a patient's pain and b) BPI-SF Interference which is the impact of this pain on daily functioning. The patient is asked to rate severity and interference on a 10-point scale where 0 represents 'No pain/No interference' and 10 represents 'Pain/Interference as bad as you can imagine'.</description>

        <description>Reduction in pain interference during daily activity at Visit 4 compared to Baseline as measured by the BPI-SF Interference score. BPI-SF Interference score measures how much pain has interfered with seven daily activities, including general activity, walking, work, mood, enjoyment of life, relations with others, and sleep. The 0-10 scale is also used for pain interference, where 0 represents 'does not interfere' and 10 represents 'completely interferes'. BPI pain interference is typically scored as the mean of the seven interference items.</description>

        <title>Mean Reduction in BPI-SF Interference Score</title>
        <description>Reduction in pain interference during daily activity at Visit 6 as measured by the BPI-SF Interference score. BPI-SF Interference score measures how much pain has interfered with seven daily activities, including general activity, walking, work, mood, enjoyment of life, relations with others, and sleep. The 0-10 scale is also used for pain interference, where 0 represents 'does not interfere' and 10 represents 'completely interferes'. BPI pain interference is typically scored as the mean of the seven interference items.</description>
