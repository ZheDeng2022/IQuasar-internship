    <textblock>
      Patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic squamous cell penile carcinoma&#xD;
      (SPC) who are in response or with stable disease after first line platinum containing&#xD;
      polychemotherapy who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be offered to take part in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients may be pre-screened at the time of the 1st line chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order for patients to be enrolled, the investigator must have carried out a radiological&#xD;
      assessment of the disease during first line systemic treatment (a maximum of between 3 and 6&#xD;
      cycles): the cancer must be controlled. Patients with disease progression cannot be included&#xD;
      in the PULSE study as this is a maintenance study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After inclusion, Avelumab will be administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg, at a frequency of once&#xD;
      every 2 weeks with appropriate supportive care.&#xD;

             behavior; or laboratory abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study&#xD;
             participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the&#xD;
             interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make&#xD;
             the patient inappropriate for entry into this study&#xD;
