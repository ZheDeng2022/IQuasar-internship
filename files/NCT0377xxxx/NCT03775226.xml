      An Early Feasibility Study to Assess Safety and Efficacy of the ChampioNIR® SFA Stent in the&#xD;
      Treatment of Patients with Femoro-Popliteal Disease&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      Device Overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ChampioNIR® SFA Stent is composed of a Nitinol alloy structure with an elastomeric&#xD;
      micro-fiber mesh and is designed specifically to be used in the peripheral vasculature. The&#xD;
      stent is characterized by high flexibility, strong radial support and high resistance to&#xD;
      fractures, as well as high deliverability and precise positioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and feasibility of delivery and implantation of ChampioNIR® SFA&#xD;
           Stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the early and long term ability of the stent to maintain vessel patency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the long term safety of the ChampioNIR® SFA Stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as an early feasibility, prospective, open label, single arm study. 30&#xD;
      patients with infra-inguinal peripheral arterial disease appropriate for treatment with a&#xD;
      femoro-popliteal stent will be treated with ChampioNIR® SFA stent implantation. All enrolled&#xD;
      patients will be followed up at 30 days and up to 36 months. The follow-up visits will&#xD;
      include patency evaluation by duplex ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary efficacy endpoint: Primary patency of the target lesion at 6 months. Primary patency&#xD;
      is defined as the absence of target lesion restenosis (defined by Duplex ultrasound (US) peak&#xD;
      systolic velocity ratio (PSVR) &gt;2.4) Primary safety endpoint: Composite rate of freedom from&#xD;
      all-cause death, target vessel revascularization or any amputation of the index limb through&#xD;
      30 days following stent implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary efficacy endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary patency defined by Duplex US peak systolic velocity ratio (absence of restenosis&#xD;
           which defined by Duplex US PSVR &gt;2.4) at 30 days and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Acute device success, defined as achievement of a final residual diameter stenosis of&#xD;
           &lt;50% by Quantitative Angiography (QA), using the assigned treatment only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Acute procedural success, defined as device success with &lt;50% residual stenosis&#xD;
           immediately after stent placement or mean trans-stenotic pressure gradient &lt;5 mmHg, and&#xD;
           without the occurrence of death, amputation or repeat revascularization of the target&#xD;
           lesion during the hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Acute technical success, defined as the attainment of &lt;50% residual stenosis by QA by&#xD;
           any percutaneous method as determined by the angiographic core laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The following endpoints at 30 days 6, 12, 24 and 36 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Secondary Patency (absence of restenosis which is defined as Duplex US PSVR ≥ 2.4)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Change of Rutherford classification from baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Change of resting ankle-brachial index (ABI) from baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Change in walking impairment questionnaire from baseline&#xD;

&#xD;
      Secondary safety endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Combined rate of death at 30 days, target lesion revascularization (TVR), index limb&#xD;
           amputation and increase in Rutherford-Becker Classification by ≥2 classes (as compared&#xD;
           to post-procedural assessment) throughout 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Stent fracture at 30 days 6, 12, 24 and 36 months. Stent fractures will be analyzed by a&#xD;
           two-view X-ray evaluation by a designated core laboratory, compared with a baseline&#xD;
           two-view X-ray taken before discharge and defined as type I, II, III, IV or V as&#xD;
           follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Type I - a single strut fracture only.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Type II - multiple single nitinol stent fractures that can occur at different&#xD;
                sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Type III - multiple nitinol stent fractures resulting in complete transverse linear&#xD;
                fracture but without stent displacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Type IV - a complete transverse linear type III fracture with stent displacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Type V - a spiral dissection of a stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Freedom at 30 days from all-cause death, index limb amputation above the ankle and TVR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The following endpoints will be assessed at 30 days, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. All-cause death&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Amputation (above the ankle)-Free Survival (AFS)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Target Vessel Revascularization (TVR)&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Re-intervention for treatment of thrombosis of the target vessel or embolization to&#xD;
                its distal vasculature&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Major Adverse Limb Events (MALE) at 30 days, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Stent thrombosis&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Clinically apparent distal embolization (defined as causing end-organ damage, e.g.&#xD;
                lower extremity ulceration, tissue necrosis, or gangrene)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Procedure-related arterial rupture&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Acute limb ischemia&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Target limb amputation&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Procedure related bleeding event requiring transfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is an early feasibility study and is not powered towards finding significant&#xD;
      differences in the primary endpoints. The sample size of up to 30 patients will allow for the&#xD;
      evaluation of feasibility and safety of the procedure, to support the initiation of a pivotal&#xD;
      study. No formal statistical power calculations were conducted.&#xD;
