  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aphasia is an acquired (typically left-hemisphere) multi-modality disturbance of language&#xD;
      that impacts around 2 million people in the USA. Aphasia impacts language production and&#xD;
      comprehension as well as reading and writing. The ramifications of aphasia extend beyond&#xD;
      language impairment to negatively impacting a person's social, vocational, and recreational&#xD;
      activities. Currently, the most effective way to treat aphasia is with speech-language&#xD;
      therapy (SLT). However, even if SLT is intensive, persons with aphasia are left with residual&#xD;
      language delays. Recent research suggests that pairing SLT with transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation (tDCS) a non-invasive, safe, low-cost form of brain stimulation may aid language&#xD;
      recovery in persons with aphasia. However, results from tDCS studies are inconclusive. The&#xD;
      success of tDCS in combination with SLT could depend on the timing of tDCS since tDCS-induced&#xD;
      effects depend on the neuronal state of the brain-networks at the time of the stimulation. In&#xD;
      this study, the differential impact of tDCS before behavioral SLT (offline-before therapy),&#xD;
      tDCS after SLT (offline-after therapy), and tDCS concurrently with SLT (online) on functional&#xD;
      language recovery in persons with aphasia will be investigated. Sham tDCS (i.e., SLT alone)&#xD;
      as a control group will also be included in the study. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      both offline and online tDCS will improve language functioning than sham tDCS.&#xD;

      tDCS Implementation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2mA of direct current for 20 minutes will be delivered using a constant current stimulator&#xD;
      via two electrodes in saline soaked sponges. To stimulate the left angular gyrus, a cathodal&#xD;
      electrode inside a saline soaked sponge (5 x 3cm) will be placed over the CP5 according to&#xD;
      the 10-20 international system for EEG electrode placement. The electrodes will be secured in&#xD;
      position by a custom-built EEG cap that will be marked with the location for angular gyrus.&#xD;
      The investigators will then confirm that the cathodal electrode is over the left angular&#xD;
      through the use of neuronavigation. The &quot;return&quot; anode electrode will be placed in a saline&#xD;
      soaked sponge (5 x 5cm) on the center of the supraorbital region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the tDCS, current will slowly ram-up during the first few seconds until&#xD;
      it reaches 2mA. The ramp-up process will acclimate the participants to tDCS-induced&#xD;
      sensations (e.g., itching). At the end of the tDCS sessions, current will slowly ramp down in&#xD;
      the last few seconds to 0mA. The total duration of the 2mA current will be maintained for 20&#xD;
      minutes. For sham stimulation, the investigators will place the electrodes in the same&#xD;
      location as the real tDCS groups with stimulation ending after few seconds. The brief&#xD;
      stimulation will produce tDCS-induced sensations so that participants will not be aware when&#xD;
      the tDCS stopped delivering direct current&#xD;
&#xD;
      Speech-Language Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard-of-care treatment - script training will be used to provide SLT to our participants.&#xD;
      The treatment will be delivered via a computer program, Aphasia Scripts Â®, whereby a virtual&#xD;
      therapist interactively guides the participants through treatment steps. Scripts will be five&#xD;
      to ten sentences and developed from common templates about topics relevant to daily life&#xD;
      (e.g., asking questions at the grocery store, ordering in a restaurant). The advantage of&#xD;
      using a computer program instead of a human therapist is that it removes extraneous variables&#xD;
      associated with human therapists (e.g., different levels of encouragement) and this, together&#xD;
      with the use of script templates, ensures treatment fidelity across participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of an individual subject's participation in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be requested to come for baseline sessions (3 to 4 hours) before the actual&#xD;
      experiment. The baseline assessments may be done over two visits. In the baseline session the&#xD;
      subjects' aphasia severity will be assessed. The participants will also perform baseline&#xD;
      tasks of language and cognition in this session. Subjects will then participate in 3 weeks of&#xD;
      tDCS and SLT (i.e., 15 sessions). The sessions will consist of 40 minutes of SLT and 20&#xD;
      minutes of tDCS. Subjects will be asked to return for an assessment immediately following the&#xD;
      end of treatment and for follow-up testing after 4 and 8 weeks. Therefore, total number of&#xD;
      visits will be 19-23 sessions (depending on how many visits are needed for the assessments)&#xD;
      over a period of three months.&#xD;
