    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety and tolerability of Renaparin in adult patients receiving a&#xD;
      deceased donor kidney treated ex-vivo with Renaparin prior to transplantation. Half the&#xD;
      patient group will receive a kidney treated with Renaparin, while the other half of the&#xD;
      patient group will receive a kidney treated with placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation is the last resort for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). A key problem&#xD;
      after transplantation is Delayed Graft Function (DGF). Short term, DGF will result in&#xD;
      patients being put on dialysis in the immediate time-period after transplantation. In the&#xD;
      longer perspective DGF is associated with increased risk of graft failure, thus decreasing&#xD;
      the efficacy of the kidney transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renaparin is a new product under development for the prevention of DGF in association with&#xD;
      kidney transplantation. The product binds to the kidney vascular endothelium and its&#xD;
      pharmacological effect is based on a local and effective presentation of heparin. Renaparin&#xD;
      is administered ex vivo to the kidney by adding it to the preservation solution during&#xD;
      Hypothermic Machine Perfusion (HMP) prior to transplantation.&#xD;
