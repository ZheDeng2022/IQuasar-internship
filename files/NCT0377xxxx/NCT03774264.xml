  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to develop a database of patients with Peyronie's&#xD;
      disease who are treated at the University of Miami. The collected data will help the&#xD;
      researchers to better understand Peyronie's disease and its response to therapy.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Psychosexual changes in Peyronie's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ).</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PDQ is highly responsive to treatment-related change in men with PD. It is self-administered, that measures psychosexual consequences after the presentation of PD. It is intended for men who have had vaginal intercourse in the past 3 months. The range of scores is from 0-24 points, with higher scores signifying greater psychosexual consequences from PD.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Penile pain evaluation in Peyronie's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ).</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PDQ is highly responsive to treatment-related change in men with PD. It measures penile pain in patients with PD. It is intended for men who have had vaginal intercourse in the past 3 months, which evaluate the levels of pain or discomfort based on last erection or vaginal intercourse. The range of scores is from 0-30 points, with higher scores signifying greater penile pain or discomfort.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Goniometer measurement to determine degree of curvature of PD.</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate the total degree change of curvature improvement after treatment with Xiaflex measured by goniometer, an instrument that measures the angle of the curvature to determine the degree of the PD.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 15-question International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Questionnaire is a validated, multi- dimensional, self-administered investigation that has been found useful in the clinical assessment of erectile dysfunction and treatment outcomes in clinical trials. A score of 0-5 is awarded to each of the 15 questions, with a range of scores from 0-75, with lower scores signifying poorer erectile function.</description>

    <description>Patients will be evaluated in our urology clinic at baseline for possible inclusion in our study. All patients at baseline evaluation will be evaluated for duration of symptoms, relationship stability, IIEF and PDQ. All patients will obtain a penile Doppler ultrasound with the aid of a vasoactive substance by a specially trained technician. During this visit, plaque measurements will be taken: location of plaque, distance of plaque from the tip of the penis, degree of curvature measured by goniometer.&#xD;
Ultrasound characteristics will be documented: Type (Type 1: The plaque appears as a thickening of the tunica albuginea without acoustic shadowing. Type 2: A moderately calcified plaque with a typical ultrasound shadow. Type 3: A severely calcified plaque with typical ultrasound shadowing) and Grade of calcification (grade 1 (&lt;0.3 cm), grade 2 (&gt;0.3 cm, &lt;1.5 cm), grade 3 (&gt;1.5 cm; or ≥ 2 plaques &gt;1.0 cm). Sample data sheet attached as appendix 2.</description>
