  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sympathetic nervous activity plays an important role in the development of hypertension and&#xD;
      studies have shown that the pannexin-1 channel is involved in the signalling of the&#xD;
      sympathetic activity to the vascular bed. The main project aim is to investigate the effects&#xD;
      of 10 weeks of high intensity training on the effect of the sympathetic nervous activity on&#xD;
      vascular function in individuals with essential hypertension. A secondary aim is to assess&#xD;
      the role of essential hypertension and physical activity on vascular endothelial function,&#xD;
