  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the safety and efficacy profile of the&#xD;
      antibody-cytokine fusion protein L19TNF in patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)&#xD;
      wildtype WHO grade III / IV glioma at first relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this phase is to evaluate the safety of L19TNF in patients with&#xD;
      IDH-wildtype WHO grade III / IV glioma at first relapse and to establish and confirm the&#xD;
      recommended dose (RD) for phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this phase is to evaluate antitumor activity of L19TNF in patients&#xD;
      with IDH-wildtype WHO grade III / IV glioma at first relapse.&#xD;
