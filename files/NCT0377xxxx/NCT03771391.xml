  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to measure changes in participants' blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels in&#xD;
      participants with PKU when switching from a conventional amino acid based protein substitute&#xD;
      to a GMP based protein substitute (PKU Sphere) over a 16 week period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a stepped wedge, open-label study of PKU Sphere for the dietary management of&#xD;
      participants with Phenylketonuria. It will be carried out with 33 participants who will be&#xD;
      randomised into one of three clusters. The total study length per patient is 16 weeks. Each&#xD;
      cluster transitions from taking their standard amino acid product alone to incorporating PKU&#xD;
      Sphere (at least 50% of their protein substitue requirement) at different timepoints: week 5,&#xD;
      9 or 13.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a face-to-face clinical review at the time of recruitment (week 0) and&#xD;
      at 16 weeks (completion of the study). They will also have an additional telephone review&#xD;
      when they switch onto PKU Sphere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be taken at baseline, and then every two weeks for the duration of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to these study visits and procedures, routine clinical care will continue in line&#xD;
      with local guidelines.&#xD;

    <intervention_model>Crossover Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>The study has a stepped wedge design, which is chosen over the alternative cross-over study as it allows that all participants start on the amino acid supplement and avoids the difficulty of the 'wash-out' period being the same as one of the treatment strategies being offered.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>At the point of randomisation every effort will be made to ensure that participants are unaware of the cluster they are randomised to; this is to help ensure that compliance is not affected by participants knowing when they will start the new treatment.</masking_description>
