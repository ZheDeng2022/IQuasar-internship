      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the bioequivalence of a single dose of one tablet of sotagliflozin (test)&#xD;
      compared to two tablets of sotagliflozin (reference) under fasting conditions in healthy male&#xD;
      and female subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the single-dose pharmacokinetics of sotagliflozin following administration&#xD;
           of one tablet sotagliflozin (test) compared to two tablets of sotagliflozin (reference)&#xD;
           in healthy male and female subjects under fasting conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate safety and tolerability of one tablet sotagliflozin (test) compared to two&#xD;
           tablets of sotagliflozin (reference) administered under fasted conditions in healthy&#xD;
           male and female subjects&#xD;

      21 days before first dose, 4 periods of dosing and pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling each lasting&#xD;

             tracing abnormality to be not clinically relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Laboratory parameters within the normal range, unless the Investigator considers an&#xD;
             abnormality to be clinically irrelevant for healthy subjects; however serum&#xD;
