  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center Ib / II study of triple targeted drug combination (aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitor letrozole，novel HER2-targeted small molecule inhibitor pyrotinib and CDK4/6&#xD;
      inhibitor SHR6390) as a first or second line of therapy in patients with relapsed/metastatic&#xD;
      hormone receptor positive and HER2-positive breast cancer.&#xD;

      This is a single-center, single arm, open-label, run-in phase Ib / roll-over phase II study&#xD;
      of letrozole in combination with novel human epidermal growth factor&#xD;
      receptor-2(HER2)-targeted tyrosine kinase Inhibitor pyrotinib and cyclin-dependent kinase&#xD;
      4/6(CDK4/6) Inhibitor SHR6390 in subjects with hormone receptor(HR)+/HER2+ relapsed or&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer. The study will enroll natural postmenopausal women, or women who&#xD;
      have undergone bilateral oophorectomy.The phase Ib part of the study will determine safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of the combination of letrozole, pyrotinib and SHR6390 to define that&#xD;
      appropriate dose of SHR6390 for phase II.Data from phase Ib showed the triplet of pyrotinib,&#xD;
      SHR6390, and letrozole had an acceptable safety profile and encouraging efficacy, potentially&#xD;
      offering a chemotherapy-sparing treatment option for patients with HER2-positive/HR-positive&#xD;
      MBC.Once the recommended regimen has been identified, subjects with the selected tumor type&#xD;
      will be enrolled into expansion cohorts for the purpose of assessing efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      the combination treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Data from phase Ib showed the triplet of pyrotinib, SHR6390, and letrozole had an acceptable safety profile and encouraging efficacy, potentially offering a chemotherapy-sparing treatment option for patients with HER2-positive/HR-positive MBC. Based on DLTs and clinical efficacy, pyrotinib 320mg/d, SHR6390 125mg/d, and letrozole 2.5mg/d was declared as RP2D. The pharmacokinetic analysis had not yielded conclusive results and would involve more samples in phase II trial.</description>
