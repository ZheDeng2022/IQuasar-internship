      acid to the bath twice weekly on the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score as compared&#xD;
      to adding dilute bleach to the bath including a control arm in which no solution is added to&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score improvement from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>At each visit until the last visit at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EASI score is a validated composite score that ranges from 0 (clear) to 72 (very severe). The EASI is assessed and calculated as: the proportion of affected body surface area (BSA) was estimated from 4 designated body regions (head/neck, upper limbs, trunk, and lower limbs), and the Physician's Assessment of Individual Signs was determined for each region. The Physician's Assessment of Individual Signs grades signs of AD (erythema, edema/induration/papulation, excoriation, oozing/weeping/crusting, scaling, and lichenification) on a 4-point scale, ranging from absent to severe. Both the proportion of affected BSA and the Physician's Assessment of Individual Signs score are used to calculate the EASI score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM)</measure>
    <time_frame>At each visit until the last visit at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The POEM measures the severity of eczema from a scale of 0-28 with 0 being clear and 28 as having severe eczema.&#xD;
0 to 2 = Clear or almost clear&#xD;
3 to 7 = Mild eczema&#xD;
8 to 16 = Moderate eczema&#xD;
17 to 24 = Severe eczema&#xD;
25 to 28 = Very severe eczema</description>

    <measure>Infant Dermatitis Quality of Life (IDQOL) for children under 4 years old</measure>
    <time_frame>At each visit until the last visit at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This quality of life (QoL) measures the patient quality of life from 0 - 30 with 0 being the patient's eczema doesn't have an affect on the patient's QoL while 30 means it has a profound effect on the patient's QoL.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Children's Dermatitis Quality of Life Index (CDQLI) for children at 4 years old or greater</measure>
    <time_frame>At each visit until the last visit at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This quality of life (QoL) measures the patient quality of life from 0 - 30 with 0 being the patient's eczema doesn't have an affect on the patient's QoL while 30 means it has a profound effect on the patient's QoL.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of oral antibiotic prescribing</measure>
    <time_frame>At each visit until the last visit at 6 months</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>At each visit until the last visit at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The IGA score (clear, almost clear, mild, moderate, severe, very severe; on numbered scaled where 0 = clear and 5 = very severe) at each visit</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency and severity of atopic dermatitis flares</measure>
