  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the impact of low dose aspirin on normal fallopian tube fimbriae in&#xD;
      women who have surgery to have their fallopian tubes removed. Participants will take a low&#xD;
      dose of aspirin for 2 weeks before their surgery. A portion of the removed fallopian tubes&#xD;
      will also be collected for future research and routine pathology purposes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects in this study will receive low dose aspirin for 14 days before undergoing surgery to&#xD;
      remove fallopian tubes removed to determine whether aspirin decreases inflammation in the&#xD;
      fallopian tube. Subjects will also submit blood samples at their initial visit with their&#xD;
      oncologist, at the time of surgery and at the pre-operative visit to measure inflammation&#xD;
      markers and blood counts. A portion of the subject's fallopian tube will be collected for&#xD;
      future research studies.&#xD;
