  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open, multi-center, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome Injection in Relapsed or refractory peripheral t-cell&#xD;
      and NK/T-cell lymphoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dosage regimen of Liposome-entrapped Mitoxantrone is multi-cycle 20mg/m2 intravenous&#xD;
      infusion. Every 4 weeks is a treatment cycle, with administration on the first day of each&#xD;
      cycle. End-of-treatment visit will be made to the subjects within 4 weeks after the end of&#xD;
      the last administration. Progression-free survival (PFS) follow-up will be conducted to the&#xD;
      subjects in stable or improved condition after treatment and the subjects with early&#xD;
      termination of treatment due to intolerance in Week 8 after the last administration of study&#xD;
      drug, and thereafter once every 8 weeks until PD, death, withdrawal of informed consent form&#xD;
      (ICF), starting another new treatment or end of the entire study (whichever occurs first).&#xD;
      Meanwhile, overall survival (OS) follow-up will also be conducted to the subjects with PD and&#xD;
      starting another new treatment once every 8 weeks until death, withdrawal of ICF or end of&#xD;
      the entire study (whichever occurs first).&#xD;
