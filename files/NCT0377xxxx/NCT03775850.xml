        Selected Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic solid&#xD;
             tumors who have had disease progression after treatment with all available therapies&#xD;
             for metastatic disease that are known to confer clinical benefit, or are intolerant to&#xD;
             treatment, or refuse standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have adequate organ function as defined in the clinical protocol. Specimens must be&#xD;
             collected within 10 days prior to the start of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have provided an archival tumor tissue sample obtained since the most recent prior&#xD;
             anticancer regimen or newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion not&#xD;
             previously irradiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Measurable disease by RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the local site&#xD;
             investigator/radiologist. Lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are&#xD;
             considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Metastatic disease not suitable for upfront curative-intent surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Progressive disease on previous line of therapy per treating investigator (additional&#xD;
             specific criteria for cohort C).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤ 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Additional tumor-specific inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Selected Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study treatment. Patients&#xD;
             must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require&#xD;
             corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted&#xD;
             for palliative radiation (≤2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-CNS disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Treatment with investigational therapy within 28 days prior to initiation of study&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti PD-L2 agent or with&#xD;
             an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (e.g.,&#xD;
             CTLA-4, OX40, CD137) and was discontinued from that treatment due to a Grade 3 or&#xD;
             higher immune-related adverse event (irAE).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy within 28 days or 5 half-lives,&#xD;
             whichever is shorter prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Patients must have recovered from all AEs due to previous therapies to ≤Grade 1&#xD;
             or baseline. Patients with ≤Grade 2 neuropathy may be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: If patient received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the&#xD;
             toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac diseases, including any of&#xD;
             the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction ≤ 3 months prior to C1D1;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Clinically significant heart disease (e.g., symptomatic congestive heart failure&#xD;
                  [e.g., &gt;NYHA Class 2]; uncontrolled arrhythmia, or hypertension; history of&#xD;
                  labile hypertension or poor compliance with an antihypertensive regimen).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Uncontrolled active severe systemic infection requiring parenteral antibiotics within&#xD;
             1 week, and systemic antivirals or antifungals within two weeks prior to C1D1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Patients with&#xD;
             previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically&#xD;
             stable, i.e., without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging&#xD;
             (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically&#xD;
             stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to&#xD;
             first dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with severe hypersensitivity (≥Grade 3) to pembrolizumab and/or any of its&#xD;
             excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Prior malignancies:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients with adequately resected basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin,&#xD;
                  or adequately resected carcinoma in situ (i.e. cervix, breast) may enroll&#xD;
                  irrespective of the time of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patients with a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required&#xD;
                  active treatment within the past which may interfere with the interpretation of&#xD;
                  the study. Cancer treated with curative intent &lt; 5 years previously will not be&#xD;
                  allowed unless approved by the Sponsor. Cancer treated with curative intent &gt; 5&#xD;
                  years previously and without evidence of recurrence will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients with a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or receiving chronic systemic steroid&#xD;
             therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form&#xD;
             of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients with uncontrolled vomiting or dirrahea that could interfere with the GI&#xD;
             exposure to EDP1503.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients who are transfusion dependent should be discussed with the Medical Monitor&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients unwilling to comply with the protocol including required biopsies and sample&#xD;
             collections required to measure disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years&#xD;
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned C1D1. Note: Examples of live&#xD;
             vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella,&#xD;
             varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG),&#xD;
             and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally&#xD;
             inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed. Intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g FluMist)&#xD;
             are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.&#xD;
