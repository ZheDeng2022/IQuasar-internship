  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tumor organoids and TILs (and/or peripheral T cells) cultures will be established from fresh&#xD;
      tissure of lung cancer and other solid tumors. Coculture will be utilized to screen&#xD;
      tumor-responsive T cells which are further selected for monoclonal expansion and TCR cloning&#xD;
      for engineered reconstitution of TCR-T cells. After verification by multiple in vitro and in&#xD;
      vivo studies, a large number of TCR-T cells will be introduced back into the patients via&#xD;
      vein, artery or tumor puncture, or combinations. In this phase I study, the safety, tolerance&#xD;
      and preliminary efficacy of the TCR-T cell immunotherapy on human will firstly be assessed.&#xD;

      1. Choose appropriate patients with KK-LC-1 expression in advanced lung cancer or other&#xD;
           solid tumors, with written consent for this study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Perform biopsy to obtain tissue from tumor/lymph node for organoids, TILs, DC and T&#xD;
           cells, coculture to screening anti-tumor T cells, select monoclonal T cells;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clone TCR sequence that targets KK-LC-1; collect PBMCs from the blood of the patients,&#xD;
           isolate and activate the T cells and produce the TCR-T cells;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Test the quality and killing activity of the TCR-T cells and then transplant back the&#xD;
           patients via systemic (vein and/or artery) or local injections, and follow up closely to&#xD;
           collect related clinical data as needed;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Evaluate the clinical results as needed.&#xD;
