      This study investigates whether 1) Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) application using Super&#xD;
      Floss can arrest and/or reverse initial interproximal caries on primary molars and 2) whether&#xD;
      SDF applied with Super Floss is more effective in arresting or remineralizing initial&#xD;
      interproximal lesion in comparison to SDF applied without Super Floss or fluoride varnish&#xD;
      applied alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interproximal carious lesions are challenging to control and arrest due to difficulty&#xD;
      reaching the contact area (in between teeth), limited salivary access, and poor flossing&#xD;
      compliance in children and adolescents when flossing themselves. The vast majority of caries&#xD;
      observed in children ages 5 to 10 are on interproximal surfaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) is a topical medicament touted as a very safe and noninvasive&#xD;
      alternative and/or adjunct to topical fluoride treatment or restorative treatment to halt the&#xD;
      progress (&quot;arrest&quot;) of caries. SDF has been shown to remineralize (&quot;reverse&quot;) demineralized&#xD;
      enamel or dentin, inhibit collagenases to protect dentin collagen from destruction, and have&#xD;
      bactericidal properties to cariogenic bacteria including streptococcus mutans. Normally, SDF&#xD;
      is applied with a microbrush directly on an exposed carious lesion, but due to difficulty&#xD;
      reaching interproximal carious lesions, an absorbent type of floss such as Super Floss has&#xD;
      been proposed as a delivery method for SDF application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether 1) SDF application using Super Floss can&#xD;
      arrest and/or reverse initial interproximal caries on primary molars and 2) whether SDF&#xD;
      applied with Super Floss is more effective in arresting or remineralizing initial&#xD;
      interproximal lesion in comparison to SDF applied without Super Floss or Fluoride varnish&#xD;
      applied alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population includes healthy children, aged 3-12, with initial interproximal decay&#xD;
      on deciduous molars identified by radiographs. In this study, initial decay is defined as&#xD;
      radiographic decay within enamel or extending to the dentin-enamel junction based on&#xD;
      International Caries Classification and Management System (ICCMS). Any eligible participant&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated to one of three treatments: Fluoride varnish (Control) application&#xD;
      alone versus SDF application without Super Floss (Control) versus SDF application with Super&#xD;
      Floss (Intervention), which will be applied at the initial visit. At 3, 6, and 12 months, the&#xD;
      participants will return for reapplication of their respective treatments. At the 6 month and&#xD;
      12 month mark, bitewing radiographs will be taken to determine status of the interested&#xD;
      lesion(s). If a lesion progresses beyond the outer 1/3 of dentin, then the patient will be&#xD;
      withdrawn and recommended routine restorative dental treatment. If a lesion arrests or&#xD;
      reverses, then the current treatment will continue until end of study duration (12 months)&#xD;
      and re-evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A statistician will be assisting us with descriptive statistics, cluster-adjusted chi-squared&#xD;
      test, and other statistics to determine if any correlation exists.&#xD;
