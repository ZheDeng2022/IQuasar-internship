    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to compare between recent over-the-counter toothpaste (Novamin &amp;&#xD;
      Fluoride) and regular over-the-counter toothpaste (Sodium Fluoride) in remineralization&#xD;
      potential, so as to be able to know which of the toothpastes will have a better&#xD;
      remineralization potential on demineralized enamel.&#xD;

      Statement of problem:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental caries has been recognized as a dynamic process that results from an imbalance between&#xD;
      the physiologic demineralization and remineralization of tooth structure. It has been well&#xD;
      established that tooth undergoes cyclic demineralization of enamel crystals with periods of&#xD;
      remineralization resulting from re-precipitation of calcium and phosphate ions from the&#xD;
      saliva. If the process of demineralization dominates, caries result. However, if&#xD;
      remineralization dominates along with removal of bacterial infection, enamel integrity gets&#xD;
      restored. This basic knowledge of carious process brings us to an understanding that by&#xD;
      controlling the amount, pattern and rhythm of demineralization and remineralization, carious&#xD;
      lesions can either be controlled from progressing further or can be reversed. Several decades&#xD;
      ago it was noted that clinically detectable white-spot lesions could be hardened; various&#xD;
      scientific methods have been advocated for arrest and the reversal of incipient caries lesion&#xD;
      by either decreasing the solubility of the mineral present or by increasing the mineral&#xD;
      content of the previously demineralized tooth. Since remineralization occurring naturally in&#xD;
      oral environment is often inadequate for maintaining strong decay free enamel and dentin, the&#xD;
      process needs to be augmented by using some external means. It has been proposed that a&#xD;
      simultaneous supply of calcium, phosphate and fluoride ions might serve as an invaluable tool&#xD;
      to remineralize and strengthen the tooth structure by formation of calcium fluorapatite.&#xD;
      Fluoride as a constituent of drinking water and in the form of various topically applied&#xD;
      products especially over-the-counter toothpastes have a long successful history of use as a&#xD;
      caries preventive agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NovaMin is claimed to release calcium and phosphate ions intraorally to help the self-repair&#xD;
      process of enamel. A silica-rich surface layer forms through poly-condensation of hydrated&#xD;
      silica groups on which precipitation of ions happens which crystallizes over time to form a&#xD;
      hydroxyl-carbonate apatite. Although it is used extensively as a desensitizing agent reports&#xD;
      also claim that the chemical reactions that promote apatite formation may enhance the&#xD;
      remineralization. But there is limited clinical research to ascertain if there is any&#xD;
      synergistic effect on combining anti-cariogenic activity of fluoride ions with these&#xD;
      remineralization systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct benefit of the research to the human volunteer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have better remineralization for initial white spot carious lesions using recent Novamin&#xD;
           technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gain the other advantages for Novamin technology on the gingival health as well as&#xD;
           dental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient will know the proper brushing technique as he would be given instructions about&#xD;
           this during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient will get to know the difference in efficiency of different over-the-counter&#xD;
           toothpastes especially those assigned in the investigator's study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific value and social Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether the new Novamin technology results are worth and have good efficient&#xD;
           remineralization potential or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Know more conservative mean for repair of demineralized areas in teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have proper data base about difference in over-the-counter toothpastes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will recent over-the-counter toothpaste (Novamin &amp; Fluoride) be better than regular&#xD;
      over-the-counter toothpaste (Sodium Fluoride) in remineralization of white spot lesions in&#xD;
      adult patients who are having initial white spot carious lesions?&#xD;
