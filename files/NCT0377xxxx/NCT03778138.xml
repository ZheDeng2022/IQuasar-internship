  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, with the progress in the treatment field, NSCLC has become the most&#xD;
      successful cancer species in precision medicine. Patients with positive driving genes such as&#xD;
      EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF and so on have clearly targeted drugs, which bring survival benefits to&#xD;
      patients.However, about 50% of patients still lack a clear driving gene target, which has&#xD;
      become the focus of current research.In the field of wild-type NSCLC with negative driver&#xD;
      genes, the classic first-line treatment regimen is the two-drug regimen containing&#xD;
      platinum.he phase II clinical study of pemetrexed in the second-line treatment of advanced&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer patients with pemetrexed versus carboplatin pemetrexed showed that&#xD;
      the median PFS time in the pemetrexed group was 3.5 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anlotinib is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor in domestic research and&#xD;
      development.In the phase Ⅲ study, patients who failed at least two kinds of systemic&#xD;
      chemotherapy (third line or beyond) or drug intolerance were treated with anlotinib or&#xD;
      placebo, the anlotinib group PFS and OS were 5.37 months and 9.63 months, the placebo group&#xD;
      PFS and OS were 1.4 months and 6.3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy and safety of anrotinib combined with pemetrexed in the second-line treatment of&#xD;
      advanced non-squamous and non-small cell patients deserve further exploration.&#xD;

      This is a multicentre single arm clinical trial conducted in China,the purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to evaluate and observe Anlotinib (12mg QD PO d1-14, 21 days per cycle) Combined With&#xD;
      Pemetrexed(500mg/m2,IV,d1,21 days per cycle) as the second-line Treatment in Patients With&#xD;
      Advanced nonsquamous Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.As the report,The median PFS of advanced&#xD;
      NSCLC treated by Pemetrexed as second-line was 3-3.5 months.We expect the median PFS of&#xD;
      Anlotinib combined with Pemetrexed as the second-line Treatment in Patients With Advanced&#xD;
      nonsquamous NSCLC was 6 months.Using PASS15, we calculated the sample size of this study was&#xD;
      46(α=0.025、β=0.1), according to 10% censoring,the expected sample size is 51.&#xD;
