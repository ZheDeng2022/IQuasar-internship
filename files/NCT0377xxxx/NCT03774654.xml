  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients who have lymphoma or leukemia that has come back or has not gone&#xD;
      away after treatment. Because there is no standard treatment for this cancer, patients are&#xD;
      being asked to volunteer for a gene transfer research study using special immune cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect&#xD;
      for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease,&#xD;
      antibodies and immune cells. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from&#xD;
      bacteria and other diseases. Immune cells, also called lymphocytes, are special&#xD;
      infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells including tumor cells. Both&#xD;
      antibodies and lymphocytes have been used to treat patients with cancer. They have shown&#xD;
      promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antibody used in this study is called anti-CD19. This antibody sticks to lymphoma cells&#xD;
      because of a substance on the outside of the cells called CD19. CD19 antibodies have been&#xD;
      used to treat people with lymphoma and leukemia. For this study, the anti-CD19 antibody has&#xD;
      been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood it is now joined to the NKT cells,&#xD;
      a special type of lymphocytes that can kill tumor cells but not very effectively on their&#xD;
      own. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor.&#xD;
      Investigators have also found that NKT cells work better if proteins are added that stimulate&#xD;
      lymphocytes, such as one called CD28. Adding the CD28 makes the cells last for a longer time&#xD;
      in the body but maybe not long enough for them to be able to kill the lymphoma cells. It is&#xD;
      believed that by adding an extra stimulating protein, called IL-15, the cells will have an&#xD;
      even better chance of killing the lymphoma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators are going to see if this is true by putting the anti-CD19&#xD;
      chimeric receptor with CD28 and the IL-15 into NKT cells grown from a healthy individual.&#xD;
      These cells are called ANCHOR cells. These cells will be infused into patients that have&#xD;
      lymphomas or leukemias that have CD19 on their surface. The ANCHOR cells are investigational&#xD;
      products not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find the biggest dose of ANCHOR cells that is safe, to see&#xD;
      how long the ANCHOR cells last, to learn what their side effects are and to see whether this&#xD;
      therapy might help people with lymphoma or leukemia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Earlier, a healthy donor provided blood to make ANCHOR cells in the laboratory. These cells&#xD;
      were grown and frozen for later use. To make the ANCHOR cells, the investigators took the&#xD;
      donor blood and stimulated it with growth factors to make the NKT cells grow. To get the CD19&#xD;
      antibody, CD28 and IL-15 into the NKT cells, they were infected with a virus, called a&#xD;
      retrovirus. This virus cannot grow and infect other cells, but delivered a new genetic&#xD;
      message into the ANCHOR cells that provides the instructions for the cells to make the CD19&#xD;
      antibody, CD28 and IL-15. This new genetic message will also help the investigators to find&#xD;
      the ANCHOR cells in the blood after they are injected. Because patients will have received&#xD;
      cells with a new gene in them, patients will be followed for a total of 15 years to see if&#xD;
      there are any long term side effects of gene transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assigned a dose of ANCHOR cells. This is a dose escalation study. This means&#xD;
      that at the beginning, patients will be started on the lowest dose of ANCHOR cells. Once that&#xD;
      dose schedule proves safe, the next group of patients will be started at a higher dose. This&#xD;
      process will continue until all 3 dose levels are studied. If the side effects are too&#xD;
      severe, the dose will be lowered or the infusions will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients will receive treatment with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. These&#xD;
      drugs will decrease the numbers of the patients own immune cells before the ANCHOR cells are&#xD;
      infused.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be given an injection of ANCHOR cells into the vein through an IV at the&#xD;
      assigned dose. Before receiving the injection, the patient may be given a dose of Benadryl&#xD;
      and Tylenol. The injection will take about 20 minutes. The patient will then be monitored in&#xD;
      the clinic for up to 2 hours. Certain patients with aggressive lymphomas will need to be&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital for the first three days after receiving the cells. Patients will&#xD;
      need to stay in Houston for 4 weeks after the ANCHOR cell infusion to monitor them for side&#xD;
      effects. Patients will have follow-up visits daily on days 1-10, then weekly at weeks 2, 3,&#xD;
      4, and 6; monthly at months 3, 6, 9, and 12; twice a year for 4 years and then once a year&#xD;
      for the next 10 years - for a total of 15 years). Patients will also have scheduled disease&#xD;
      evaluations after the ANCHOR cell infusion (at week 4 and then as clinically needed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy in Texas Chidren's&#xD;
      Hospital or Houston Methodist Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical tests before treatment--&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before being treated, the patient will receive a series of standard medical tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam and History&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of tumor by scans and/or bone marrow studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A urine or serum pregnancy test, when applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical tests during and after treatment--&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive standard medical tests when getting the infusions and afterwards. The&#xD;
      evaluations that will be done at these visits include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exams and History&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of the tumor by scans and/or bone marrow studies 4 weeks after the infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To learn more about the way the ANCHOR cells are working and how long they last in the&#xD;
           body, extra blood will be drawn. On the day patients receive the cells, blood will be&#xD;
           taken before the cells are given and a few hours afterwards. Other blood will be drawn&#xD;
           one week after the infusion, 2 weeks, 3 weeks (optional), 4 weeks, and 6 weeks after the&#xD;
           infusion, at 3 months, at 6 months, at 9 months, at 1 year, twice a year for 4 years,&#xD;
           then yearly for the next 10 years - for a total of 15 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the time points listed above, if the ANCHOR cells are found in the patient's blood&#xD;
      above a certain amount, an extra 5 mL of blood may need to be collected for additional&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient has a biopsy of a lymph node, like a repeat tumor or bone marrow study, the&#xD;
      investigators may ask to have a piece for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive supportive care for any acute or chronic toxicities, including blood&#xD;
      components or antibiotics, and other intervention as appropriate.&#xD;
