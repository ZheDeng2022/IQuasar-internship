    <textblock>
      This research study is being offered to those patients who have received radiation therapy&#xD;
      and who are receiving long-term hormonal therapy for their prostate cancer and whose PSA&#xD;
      remains detectable despite having received at least 6, but no more than 12 months of hormonal&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The name of the study drugs involved in this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LHRHA (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist or antagonist)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abiraterone Acetate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Apalutamide&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prednisone&#xD;

      This research study is a Phase III clinical trial. Phase III clinical trials test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in&#xD;
      treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that an intervention is being studied.&#xD;
      In this study, the investigational agents are apalutamide and abiraterone acetate.&#xD;
      Abiraterone acetate (used in combination with prednisone) is an FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration) approved drug for prostate cancer, but is approved in patients that have&#xD;
      prostate cancer spread to other parts of their body and have been previously treated with&#xD;
      ADT. Apalutamide has also been approved by the FDA for men whose cancer does not respond to&#xD;
      hormone therapy but it is still investigational for this type of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are looking at two methods of androgen deprivation&#xD;
      therapy (ADT), also known as hormonal therapy, to determine which method is better for&#xD;
      improving long term cure rates. ADT blocks the function of hormones, including testosterone&#xD;
      which prostate cancer uses to grow and spread. The first method of ADT includes prednisone,&#xD;
      apalutamide, and abiraterone acetate plus standard ADT and the second method of ADT is&#xD;
      standard ADT alone for men with this type of prostate cancer. Currently, the best standard&#xD;
      treatment for men with this type of prostate cancer includes standard ADT. All participants&#xD;
      in this study will receive the main standard form of ADT called a luteinizing&#xD;
      hormone-releasing hormone agonist or antagonist (LHRHA).&#xD;
