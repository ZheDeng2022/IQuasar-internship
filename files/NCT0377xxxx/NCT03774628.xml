  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A rabies vaccine (human diploid cell) for human use, Freeze-dried produced by Chengdu Kanghua&#xD;
      Biological Products Co.,Ltd is used to prevent human rabies. The vaccine was completed in the&#xD;
      Phase III clinical trial from August 2008 to February 2009 in Lianshui County, Jiangsu&#xD;
      Province (Approval of Drug Clinical Trial No. 2008L03156). A total of 1200 subjects aged&#xD;
      10-60 years were randomly assigned trial group (Kanghua vaccine group, 600 participants) and&#xD;
      control groups (Pasteur vaccine group, 600 participants). The result showed that this vaccine&#xD;
      could provide good immunogenicity and mild adverse reactions. On April 28, 2012, the drug&#xD;
      registration approval was obtained (Approval No. 2012S00222).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To disclose the effects of booster immunization of human diploid cell rabies vaccine (HDCV)&#xD;
      after eight years of primary vaccination. Sixty subjects who had participated the phase Ⅲ&#xD;
      clinical trial of freeze-dried HDCV were selected and given booster immunization after eight&#xD;
      years of primary vaccination. The result showed that the freeze-dried HDCV has good immune&#xD;
      effects with one-dose of booster immunization after eight years of primary vaccination． In&#xD;
      order to find a ten years of immunization persistence and booster dose immune effect, the&#xD;
      investigators decided to perform this immunization persistence and booster immunity trial&#xD;
      among these subjects who had received five doses of rabies vaccine vaccines (around ten years&#xD;
      after the fundamental immunity). The investigators do the recruitment among these subjects&#xD;
      who had participated in the previous phase Ⅲ trail and the subjects were divided into two&#xD;
      layers, such as trial group (Kanghua vaccine group) and the control group (Paste vaccine&#xD;
      group). Each layer of the subjects randomly received one booster dose (Day 0) and two booster&#xD;
      doses (Day 0, 3) the freeze-dried HDCV in a ratio of 1:1.&#xD;
