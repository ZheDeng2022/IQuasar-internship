    <textblock>
      A randomised controlled clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of two functional&#xD;
      appliances in the correction of a Class II malocclusion. (Class II malocclusions are where&#xD;
      upper front teeth bite significantly further forward in relation to lower front teeth).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no significant difference between the Button &amp; bead and Twin-block appliances with&#xD;
      regard to time taken to reduce the overjet&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A functional appliance is a type of brace used to help correct a 'Class II' malocclusion.&#xD;
      Class II malocclusions are where upper front teeth bite significantly further forward in&#xD;
      relation to lower front teeth. A functional appliance is defined as a brace that engages&#xD;
      upper and lower teeth and works mainly by posturing the lower jaw away from its normal&#xD;
      position1. The functional appliance may either be removable or fixed in nature and of various&#xD;
      designs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correction of a class II malocclusion can be commenced early i.e. before the age of 10 or&#xD;
      during early adolescence when the patient is in a late mixed dentition / early permanent&#xD;
      dentition. If correction is commenced early, this results in the need for a two phase&#xD;
      treatment which involves functional appliance treatment in the first phase (age 7-10)&#xD;
      followed by fixed appliances (+/- functional appliances) as an adolescent (age 11-16). If&#xD;
      correction is started in early adolescence only one phase of treatment is required which&#xD;
      involves a combination of functional and fixed appliances (age 11-16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early or delayed class II treatment has been studied by various researchers2-10. O'Brien et&#xD;
      al7 concluded that there was no advantage of early treatment with Twin Block as compared to&#xD;
      treatment started in adolescents. In fact, they reported significantly poorer occlusal&#xD;
      outcomes as determined by the objective Peer Assessment Rating (PAR) index in those that had&#xD;
      early treatment. In addition, they found that total duration of treatment, total attendances&#xD;
      and total cost of treatment was significantly higher in the early treatment group. The&#xD;
      average total duration of treatment for those that had early treatment was 968 days (phase 1&#xD;
      = 527 days and phase 2 = 435 days) compared to 744 days for those that had treatment as an&#xD;
      adolescent only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most commonly used brace to correct class II malocclusions in the UK is a functional&#xD;
      appliance (Twin Block design) 11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Button and Bead functional appliance has been developed and used successfully by Mr Spary&#xD;
      (Consultant Orthodontist) for several years. However, there are no studies to date that have&#xD;
      studied its effectiveness in correcting a class II problem. The Button and bead appliance&#xD;
      appears to be quicker at reducing the overjet and preferred by patients as there is less&#xD;
      mouth opening making the appliance more comfortable to wear. It is also two clear aligners,&#xD;
      which are more aesthetic than the traditional twin block appliance. The button and bead&#xD;
      appliance does not however allow arch expansion. This may necessitate another appliance prior&#xD;
      to fixed appliance treatment or prolong fixed appliance treatment if expansion also needs to&#xD;
      be carried out in that phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. To compare the Button-&amp;-bead and Twin-block appliances treatment duration for overjet&#xD;
           reduction&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To compare the Button-&amp;-bead and Twin-block appliances dento-occlusal outcomes as&#xD;
                measured by the Peer Assessment Rating (PAR)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. To compare patient compliance with the Button-&amp;-bead and Twin-block appliances and&#xD;
                identify causes for failure&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. To compare the health economics of the Button-&amp;-bead and Twin-block appliances&#xD;
                (Cost of appliances, number of visits, number and cost of repairs and/or&#xD;
                replacements)&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. To compare the skeletal changes of the Button-&amp;-bead and Twin-block appliances&#xD;
                based on the Eastman analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. To compare changes in soft tissue profile as assessed by 3D photographs&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. To assess changes in OHRQoL after overjet reduction with the Button-&amp;-bead and&#xD;
                Twin-block appliances&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. To evaluate and compare patient satisfaction with the Button-&amp;-bead and Twin-block&#xD;
                appliances&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Safety objective&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To evaluate the safety of the Button-&amp;-Bead appliance relative to the Twin-Block&#xD;
                appliance in terms of the occurrence of any device-related adverse- and&#xD;
                side-effects (soft-tissue trauma, decalcification, dental caries, ingestion or&#xD;
                aspiration of appliance).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  * Overjet ≥ 7mm&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The normal overjet for a Caucasian population is in the range of 2-4mm. A&#xD;
                  functional appliance is used to allow for overjet reduction without extractions&#xD;
                  and/or to reduce the anchorage demands of the subsequent treatment with the&#xD;
                  Straight Wire Appliance (SWA). Clinically the overjet would need to be&#xD;
                  significantly increased for the treating clinician to consider the use of a&#xD;
                  functional appliance. Other similar studies have used an overjet of &gt;6mm or ≥&#xD;
                  7mm. This study has elected for an initial overjet of ≥ 7mm to improve the&#xD;
                  studies external validity by making it more applicable to day-to-day clinical&#xD;
                  practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The initial overjet will be used to select patients. The majority of recent high&#xD;
                  level trials and systematic reviews that have provided a significant amount of&#xD;
                  the evidence base in the treatment of Class II malocclusions have defined&#xD;
                  subjects according to their initial overjet.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  * Age 10 to 14 years&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  This has been selected to match other studies relating to functional appliance&#xD;
                  treatment and reflect the most common clinical practice. The literature on&#xD;
                  functional appliance treatment has provided evidence that on average the&#xD;
                  enhancement of growth is small. Some studies on the timing of functional&#xD;
                  appliance treatment have suggested that pubertal growth is not a significant&#xD;
                  factor in the success of functional appliance treatment but it is well know and&#xD;
                  accepted that functional appliance treatment is assisted during periods of more&#xD;
                  rapid growth. Numerous studies have also found better co-operation and completion&#xD;
                  of treatment in younger patients (Banks 2004, KOB 2003a &amp; 2003b)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  * Satisfactory Dental health&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must be dentally healthy and have a suitable level of oral health that&#xD;
                  would support orthodontic treatment, as per the British Orthodontic Society&#xD;
                  guidelines. They must have good oral hygiene with minimal gingivitis or&#xD;
                  periodontal disease, no dental caries or periapical pathology and no history of&#xD;
                  dento-alveolar trauma. This is judged by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Willing to participate in study and provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  * No previous orthodontic treatment or premolar extractions&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  This is aimed at reducing any confounding factors within the study as these may&#xD;
                  affect the success of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  * No craniofacial syndrome (including Cleft patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  This is aimed at reducing any confounding factors within the study as these&#xD;
                  conditions may affect the success of treatment. The treatment of this subgroup&#xD;
                  requires a multi-disciplinary team and is more complex. Their treatment pathway&#xD;
                  may vary from normal clinical practice.&#xD;
