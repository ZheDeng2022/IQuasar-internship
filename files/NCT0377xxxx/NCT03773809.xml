      Title:Impact of vitamin D administration on cardiac autonomic tone in Asthma Chronic&#xD;
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Overlap patients: A blinded randomized control trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Respiratory disease is closely associated with cardiovascular disease. Reduced&#xD;
      Heart Rate Variability (HRV), reflecting impaired autonomic activity have been reported in&#xD;
      both asthma and COPD. Vitamin D deficiency is a common feature in Asthma COPD Overlap (ACO)&#xD;
      patient. Relationship between vitamin D deficiency and low HRV has been reported. Vitamin D&#xD;
      administration has been reported to improve cardiac autonomic modulation in healthy subjects&#xD;
      in response to external stressor. Objective: To assess the changes in cardiac autonomic tone&#xD;
      after vitamin D administration for 90 days in vitamin D deficient ACO patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:Null: Vitamin D administration does not have impact on cardiac autonomic tone in&#xD;
      vitamin D3 deficient ACO patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      .Method: This randomized controlled trial will be conducted by Department of Physiology,&#xD;
      Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Shahbag, Dhaka from September' 2017 to&#xD;
      August' 2018. For this study, a total number of 60 subjects (age &gt; 40 years, both male and&#xD;
      female) will be randomly selected. 30 diagnosed vitamin D deficient Asthma COPD Overlap (ACO)&#xD;
      patients will form group A and another 30 diagnosed vitamin D3 deficient ACO patients with&#xD;
      similar age, sex, (Body Mass Index) BMI will constitute control group B. Patients of study&#xD;
      group B0 will take vitamin D3 with a prescribed schedule for 3 months and followed up after 3&#xD;
      months (group B90). On the other hand patients of group A1 will be given placebo and followed&#xD;
      up after 3 months (group A90). All these patients will continue their medication prescribed&#xD;
      by physician during these 3 months. On the basis of data recording - group B1 and group B90&#xD;
      will constitute pre and post vitamin D group whereas group A0 and group A90 will represent&#xD;
      pre and post placebo follow up at day 0 and day 90. Cardiac autonomic nerve function will be&#xD;
      assessed by recording ECG &amp; Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis by a data acquisition&#xD;
      device, powerlab 8/35, AD instruments, Australia. HRV measures of all patients will be&#xD;
      recorded at baseline.Then after 3 months of follow up it will be recorded in both groups at&#xD;
      day 90. Serum 25(OH)D level will be measured of all subject at day 0 and day 90. For&#xD;
      statistical analysis unpaired and paired &quot;t&quot; test will be done by using Microsoft Office&#xD;
      Excel Word version 2016&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies reported earlier age of onset, symptom with longer duration, more&#xD;
      exacerbation and devoid of adequate health care in Asthma Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary&#xD;
      Disease (COPD) Overlap (ACO) patients compared to asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary&#xD;
      Disease (COPD) alone. However their prevalence rate was reported between 15 and 55%.&#xD;
      Existence of asthma and COPD has been reported in between 15-20% of patient. There is no&#xD;
      population based data on ACO patients in Bangladesh. But one study very recently reported&#xD;
      11.6% of Asthma COPD Overlap (ACO) patients in this country. Thus it is of utmost importance&#xD;
      to perform more research on this significant disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies investigated autonomic function in asthma and COPD patients. Both asthma and&#xD;
      COPD affect cardiac autonomic function. Poor asthma control is associated with lower HRV,&#xD;
      depressed sympathetic and enhanced parasympathetic modulation. It has reported that the risk&#xD;
      of cardiovascular disease in COPD is increase by 2 to 3 fold and it is the leading cause of&#xD;
      death in mild to moderate COPD. But to the best of our knowledge no study investigated the&#xD;
      cardiac autonomic function of ACO patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D deficiency is a common feature in ACO patient. Previous studies demonstrated the&#xD;
      relationship between vitamin D deficiency and reduced HRV resulting in incidence of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. Only one study reported the effect of vitamin D administration on&#xD;
      HRV. They enrolled young healthy subjects and observed the effect of vitamin D on HRV in&#xD;
      response to physiological stressor such as angiotensin II induced stress. All these subjects&#xD;
      were vitamin D insufficient and their result showed improvement of sympathovagal balance&#xD;
      after administration of vitamin D. With this experimental observation we can expect,&#xD;
      administration of vitamin D in vitamin deficient ACO patients might improve cardiac autonomic&#xD;
      function and thereby protect them from the risk cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However vitamin D appears to be a simple, cost effective treatment to reduce cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease associated risk by improving function of autonomic nerve function in both healthy and&#xD;
      chronic disease population worldwide. But the volume of information regarding the effect of&#xD;
      vitamin D administration in ACO patients is not enough for reaching any final conclusion.&#xD;
      Moreover, with the best of our knowledge no study have been conducted to observe the effects&#xD;
      of this fat soluble vitamin on HRV in vitamin D deficient, stable patients with ACO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, on the basis of this background the present study has been designed to evaluate&#xD;
      the effects of Vitamin D on heart rate variability in D deficient, stable patients with ACO.&#xD;
      This study will draw attention of the physicians on the cardiac autonomic status of ACO&#xD;
      patients and the effects of Vitamin D on it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the impact of vitamin D therapy on cardiac autonomic tone in vitamin D&#xD;
      deficient ACO patients by heart rate variability analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure HRV by time domain and frequency domain and nonlinear methods in vitamin D&#xD;
           deficient ACO patient at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure all these above parameters after 3 months of vitamin D and placebo&#xD;
           administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To Compare pre and post intervention HRV parameters in both vitamin D group and placebo&#xD;
           group of ACO patients.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        4. Ethical Clearance:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The protocol of this study involving the human subjects will be submitted to&#xD;
           Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU)&#xD;
           for ethical and other technical approval before commencing the actual study.this project&#xD;
           is a part of an ongoing research which was approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB)&#xD;
           of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total 60 subjects will be recruited in this study, which is designed for randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial on the basis of outcome measures (effect size) i.e. estimation of mean&#xD;
      differences between pre &amp; post intervention mean of the study which has already been&#xD;
      published in a cross sectional study that assess the association of vitamin D deficiency with&#xD;
      cardiac autonomic activity. Sample size based on effect size .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simple random sampling will be adopted to select the patients. According to the selection&#xD;
      criteria total 60 subjects of both male and female with specific age range suitable for the&#xD;
      aim and objective of the study will be enrolled. These diagnosed ACO patients (diagnosed by&#xD;
      applying the &quot;tick box&quot; approach recommended by the joint committee of GOLD &amp; GINA from Out&#xD;
      Patient Department (OPD) of NIDCH) will be selected by clinicians in OPD of National&#xD;
      Institute of the Disease of Chest and Hospital (NIDCH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grouping of the subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a careful brief interview, selection and enrollment of the subjects for this study will&#xD;
      be done. All the subjects will be divided into following groups according to the objectives&#xD;
      of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This group will include 60 vitamin D deficient ACO patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      25 diagnosed vitamin D deficient ACO patients will be included in this group and they will be&#xD;
      given vitamin D. This group will be further divided into the following group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A0: Vitamin D deficient ACO patients with placebo at day 0. Group A90: Vitamin D&#xD;
      deficient ACO patients with placebo at day 90&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      25 diagnosed vitamin D deficient ACO patients will be included in this group and they will be&#xD;
      given placebo. This group will be further divided into the following group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B0: Vitamin D deficient ACO patients with vitamin D at day 0. Group B90: Vitamin D&#xD;
      deficient ACO patients with vitamin D at day 90.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients will be similar by age, sex and BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Study intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be given by oral administration of vitamin D3 capsule each of which&#xD;
      contain 40000 International Unit (IU) of vitamin D. The capsule will be manufactured and&#xD;
      supplied by Beximco Pharmaceutical Limited, Bangladesh. The placebo will also be manufactured&#xD;
      and supplied by the same pharmaceutical company and will be similar in size shape &amp;&#xD;
      appearance to vitamin D capsule but it will contain sucrose powder. All patients will be&#xD;
      advised to take 2 capsule after breakfast on a fixed day of the week for 3 consecutive&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of enrollment all patients will be randomized to one of the two interventions&#xD;
      (placebo or vitamin D) immediately. The intervention will be double blind randomized and&#xD;
      cross over design so that each patient will act as his/her control. Each participant of the&#xD;
      placebo group &amp; vitamin D3 group will be studied before &amp; after intervention and comparison&#xD;
      will be done between these two groups. In addition comparison will be done post intervention&#xD;
      data of placebo &amp; vitamin D group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. Study procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the first day of enrollment the researcher will introduce herself to the patient and ask&#xD;
      for permission to talk to them. Then she will cordially explain about the objectives,&#xD;
      purpose, and procedure of the study on the day of enrollment. The benefit as well as risk (if&#xD;
      any) of the study should be carefully mentioned. Special emphasis will be given on explaining&#xD;
      how he/she will be benefited from this study. The patient will be motivated for voluntary&#xD;
      participation and will be allowed to withdraw him or herself from the study even after&#xD;
      participation, whenever the patient feels uneasy. If he or she agrees to be a part of the&#xD;
      study, an informed written consent will be taken in a prescribed form. Detailed family&#xD;
      history, medical history and thorough physical examination of each patient will be done and&#xD;
      all the information will be recorded in a standard data sheet. Then all the patients will be&#xD;
      requested to attend the Department of Physiology at 8:30 am on the day of biochemical&#xD;
      examination On the examination day, 5 ml of venous blood will be collected and taken to the&#xD;
      biochemistry laboratory as soon as possible for the estimation of serum 25(OH)D. BMI will&#xD;
      also be calculated by recording height weight. After getting the biochemical report, the&#xD;
      final selection will be done, according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and blinding: As it is not possible to exclude ACO patient with hypertension&#xD;
      and/or diabetes , we will apply stratified randomization technique according to these two&#xD;
      confounding factors. Four strata will be formed, as hypertension, diabetes, diabetes with&#xD;
      hypertension and without hypertension and diabetes. Whenever a patient will be selected for&#xD;
      enrollment, he will be given an Identification Number (ID) and assigned to one of the four&#xD;
      strata according to his characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization and blinding design was developed by a faculty of the Department of&#xD;
      Physiology who is not included in the study team. The ID number and stratification will&#xD;
      informed to the faculty. She (the faculty) will then then randomly allocate the patient in&#xD;
      either group A (placebo) or group B (vitamin D) considering his strata so that both the group&#xD;
      had equal number of patients from each strata. The faculty will then note down the patient ID&#xD;
      in the allotted group and supplied principal investigator (PI) the drug (placebo or vitamin&#xD;
      D) according to the allotted group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, the faculty will provide the list of the patient's ID with allotted&#xD;
      group to the PI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: All the selected patients will be then requested to come to the Department&#xD;
      again on the next day for the HRV test with proper preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation for HRV test: Preparation for the test will be explained to them. For HRV&#xD;
      examination, the subject will have to take their meal by 9:00 pm and need to have a sound&#xD;
      sleep in the previous night. From previous night up to the time of examination, they will be&#xD;
      requested not to undergo any physical or mental stress and also avoid taking any sedatives or&#xD;
      any other drugs that affect central nervous system (Task force, 1996).The patients will be&#xD;
      requested to take light breakfast in the morning without tea or coffee. After that, the&#xD;
      selected subjects will be kept in complete bed rest in supine position for 10-15 minutes in&#xD;
      the cool and calm laboratory environment to adjust with the lab conditions. During this&#xD;
      period, the subject will be advised not to talk, eat or drink and also not to perform&#xD;
      physical or mental activity even sleep .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory conditions and recording of HRV: The recording of HRV measures will be done by 8&#xD;
      active channels, power lab 8/35 (AD instrument, Australia), in the Autonomic Nerve Function&#xD;
      Laboratory of Department of Physiology, BSMMU. The temperature of the laboratory will be&#xD;
      maintained at 25°C-28°C and lights will be kept dim. It will also be maintained noise free.&#xD;
      Door of the lab will be closed and no one will be allowed to enter the room during the test&#xD;
      except the investigator and the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the HRV recording will be completed, the patients will be provided the drug (containing&#xD;
      placebo or vitamin D3 ) and will be asked to take 2 capsule per week for consecutive 90 days.&#xD;
      The schedule of the therapy will be explained meticulously in detail to the patients. He/she&#xD;
      will also be informed about the possible side effect of the drug (e.g. diarrhea). If the&#xD;
      subject is able to understand everything explained to him, then he/she will be advised to&#xD;
      continue the drug therapy for the consecutive 90 days. If the subject finds it difficult to&#xD;
      understand the intervention or if any side effect of the drug appears, he/she will be asked&#xD;
      to come to the department or to contact via telephone. During this period, the subjects will&#xD;
      be regularly monitored and encouraged to be the part of this study by maintaining regular&#xD;
      communication through telephonic calls several times a week. A good rapport will be built up&#xD;
      to take time to time follow-up over telephone and visiting patient's place. In addition,&#xD;
      scheduled appointment, hot-line and follow up will be maintained properly. If the subject&#xD;
      finds it difficult to understand the intervention or if any side effect of the drug appears,&#xD;
      he/she will be asked to come to the department or to contact via telephone. All the selected&#xD;
      ACO patients will be allowed to continue standard therapeutic treatment as prescribed by the&#xD;
      physician for these three months. Along with this, all the subjects of both the groups will&#xD;
      be advised to continue a diet according to their own choice. Subsequently, all subjects will&#xD;
      be requested to attend the Department of Physiology, BSMMU again on the 90th day for&#xD;
      assessment of all the above-mentioned study variables. Any subject who fails to follow the&#xD;
      study procedure exactly during the study period will be dropped and a new one will be&#xD;
      included to fulfill the desired total sample size. At the end of the study i.e. after 90 day&#xD;
      vitamin D3 will be given to all the patients of placebo group.&#xD;
