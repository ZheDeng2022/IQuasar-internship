  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Agonistic activation of fat metabolite responsive G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) has been&#xD;
      linked to improved glucose metabolism through increased glucose-stimulated-insulin-secreting&#xD;
      (GSIS) and incretin release, improved insulin sensitivity and reduced low grade inflammation.&#xD;
      In vitro studies have demonstrated that pinolenic acid (20% of pine nut oil) is a potent dual&#xD;
      agonist of two GPCRs: free fatty acid receptor-1 (FFA1, formerly GPR40) and free fatty acid&#xD;
      receptor-4 (FFA4, formerly GPR120). Moreover, pinolenic acid was able to improve glucose&#xD;
      tolerance in mice. G-protein-coupled receptor-119 (GPR119) is known to be activated by the&#xD;
      monoacylglycerol: 2-oleoylglycerol (2OG), which is a glycerol molecule attached to oleic acid&#xD;
      in the second position. Olive oil contains 61-80% oleic acid, and under digestion 2OG is&#xD;
      produced. 2OG has been shown to stimulate GLP-1 release in humans and interestingly, it has&#xD;
      recently been suggest that simultaneous activation of GPR119 and FFA1 acts in synergy and&#xD;
      enhances enteroendocrine GLP-1 secretion more than the summarized individual agonistic&#xD;
      activation. However, this remains to be evaluated in humans. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that a combination of pinolenic acid and 2OG administered in delayed release capsules will&#xD;
      act in synergy and enhance 1) GLP-1 secretion by stimulating FFA1/FFA4 and GPR119 on&#xD;
      enteroendocrine cells causing improved GSIS and increased satiety and 2) enhance GSIS by&#xD;
      directly stimulating FFA1 and GPR119 on beta-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aim: To investigate the acute effects of pinolenic acid combined with 2OG (olive oil)&#xD;
      versus pinolenic acid alone on changes in glucose tolerance, insulin, GLP-1, GIP and ghrelin&#xD;
      secretion, appetite and gastrointestinal tolerability in overweight and obese healthy humans.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the last decade, several G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) that respond to dietary&#xD;
      lipid metabolites including free fatty acids (FFAs) have been discovered. These receptors&#xD;
      have been implicated in metabolic processes and inflammation. Consequently, several of the&#xD;
      receptors have attracted interest as potential targets for the treatment of metabolic and&#xD;
      inflammatory diseases, including obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Free fatty acid receptor 1 (FFA1 or GPR40) is activated by long-chain FFAs and is highly&#xD;
      expressed in pancreatic β-cells, where it increases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion&#xD;
      (GSIS). FFA1 is also expressed on intestinal enteroendocrine cells, where it promotes&#xD;
      secretion of incretin hormones such as glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent&#xD;
      insulinotropic peptide (GIP). GLP-1 is highly interesting for treatment of obesity and T2D&#xD;
      because of its ability to increase GSIS, enhance β-cell growth, increase insulin sensitivity,&#xD;
      reduce gastric motility, increase satiety and reduce body weight. The published phase II&#xD;
      clinical trial with the selective FFA1 agonist TAK-875 demonstrated high efficacy in reducing&#xD;
      plasma glucose without increased incidence of hypoglycemia, and has caused considerable&#xD;
      interest in the receptor as a new target for treatment of type 2 diabetes. Free fatty acid&#xD;
      receptor 4 (FFA4 or GPR120) is activated by unsaturated long-chain FFAs and is expressed in&#xD;
      the gastrointestinal system and adipose tissue. It is reported to promote GLP-1 secretion&#xD;
      from intestinal cells, to counteract inflammation and to increase insulin sensitivity in&#xD;
      adipose tissue. Notably, dysfunctional FFA4 was recently connected to the development of&#xD;
      obesity in both mice and humans. This has considerably increased the interest on the receptor&#xD;
      as a target for obesity and metabolic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another GPCR receptor: G-protein-coupled receptor-119 (GPR119), which reacts to different&#xD;
      degradation products of triacylglycerol including monoacylglycerols, has similar functions as&#xD;
      FFA1 and FFA4. It is also expressed in enteroendocrine cells in the gastrointestinal tract&#xD;
      and on pancreatic β-cells, where it stimulates GLP-1 secretion and GSIS, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, these receptors are expressed in different tissues in the body where they&#xD;
      potentially can affect metabolic and inflammatory conditions such as type 2 diabetes and&#xD;
      obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to this study, an in in vitro screening of 36 relevant FFAs and their ability to act as&#xD;
      FFA1 and FFA4 agonists was carried out to identify the most potent naturally occurring dual&#xD;
      FFA1/FFA4 agonist for clinical studies. Of these, the polyunsaturated fatty acid, pinolenic&#xD;
      acid showed the highest efficacy and a good potency on both receptors, and was therefore&#xD;
      selected for further studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further support this choice, the effect of pinolenic acid was tested using a small dose&#xD;
      (100 mg/kg) given 30 min prior to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in mice.&#xD;
      Convincingly, purified pinolenic acid significantly improved glucose tolerance by reducing&#xD;
      OGTT glucose levels when compared to control (corn oil). The efficacy was similar to that&#xD;
      obtained with a pharmaceutical selective FFA1 agonist (TUG-905). Pinolenic acid is a fatty&#xD;
      acid contained in Siberian Pine nuts, Korean Pine nuts and the seeds of other pines. The&#xD;
      highest percentage of pinolenic acid (~20%) is found in Siberian Pine nuts and the oil&#xD;
      produced from them. Korean Pine nut oil given as hydrolyzed FFAs, but not as triglycerides,&#xD;
      has been reported to increase secretion of GLP-1 and decrease appetite in overweight females.&#xD;
      This supports the indication that purified pinolenic acid may be superior in improving&#xD;
      glucose metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GPR119 is activated by different endogen ligands, one of them being the monoacylglycerol&#xD;
      2-oleoylglycerol (2OG), which is a glycerol molecule attached to oleic acid in the second&#xD;
      position. Olive oil contains 61-80% oleic acid, and under digestion of 5 ml olive oil,&#xD;
      approximately 2g 2OG is produced. 2OG has been shown to stimulate GLP-1 release in humans and&#xD;
      interestingly, it has recently been suggest that simultaneous activation of GPR119 and FFA1&#xD;
      acts in synergy and enhances enteroendocrine GLP-1 secretion more than the summarized&#xD;
      individual agonistic activation. However, this remains to be evaluated in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery, used to treat severe obesity, frequently results in&#xD;
      immediate beneficial effects on glucose metabolism in type 2 diabetes, often with complete&#xD;
      remission. These effects are in part independent of weight loss, but may be explained by a&#xD;
      significant increase in GLP-1 levels immediately after surgery. Thus, it appears that the&#xD;
      effect depends on the delivery of nutrients to the lower parts of the intestine. Fat&#xD;
      metabolites are normally rapidly absorbed in the upper parts of the gastrointestinal tract.&#xD;
      It is therefore possible that the RYGB effects are partly due to enteroendocrine stimulation&#xD;
      of FFA1, GPR119 and perhaps FFA4 by direct nutrient delivery, that is, delivery of fat&#xD;
      metabolites to the lower intestines. A hypothesis to be investigated in this study is that&#xD;
      the delivery of pinolenic acid and 2OG to the lower intestines can mimic the beneficial&#xD;
      effects observed after RYGB with less expense and fewer adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivery of nutrients beyond the proximal small intestine can be achieved by the use of&#xD;
      delayed release capsules. The potential positive effect of this principle was recently&#xD;
      reported in a small cohort of patients with T2D. Where, delivery of small amounts of lauric&#xD;
      acid (a C12 fatty acid) to the distal gut using enteric-coated pellets stimulated GLP-1&#xD;
      secretion and lowered postprandial glucose levels in response to meals. No chronic effects&#xD;
      where tested in this study. Although not suggested by the authors, the increased release of&#xD;
      GLP-1 could involve direct stimulation of FFA1 and/or FFA4 by lauric acid in the distal gut.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: As described, the expression of FFA1, FFA4 and GPR119 on intestinal&#xD;
      enteroendocrine cells and pancreatic beta-cells has been linked to 1) increased secretion of&#xD;
      GLP-1 and GIP hence the incretin-mediated increase in GSIS and 2) a direct positive effect on&#xD;
      GSIS. The investigators hypothesize that a combination of pinolenic acid and 2OG administered&#xD;
      in delayed release capsules will act in synergy and 1) enhance GLP-1 secretion by stimulating&#xD;
      FFA1/FFA4 and GPR119 on enteroendocrine cells causing improved GSIS, 2) enhance GSIS by&#xD;
      directly stimulating FFA1 and GPR119 on beta-cells and 3) increase satiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the hypotheses, the aim of this project is to investigate the acute effect of&#xD;
      pinolenic acid (hydrolyzed pine nut oil) combined with 2OG (olive oil) versus pinolenic acid&#xD;
      (hydrolyzed pine nut oil) alone on glucose tolerance, insulin, GLP-1, GIP and ghrelin&#xD;
      secretion, appetite and gastrointestinal tolerability in overweight and obese healthy humans.&#xD;
