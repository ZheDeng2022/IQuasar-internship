    <textblock>
      Although Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) was formally introduced in DSM-5,&#xD;
      no specialized intervention has yet been empirically studied. This randomized controlled&#xD;
      crossover trial (RCCT) will test the feasibility and acceptability of a novel intervention,&#xD;
      Family-Based Treatment of Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (FBT-ARFID) for patients&#xD;
      ages 5-12 years old.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential subjects aged 5 years to 12 years, 11 months old with anorexia nervosa (AN)&#xD;
      diagnosed with ARFID and their families will be recruited will be recruited through Stanford&#xD;
      University, pediatricians, mental health experts, clinics treating EDs, and local parents'&#xD;
      groups. Those eligible for the program will be invited to read and sign informed consent&#xD;
      forms and complete the baseline assessment. They will then be randomized to the FBT-ARFID&#xD;
      program either immediately after their screening or 3 months after assessment (i.e., to a&#xD;
      usual care group). FBT-ARFID consists of 22 sessions over a 6-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 3 major assessment time points for those in the FBT-ARFID Arm: Baseline, 3&#xD;
      months into treatment, and EOT. There will be 4 major assessment time points for those in&#xD;
      Usual Care: Baseline, transition to treatment (3 months after the usual care period is&#xD;
      complete), 3 months into treatment, and EOT. Both the child and the parent will complete&#xD;
      measures at these time points. In addition, patients and parents will participate in ongoing&#xD;
      qualitative assessments before treatment (BL), throughout treatment (every other session),&#xD;
      and at EOT.&#xD;
