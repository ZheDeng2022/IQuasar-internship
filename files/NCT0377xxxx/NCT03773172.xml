  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, single-center, placebo controlled, double-blind, randomized crossover&#xD;
      study to determine the effects of MEDI6012 on the metabolism of apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100)&#xD;
      lipoproteins in individuals with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atherosclerosis, characterized by excess fat deposit in arteries, is a progressive and&#xD;
      life-threatening condition. Therefore, treatments that can remove fat deposits from the&#xD;
      arteries are being developed. These treatments may prevent subsequent heart attacks or other&#xD;
      cardiovascular events, addressing an unmet medical need. MEDI16012 is a new drug that targets&#xD;
      a substance produced by the body to assist participants in breaking down the bodies &quot;good&quot;&#xD;
      fat. The investigators are interested in understanding why MEDI6012 increases the good fat,&#xD;
      but also why it increases other types of &quot;bad&quot; fat such as low-density lipoprotein-C (LDL-C).&#xD;

    <description>MEDI6012 is recombinant human lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (rhLCAT), an approximately 60 kilodalton, glycosylated, single-chain protein consisting of 416 amino acids produced via Chinese hamster ovary cell culture. It is being explored as an acute treatment to reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events as an adjunct to the standard of care in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI). MEDI6012 and ACP501 have the identical amino acid sequence and are therefore considered the same molecular entity.</description>

&#xD;
          1. Adult male and female subjects (non-childbearing potential for females) ages 35&#xD;
             through 80 years at the time of screening who are capable of providing informed&#xD;
             consent prior to screening and any protocol-related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Written informed consent and any locally required authorization (e.g., Health&#xD;
             Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the USA) obtained from the&#xD;
             subject prior to performing any protocol-related procedures, including screening&#xD;
             evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Ability to complete and meet all eligibility requirements for randomization within 28&#xD;
             days of informed consent (56 days if washing out from lipid altering agent other than&#xD;
             statins or ezetimibe).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A diagnosis of stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) documented prior to&#xD;
             screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Coronary artery disease defined as a history of prior myocardial infarction,&#xD;
                  coronary revascularization, history of coronary atherosclerosis based on invasive&#xD;
                  or non-invasive imaging, and/or abnormal stress testing diagnostic of coronary&#xD;
                  artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Carotid artery disease (extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis)&#xD;
                  defined as evidence of carotid atherosclerosis by carotid imaging, or history of&#xD;
                  percutaneous or surgical carotid revascularization&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Peripheral artery disease defined as ankle-brachial index &lt; 0.90 and&#xD;

                  noninvasive imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Currently receiving statin as standard of care, at a stable dose for ≥ 8 weeks prior&#xD;

             participation in the study. Because male condom and spermicide is not a highly&#xD;
             effective contraception method it is strongly recommended that female partners of a&#xD;
             male study subjects also use a highly effective method of contraception throughout&#xD;

             postmenopausal; defined as 12 months with no menses without an alternative medical&#xD;
             cause and a follicle-stimulating hormone level in the central laboratory's normal&#xD;
