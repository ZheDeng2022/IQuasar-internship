    <textblock>
      This study consists of two phases. The phase I study is designed to investigate the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of Satoreotide tetraxetan following fractionated i.v. administrations in&#xD;
      pre-treated subjects with locally advanced or metastatic cancers expressing sstr2 as&#xD;
      identified by Satoreotide trizoxetan Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT) scans. This phase&#xD;
      will encompass both radioactivity escalation and peptide mass dose evaluation. Phase II will&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of Satoreotide tetraxetan in subjects in selected indications, in a&#xD;
      basket design.&#xD;

          <description>In the screening period, 8 subjects received a single i.v. injection of IIP, 68Ga-satoreotide trizoxetan with a peptide mass of up to 45 ug and a radioactivity dose range of 150-200 MBq for screening purposes. The PET images were acquired at 1-hour post injection and 1 contrast enhanced CT scan was performed.</description>
