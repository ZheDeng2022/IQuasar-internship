      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human milk (HM) is recommended for all very low birth infants (VLBW)). Breast-milk is highly&#xD;
      variable in nutrient content, failing to meet the nutritional demands of VLBW. Fortification&#xD;
      of HM is recommended to prevent extra-uterine growth retardation and associated poor&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcome. However, standard fortification with fixed dose multicomponent&#xD;
      fortifier does not account for the variability in milk composition. Targeted fortification is&#xD;
      a promising alternative and needs further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate if targeted fortification of human milk may optimize&#xD;
      growth and development in preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized single blind controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS &amp; ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit preterm infants (≤ 32 weeks of gestation) within the first 7 days of life.&#xD;
      After reaching 80 ml/kg/day of enteral feeding, patients will be randomised to receive&#xD;
      standard fortification (HMF, Nutricia) or targeted fortification (modular components: Bebilon&#xD;
      Bialko, Nutricia - protein, Calogen, Nutricia - carbohydrates, Calogen, Nutricia - lipids).&#xD;
      The intervention will continue until 37 weeks of post-conception age, or hospital discharge.&#xD;
      Parents and outcome assessors will be blinded to the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome - weight gain velocity will be measured starting from the day infants&#xD;
      regain their birth weight up to 4 weeks, then weekly until discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes such as neurodevelopment at 12 months of corrected age (CA) will be&#xD;
      assessed with Bayley Scale of Development III, repeated at 36 months of CA. Additionally a&#xD;
      Wescheler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence IV test will be applied at 3,5 years of&#xD;
      CA. Secondary outcomes such as length and head growth, body composition will be assesed at&#xD;
      discharge and at 4 months. Incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), sepsis, retinopathy&#xD;
      of prematurity (ROP) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) will also be followed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Study design and setting This is a multi-centre superiority randomised parallel group, 1:1&#xD;
      allocation study. Patients will be recruited at three departments of neonatology and&#xD;
      intensive care units: Department of Neonatology and Neonatal Intensive Care, Division of&#xD;
      Neonatal Intensive Care (Medical University of Warsaw), and the Institute of Mother and&#xD;
      Child. Follow up will be carried out at the Department of Paediatrics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is lead by the Department of Neonatology and Neonatal Intensive Care (KAROWA) with&#xD;
      approximately 3000 (100 ≤ 32 weeks of gestation) deliveries per year and 12 intensive care&#xD;
      and 40 high dependency neonatal beds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Recruitment will take place between June 2019 and December 2020. Parents of&#xD;
      infants born at less than 32 weeks of gestation will be approached within the first week of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation After reaching 80 ml/kg/day of enteral feeding, patients will be randomised to&#xD;
      receive standard fortification (SF) or targeted fortification (TF) (proteins, lipids,&#xD;
      carbohydrates). Allocation will be performed electronically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions Human milk fortification procedure Milk fortification will be done twice a day&#xD;
      (8 am and 8 pm) for each following 12 hour nursing shift (Appendix 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 10 mL aliquot from each batch of native breast milk will be used for macronutrient analysis&#xD;
      using a human milk analyser Miris® as per protocol. The remaining batch will first be&#xD;
      fortified with the standard fortifier. Macronutrient analysis will determine how much extra&#xD;
      fat, protein, and/or carbohydrate is needed to obtain target fortified breast milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An experienced laboratory technician will perform milk analysis in the neonatal intensive&#xD;
      care unit (NICU) research laboratory at KAROWA twice per week at 10:00 am (Monday/Friday)&#xD;
      from batches collected from the two previous days. Milk samples from other sites will be&#xD;
      delivered by medical transport in secure freezing containers at 8:00 am.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mean of three measurements per batch (3 x 2-3ml) will be used to calculate the required&#xD;
      amount of extra fat, protein, and carbohydrate for the following 3 days of fortification&#xD;
      using a predefined Excel spread sheet (Microsoft Inc, Redmond, Washington). Milk analysis&#xD;
      will be performed in both treatment arms; however only the intervention group will receive&#xD;
      TF. Results, together with required amounts of macronutrients, will be emailed to the&#xD;
      participating centres before noon the same day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The defined macronutrient concentration in breast milk is 4.4 g/100 mL of fat, 3 g/100 mL of&#xD;
      protein, and 8.8 g/ 100 mL of carbohydrate to meet the European Society for Paediatric&#xD;
      Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) guidelines (6.6 g/kg/d of fat, 4.5&#xD;
      g/kg/d of protein, and 13.2 g/kg/d of carbohydrate) assuming an intake of 150 mL/kg/d.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target fortification will be done in 3 steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determination of macronutrients concentration in own mothers´s milk (OMM)/human donor&#xD;
           milk (HDM).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Standard fortification (SF) (human milk fortifier - HMF).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Targeted fortification (TF): adding fat, protein, and/or carbohydrate to achieve target&#xD;
           levels of macronutrients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cases where a macronutrient component after SF will exceed the target value, only the&#xD;
      other deficient macronutrient components will be adjusted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Prescription of TF will be completed before noon. Bedside nurses will prepare batches&#xD;
      of fortified breast milk including the additives for TF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from breast milk analyses, fortification, and enteral intake will be documented daily.&#xD;
      Acid base status, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and glucose will be determined as per NICU&#xD;
      routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will continue until 37 weeks of post-conception age, or hospital discharge.&#xD;
      Parents and outcome assessors will be blinded to the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization A study number together with the allocated treatment will be assigned by the&#xD;
      platform. Patient's data along with the result of the allocation will be sent to statistical&#xD;
      team. The randomisation list will remain with the statistical team for the whole duration of&#xD;
      the study. Randomisation will be conducted without any influence of the principal&#xD;
      investigators, clinicians, recruitment or follow up staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding The decision to start fortification will be made by the attending physician blinded&#xD;
      to the intervention allocated. An employee outside the research team will feed data into the&#xD;
      computer in separate datasets so that the researchers can analyse data without having access&#xD;
      to information about the allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The sample size required to compare two means in two-sided equality test was&#xD;
      estimated based on results from a prior double blind, randomised clinical trial,&#xD;
      investigating the effect of target fortification vs standard fortification of breast milk on&#xD;
      the changes of anthropometric parameters and body composition in preterm children. It was&#xD;
      determined, that a mean difference of weight gain 1.9 g/kg/day between groups would be&#xD;
      clinically important and feasible during intervention. between the study groups with a power&#xD;
      of 80% and α=0.05, a sample of 91 infants is needed in each study group. Allowing for 10% of&#xD;
      loss to follow-up, the target number of 200 premature infants will be recruited.&#xD;
