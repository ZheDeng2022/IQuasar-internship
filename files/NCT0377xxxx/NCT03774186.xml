  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In pregnancies associated with diabetes, lowering glucose to the recommended targets to&#xD;
      prevent adverse health outcomes often leads to significant hypoglycemia. Hybrid closed-loop&#xD;
      (HCL) therapy, automated insulin delivery using an insulin pump getting feedback from a&#xD;
      continuous glucose monitor (CGM), may improve outcomes. This exploratory, novel pilot&#xD;
      feasibility randomized clinical trial will evaluate pregnant women with type 1 diabetes (T1D)&#xD;
      on HCL therapy or Sensor-Augmented Pump Therapy (SAPT, non-communicating pump and CGM) from&#xD;
      the 2nd trimester, throughout pregnancy, and 4-6 weeks post-partum. Comparisons will be made&#xD;
      on safety (Specific Aim [SA] 1), indices of glycemic variability and fear of hypoglycemia (SA&#xD;
      2), and quality of life and device satisfaction (SA 3) between groups. Exploratory SA 4 will&#xD;
      compare maternal and fetal outcomes between groups. Safety data will include episodes of&#xD;
      severe hypoglycemia requiring 3rd party assistance, diabetic ketoacidosis, and skin&#xD;
      reactions. Glycemic control will be measured by CGM time spent in glucose ranges (&lt;63,&#xD;
      63-140, &gt;140 mg/dL) and other measures of glycemic variability. Subjects will fill out&#xD;
      surveys (Fear of Hypoglycemia, a quality of life survey, and 2 questionnaires about device&#xD;
      satisfaction) at baseline, throughout gestation, and early post-partum. Data on maternal and&#xD;
      fetal outcomes will be collected. Findings will reveal the safety profile and glucose control&#xD;
      with a novel therapy for pregnant women with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-center, prospective, 'open-label', single-blind, investigator-initiated&#xD;
      randomized controlled pilot study evaluating hybrid closed-loop (HCL) insulin delivery among&#xD;
      pregnant women with T1D compared with sensor-augmented pump therapy (SAPT) throughout most of&#xD;
      gestation and the first 6 weeks of the post-partum period at the Barbara Davis Center for&#xD;
      Diabetes and Ohio State University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 37 women will be enrolled at ≤11 weeks gestation, sign informed consent, and begin a&#xD;
      run-in phase. At baseline, the investigators will obtain data about demographics, health&#xD;
      history, pregnancy history, and medication use. The investigators will conduct a physical&#xD;
      exam, download diabetes devices already in use by subjects, obtain blood and urine tests, and&#xD;
      administer validated questionnaires (Hypoglycemia Fear Survey, MOS Short-Form 36 [SF-26],&#xD;
      INSPIRE Questionnaire, Insulin Delivery Satisfaction Survey [IDSS], and Glucose Monitoring&#xD;
      Satisfaction Survey [GMSS]). During run-in, women will wear a CGM, fill out log sheets&#xD;
      (glucose levels, insulin doses, carbohydrate intake, exercise), upload the CGM, and be in&#xD;
      contact with research staff. Eligible subjects will then be trained on study devices for SAPT&#xD;
      therapy. At the start of the 2nd trimester, women will be randomized to SAPT or HCL therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During pregnancy, women will be seen at each institution monthly for vital signs, HbA1c&#xD;
      measurements, device downloads, pump adjustments, medication use, reporting of adverse events&#xD;
      and device-related deficiencies, and once a trimester the investigators will additionally&#xD;
      obtain serum and urine measurements, specimens for the repository of biological specimens,&#xD;
      and ask subjects to fill out questionnaires (Hypoglycemia Fear Survey, SF-35, IDSS, GMSS).&#xD;
      Weekly remote contact will be obtained for pump adjustments and reporting of adverse events&#xD;
      and device-related deficiencies. Women on HCL therapy will use SAPT during labor and delivery&#xD;
      until 3-7 days post-partum, when a study clinician will put them back into auto mode (HCL&#xD;
      therapy), if it is safe to do so. The final study visit will take place 4-6 weeks post-partum&#xD;
      where the physical exam will be done, HbA1c obtained, device downloads obtained, and final&#xD;
      questionnaires submitted (as above plus a post-partum survey). Medical records of the labor&#xD;
      and delivery admission will be obtained.&#xD;
