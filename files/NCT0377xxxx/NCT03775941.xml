  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is associated with decreased risk for mild cognitive&#xD;
      impairment (MCI) and dementia. CRF is linked with more conserved gray and white matter (WM)&#xD;
      volume, improved WM microstructural integrity, and better cognitive performance among healthy&#xD;
      older adults. Additional research is needed to determine: (1) which WM tracts are most&#xD;
      strongly related to CRF, (2) whether CRF-related benefits on WM translate to enhanced&#xD;
      cognitive functioning, and (3) factors that mediate and moderate CRF effects. Higher CRF was&#xD;
      hypothesized to be associated with stronger WM integrity, both globally and locally in WM&#xD;
      tracts that connect frontal brain regions. The neuroprotective effects were hypothesized to&#xD;
      be age-dependent, such that the association between CRF and WM integrity would be stronger in&#xD;
      old age compared to younger age. Finally, higher CRF was hypothesized to predict stronger&#xD;
      performance on tests of executive functioning (EF), partially mediated by frontal WM&#xD;
      integrity. Delineation of specific neurocognitive effects of CRF may serve clinicians in&#xD;
      individually tailoring wellness interventions to meet patients' specific cognitive concerns&#xD;
      with aging.&#xD;

      Sample: Participant data from the &quot;Cross-Sectional Lifespan Connectomics Study&quot; of the Nathan&#xD;
      Kline Institute - Rockland Sample (NKI-RS) will be analyzed for the present study. Zip&#xD;
      code-based recruitment and monitoring enrollment for key demographic variables (e.g., age,&#xD;
      sex, ethnicity) were used to maintain adequate representation of Rockland County and prevent&#xD;
      sampling biases (e.g., cohort effects). NKI-RS eligibility was designed for inclusivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: All participants completed a medical evaluation, psychiatric interview,&#xD;
      self-report questionnaires, standardized battery of cognitive tests, and neuroimaging at NKI.&#xD;
      Complete details about the MRI measurement parameters can be located on the NKI-RS website&#xD;
      for DTI and MPRAGE and protocols. Quality assurance of raw data, inclusive of monitoring&#xD;
      standard operating procedures, error-handling, and compiling the data dictionary, is&#xD;
      maintained by NKI-RS. Raw neuroimaging data was acquired by NKI-RS and processed at Suffolk&#xD;
      University using TRACULA and FreeSurfer 5.3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Plan: Analyses will be performed on de-identified phenotypic and neuroimaging&#xD;
      data from adult NKI-RS participants available at the start of this study (October 2016).&#xD;
      Analyses will evaluate the potential for CRF to modulate decline in WM integrity and EF&#xD;
      observed with aging. Mixed-effects modeling will investigate the extent to which CRF predicts&#xD;
      WM integrity, as both a global measurement of fractional anisotropy (FA) and FA within nine&#xD;
      major WM tracts. Structural equation modeling will examine whether higher FA within frontal&#xD;
      WM tracts partially mediates a positive relationship between CRF and EF. The role of age and&#xD;
      clinical characteristics (e.g., cardiovascular risk factors, depression) will also be&#xD;
      explored as covariates in the link between CRF, WM, and EF.&#xD;
