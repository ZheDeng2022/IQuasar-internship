  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a three phase sequential study of the medical treatment of insomnia with&#xD;
      zolpidem. All participating subjects will receive one month of standard nightly treatment. If&#xD;
      the subject has a positive treatment response they continue in the study and are randomized&#xD;
      to one of four conditions: intermittent dosing (3-5 pills week, full dose), or one of three&#xD;
      variable dose conditions (nightly pill use where any given pill is a variable dose). Standard&#xD;
      treatment will last for 4 weeks. The experimental phase will extend over two periods. The&#xD;
      first period will last for 12 weeks. The second period will last for 36 weeks. Both periods&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Taking a pill 30 minutes prior to bedtime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In one case, this will involve taking 3-5 pills per week. In the remaining condition pills&#xD;
      will be taken on each and every night. Depending on the specific group that the subject is&#xD;
      assigned to, they will either receive 10mg or 5mg of zolpidem (variable by age and sex) or a&#xD;
      variable dose of zolpidem on a nightly basis (range from 0 mg to 10 mg per night).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completing a sleep diary each day;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completing 6 to 7 questionnaires each week;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A monthly visit to Penn to return your medication foil packs and to receive a new foil&#xD;
           pack with the next month of medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phases 3&amp;4, the subject will be asked to undergo quarter annual physicals so that we&#xD;
      can optimally track their health and wellbeing. The physicals will involve standard vitals&#xD;
      measures (e.g., temperature, blood pressure, height and weight, etc.) and, based on the&#xD;
      judgement of the research clinician, may involve an EKG and blood and urine chemistries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject does not experience a treatment response or (following a treatment response)&#xD;
      experiences a relapse of insomnia, they will not continue in the study but will be given the&#xD;
      opportunity to be treated with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) at no cost.&#xD;
      Assessments of the subjects clinical status will be based on your daily sleep diaries and&#xD;
      weekly questionnaires.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Phase-1: Initial Evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This evaluation occurs at the offices of the Behavioral Sleep Medicine Program (Suite 670,&#xD;
      3535 Market Street Philadelphia, PA 19104) and lasts about 1 to 2 hours. Procedures include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completing forms asking questions about your sleep, mood, alcohol use, medical history,&#xD;
           your current medications, and background questions about your age, race, and education.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The provision of your consent to contact your primary care provider to gain their assent&#xD;
           (agreement) that you may participate in the trial safely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information obtained during the initial assessment will be used to see if you are&#xD;
      eligible to participate in this study. If you are determined ineligible, you will not be able&#xD;
      to continue in the study but will be provided with a referral if appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: This study will be using an Internet Data Portal (IDP) system to collect most&#xD;
      questionnaire data. The IDP is a Research Electronic Data Capture and is a secure web&#xD;
      application. It is a password protected site located on Penn's servers in which the data will&#xD;
      live in a database online where only qualified research personnel can access it. During the&#xD;
      initial evaluation you will be introduced to this system and provided with a username and&#xD;
      password. The study staff will assist you in filling out the questionnaires using this IDP&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase-2: Baseline Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase lasts 14 days. Your participation includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completing daily sleep diaries at home. The online diary form requires about 5 minutes&#xD;
           each day to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completing 6 to 7 forms asking questions about your medical symptoms, and sleep each&#xD;
           week of the baseline period. These online questionnaires require about 15 minutes to&#xD;
           complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abstaining from the use of any medication or over the counter product that is used&#xD;
           expressly for the purpose of helping you fall or stay asleep (e.g. trazadone/Desyrel,&#xD;
           melatonin, Nyquil, Tylenol PM, Benadryl, etc.). If you choose to discontinue your&#xD;
           current sleep medication to participate in our study, please do this in consultation&#xD;
           with the clinician that prescribed your sleep medication. Please note that&#xD;
           discontinuation of your current sleep medication will make it necessary to extend the&#xD;
           baseline component of our study by at least two weeks. Should the sleep diaries indicate&#xD;
           that your insomnia is not of the type, severity, or frequency required for the study,&#xD;
           you will not be able to continue in the study but will be provided with a referral. This&#xD;
           referral will be for the Penn Sleep Disorder Center. If you or study personnel deem your&#xD;
           two weeks to be unusual, you may be offered the chance to repeat the baseline period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase-3: Sleep Lab Study (polysomnography) or Home Sleep Apnea Test (HSAT). You will undergo&#xD;
      a polysomnography study or an HSAT to determine if you are eligible to continue in the study.&#xD;
      During the pandemic all sleep tests will be administered at home. After the pandemic, the&#xD;
      study investigators will decide which type of study you will receive. Both sleep assessments&#xD;
      will last for 1 night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HSAT equipment will be shipped to your house. A member of the study team will contact you&#xD;
      to go over proper use instructions. On the night of the test, you can go to bed at your&#xD;
      regular bedtime. Prior to bedtime, you will attach the sensor(s) as instructed and start the&#xD;
      test. Upon waking up, you will stop the test and remove the sensor(s). On the day immediately&#xD;
      following the sleep test, you will ship the device back in the prepaid shipping envelope&#xD;
      Procedures for the polysomnography study are: you will be asked to arrive at the sleep lab&#xD;
      located at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP) at the cross streets of 34th&#xD;
      and Spruce by 7 P.M. for a polysomnographic study (PSG). Upon arrival, to ensure for accurate&#xD;
      laboratory measurements, urine toxicology screens may be performed to rule out illegal&#xD;
      substance use. These data are acquired to explain abnormal findings on the PSG. Following the&#xD;
      sleep study, it will be determined whether a repeat study is necessary based on the findings&#xD;
      both from the clinical chemistries and the polysomnography. If a repeat study is necessary,&#xD;
      one of the project investigators will discuss the issue of substance use with you to: (1)&#xD;
      determine if the clinical chemistries' finding was an error (for example poppy seeds led to a&#xD;
      positive screen) or (2) gain your willingness to refrain from substance use for the second&#xD;
      PSG and for the remainder of the study. If you screen positive a second time, your&#xD;
      participation will be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific procedure for a PSG requires that you have a set of sensors placed on your face,&#xD;
      scalp, and body by a technician. All the sensors are attached with surgical tape, paste and&#xD;
      glue. The sensors on your face are attached on your left and right temple, cheek bone and&#xD;
      under your nose. The sensors on the temple and cheek bone measure eye movements associated&#xD;
      with falling asleep and dreaming. The sensors under your nose measure airflow through your&#xD;
      mouth and nose. The sensors on your scalp measure brain waves during sleep. The sensors on&#xD;
      the body are placed above the collar bones and over the calf muscles. The sensors over the&#xD;
      collar bones measure heart muscle activity. The sensors over the calf muscles measure muscle&#xD;
      activity from the legs. In addition, a strap will be placed around your chest and abdomen to&#xD;
      measure respiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you have been connected to the equipment, you are expected to stay in bed until final&#xD;
      wake time the next morning, except for bathroom breaks. You will be visually monitored by the&#xD;
      lab technicians by remote video. In the morning, you will be awakened by the technician (if&#xD;
      needed), be unhooked from the equipment, and then allowed to shower, dress, and eat before&#xD;
      leaving. You will be free to go about your normal schedule for the rest of the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the in-lab PSG sleep or HSAT study finds evidence of a sleep disorder other than insomnia,&#xD;
      such as sleep apnea, you will not be able to continue in the study but will be provided with&#xD;
      a referral.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase-4: Standard Treatment. All participating subjects will receive one month of standard&#xD;
      nightly treatment. If you have a positive treatment response you will remain in the study and&#xD;
      be randomized to one of the following treatment conditions: nightly dosing, intermittent&#xD;
      dosing (1-3 pills week, full dose), or one of two variable dose conditions (nightly pill use&#xD;
      where any given pill is a variable dose). The assignment of condition will be accomplished by&#xD;
      a process that is the same as the flip of a coin and neither you nor the study personnel will&#xD;
      know which condition you have been assigned to (this is referred to as a &quot;double blind&quot;&#xD;
      study). You will have an equal chance of being randomized to each of the 4 study arms. In the&#xD;
      case of an emergency, the blind will be broken and the study doctor and clinicians associated&#xD;
      with your care will be informed of which dosing condition you were assigned to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard treatment will last for 4 weeks. The experimental phase will extend over two&#xD;
      periods. The first period will last for 12 weeks. The second period will last for 36 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both periods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Taking a pill 30 minutes prior to bedtime. In one case, this will involve taking 1-3&#xD;
           pills per week. In the remaining conditions, pills will be taken on each and every&#xD;
           night. Depending on the specific group you are assigned to, you will either receive 10mg&#xD;
           or 5mg of zolpidem (variable by age and sex) or a variable dose of zolpidem on a nightly&#xD;
           basis (range from 0 mg to 10 mg per night). Please note that the effect of zolpidem may&#xD;
           be slowed if taken with or immediately after a meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completing a sleep diary each day;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completing 6 to 7 questionnaires each week;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A monthly visit to Penn to return your medication foil packs and to receive a new foil&#xD;
           pack with the next month of medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you do not experience a treatment response or (following a treatment response) you&#xD;
      experience a relapse of insomnia, you will not be able to continue in the study but will be&#xD;
      given the opportunity to be treated with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) at&#xD;
      no cost. Assessments of your clinical status (how your insomnia is responding to treatment)&#xD;
      will be based on your daily sleep diaries and weekly questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phase-4, you will be asked to undergo quarter annual physicals so that we can&#xD;
      optimally track your health and wellbeing. The physicals will involve standard vital measures&#xD;
      (e.g., temperature, blood pressure, height and weight, etc.) and, based on the judgement of&#xD;
      the research clinician, may involve an EKG and/or blood and urine chemistries.&#xD;
