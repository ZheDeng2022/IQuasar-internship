  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myopia is a common disease of the eye with increasing prevalence all over the world including&#xD;
      Denmark where the prevalence has increased from 12,8% in 2004 among young adults (mean age&#xD;
      19,3 years) till 17,9% in 2017 among school children (mean age 15,4 years). High myopia is&#xD;
      associated with an increasing risk of sight threatening complications such as retinal&#xD;
      detachment, glaucoma, macular choroidal degeneration, and myopic choroidal&#xD;
      neovascularization. In myopia the eye is elongated compared to an emmetropic eye. If the&#xD;
      elongation of the eye can be controlled the progression of myopia can be controlled. Asian&#xD;
      studies have shown reduction in axial length growth by 36-46% in children using&#xD;
      orthokeratology contact lenses (OKL). OKL are custom fit, form stable lenses. During sleep&#xD;
      the cornea is reshaped creating an emmetropic vision during the day, so no glasses or contact&#xD;
      lenses are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the CONTROL-study 60 Danish children aged six to 13 years were randomized 1:1 to either&#xD;
      OKL (intervention group) or single vision spectacles (SVS) (control group) and followed for&#xD;
      18 months to compare changes in axial length (AL). In CONTROL2 the intervention group will be&#xD;
      followed for another 18 month and the control group will be crossed over to OKL treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of CONTROL2 is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigate changes in axial length after 3 years of OKL wear (DreamliteR, Procornea,&#xD;
           Nederlands).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigate changes in progression rate 18 month before and after OKL wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigate correlations between changes in choroidal thickness and changes in AL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Investigate the safety of OKL treatment (Efron score).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Investigate changes in quality of life before and after OKL treatment using Pediatric&#xD;
           Refractive Error Profile 2 (PREP2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Investigate correlations between AC/A-ratio, peripheral refraction and higher order&#xD;
           aberrations on myopia progression.&#xD;

      Myopia is a common disease of the eye with increasing prevalence in the Western World as well&#xD;
      as in South East Asia where 60-90% of the children are affected. A Danish study found that&#xD;
      early debut of myopia is associated with a higher degree of myopia later on in life. Myopia&#xD;
      may be corrected with spectacles, contact lenses or surgically, but despite this&#xD;
      socio-economic burden, high myopia is associated with an increasing risk of sight threatening&#xD;
      complications such as retinal detachment, glaucoma, macular choroidal degeneration and myopic&#xD;
      choroidal neovascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myopia is a complex disease with a multi-factorial etiology. Twin studies and family studies&#xD;
      have shown a high heritability for development of myopia, and more than 40 genetic loci have&#xD;
      been identified. Outdoor activity seems to reduce the myopia progression. The shape of the&#xD;
      eye may be of importance; axial growth makes the eye ellipsoidal which increase the&#xD;
      peripheral defocus on the retina. Peripheral defocus has been suggested to induce further&#xD;
      axial growth of the eyeball.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accommodation is a significant covariant of near work and reading. A cross section study has&#xD;
      shown a reduced precision in accommodation (A) on a near object combined with increased&#xD;
      convergence (C) in myopic eyes. This increased AC/A ratio (dynamic) may be a predictor for&#xD;
      myopia progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions for reducing myopia progression have been many. The effects of progressive&#xD;
      additional lenses, multifocal lenses and bifocal lenses have been limited. Anticholinergic&#xD;
      eyedrops (Atropin 0.01%) significantly reduce the progression of myopia in Asian children by&#xD;
      approximately 50% over a period of two years with limited side effects. Almost similar&#xD;
      results have been found in Asian children using orthokeratology contact lenses (OKL) for&#xD;
      reducing myopia progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OKL are custom fit, form stable lenses used during sleep. The lenses induce a temporary&#xD;
      flattening of the cornea, which modify or eliminate refractive errors, leaving no need for&#xD;
      glasses or contact lenses during daytime. OKL were introduced in the 1960 ́s, but with&#xD;
      limited success due to lens material (PMMA) which was not gas-permeable. Decentration was&#xD;
      also a problem making the effect variable and unpredictable. With new gas permeable lens&#xD;
      materials and computer assisted topographic measurements of the cornea, fitting of the lenses&#xD;
      has been improved significantly, so that nightly wear is now standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clear-cut reduction in axial length growth in Asian children using OKL compared to&#xD;
      single-vision spectacles (SVS) has been proofed in several studies. In these studies, which&#xD;
      are very heterogeneous regarding design, reductions of 36-46% in axial length growth were&#xD;
      found compared to a matched control group. Two European prospective cohort studies have&#xD;
      investigated the effect of OKL compared to SVS in Spanish children. A reduction in axial&#xD;
      growth of 32 % and 38% respectively was found. Side effects of OKL have been evaluated; in a&#xD;
      meta-analysis from 2015, including 8 Asian and one of the European studies. Odds Ratio for&#xD;
      side effects were 8.87 for the OK group compared to the control group, however all side&#xD;
      effects were mild and disappeared after termination of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, a reduction in childhood myopia using OKL has been proofed in Asian children; however,&#xD;
      weather similar result can be achieved in a group of children from Northern Europe is unknown&#xD;
      and to address that the CONTROL-study was conducted. The CONTROL-study is an eighteen-months&#xD;
      randomized prospective 1:1 study of the progression of myopia in a group of Danish children&#xD;
      wearing OKL nightly (n=30) compared to a control group wearing SVS (n=30). The study is&#xD;
      ongoing and thus there are not yet published any results. However, the study has formed the&#xD;
      basis for a unique opportunity to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Look at the long-term effects of OKL treatment (3 years) in regards to efficacy and&#xD;
           safety, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the progression-rate of myopia 18 months prior to treatment compared to 18&#xD;
           months after treatment with OKL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary goals of the CONTROL2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To investigate changes in axial length after 3 years of OKL wear (DreamliteR, Procornea,&#xD;
      Nederlands).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. To investigate changes in progression rate 18 month before and after OKL wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate correlations between changes in choroidal thickness and changes in AL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the safety of OKL treatment (Efron score).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate changes in quality of life before and after OKL treatment using Pediatric&#xD;
           Refractive Error Profile 2 (PREP2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To investigate correlations between AC/A-ratio, peripheral refraction and higher order&#xD;
           aberrations on myopia progression.&#xD;
