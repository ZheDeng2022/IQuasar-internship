      This study evaluates if trainees can accurately rule out dilation of the renal collecting&#xD;
      system on ultrasound (hydronephrosis) using hand-carried ultrasound (HCU). Trainees will&#xD;
      undergo a short ultrasound training program. Patients will be adults that are hospitalized&#xD;
      and have acute or subacute kidney dysfunction. The investigators will assess sensitivity,&#xD;
      specificity, positive and negative predictive value of HCU compared to radiology performed&#xD;
      ultrasound, and calculate potential cost savings to the patient and to the healthcare system.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hand-carried ultrasound is an increasingly popular imaging modality and is widely used by&#xD;
      emergency physicians, intensivists, trauma doctors and cardiologists. Renal ultrasonography&#xD;
      is commonly ordered for patients with acute kidney injury, with a main focus on identifying&#xD;
      obstruction of the collecting system, a rare but potentially reversible cause of acute kidney&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study's aim is to evaluate if nephrology and internal medicine trainees can accurately&#xD;
      rule out dilation of the renal collecting system on ultrasound (hydronephrosis) using&#xD;
      hand-carried ultrasound (HCU). Trainees will undergo a short, uniform and well described&#xD;
      ultrasound training program. Patients will be adults that are hospitalized and have acute or&#xD;
      subacute kidney dysfunction. The investigators will assess sensitivity, specificity, positive&#xD;
      and negative predictive value of HCU compared to radiology performed ultrasound, and&#xD;
      calculate potential cost savings to the patient and to the healthcare system.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Direct costs of hand-carried ultrasound</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Direct costs in $ of hand-carried ultrasound will be calculated and compared to the costs of radiology performed ultrasound. For hand-carried ultrasound, this will include costs of purchasing the device, training costs, yearly depreciation of the hand-carried ultrasound device. For radiology performed ultrasound, this will include the sonographer's fee, radiologist fee for interpretation of the result, transportation fee by hospital transport and depreciation of the ultrasound machine.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Ultrasound image quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Ultrasound image quality assessed by a blinded independent radiologist. The quality will be deemed either excellent, good, fair or poor by the radiologist.</description>

    <measure>Technical difficulty of the ultrasound study</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>How technically difficult was it for the trainees to obtain the images (patient intubated, obesity etc.) as graded by the trainees who performed the ultrasound scans themselves. Trainees will grade difficulty using the following measurement scale (1) Technically easy: trainee able to get clear images of both kidneys within a timeframe of 10 minutes (2) Technically challenging: Trainee able to get clear images of kidneys but requiring more than 10 minutes of scanning time (3) Technically difficult: trainee unable to get clear images of both kidneys independent of time spent scanning.</description>
