  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer is the sixth most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Esophageal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma has become more common in Western countries. In many Asian countries, however,&#xD;
      Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC) represents the most common esophageal cancer. In&#xD;
      palliative chemotherapy for metastatic or recurrent ESCC, A combination of 5-fluorouracil and&#xD;
      platinum was prescribed as a standard treatment for about 20 years. With this traditional&#xD;
      regimen, the median progression free survival is approximately 7 months, and 1-year survival&#xD;
      rate is reported to be 34%. Combinations of taxane and anthracycline are also considerable,&#xD;
      but also shows the median survival less than one year. Though cytotoxic chemotherapy is&#xD;
      current main treatment option, molecularly targeted agents are recently incorporated to&#xD;
      improve survival in ESCC. There is a strong rationale for investigation of biologic agents&#xD;
      targeting Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) family in ESCC. EGFR is frequently&#xD;
      overexpressed in esophageal cancer and is known to be associated with poor prognosis. Several&#xD;
      EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been studied in esophageal cancer subjects and&#xD;
      have shown clinical effects. In a recent Phase II trial using dacomitinib, pan-human&#xD;
      epidermal growth receptor TKI, Partial response was observed in 10 of the 49 esophageal&#xD;
      cancer subjects, with a response rate of 20.8%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on notable rationale in exploring impact of EGFR inhibition, we suggest multicenter&#xD;
      phase II study to determine antitumor activity and safety of a other potent pan-HER&#xD;
      inhibitor, Poziotinib in Esophageal Squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;
