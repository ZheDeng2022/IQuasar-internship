    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the morphology of iridocorneal angle and anterior&#xD;
      segment structure in children with cataract, and to explore potential preoperative structural&#xD;
      clues for postoperative glaucoma. The investigators included children with cataract planning&#xD;
      to have cataract surgery in our institute. For analysis, one eye was randomly selected in a&#xD;
      case of bilateral cataract via a random table, forming the &quot;bilateral cataract&quot; group; the&#xD;
      cataractous eyes in cases of unilateral cataract composed the &quot;unilateral cataract&quot; group and&#xD;
      the fellow non-cataractous eyes made up the &quot;control&quot; group. Exclusion criteria were: a&#xD;
      history of ocular trauma, a history of intraocular surgery, preoperative glaucoma, steroid&#xD;
      use before surgery, a history of maternal rubella syndrome, chronic anterior uveitis,&#xD;
      persistent fetal vasculature, ocular anomalies associated with an increased risk of glaucoma,&#xD;
      unable to complete examinations. The investigators recorded age at surgery, gender and&#xD;
      relevant ocular and systemic histories. All patients underwent slit lamp biomicroscopy,&#xD;
      dilated fundus examination and cycloplegic retinoscopy. In patients with good cooperation,&#xD;
      The investigators obtained the axial length (AL) using IOL-Master 500 and the intraocular&#xD;
      pressure (IOP) with a non-contact tonometer. In young patients with poor cooperation, the&#xD;
      investigators measured the AL with a contact A-scan, the central corneal thickness (CCD)&#xD;
      value with a handheld pachymeter and the IOP using a handheld tonometer under sedation. With&#xD;
      a contact A-scan, the AL measurement was repeated 10 times by the same examiner and the mean&#xD;
      value was analyzed. Corneal diameter was measured with a caliper in the operating room before&#xD;
      cataract surgery. Under general anesthesia, a pediatric surgeon (YEZ) evaluated the&#xD;
      iridocorneal angle with an indirect goniolens under the operating microscope. A gentle&#xD;
      tilting of the goniolens was allowed to obtain a better view of the angle. Another&#xD;
      experienced pediatric ophthalmologist (DDW) double checked the video recordings and graded&#xD;
      the details of iridocorneal angle according to the Shaffer and Spaeth classification system&#xD;
      and standard methods reported. The angle width was defined as follows: grade 0, a closed&#xD;
      angle without visible angle structures; grade 1, a very narrow angle with Schwalbe's line&#xD;
      visible only; grade 2, a moderately narrow angle with Schwalbe's line and trabecular meshwork&#xD;
      visible; grade 3, an open angle with trabecular meshwork and scleral spur visible; grade 4,&#xD;
      the widest angle with ciliary body band (CBB) visible. The iris insertion and pigmentation of&#xD;
      the posterior trabecular meshwork were classified according to the Spaeth classification&#xD;
      system. The iris insertion was defined as follows: A, anterior to Schwalbe's line; B, between&#xD;
      Schwalbe's line and scleral spur; C, scleral spur visible; D, deep with ciliary body visible;&#xD;
      E, extremely deep with &gt; 1 mm ciliary body band. The pigmentation of trabecular meshwork was&#xD;
      defined as follows: 0, no pigment; 1, minimal pigment; 2, mild pigment; 3, moderate pigment;&#xD;
      4, intense pigment. The number of iris process was defined as follows: 0, none; 1, minimal;&#xD;
      2, moderate; 3, marked. The width of CBB was graded according to the classification proposed&#xD;
      by Tawara et al and defined as follows: invisible, the CBB could not be seen at all; very&#xD;
      narrow, the CBB was narrower than the scleral spur; normal, the CBB was wider than the&#xD;
      scleral spur. The normality of variables was tested using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Continuous&#xD;
      variables are presented as meanÂ±standard deviation or median (interquartile range) based on&#xD;
      the normality of variables, and categorical variables are presented as frequencies and&#xD;
      percentages. One-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test was used for overall comparison, and&#xD;
      Dunnett test or Kruskal-Wallis One-way ANOVA was used for paired-comparison of variables&#xD;
      between groups where appropriate. Mann-Whitney test was used for further subgroup comparison.&#xD;
      A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses&#xD;
      were performed using SPSS version 21.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois, USA).&#xD;
