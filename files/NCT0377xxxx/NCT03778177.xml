  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is an idiopathic pain disorder that is characterized by episodic&#xD;
      attacks of intense facial pain, described as paroxysms of stabbing, electric, or explosive&#xD;
      pain, and lasting for a few seconds or longer, often producing a tic-like facial movement,&#xD;
      and can occur up to hundreds of times per day. This pain is known to be one of the worst pain&#xD;
      conditions that a patient can suffer and has been called the &quot;suicide disease&quot;. Given the&#xD;
      severity of this disorder, determining the cause becomes essential for finding a cure. This&#xD;
      project will study the cause of TN using a translational approach, which means the research&#xD;
      project will be completed in both humans and animals. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      there are specific areas of the brain and spinal cord that will provide a &quot;signature&quot; center&#xD;
      of activity. The study team will use state of the art magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      machines and other non-invasive brain activity measurements, including electroencephalography&#xD;
      (EEG) to locate these centers in people with TN before and after their pain has started.&#xD;
      Recent studies have investigated the effects of transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) for&#xD;
      pain control. Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) includes transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). This approach is&#xD;
      important because identifying similar regions neural activity will allow for us to study&#xD;
      novel therapies in search of the cure for TN and this study has thus both basic and clinical&#xD;
      neuroscience significance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is an extremely painful and highly disabling orofacial pain&#xD;
      disorder, often referred to as the &quot;suicide disease,&quot; for which presently available therapies&#xD;
      are largely ineffective or inadequate. Both the unpredictable response to treatment and&#xD;
      variability in long-term clinical outcomes in TN strongly suggest that a range of peripheral&#xD;
      and central mechanisms remain to be understood. The long-term goal is to identify the&#xD;
      mechanisms involved in the initiation and progression of TN, and uncover rational targets for&#xD;
      the safe and effective treatment of TN. The objective of this application is to explore the&#xD;
      use of multimodal neuroimaging and neurophysiologic techniques in defining neural signatures&#xD;
      of the disease. Additionally, the study team wants to evaluate the efficacy of transcranial&#xD;
      electrical stimulation on relieving pain. The rationale for the proposed research is that&#xD;
      identification of signature peripheral and central activation sites will allow for&#xD;
      individualized treatment strategies for TN patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To modulate brain activities the investigators will use transcranial electrical stimulation&#xD;
      (tES). tES is an emerging neuromodulation technique that can be noninvasively and safely&#xD;
      applied in humans. tES can help better understand the causal roles of brain networks and&#xD;
      brain activities and has shown efficacy in improving pain. tES has two main variations:&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial alternating current&#xD;
      stimulation (tACS). The former applies a weak direct current to the scalp whereas the latter&#xD;
      applies a weak sinusoidal current to the scalp. tDCS can modulate the excitability of tissues&#xD;
      under the stimulating electrodes. tACS is particularly suited for interacting with various&#xD;
      oscillatory activities in the brain. tES has been used to study normal brain function and&#xD;
      treat neurological and pain disorders as well. There is demonstrated efficacy in improvement&#xD;
      of pain in subjects suffering from fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain. The study team will use&#xD;
      different tDCS/tACS montages targeting different brain regions and observe behavior and&#xD;
      neuronal activities. The current strength will be within 1mA or 2mA which has been shown to&#xD;
      be safe and effective.&#xD;

    <description>Pain will be measured by subjects using a visual analog scale (VAS). The VAS is a psychometric measuring instrument presented as a 100-mm horizontal line anchored on one end with the words &quot;no pain at all&quot; which is 0 and at the other end with the words &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot; which is 100. Subjects will be asked to rate their pain on the VAS from 0-100 once before the stimulation and again after the stimulation is complete. The two scores will be compared to see if there is any reduction in subject's pain after the stimulation.</description>

    <description>Healthy patients between the ages of 18-75 who have been diagnosed with moderate to severe Trigeminal Neuralgia Pain. The study team will perform transcranial electrical brain stimulation using either electrodes that are in the form of two salt-water soaked sponges attached to the head or a set of smaller gel-covered disk electrodes that fit inside the electrode holders of the EEG cap. During stimulation a weak direct or alternating current will be passed through the stimulating electrodes. Stimulation may last 20 to 30 minutes.</description>
