      Twenty-four non-diabetic hypertensive and hyperlipidemic patients undergoing periodic chronic&#xD;
      hemodialysis will be enrolled for receiving extravirgin olive oil (EVOO) Coratina (12&#xD;
      patients) or refined olive oil (12 patients). Aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      EVOO-C on serum lipid levels. Randomization will be done centrally with appropriate&#xD;
      stratification. Sample size is opportunistic because this is a pilot study. Dietary and&#xD;
      clinical monitoring will be done by nephrologists, cardiologists and dieticians.&#xD;

      Detailed Description: EXTRAVIRGIN OLIVE OIL CORATINA INTERVENTION ON LIPIDS IN NON-DIABETIC&#xD;
      HYPERTENSIVE (H) PATIENTS WITH HYPERLIPIDEMIA (H)UNDERGOING PERIODIC HEMODIALYSIS (H)&#xD;
      (EVOOC-3H) INTRODUCTION What is known. The primary causes of death in patients undergoing&#xD;
      chronic hemodialysis (HD) are the cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular risk factors(hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obesity, high levels of low&#xD;
      density lipoprotein (LDL) , low levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), smoking&#xD;
      and reduced physical activity) are almost universally present in people on HD. Evidence from&#xD;
      randomized clinical trials demonstrate that statin administration in patients undergoing HD&#xD;
      does not reduce the risk of adverse vascular outcomes. In the general population, there is&#xD;
      growing evidence that the Mediterranean diet supplemented with olive oil implies&#xD;
      cardiovascular and survival advantage. The favorable effects of the extravirgin olive oil&#xD;
      (EVOO) are due to the combination of high content of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and&#xD;
      polyphenols. The EVOO Coratina (EVOOC), produced in the Puglia Region within the Bari&#xD;
      Province, is characterized by high values of polyphenols ranging between 400 and 1000 mg/kg&#xD;
      of EVOO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is unknown. The potential effects of EVOOC in people on HD have not been formally&#xD;
      explored both for surrogate and patient level endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why this study. The investigators want to evaluate the effects of EVOOC in non-diabetic&#xD;
      hypertensive patients undergoing chronic HD on a series of surrogate endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM OF THE PROPOSAL The investigators will investigate the effects of EVOOC with high content&#xD;
      of polyphenols compared with refined olive oil (ROO) on lipid levels in HD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll non-diabetic hypertensive and hyperlipidemic patients&#xD;
      undergoing chronic HD Hypertension will be defined as systolic blood pressure &gt;130 mmHg and&#xD;
      diastolic blood pressure &gt;80 mmHg or having any antihypertensive agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperlipidemia will be defined as LDL cholesterol values more than 70 mg/dl or receiving&#xD;
      statins at any dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients may be of age. (40-80 years old)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following patients will be excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        2. Severe heart failure (NYHA class III or IV)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients with low compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Smoking, intake of antioxidant supplements (eg, carotenoids, vitamin C, vitamin E and&#xD;
           glutathione), aspirin, or any other drug with established antioxidant properties,&#xD;
           hyperlipidemia, obesity (body mass index &gt;30 kg/m2), diabetes, celiac or other&#xD;
           intestinal disease, life-threatening&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Life expectancy &lt;6 months based on managing physicians assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Inability to participate in the trial based on managing physician assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental intervention will be EVOOC. Participants will ingest two tablespoons of&#xD;
      olive oil during the day: one spoon containing 10g of EVOOC (&gt;5mg of total biophenols/kg of&#xD;
      EVOOC) at lunch and one at dinner. Total biophenols ingested per day will be &gt;10mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparator:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control will be refined olive oil (ROO). Participants will ingest two tablespoons of ROO&#xD;
      during the day: one spoon containing 10g of ROO at lunch and one at dinner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cointerventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may be receiving any drug for anemia, bone disease, nutrition and other including&#xD;
      dietary advice towards a Mediterranean dietary pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may be on either chronic HD or hemodiafiltration (HDF). All treatments will be high&#xD;
      flux.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CASE REPORT FORM This includes demographic findings and laboratory data at each time visit&#xD;
      during the follow-up. Moreover, inclusion and exclusion criteria will be present at&#xD;
      randomization time Daily food and individual quantities will be recorded on 'ad hoc' designed&#xD;
      case report form. The intake of food will be analyzed and converted into nutrients using the&#xD;
      useful software Medisystems (Anthropometric variable -weight) will be measured during the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity will be evaluated by the Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity&#xD;
      Questionnaire. No restriction of physical activity will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a centrally randomized trial with blinding of participants, investigators&#xD;
      and outcome assessors, based on the intention to treat principle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Organizational aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted by the Schena Foundation in collaboration with the Renal Unit at&#xD;
      Policlinic,University of Bari, and the MED&amp;FOOD spin-off of the University of Bari.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up duration will be 12 weeks. Clinical visit and laboratory control will be done every&#xD;
      4 weeks for 3 consecutive months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed centrally at the Schena Foundation, with appropriate&#xD;
      stratification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size is opportunistic. The investigators will recruit a total of 24 individuals of&#xD;
      whom 12 will receive EVOOC and 12 will receive ROO, based on the pilot nature of this study.&#xD;
      There are, therefore, no formal sample size calculations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW- UP Dietary and clinical monitoring will be done by nephrologists, cardiologists and&#xD;
      dieticians. Participants in both groups will receive dietary counseling. The counseling will&#xD;
      be accompanied by written information with detailed description of typical ingested foods and&#xD;
      the use of specific questionnaires: 1) the 14-items for the adherence to the Mediterranean&#xD;
      diet; 2) the 137-items for the food frequency; 3) the Minnesota questionnaire for the&#xD;
      physical activity; 4) the short-form-36 for the quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CARDIOLOGY INVESTIGATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intima-media thickness study will be done by the measurement of the carotid-wall&#xD;
           intima-media thickness (cIMT). Echo-measurements will be made in three zones: (a)&#xD;
           proximal zone: about 2 cm before the flow-divider; (b) distal zone: about ½ cm before&#xD;
           the flow-divider; (c) middle zone. These data will be used to obtain the arithmetical&#xD;
           mean cIMT value.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brachial artery reactivity study will be carried out by the ultrasonographic assessment&#xD;
           of endothelial dependent flow-mediated vasodilation of the brachial artery. ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24 hours ECG Holter monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2D Color Doppler Echocardiography Cardiological investigations will be held during the&#xD;
           long intradialytic period except for the ECG Holter monitoring that will be done at&#xD;
           least one hour before and four hours after dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cardiovascular event onset&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  composite outcome: myocardial infarction, revascularization, ischemic stroke, peripheral&#xD;
           artery disease, cardiovascular death&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood concentration of LDL and HDL cholesterol, total cholesterol,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood pressure METHODS Blood samples will be drown in the morning after 12 hours of&#xD;
           fasting. Urine sample will be collected from the first spot morning micturition in&#xD;
           presence of residual diuresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine sample will be collected at the randomization visit and at each intervention&#xD;
      period (every 4 weeks for a total of 3 months) after the short interval between two dialysis&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be collected for the genome study. Serum&#xD;
      samples will be collected for the measurement of pro-inflammatory (IL-1b, IL-6, TNFa) and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory (IL4, IL-10) cytokines and CRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few ml of urine will be collected for tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol determinations by&#xD;
      mass-spectrometry. In addition, other metabolites will be measured by nuclear magnetic&#xD;
      resonance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxidative stress evaluation. The investigators will evaluate at T0 and after 12 weeks ROS&#xD;
      serum concentrations by spectrophotometric method using commercially available kit (dROMs&#xD;
      Test Diacron). The investigators will also assess the measurement of serum 8-oxodG, a marker&#xD;
      of oxidative DNA damage by ELISA (Trevigen). The investigators will identify the nature of&#xD;
      ROS generated in PBMCs by the peroxide-sensitive fluorescent probe&#xD;
      2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescin diacetate (DCFH, Molecular Probes). Kinetic measurements of&#xD;
      mitochondrial ROS generation will be evaluated by measuring the linear fluorescence increase&#xD;
      caused by the H2O2-dependent oxidation of DCFH. NADPH-dependent superoxide generation will be&#xD;
      measured by lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence methods in PBMCs isolated from HD patients.&#xD;
      In parallel, the investigators will prepare RIPA lysates of the PBMCs and evaluate the&#xD;
      expression of the various NADPH oxidase subunits by Western blot analysis. The antibodies for&#xD;
      gp91phox/Nox2 or Rac1 antibodies will be furnished by Upstate/Millipore; p22phox, p47phox or&#xD;
      p67phox will be purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. Additionally, the activity of the&#xD;
      small GTPase Rac will be evaluated by affinity precipitation using the p21-activated kinase&#xD;
      (PAK-1) binding domain linked to glutathione S-transferase (GST-PAK-1-PBD) on&#xD;
      glutathione-agarose beads (Millipore/Upstate Biotech.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Normality of variable distribution will be assessed by analysis of&#xD;
      skewness and kurtosis. One-factor ANOVA and Kruskall-Wallis test will be used to analyze the&#xD;
      differences among the two groups (case-control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general linear model for repeated measurements will be used with multiple paired&#xD;
      comparisons in order to assess differences between the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linearity of values across refined OO and EVOO will be determined for testing the&#xD;
      dose-response effect of biophenolic compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and power calculations are not applicable given the pilot nature of the study&#xD;
      with recruitment of an opportunistic sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary statistical analysis: All analyses will be carried out on an intention-to-treat&#xD;
      basis. Statistical significance will be defined as p&lt;0.05 for a two-sided test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHARACTERISTICS OF EVOOC AND ROO EVOOC: This olive oil is obtained by Coratina cultivar trees&#xD;
      that are DNA certificated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ROO: This olive oil used as placebo is a mixture of refined OO. Fatty acid composition and&#xD;
      polyphenol content have been determined by gas chromatography and HPLC, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polyphenols are undetectable in ROO. The characteristics of EVOOC and ROO (nutraceutic label)&#xD;
      are enclosed in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OOs will be provided by the MED&amp;FOOD spin-off, University of Bari.&#xD;
