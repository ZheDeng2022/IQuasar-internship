    <textblock>
      Lymph node assessment provides the crucial information about the prognosis of cervical&#xD;
      cancer. Sentinel lymph node stands in the first station on the lymph node metastasis&#xD;
      pathways. While traditional systemically lymph node resection would bring a lot of&#xD;
      complications, sentinel node mapping and biopsy is a feasible way with less damage to&#xD;
      evaluate whether lymph node metastasis occurs in early cervical cancer patients, due to less&#xD;
      lymph nodes resected. However, the process of this technology isn't well established. The&#xD;
      investigators intend to conduct a prospective and multicentric study to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of different mapping methods to achieve a reliable lymph node assessment. Early&#xD;
      cervical cancer patients in each center will be recruited in the investigators' study with&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. After the patients signing the informed consent form, the&#xD;
      surgery process will be performed, including sentinel lymph node mapping with Carbon&#xD;
      Nanoparticles (CNP) or CNP combining Indocyanine Green(ICG),&#xD;
      extra-fascial/sub-extensive/extensive hysterectomy, pelvic with or without para-aortic lymph&#xD;
      node resection, sequentially. All resected nodes will be pathologically exanimated. Then the&#xD;
      data obtained will be analyzed and discussed deeply and finally lead to a conclusion.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Quality Control The investigators' quality assurance plan is as follows： A. Once the plan has&#xD;
      been approved, it cannot be modified at will. If special circumstances such as difficulty in&#xD;
      implementation are found after the start of the study, the proposal may be revised or&#xD;
      supplemented by the discussion of the research group and the project leader, and the revised&#xD;
      content shall be recorded in writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program change process is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the problems and understand the necessary to change the plan;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Convene the main members of the research team and the project leader to discuss and&#xD;
           propose solutions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Revise the plan and update the version number, fill out the &quot;Program Description&quot;;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The revised plan and the &quot;Revision of the Plan&quot; need to be signed by the person in&#xD;
           charge of the project. If necessary, they must be submitted to the ethics committee for&#xD;
           approval or filing; if approved, the revised plan can be implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. In order to ensure that the research personnel have sufficient qualifications to undertake&#xD;
      specific research work, the research personnel should at least complete the following&#xD;
      training before the project starts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research object protection and ethical requirements;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study protocols and related standard operating procedures (tracer injection methods, use&#xD;
           of near-infrared fluorescent vascular imagers, and pathology);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Case Report Form and gauge filling instructions (form entry criteria, surgical record&#xD;
           methods, etc.);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical research project implementation considerations (such as research object&#xD;
           screening, enrollment, data collection process); Project-related training should be&#xD;
           carried out throughout the research process. The project leader and project coordinator&#xD;
           can increase the training content according to the situation, such as training on weak&#xD;
           links in the test, training on updating programs and various causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management A. Case report form design The researcher is responsible for drafting the&#xD;
      research case report form. B. Data Entry and Data Verification According to the final version&#xD;
      of CRF, the project database is built using software. The data entry and verification is&#xD;
      carried out by a dedicated person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis A. Statistical Analysis Plan and Statistical Software After the trial&#xD;
      protocol is determined, the statistical professors and the main investigators are responsible&#xD;
      for developing a statistical analysis plan. The statistical analysis software uses SAS® 9.2&#xD;
      software (software installation point authorization number: 11202165).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Calculation and reasoning of sample size The sample size is calculated using PASS11&#xD;
      software; the sample size is estimated based on the negative prediction value of the previous&#xD;
      study, and the negative prediction value of SLNs is expected to be 90%; the allowable error&#xD;
      is 2% (the range of the confidence interval is 88% to 92%). When the significant level is&#xD;
      0.05, 914 cases are needed to be studied. Considering the detection rate of 80% of SLNs, a&#xD;
      total of 1143 cases are expected to be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Statistical Analysis Methods General principle Using a two-sided test, a P value of less&#xD;
      than 0.05 would be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quantitative indicators will calculate the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum,&#xD;
      maximum, lower quartile (Q1), upper quartile (Q3), and the classification indicators will&#xD;
      describe the number of cases and percentages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of clinicopathological features (age, body mass index, pathological type, tumor&#xD;
      stage, grading, maximum tumor diameter, invasive myometrial depth, lymphatic vascular&#xD;
      infiltration, and tracer method) for SLNs and undetected SLNs will be based on the type of&#xD;
      indicator. For the comparison of quantitative data between groups, the t-test or Wilcoxon&#xD;
      rank sum test will be used according to the data distribution. For the comparison of&#xD;
      categorical data between groups, the data will be analyzed by chi-square test or exact&#xD;
      probability method (if the chi-square test is not applicable). And the grade data was&#xD;
      analyzed by Wilcoxon rank sum test or CMH test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical diagnostic index calculation According to the true positive (TP), false negative&#xD;
      (FN), true negative (TN), and false positive (FP), the results of SLNs pathological&#xD;
      examination and all lymph node pathological examination results will be compared. The&#xD;
      comparison results will be plotted as a four-grid table to calculate sensitivity, false&#xD;
      negative rate, and negative predictive value, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chi-square test or exact probability method (if the chi-square test is not applicable) will&#xD;
      be used to compare the clinical diagnosis value of SLNs biopsy of endometrial cancer patients&#xD;
      with injection of carbon nanoparticles (CNP) or combined injection of CNP and indocyanine&#xD;
      green(ICG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chi-square test or exact probability method (if the chi-square test is not applicable) will&#xD;
      be used to analyze the clinic-pathological factors affecting the detection rate of SLNs.&#xD;
