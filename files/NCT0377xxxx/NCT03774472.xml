    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of hydroxychloroquine when given&#xD;
      together with palbociclib and letrozole before surgery in treating patients with estrogen&#xD;
      receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer. Hydroxychloroquine is a substance that&#xD;
      decreases immune responses in the body. Palbociclib may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast&#xD;
      cancer cells. Drugs, such as letrozole, may lessen the amount of estrogen made by the body.&#xD;
      Giving hydroxychloroquine, palbociclib, and letrozole before surgery may work better than&#xD;
      palbociclib and letrozole in treating patients with breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety of adding hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) to continuous low dose&#xD;
      palbociclib and letrozole and to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for the subsequent Phase II study. (Phase I) II. To determine the&#xD;
      dose responsiveness of 2 dose levels (400 mg and recommended phase II dose [RP2D]) of&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine added to low dose palbociclib and letrozole on pre and post HCQ breast&#xD;
      tumor proliferation index (Ki67), autophagy, senescence and cell cycle control. (Phase II,&#xD;
      Part I) III. To determine whether hydroxychloroquine added to low dose palbociclib and&#xD;
      letrozole can increase the proportion of patients whose tumors achieve complete cell cycle&#xD;
      arrest (CCCA, defined as the Ki67 =&lt; 2.7%) comparing T2 to T1. (Phase II, Part II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the response rate and clinical benefit rate at 8 weeks of the assigned dose&#xD;
      of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) plus continuous low dose palbociclib and letrozole. (Phase I) II.&#xD;
      Determine longer term clinical tumor responsiveness (tumor volume) and tumor biomarker&#xD;
      indices (for patients who have extended pre-operative therapy, maximum 24 weeks). (Phase II,&#xD;
      Part I) III. Perform exploratory studies on blood-based tumor protein, deoxyribonucleic acid&#xD;
      (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) biomarkers with a focus on pathways of cell proliferation,&#xD;
      autophagy, senescence and cell cycle control. (Phase II, Part I) IV. To determine the impact&#xD;
      of adding hydroxychloroquine to low dose palbociclib and letrozole on breast tumor indices of&#xD;
      proliferation, autophagy, senescence, cell cycle control and other intersecting pathways.&#xD;
      (Phase II, Part II) V. Determine longer term clinical tumor responsiveness and tumor&#xD;
      biomarkers indices (for patients who have extended pre-operative therapy, maximum 24 weeks).&#xD;
      (Phase II, Part II) VI. To determine the dose responsiveness of HCQ (400 mg vs. RP2D) on the&#xD;
      primary (proportion with CCCA) and secondary clinical/biological endpoints. (Phase II, Part&#xD;
      II) VII. To perform exploratory studies on blood-based tumor protein, DNA and RNA biomarkers.&#xD;
      (Phase II, Part II) VIII. Obtain additional safety information for the combination of low&#xD;
      dose palbociclib, letrozole and hydroxychloroquine. (Phase II, Part II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of hydroxychloroquine followed by a phase&#xD;
      II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE I: Patients with advanced, metastatic (stage IV) breast cancer receive&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine orally (PO) once daily (QD), palbociclib PO QD, and letrozole PO QD on&#xD;
      days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE II: Patients with early stage (stage I-III) breast cancer receive hydroxychloroquine PO&#xD;
      QD on days 15-28 of cycle 1 and on days 1-28 of subsequent cycles. Patients also receive&#xD;
      palbociclib PO QD, and letrozole PO QD on days 1-28, followed by standard of care surgery at&#xD;
      week 5. If there is a proliferative benefit with complete cell cycle arrest (CCCA) by biopsy&#xD;
      at 4 weeks, cycles may repeat every 28 days for up to 20-24 weeks in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity, followed by standard of care surgery during weeks&#xD;
      20-24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days or every 4&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
