    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the effects of different methods of&#xD;
      broccoli preparation on levels of urinary glucosinolate metabolites. The secondary objective&#xD;
      is to determine the effects of different methods of broccoli preparation on levels of plasma&#xD;
      carotenoids.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Consumption of Brassica vegetables (which include broccoli, cabbage, and kale) is inversely&#xD;
      associated with the incidence of several cancers, including cancers of the lung, stomach,&#xD;
      liver, colon, rectum, breast, endometrium, and ovaries. Brassica vegetables are a good source&#xD;
      of many nutrients including glucosinolates and carotenoids. Glucosinolates are&#xD;
      sulfur-containing compounds that are converted to bioactive metabolites by an enzyme called&#xD;
      myrosinase, which is released when the vesicles containing myrosinase are ruptured by chewing&#xD;
      or cutting. These bioactive compounds are considered to be active agents for cancer&#xD;
      prevention. Their ability to reduce risk of cancer may derive in part from their ability to&#xD;
      modulate foreign-substance metabolizing enzymes, which include enzymes called Phase I&#xD;
      cytochrome P450s and Phase II enzymes. Carotenoids may also have a role in cancer prevention&#xD;
      and other health benefits including reducing age-related macular degeneration, and therefore&#xD;
      merit research to reveal factors that affect their presence in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate how various preparations of broccoli impact&#xD;
      levels of these healthful nutrients in humans.&#xD;
