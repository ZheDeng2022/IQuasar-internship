      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: Cohort 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        The study eye must meet all inclusion criteria. If both eyes meet the inclusion criteria,&#xD;
        the eye with the worst normal luminance best-corrected visual acuity (NL-BCVA) at the&#xD;
        screening visit will be designated as the study eye. If both eyes have the same visual&#xD;
        acuity, the eye with the larger GA lesion will be selected as the study eye. If both eyes&#xD;
        have the same GA lesion size, the right eye will be selected as the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ocular- specific inclusion criteria apply to the study eye only, unless otherwise&#xD;
        specified.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age ≥ 60 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Normal Luminance best corrected visual acuity of between 35 and 5 letters using Early&#xD;
             Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) charts (approximately between 20/200 and&#xD;
             20/800 Snellen equivalent).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Clinical diagnosis of GA of the macula secondary to AMD as determined by the&#xD;
             Investigator and confirmed by the Reading Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The GA lesion must meet the following criteria as determined by the central reading&#xD;
             center's assessment of Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF) imaging at screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Total GA area must be ≥ 2.5 (1 disk areas [DA]).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. If GA is multifocal, at least one focal lesion must be ≥ 1.25 mm2 (0.5 DA), with&#xD;
                  the overall aggregate area of GA as specified above in 4a.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Adequate clarity of ocular media, adequate pupillary dilation, and fixation to permit&#xD;
             the collection of good quality images as determined by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Female subjects must be:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Women of non-child-bearing potential (WONCBP), or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) with a negative serum pregnancy test at&#xD;
                  screening and must agree to use protocol defined methods of contraception for the&#xD;
                  duration of the study and refrain from breastfeeding for the duration of the&#xD;
                  study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Males with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use protocol&#xD;
             defined methods of contraception and agree to refrain from donating sperm for the&#xD;
             duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Willing and able to give informed consent and to comply with the study procedures and&#xD;
             assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria: Cohort 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ocular specific exclusion criteria apply to the study eye only, unless otherwise specified.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. GA secondary to a condition other than AMD such as Stargardt disease, cone rod&#xD;
             dystrophy or toxic maculopathies like plaquenil maculopathy in either eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Spherical equivalent of the refractive error demonstrating &gt; 6 diopters of myopia or&#xD;
             an axial length &gt;26 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any history or active choroidal neovascularization (CNV), associated with AMD or any&#xD;
             other cause, including any evidence of retinal pigment epithelium rips or evidence of&#xD;
             neovascularization anywhere based on SD-OCT imaging and/or fluorescein angiography as&#xD;
             assessed by the Reading Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Presence of an active ocular disease that in the opinion of the Investigator&#xD;
             compromises or confounds visual function, including but not limited to, uveitis, other&#xD;
             macular diseases (e.g. clinically significant epiretinal membrane [ERM], full&#xD;
             thickness macular hole) or uncontrolled glaucoma/ocular hypertension). Benign&#xD;
             conditions in the opinion of the Investigator such as peripheral retina dystrophy are&#xD;
             not exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Intraocular surgery (including lens replacement surgery) within 3 months prior to&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. History of intraocular injection within 3 months prior to the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Aphakia or absence of the posterior capsule. Note: Yttrium-Aluminum Garnet YAG laser&#xD;
             posterior capsulotomy for posterior capsule opacification done at least 60 days prior&#xD;
             to screening is not exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Any ocular condition other than GA secondary to AMD that may require surgery or&#xD;
             medical intervention during the study period or, in the opinion of the Investigator,&#xD;
             could compromise visual function during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Any contraindication to IVT injection including current ocular or periocular&#xD;
             infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Participation in any systemic experimental treatment or any other systemic&#xD;
             investigational new drug including within 6 weeks or 5 half-lives of the active&#xD;
             ingredient (whichever is longer) prior to the start of study treatment. Note: clinical&#xD;
             trials solely involving observation, over-the-counter vitamins, supplements, or diets&#xD;
             are not exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Medical or psychiatric conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator, make&#xD;
             consistent follow-up over the 60-month treatment period unlikely, or would make the&#xD;
             subject an unsafe study candidate.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Any screening laboratory value (hematology, serum chemistry or urinalysis) that in the&#xD;
             opinion of the Investigator is clinically significant and not suitable for study&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Known hypersensitivity to fluorescein sodium for injection or hypersensitivity to&#xD;
             pegcetacoplan or any of the excipients in pegcetacoplan solution.&#xD;
