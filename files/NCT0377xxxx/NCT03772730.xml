  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of precision methods that quantify injury&#xD;
      and response to injury to predict how short-term clinical outcomes are affected by initial&#xD;
      and staged orthopaedic interventions in multiply injured patients (MIPs) who sustain major&#xD;
      orthopaedic trauma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is currently a knowledge gap regarding in the treatment of the severely injured MIP, as&#xD;
      clinicians are often challenged by when non-life threatening orthopaedic procedures should be&#xD;
      performed. Information to guide orthopaedic interventions in MIPs is based primarily on&#xD;
      resuscitation parameters and injury severity metrics.Lack of consensus among surgeons&#xD;
      regarding choices of orthopaedic interventions reflects the paucity of data to form treatment&#xD;
      decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will define the key parameters affecting these decisions in a quantitative manner&#xD;
      by exploring the efficacy of a precision medicine approach to guide surgical decisions in&#xD;
      multiply injured patients (MIPs) with skeletal trauma. According to the National Institutes&#xD;
      of Health (NIH),36 precision medicine is &quot;an emerging approach for disease treatment and&#xD;
      prevention that takes into account individual variability in genes, environment, and&#xD;
      lifestyle for each person.&quot; This approach will allow clinicians and researchers to predict&#xD;
      more accurately which treatment and prevention strategies for a particular disease will work&#xD;
      in which groups of people. The application of precision medicine will bring to bear&#xD;
      evidence-based tools that can guide decisions facing the treating surgeons regarding the&#xD;
      optimal timing of definitive fracture surgery after injury, as well as defining the magnitude&#xD;
      of surgical intervention which may be pursued without engendering clinical complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Define groups of patients based on Precision Injury Signatures (mechanical&#xD;
      and ischemic injury characteristics and immunologic response profile) that correspond to the&#xD;
      following short term clinical outcomes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Multiple organ dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Nosocomial infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Wound complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Resource utilization (ICU/hospital LOS, days on mechanical ventilation, discharge&#xD;
           disposition)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Death&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Patients who develop complicated short term outcomes will demonstrate distinct&#xD;
      Precision Injury Signatures compared to patients who have uncomplicated outcomes for injuries&#xD;
      of similar magnitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of timing and magnitude of orthopaedic surgical&#xD;
      interventions on progression of patient-specific physiologic and immunologic response.&#xD;
      Describe changes in physiologic and immunologic response after initial and staged orthopaedic&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Immunologic and physiologic response to surgery will be a function of initial&#xD;
      Precision Injury Signature and timing/magnitude of orthopaedic surgical interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To develop surgical decision rules related to timing of definitive&#xD;
      orthopaedic intervention that optimize short term clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3a: Initial Precision Injury Signatures can be used to identify orthopaedic trauma&#xD;
      patients who are best treated with early definitive treatment or staged definitive&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3b: Progression of Precision Injury Signatures can be used to determine optimal&#xD;
      timing and choices of definitive orthopaedic interventions.&#xD;
