    <textblock>
      The study group received antipsychotic drugs combined with Computerized Cognitive Remediation&#xD;
      Therapy (CCRT) for 4 times/week for 45 minutes each time. The control group only received&#xD;
      antipsychotic drugs. For a total of 12 weeks. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and&#xD;
      Tropomyosin-related kinase B (Trk B) genes in peripheral blood were detected in both groups&#xD;
      before and after treatment. Clinical symptoms and executive function assessment were&#xD;
      performed in both groups before and after treatment. The relevance of genes and their effects&#xD;
      on downstream protein expression levels led to a molecular genetic mechanism for the efficacy&#xD;
      of Computerized Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CCRT) .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among the cognitive disorders of chronic schizophrenia, the most reported is the executive&#xD;
      dysfunction of the prefrontal lobe. There is increasing evidence that Computerized Cognitive&#xD;
      Remediation Therapy (CCRT) has a significant improvement in the implementation of&#xD;
      schizophrenia, but the specific mechanism is unknown. Therefore, this study plans to select&#xD;
      154 patients with chronic schizophrenia who were hospitalized for a long time. They were&#xD;
      randomly divided into two groups. The study group received antipsychotic drugs combined with&#xD;
      Computerized Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CCRT) for 4 times/week for 45 minutes each time.&#xD;
      The control group only received antipsychotic drugs. For a total of 12 weeks. brain-derived&#xD;
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tyrosine receptor kinase B(TRK-B) genes in peripheral blood&#xD;
      were detected in both groups before and after treatment. Clinical symptoms and executive&#xD;
      function assessment were performed in both groups before and after treatment. The relevance&#xD;
      of genes and their effects on downstream protein expression levels led to a molecular genetic&#xD;
      mechanism for the efficacy of Computerized Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CCRT).&#xD;
