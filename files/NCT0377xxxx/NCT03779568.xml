  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal anesthesia is one of the preferred anesthetic techniques for post-partum bilateral&#xD;
      tubal ligation (PBTL). Bupivacaine is the most commonly used local anesthetic for neuraxial&#xD;
      anesthesia for post-partum tubal ligation. Typically, hyperbaric bupivacaine would be&#xD;
      injected into the spinal (intrathecal) space via a spinal needle; however, ongoing medication&#xD;
      shortages have resulted in limited availability on a local and national level. One proposed&#xD;
      alternative is isobaric bupivacaine; however, studies investigating its use for post-partum&#xD;
      bilateral tubal ligation are limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this prospective study is to determine the minimal effective dose (ED50 and&#xD;
      ED95) of isobaric bupivacaine for adequate anesthesia during post-partum tubal ligation after&#xD;
      vaginal delivery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This prospective study proposes to enroll 40 post-partum women who are undergoing elective&#xD;
      post-partum bilateral tubal ligation. The patient will be positioned sitting, and combined&#xD;
      spinal anesthesia will be performed at L2-3 or L3-4 level. The presence of an epidural&#xD;
      catheter enables the provider to supplement the spinal anesthetic if required. The starting&#xD;
      dose of isobaric bupivacaine will be 10 mg based on prior similar studies1,4 and our&#xD;
      institution's current practice. The dose of intrathecal isobaric bupivacaine was decided by&#xD;
      using the up-down sequential method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The motor block will be graded by a modified Bromage score: Score 1 = complete block, unable&#xD;
      to move feet or knees; 2 = almost complete block, able to move feet only; 3 = partial block,&#xD;
      just able to move knees; 4 = detectable weakness of hip flexion while supine, full flexion of&#xD;
      knees; 5 = no detectable weakness of hip flexion while supine; and 6 = able to perform&#xD;
      partial knee bend. The score of 1 or 2 within 10-15 minutes of injection will be evaluated as&#xD;
      successful motor block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The success of the sensory spinal block will be noted when bilateral T6 sensory level to&#xD;
      pinprick is attained after 10 mins from the intrathecal drug administration, this is in&#xD;
      accordance with previous studies1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If spinal anesthesia is inadequate, the epidural catheter will be dosed up for&#xD;
      supplementation. All observations, including block characteristics and the associated outcome&#xD;
      (i.e., adequate or inadequate block), will be evaluated by a dedicated anesthesia provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative adverse effects, such as hypotension, bradycardia, nausea, or vomiting,&#xD;
      pruritus, or shivering were noted. Hypotension is defined as a decrease of more than 20% in&#xD;
      basal systolic blood pressure within 30 minutes of intrathecal injection. The management of&#xD;
      blood pressure including dose of pressor: phenylephrine and ephedrine will be at the&#xD;
      discretion of the attending anesthesiologist. The use of pressor and anti-emetics will also&#xD;
      be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be take place in standard clinical context. The study does not deviate from&#xD;
      our current practice, which includes the use of combined spinal anesthesia where the epidural&#xD;
      catheter is available if supplemental local anesthetic is required.&#xD;
