      6-month, randomized, controlled investigation measuring the effect of increased clinical&#xD;
      contact and personalization compared to standard physician counseling on adherence to&#xD;
      consensus-based, brain health recommendations for patients with subjective cognitive decline,&#xD;
      mild cognitive impairment, and early dementia or patients who are at risk for developing&#xD;
      these conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 6-month, randomized, controlled investigation measuring the effect of increased&#xD;
      clinical contact and personalized recommendations from a health coach, compared to standard&#xD;
      physician counseling on adherence to consensus-based, brain health recommendations, including&#xD;
      80 patients with either subjective cognitive decline, MCI, or early dementia enrolled from a&#xD;
      hospital-based memory disorders clinic, or, with risk factors for dementia enrolled from a&#xD;
      hospital-based primary care clinic. Participants and caregivers in the health coach arm work&#xD;
      with a health coach within their respective practice, called the a &quot;brain health champion&quot;&#xD;
      (BHC), through weekly motivational phone calls every 6 weeks. In the encounters and visits,&#xD;
      BHCs and patients/caregivers work together to establish, update, and achieve personalized,&#xD;
      attainable lifestyle goals. Participants in the control arm receive standard counseling and&#xD;
      education from providers during routine clinic visits. Changes in physical activity, dietary&#xD;
      pattern, and social and cognitive activities are measured using questionnaires validated in&#xD;
      cognitively impaired and normal populations. Other outcomes include measures of quality of&#xD;
      life (QOL), cognitive function, neuropsychiatric status, sleep quality, and behavior.&#xD;
      Follow-up assessments are also completed at 6 months post-intervention, with some patients&#xD;
      receiving &quot;booster&quot; encounters to assess the maintenance of behaviors.&#xD;
