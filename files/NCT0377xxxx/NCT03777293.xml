    <textblock>
      The accuracy of ultrasound elastography for assessing liver fibrosis by measuring liver&#xD;
      stiffness (elastic modulus) is better than traditional method. Elastography has certain&#xD;
      advantage such as non-invasive, simple, real-time and it has been recommended by clinical&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, some chanllenging scientific problems showed up with further research and clinical&#xD;
      practice. Firstly, present elastography machines can only calculate liver stiffness from&#xD;
      shear wave speed or elastic modulus but ignore other physical characteristics such as tissue&#xD;
      viscosity. So far, present technique simply assume liver as an idealized model with isotropic&#xD;
      elasticity to assess liver fibrosis while liver is actually anisotropic and viscoelastic.&#xD;
      What's more, theoretically, there are not only different solid state structures such as cell&#xD;
      organization and vessel but also flowing liquid such as blood and bile. Thus, ignoring&#xD;
      viscosity and evaluating elasticity only is unreasonable. In the other hand, a number of&#xD;
      confounding factors have been found to influence liver stiffness measurement by elastography.&#xD;
      Different pathological chang of liver including inflammation, necrosis, cholestasis and&#xD;
      inhomogeneity among the individuals such as obesity, ascites, et,al. will decrease the&#xD;
      accuracy of liver stiffness measurement and liver fibrosis staging by elastography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact, liver fibrosis is a dynamic process. Liver fibrosis is a reaction of compensation&#xD;
      and repair for inflammation and necrosis as well as a contributing factor for liver damage.&#xD;
      This dynamic process constitutes the common characteristic of chronic liver disease and&#xD;
      result in the complicated biological mechanical characteristics of liver. In consequence, how&#xD;
      to measure liver viscosity and elasticity respectively, and to evaluate liver fibrosis stage&#xD;
      and Inflammation degree accurately during the complicated and dynamic pathological process is&#xD;
      the key scientific problem demanding solution, which is also the urgent requirement of&#xD;
      related fundamental research and clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this project plan to apply LOGIQ E viscoelastography machine as research tool, rat&#xD;
      liver fibrosis model and rat liver failure model as research object to investigate the&#xD;
      correlation between liver viscoelastography measurement and liver fibrosis stage and&#xD;
      Inflammation degree. The investigators also aim to assess the feasibility of using&#xD;
      ulstrasound viscoelastography to evaluate liver fibrosis stage and Inflammation degree&#xD;
      dynamically.&#xD;
