  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well umbralisib and pembrolizumab work in treating patients&#xD;
      with classical Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to&#xD;
      treatment (refractory). Umbralisib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of&#xD;
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with&#xD;
      the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Giving umbralisib and pembrolizumab may work&#xD;
      better in treating classical Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 for up to 16 cycles in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive umbralisib&#xD;
      orally (PO) daily on days 1-21 days. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days, then up to 1 year.&#xD;

             unless approved by the protocol principal investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an active autoimmune disorder (with the exception of autoimmune&#xD;
             hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura [ITP] or vitiligo)&#xD;
