      This is a study for evaluating enzalutamide pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and&#xD;
      related changes after drug switch in Chinese patients with metastatic castration-resistant&#xD;
      prostate cancer. The study primary objective is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      characteristics of enzalutamide in Chinese patients with mCRPC.&#xD;
