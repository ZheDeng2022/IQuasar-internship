  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of SM-88, a combination metabolic cancer&#xD;
      treatment, in two study cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinically advanced Ewing's Sarcoma patients who have not progressed at the conclusion&#xD;
           of systemic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinically advanced sarcoma patients in the salvage treatment setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 24 efficacy evaluable patients (up to 12 per cohort) will be enrolled. Study patients&#xD;
      will receive oral SM-88, with scheduled safety and efficacy evaluations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, open-label, two stage, pilot phase 2 trial evaluates the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of SM-88 in two cohorts of patients: 1) as maintenance therapy following standard&#xD;
      primary or palliative treatments for Ewing's sarcoma patients with high risk of relapse or&#xD;
      disease progression; and 2) as salvage therapy for patients with clinically advanced&#xD;
      sarcomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of SM-88, a combination metabolic cancer&#xD;
      treatment, measured as positive efficacy events, including overall response, maintaining&#xD;
      stable disease for ≥ 3 months, or progression free survival at least 1.5 times longer than&#xD;
      the last prior line of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will receive daily oral treatment with SM-88, which consists of&#xD;
      D,L-alpha-metyrosine, used with methoxsalen, phenytoin, and sirolimus in continuous treatment&#xD;
      cycles of 28 days. Treatment will continue until: 1) Symptomatic, clinical progression with&#xD;
      radiographic progressive disease; 2) 48 weeks after documented complete response; or 3)&#xD;
      evidence of unacceptable toxicity, or other decision to discontinue treatment&#xD;
