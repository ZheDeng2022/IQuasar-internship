  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Antisynthetase syndrome (ASS) is one of the most severe inflammatory myopathy (IM), due to&#xD;
      pulmonary involvement (interstitial lung disease, ILD). Until now, the most commonly used&#xD;
      immunosuppresive therapy in Europe is Cyclophosphamide followed by different&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drugs as maintenance therapy, including Azathioprine (and so called &quot;&#xD;
      European Strategy &quot;). In the USA however, the first-line immunosuppressive treatment is&#xD;
      Tacrolimus (so called &quot; American Strategy &quot;). None of these two different strategies has ever&#xD;
      been studied prospectively, and there is no clear comparison of short and long-term treatment&#xD;
      efficacy and tolerance. Thus, there are yet no evidences helping the clinicians in the&#xD;
      therapeutic management of patients with ASS-related ILD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is therefore to compare both strategies as first line treatments or in&#xD;
      relapsing patients : CATR.PAT study is a 52 weeks, randomized, comparative, controlled,&#xD;
      open-labeled, phase III, therapeutic clinical trial, comparing two treatment strategies.&quot;&#xD;

      &quot;During the study period, according to randomization into two groups (n=38 patients,&#xD;
      respectively), patients will receive either:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Group 1 &amp; 2 : 3 IV pulses of Methylprednisolone (7.5 mg/kg/day followed by tapering doses&#xD;
      of oral Prednisone, started at 1 mg/kg/day from D4 to M12&#xD;
&#xD;
      In association with :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 : European Standard of care :&#xD;
&#xD;
           6 IV pulses of Cyclophosphamide (1000 mg) followed from M5 to M12 by oral Azathioprine&#xD;
           (2 mg/kg/day), with a maximum of 150 mg/d)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 : American Strategy Tacrolimus is given orally from M0 to M12 (started at the&#xD;
           initial dose of 2x2mg/d). Tacrolimus doses are regularly adapted to its serum&#xD;
           concentration to reach 5-15 ng/ml.&quot;&#xD;
