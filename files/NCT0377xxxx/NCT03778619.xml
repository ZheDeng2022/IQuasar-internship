      This trial will consist of 3 parts; Phase 1 Maximum Tolerated Dose, Phase 1 extended cohort&#xD;
      and Phase 2a.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Phase 1, those who have a confirmed diagnosis of relapsed/refractory Non-Hodgkin's&#xD;
      Lymphoma (NHL) of B-cell Origin of any subtype will be considered eligible for enrolment.&#xD;
      Each cycle last approximately 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the dose of MG4101 is determined from Phase 1, Phase 2a will commence whereby two&#xD;
      subgroups of patients will be enrolled and will similarly receive up to 6 cycles of treatment&#xD;
      with the recommended Phase 2a dose of MG4101. The 2 subgroups are patients with indolent and&#xD;
      aggressive NHL of B-cell origin respectively.&#xD;
