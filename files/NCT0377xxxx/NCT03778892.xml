      A randomized controlled clinical trial looking at the effect of use of a mobile phone&#xD;
      application in addition to standard care compared to standard care alone at a youth-friendly&#xD;
      clinic in young men who have sex with men and transgender women aged between 15-19 years at&#xD;
      risk of HIV on PrEP adherence.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study PrEP adherence in adolescent MSM who are at high risk of HIV acquisition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Rates of HIV infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sexual risk taking behaviours In adolescent MSM who are at high risk of HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The investigators hypothesize that youth-focused interventions will produce superior&#xD;
           adherence to PrEP from 50% with standard interventions to 70% with youth focused&#xD;
           interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The investigators hypothesize that adherence to PrEP varies by the level of risk&#xD;
           behavior one perceives. Participants who take higher risk behaviors will be more likely&#xD;
           to adhere to PrEP than participants who have lower risk behaviors. STIs are expected to&#xD;
           be more common among participants with higher levels of adherence if they are&#xD;
           participants who have higher risk behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomised control trial, behavioural intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study population Volunteers aged 15 to under 20 years at high risk of HIV infection&#xD;
           receiving PrEP under the 'Princess PrEP' project&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adolescent men who have sex with men&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At high risk of HIV infection (have at least one of the following)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  More than 1 sexual partner in the last 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Irregular condom use during sexual intercourse&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  HIV positive sexual partner&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Age 15 to under 20 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A desire to take PrEP to prevent HIV infection&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Tested HIV negative within 1 month of enrolment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Able to provide written consent or assent to take part in the clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Exclusion criteria Signs or symptoms of acute retroviral syndrome that cannot be&#xD;
           confirmed to be due to alternate causes, including unremitting fevers, headaches,&#xD;
           myalgia, fatigue, and lymphadenopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Eligible persons presenting to the Thai Red Cross Anonymous Clinic (TRCARC) or its&#xD;
                affiliated community based organizations (Rainbow Sky Association Thailand (RSAT)&#xD;
                Ramkamhaeng, Sex Workers in Action Group (SWING) Bangkok will be asked by&#xD;
                counsellors on their interest to join the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Number of participants to be studied: 200&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Informed consent process/ informed assent The research doctor will explain to potential&#xD;
           participants about the purposes of the study and allow them to ask any questions they&#xD;
           may have on it, and will be given time to make their decision. If a participant chooses&#xD;
           to join the study, they will be asked for their written consent/assent and a copy of the&#xD;
           informed consent/assent form given to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants aged between 15 and 18 will be asked for assent. As this is a study on&#xD;
                sexual health where disease prevention is of utmost concern, parental consent will&#xD;
                not be asked for.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants aged 18 to 19 will be asked for consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Study procedure After informed consent or assent, all youth will commence once daily&#xD;
           TFV/FTC 200/300mg. Volunteers will be randomized into arms 1 (standard intervention) or&#xD;
           2 (novel intervention strategy). Both groups will receive youth-focused counselling by&#xD;
           trained counsellors and have access to an adolescent-friendly sexual health promotion&#xD;
           website and social media page where they can get in contact with counsellors, doctors,&#xD;
           fellow adolescents and function as a platform through which they can learn about good&#xD;
           sexual health practices. Adolescents in arm 2 (novel intervention strategy) will also&#xD;
           receive access to a mobile phone application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Youth-focused counselling Counsellors will provide counselling that is friendly,&#xD;
      non-judgmental and utilize motivational interviewing techniques where sessions are more&#xD;
      collaborative rather than didactic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobile Phone Application&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Password protection will ensure user privacy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Will allow users to input weekly data on their:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sexual risk e.g. no sexual activity, sex with condoms, sex without condoms&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  PrEP use e.g. whether or not participants take their PrEP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The application will calculate a percentage of protection users have based on their data&#xD;
           entry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Points can be accumulated for application use, data input to the application, for&#xD;
           attending appointments and also for normal STI and HIV screening results. Points can be&#xD;
           redeemed for cash&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The overall goal of the application is to increase participant awareness of self-risk&#xD;
           and motivation to protect themselves against HIV and STI infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed up at months 1, 3 and 6. At each visit, participants will&#xD;
      complete a questionnaire on drug adherence and sexual health risk behaviours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STI testing will be done as an indirect marker of condom use at visits 1 and 6. This will&#xD;
      involve blood testing for syphilis serology and nucleic acid amplification testing for&#xD;
      gonorrhea, and chlamydia on swab samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV testing will be done at all visits. TFV-DP DBS will be done at months 1, 3 and 6 to look&#xD;
      at correlation of self-reported and actual measured PrEP compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug Concentrations will be measured using the TFV-DP DBS at the Program for HIV Prevention&#xD;
      and Treatment (PHPT), Chiang Mai. TFV-DP DBS levels â‰¥ 700 fmol/punch will be taken as&#xD;
      adherence&#xD;
