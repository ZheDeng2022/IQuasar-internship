  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this registry is to correlate the amount of fibrosis as documented&#xD;
      on Electrocardiogram (ECG) gated Computed Tomography (CT) scans with ease of advancing&#xD;
      sheaths over the leads through the SVC zone during lead extraction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective, observational registry study which plans to enroll&#xD;
      approximately 200 patients referred for Cardiac Implantable Electronic Device(CIED) lead&#xD;
      extraction at one of the five study centers. The objective of this study is to determine&#xD;
      whether a correlation exists between fibrosis detected on ECG gated cardiac CT and the ease&#xD;
      of lead extraction as measured by need for extraction energy. All patients will be followed&#xD;
      for 30 days post-lead extraction to assess vital status and re-hospitalizations via phone&#xD;
      call&#xD;
