      De-rotation Breathing Exercises are the group of spinal extension, lateral spinal flexion and&#xD;
      rotational exercises performed in synchrony with deep breathing. Exercises are performed in a&#xD;
      sitting position with feet firmly placed on the ground. The therapist will stand behind the&#xD;
      patient with a medicine ball or a small Swiss ball for the patient to receive while the&#xD;
      patient rotates and laterally bend the trunk towards the convexity of scoliosis curvature.&#xD;
      The patient is instructed to breathe in deeply during lateral bend and rotation in order to&#xD;
      maximally expand the chest wall. Expiration involves relaxation while returning to the&#xD;
      neutral position. Later, patients are instructed to extend their back along with former&#xD;
      maneuver. The backrest of the chair is adjustable and aligned with the apex of thoracic&#xD;
      curvatures. Side flexion and rotation towards the convexity of the scoliotic curvature is to&#xD;
      correct scoliosis and to increase the chest wall compliance and extension of spinal is used&#xD;
      to correct the kyphosis of the spine with an intention to also increase chest wall&#xD;
      compliance.&#xD;

      Kyphoscoliosis (KS) is the dual spinal deformity characterized by exaggerated thoracic&#xD;
      kyphosis and lateral displacement of the spine in the frontal plane. Scoliosis is often&#xD;
      associated with vertebral rotation. Scoliosis is the term used by Hippocrates, which means&#xD;
      &quot;crooked&quot;. Depending on the presence of lateral displacement scoliosis is classified into&#xD;
      thoracic, lumbar or thoracolumbar. Idiopathic KS in adolescents is characterized by wedging&#xD;
      of vertebral bodies in X-Ray and cardio-respiratory compromise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scoliosis is clinically diagnosed with 'Adam's test' by observing a posterior rib hump&#xD;
      towards the convexity of scoliosis while bending forward in standing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The severity of scoliosis is quantified by Cobb angle, which is calculated by drawing a line&#xD;
      parallel to the end plates of the vertebral bodies at the starting and end of scoliotic&#xD;
      curvature. The Second line is drawn a perpendicular to the first lines, the angle made&#xD;
      between the intersection second lines is known as Cobb angle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical signs and symptoms of scoliosis become evident during the phase of rapid skeletal&#xD;
      growth in children. The prevalence of scoliosis in the general population ranges from 0.3% to&#xD;
      15.3%.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>1431 of the 108 subjects visiting out-patient Department of our hospital met the inclusion criteria. All the subjects diagnosed with kyphoscoliosis signed the informed consent approved by the ethical committee of the hospital. The diagnosis was based on the diagnosis by an experienced radiologist. Subjects with idiopathic kyphoscoliosis and Cobb's angle greater than 60 degree and normal pulmonary function were included. The subjects with other cardiovascular pathologies, congenital disorders and inability to commute were excluded from this study.</intervention_model_description>
