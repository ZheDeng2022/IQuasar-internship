  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On November 13th 2015, a terrorist attack killed 129 victims in Paris. An emergency crisis&#xD;
      unit (CUMP) has been activated in Paris in the days following the attack and a subunit was in&#xD;
      charge to answer to the phone calls of victims and their relatives. The same emergency crisis&#xD;
      unit have been activated for the terrorist attack in London, 2017 june 3, terrorist attack in&#xD;
      Barcelone 2017 august 17-18, terrorist attack in Strasbourg 2018 December 11 The purpose of&#xD;
      this observational study is to document the evolution of psychiatric symptoms among subjects&#xD;
      who called the CUMP and to collect information about the type of medical or non-medical care&#xD;
      they were seeking for.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The care of the victims of natural disasters or mass disasters such as terrorist attacks is&#xD;
      now better structured and organized. The efficacy of debriefing or of defusing has been and&#xD;
      is still debated, sometimes bitterly. The aim of the present study is not to demonstrate&#xD;
      utility or futility of such approaches, but to i) evaluate their global improvement over the&#xD;
      past three years. ii) to list the type of support that the victims were seeking in their&#xD;
      attempt to get rid of the symptoms which appeared after the terrorist attack of November 2015&#xD;
      in Paris.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) to collect their opinions about the way the CUMP (emergency medico-psychological unit of&#xD;
      Paris, France) managed the support to the victims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating subjects registered on the occasion of their first contact with the CUMP 75 by&#xD;
      phone during the week following the attack&#xD;
