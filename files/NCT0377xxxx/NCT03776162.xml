    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate bridge-enhanced ACL repair (BEAR), a new surgical&#xD;
      technique for repairing knees injured by a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) that&#xD;
      promotes reattachment and healing of the ACL using a blood-enriched implant. BEAR will be&#xD;
      compared to bone to patellar tendon to bone autograft (BPTB) reconstruction, a standard ACL&#xD;
      surgical reconstruction technique that replaces a torn portion of the ACL with transplanted&#xD;
      patellar tendon tissue, and thus requires additional invasive patellar tendon removal and&#xD;
      reuse as a portion of the ACL surgery, in a two group randomized clinical trial (RCT) in&#xD;
      which participants will have equal chance of receiving BEAR or BPTB reconstruction. The BEAR&#xD;
      technique is investigational and involves surgically placing a sponge (the BEAR scaffold)&#xD;
      between the torn ends of the ACL, providing an absorbable scaffold for the ligament ends to&#xD;
      grow into. The investigators hypothesize that the ACL repair with BEAR technology will&#xD;
      achieve results not appreciably worse than BPTB reconstruction, with a reduced burden of&#xD;
      invasive surgery, when assessed over the first two post-operative years. Animal studies&#xD;
      suggest BEAR may also ameliorate longer-term premature osteoarthritis of the knee, a common&#xD;
      consequence of ACL reconstruction surgery. However, no human data yet support that, and this&#xD;
      trial will conclude before such a benefit can be observed. All patients 18-40 years of age&#xD;
      who are candidates for ACL surgery within 50 days of the ACL injury and who present to&#xD;
      surgeons participating in the study will be offered participation in the trial. Patients will&#xD;
      be randomized and will undergo specified rehabilitation protocols post-operatively with&#xD;
      primary assessments of knee laxity and patient reported measures at 6 months, 1 year, and 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population will include active and otherwise healthy patients of both genders, all&#xD;
      races, and between 18-40 years old at any of five locations, who elect to undergo primary&#xD;
      surgery for a torn ACL within 50 days of injury. Approximately 100 patients will receive each&#xD;
      of the experimental BEAR surgery and the comparative control BPTB reconstruction surgery,&#xD;
      with each group distributed similarly across the five medical centers where the trial is&#xD;
      being conducted: Cleveland Clinic, Vanderbilt University, Ohio State University, Rhode Island&#xD;
      Hospital/University Orthopedics, and Washington University in St. Louis. The study&#xD;
      intervention uses a BEAR Implanted scaffold, which is placed between the torn ends of the&#xD;
      ruptured ACL. The BEAR scaffold is resorbed over 4 to 8 weeks, during which period it&#xD;
      promotes repair of the ACL tissue in the gap between the torn ends. The device provides a&#xD;
      stable provisional scaffold to facilitate intra-articular repair of the torn ACL ligament,&#xD;
      where without the implant device, healing does not occur. The results of this BEAR procedure&#xD;
      will be compared against ACL reconstruction using a BPTB autograft. This technique consists&#xD;
      of removing the torn ACL tissue, harvesting patellar tendon, and grafting that tendon within&#xD;
      tunnels in the bone to reconstruct or replace the torn ACL. The study duration is five years.&#xD;
      Surgery will occur at most 50 days after the patient's ACL is torn, with two year follow-up&#xD;
      and a three month window for the final follow-up examination, for a maximum enrollment period&#xD;
      for each patient of approximately 2 years and five months (29 months). Randomization will&#xD;
      occur during the surgery, and patients will be informed of their treatments at conclusion of&#xD;
      their participation. The two research time points are 1 and 2 years, when assessments will be&#xD;
      conducted by an independent examiner masked to the type of surgery the patient received. With&#xD;
      the exception of the RCT consenting process, use of the BEAR implant, and the blinded&#xD;
      assessment process, clinical care will be standard practice following surgical treatment for&#xD;
      a torn ACL.&#xD;

    <description>Co-primary Outcome measure: Knee stability or the antero-posterior (AP) knee laxity will be determined using a KT-1000 arthrometer at the 30lb force setting on both knees of the subject at 6 months, 1 and 2 years after surgery. The primary endpoint will be 2 year KT-1000. Both left and right knees will be covered with a sleeve so the trained examiner cannot tell which the operated knee is or which procedure the patient had. Values for both knees will be recorded. For knee laxity 2.5 mm in the side-to-side difference measurements will be taken as the non-inferiority margin for the 2 year post-operative comparison of patients in the bridge-enhanced repair group and the ACL reconstruction groups.Testing will be performed by experienced, certified athletic trainers, physical therapists or physician assistants trained using standardized equipment according to the MOON protocol.</description>

    <description>The IKDC patient-reported outcome measure instrument will be completed by patients pre-operatively, then at 3 and 6 months, 1 year and at the final 2 year visit after surgery. The primary endpoint will be evaluated at 2 years. The IKDC non-inferiority margin for BEAR vs. autograft patellar tendon will be set at &lt;16 points. The IKDC is a patient reported outcome measure which contains sections on knee symptoms (7 items), function (2 items), and sports activities (2 items). Scores range from 0 points (lowest level of function or highest level of symptoms) to 100 points (highest level of function and lowest level of symptoms).</description>

    <measure>The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Validated Patient Reported KOOS Subjective Score Instrument 2 years after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) is a patient-reported outcome measurement instrument to assess the patient's opinion about their knee and associated problems. The KOOS evaluates both short and long-term consequences of knee injury and primary osteoarthritis. It is a validated patient-reported outcomes measure to be administered by the research coordinator at the same time points as the IKDC (preoperatively, 3 and 6 months, 1 and 2 years). There are 5 subscales (Pain, Symptoms, Activities of Daily Living (ADL), Sports and Recreation, and Knee related Quality of life). The minimum clinically relevant difference is 8 points on a 100 point scale for each of the five subscales.The last week is taken into consideration when answering the questions. Standardized answer options are given and each question gets a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale.</description>

    <measure>MARX Activity (Marx Activity Rating Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>MARX Activity 2 years after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Marx Activity Scale is a validated patient-reported measure to be administered by the research coordinator to the patient preoperatively and at 1 and 2 years post-operatively. MARX focuses on four activity points: running, deceleration, cutting (changing directions while running), and pivoting. Patients are asked to indicate approximately how many times in the past 12 months they performed each of the activities while at their healthiest and most active state. The four knee functions are rated on a 5-point scale of frequency and scores are added up to a maximum of 16 points with a higher score indicating more frequent participation. The MARX rating scale is not based on participation in specific sporting activities. Instead, patients are asked about different components of physical function (e.g., running and pivoting) that are common to different sports.</description>

    <measure>Anterior Knee Pain Scale (AKPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>AKPS 2 years after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The AKPS is a validated patient-reported outcomes measure to be administered by the research coordinator to patients at the same time points as the IKDC (preoperatively, 3 and 6 months, 1 and 2 years). This tool is designed to measure patellofemoral pain symptoms. The BEAR-MOON study will utilize the 6-item short version (walking, squatting, jumping, pain, swelling, abnormal kneecap movements). Minimum score is 0 points (most painful) and maximum score is 100 points (no pain).</description>

    <measure>Quadriceps Strength Testing</measure>
    <time_frame>Quadriceps Strength 2 years after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of quadriceps strength on both knees will be performed at 6 months, and 1 and 2 years after surgery using a hand held dynamometer. Both sides will be covered with a sleeve so the blinded examiner cannot tell which the knee was the operated knee or which procedure was performed. Values for both knees will be recorded.</description>

    <time_frame>Hop Test Limb Difference 2 years after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Hop functional testing will be performed by a trained physical therapist or athletic trainer on a strict protocol as performed and published by MOON. This will be performed at 6 month, 1 and 2 years. The measurement of interest is the difference between hop distances using the normal leg and ACL injured leg. Single leg hop tests are a method to determine ability to return to high-level athletics following knee surgery. They are commonly used during the return to function phase in an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rehabilitation protocol to assess the functional stability of the knee</description>
