      Introduction With increasing age the incidence of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) rises and will&#xD;
      increase substantially in the future according to forecasting studies. It is possible that&#xD;
      oestrogens, alone or in combination with other forms of therapy, may assist in the management&#xD;
      of POP by increasing collagen synthesis and thereby improving the strength of the weakened&#xD;
      vaginal epithelium. Yet, studies investigating the effect of topical oestrogen and its impact&#xD;
      on POP associated symptoms, both self-reported improvement and observations of objective&#xD;
      improvement, are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective To evaluate the subjective efficacy concerning prolapse associated complaints&#xD;
      measured by the German pelvic floor questionnaire (domain POP: POP-score) after preoperative&#xD;
      use of local oestrogen compared to preoperative placebo treatment in postmenopausal women&#xD;
      with symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse. Further variables of interest are POP-score after 3&#xD;
      months, differences regarding the objective prolapse quantification system (POP-Q), surgical&#xD;
      outcome and tissue operability assessed by the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study&#xD;
      the investigators aim to include 120 postmenopausal women with symptomatic pelvic organ&#xD;
      prolapse and indicated operative procedure. An analysis of covariance will be computed with&#xD;
      the depending variable POP-score after 6 weeks and the independent variables group (verum&#xD;
      versus placebo) and Pop-Score at baseline.&#xD;
