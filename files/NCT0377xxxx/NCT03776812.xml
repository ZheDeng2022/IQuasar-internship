  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, randomized, 3-arm study to evaluate progression-free survival&#xD;
      (PFS) in patients with recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary&#xD;
      peritoneal cancer treated with intermittent or continuous regimens of relacorilant in&#xD;
      combination with nab-paclitaxel compared with patients treated with nab-paclitaxel alone.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Relacorilant is a small molecule antagonist of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The goals of&#xD;
      this study are to evaluate the efficacy of relacorilant either administered daily&#xD;
      (continuous) or on the day prior, the day of, and the day after chemotherapy (intermittent)&#xD;
      in combination with nab-paclitaxel in the treatment of platinum-resistant ovarian, fallopian&#xD;
      tube, or primary peritoneal cancers compared with nab-paclitaxel alone. The safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamic profile of relacorilant in combination with&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to one of the following three treatment arms.&#xD;
      Patient randomization will be stratified by treatment-free interval from most recent taxane&#xD;
      (relapsed within 6 months vs &gt;6 months) and presence of ascites (yes vs no).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A (Continuous relacorilant): Relacorilant starting at 100mg, administered orally,&#xD;
           once daily every day in combination with nab-paclitaxel on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each&#xD;
           28-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B (Intermittent relacorilant): Relacorilant 150mg, administered orally, on the day&#xD;
           before (excluding Cycle 1, Day -1), the day of, and the day after nab-paclitaxel, in&#xD;
           combination with nab-paclitaxel on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm C (Comparator): Nab-paclitaxel on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will remain on study treatment until reaching a protocol-defined event of disease&#xD;
      progression (PD), experiencing unmanageable toxicity, or until other treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation criteria are met. All patients will be followed for progression, subsequent&#xD;
      therapies and survival. Patients in Arm C who experience unequivocal PD per RECIST v1.1 will&#xD;
      be given the opportunity to receive relacorilant in combination with nab-paclitaxel after&#xD;
      discussion with the Medical Monitor.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Received at least one line of therapy with evidence of cancer progression within 6&#xD;
             months after the last dose of platinum-based therapy (i.e., having a platinum-free&#xD;
