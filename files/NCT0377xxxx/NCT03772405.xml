  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess if a physical barrier, created by the nasal gel Nascum®-&#xD;
      Plus, is able to prevent or minimize the induction of nasal symptoms during allergen&#xD;
      challenge in the Fraunhofer Allergen Challenge Chamber (ACC). Furthermore, the effect on&#xD;
      soluble and cellular inflammatory markers induced by the allergic reaction will be assessed.&#xD;
      Nascum®-Plus contains no active pharmaceutical ingredient, only monographed pharmaceutical&#xD;
      excipients.&#xD;

        first dose of study medication until at least 72 hours after treatment -, implants,&#xD;
        injectables, combined oral contraceptives, hormonal IUDs or double-barrier methods, i.e.&#xD;
        any double combination of IUD, condom with spermicidal gel, diaphragm, sponge, and cervical&#xD;
        cap).&#xD;
