    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study evaluating HC-1119 single-dose pharmacokinetics and effect of food on&#xD;
      its pharmacokinetics in healthy Chinese adults. The study primary objective is to evaluate&#xD;
      the HC-1119 pharmacokinetic characteristics and the effect of food on its pharmacokinetics in&#xD;
      healthy Chinese males, subsequent to a single oral administration of HC-1119 with different&#xD;
      doses in healthy Chinese males.&#xD;

          2. Healthy Chinese male aged between 18-45 years old (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Weight ≥ 50.0 kg, and BMI between 19.0-26.0 kg/m2 (inclusive) at screening. BMI =&#xD;
             weight (kg) / height2 (m2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Defined as &quot;healthy&quot; based on past medical history, physical examination, vital signs,&#xD;
             laboratory tests, 12-Lead ECG, and chest x-ray performed at screening. All examination&#xD;
             results must be within the normal range corresponding to the subject's age and gender,&#xD;
             or determined by the investigator as &quot;no clinical significance (NCS)&quot; when the result&#xD;
