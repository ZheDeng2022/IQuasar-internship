  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of music is widely supported in various areas of medicine: first of all in the&#xD;
      psychiatric field as in the treatment of autism in children, obtaining surprising results&#xD;
      even on Alzheimer's patients, or the unparalleled effect of music on those suffering from&#xD;
      depression. To strengthen the thesis of the usefulness of music in medicine there is what is&#xD;
      called PNEI, or the psychoneuroendocrinoimmunology. This discipline consists in the study of&#xD;
      mutual interactions between mental activity, behavior, nervous system, endocrine system and&#xD;
      immune reactivity. The PNEI itself no longer pays attention to the mind with respect to the&#xD;
      body, but using the principles of the empirical epistemology of the scientific method strives&#xD;
      to clarify those connections that make the nervous system, mind, immunity and hormonal&#xD;
      regulation a unique and complex homeostatic control system of the individual, whose synergism&#xD;
      would be able to modify certain biological behaviors, such as the transition from a distress&#xD;
      to an eustress. This passage would seem to be of particular obstetric interest going to&#xD;
      significantly change the course of labor in terms of pain, anxiety and well-being of women.&#xD;
      In fact, many women prefer not to resort to partoanalgesia and famaci for pain control during&#xD;
      labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent Cochrane Review analyzed the effectiveness of music in the control of pain in labor,&#xD;
      confirming its role in this sense. However, he concluded that the quality of available&#xD;
      evidence varied from low to very low, thus highlighting the need for further studies in this&#xD;
      area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the present study arises with the rational to satisfy this need for further&#xD;
      investigation into the positive effects of music on pain in women in labor.&#xD;
