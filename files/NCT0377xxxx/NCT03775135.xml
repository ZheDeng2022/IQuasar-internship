    <textblock>
      Up to 20% of the adolescents worldwide are diagnosed with a chronic illness. Although it's&#xD;
      known that these young people suffer from a wide range of physical discomfort, in real life&#xD;
      they have to cope with much more challenges whether or not caused by their physical&#xD;
      situation. Psychiatric disorders (e.g. ASS, ADHD or depression) are more often diagnosed in&#xD;
      this population compared to their healthy peers. The causal mechanisms for this higher risk,&#xD;
      however, are yet unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project examines three underlying intrapersonal processes possibly having an impact on&#xD;
      the evolution of these secondary symptoms. Previous research confirmed the significant impact&#xD;
      of having a chronic illness on the development of identity and the association with a higher&#xD;
      prevalence of depressive symptoms. Identity formation is a crucial developmental task to&#xD;
      transfer from a child to an independent, responsible adult. We believe this developmental&#xD;
      task is more at risk for youngsters and young adults suffering from a physical disability,&#xD;
      caused by a neuromuscular disease. In this longitudinal research project, we investigate the&#xD;
      development of identity in youth with a neuromuscular disease, compared to healthy peers and&#xD;
      compared to a group of peers with a non-visible chronical illness. We also evaluate the&#xD;
      impact of the degree of physical functioning on those mechanisms. Second, we examine if&#xD;
      parental behavior and parental functioning is linked with the formation of identity in a&#xD;
      neuromuscular populations. Finally, the impact of identity formation on psychosocial outcomes&#xD;
      (e.g. feelings of depression and anxiety, quality of life, â€¦) is measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By addressing these research questions, this project will add substantially to our knowledge&#xD;
      on identity in chronic illness and can inform future prevention and intervention efforts&#xD;
      targeting illness adaptation and parental functioning in order to prevent negative&#xD;
      psychosocial outcomes and to optimize quality of life.&#xD;

      A large-scale, multi-informant, two-wave longitudinal study is proposed to investigate our&#xD;
      three different research objectives, using complementary methods and multiple sources for&#xD;
      data collection. Such a longitudinal design allows for examining developmental trajectories&#xD;
      of our core identity variables, as well as examining how these identity variables are related&#xD;
      to other variables over time. As such, we will investigate integrative pathways linking&#xD;
      contextual factors to identity development and broader psychosocial functioning, enabling us&#xD;
      to forward important information for clinical practice. Before the start of the study, an&#xD;
      approval from the ethical commission will be obtained. All data will be coded anonymously and&#xD;
      stored in a confidential database. We aim to recruit 200 adolescents and emerging adults with&#xD;
      a neuromuscular disease, like DMD patients (Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy), SMA patients&#xD;
      (Spinal Muscular Atrophy), CMT patients (Charcot Marie Tooth) and MD1 patients (Myotonic&#xD;
      Dystrophy, type 1). Patients will be included in this study if they meet the following&#xD;
      criteria: confirmed diagnoses of a neuromuscular disorder; aged 12-25 years at baseline; last&#xD;
      neuromuscular consult at our NMRC is 5 or less years ago; able to read and write Dutch; and&#xD;
      valid contact details available in the clinical database or the hospital information system.&#xD;
      Given the complex data-analyses, it is difficult to perform an exact power analysis, but the&#xD;
      anticipated sample size is suited for the planned analyses (Kline, 2005). To make a useful&#xD;
      comparison, we will include a control sample of age- and gender-matched healthy adolescents&#xD;
      and a group of age- and gender-matched adolescents diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Those&#xD;
      control participants will be recruited in secondary schools and universities, while we are&#xD;
      able to use the data of an ongoing research project in patients with diabetes. To achieve&#xD;
      these aims, this project, as noted, will be in cooperation with the research team from the&#xD;
      Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences at KU Leuven.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate our objectives, data will be systematically collected during two years on two&#xD;
      different occasions (T1 and T2), with one year between subsequent time-points. All&#xD;
      neuromuscular patients are supposed to consult their multidisciplinary team every 6 months in&#xD;
      the context of a general control and this gives us the opportunity to ask both adolescents&#xD;
      and parents to complete questionnaires once a year. Depending on the date of the appointment,&#xD;
      patients will start in this survey on different moments, but we will use the same time&#xD;
      interval between time-points for every single patient. For inclusion, adolescents and parents&#xD;
      will be asked to sign informed consents, where after demographic and clinical data can be&#xD;
      obtained anonymously from the patients' medical records. Additional demographic and&#xD;
      socio-economic information will be gathered using a demographic questionnaire at T1. Other&#xD;
      data will be collected using instruments with well-established psychometric characteristics&#xD;
      that mostly include self-reports on all two time-points (T1 and T2). Parents will also be&#xD;
      asked to report on youth functioning as well. Figure 2 shows an overview of our research&#xD;
      design and estimated timeline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to investigate objective 1, adolescents will be asked to complete following&#xD;
      questionnaires on the two different time-points: Dimensions of Identity Development Scale (25&#xD;
      items), Illness Identity Resolution Scale (27 items) and Brief Illness Perception&#xD;
      Questionnaire (8 items). In addition, to examine reciprocal associations between identity&#xD;
      development and the variables forwarded under objectives 2 en 3, adolescents will be asked to&#xD;
      complete self-report questionnaires on psychosocial functioning and perceived support, using&#xD;
      the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD) (20 items) to screen for&#xD;
      depressive symptoms, the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED-NL),&#xD;
      the PedsQLTM Neuromuscular Module to measure quality of life and the Inventory of Peer and&#xD;
      Parent Attachment: subscales Trust, Communication and Alienation (12 items). At the same&#xD;
      time-points parents will be asked to complete the Illness Intrusive Scale (13 items), a scale&#xD;
      about different factors of their parenting: responsiveness (7 items), psychological control&#xD;
      (8 items), behavioral control (7 items) and overprotection/anxious parenting (8 items)&#xD;
      (Parenting Questionnaire) and about the physical dependence of their child (Activ-Lim). To&#xD;
      report about the psychosocial functioning of their child, parents will be asked to fulfill&#xD;
      the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED-NL) and the PedsQLTM&#xD;
      Neuromuscular Module to measure perceived quality of life in the youngster. For evaluating&#xD;
      their own psychosocial functioning, they will be asked to complete the Center for&#xD;
      Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (20 items) and a LAS-scale to evaluate their own&#xD;
      quality of life. Necessary measures will be taken to minimize dropout: all participants&#xD;
      receive a reward and Dillman's approach will be used to minimize non-response. Occasional&#xD;
      missing data will be dealt with using appropriate methods (Enders, 2010). State-of-the-art&#xD;
      longitudinal techniques will be used. Cross-lagged analysis will be used to examine&#xD;
      directionality of effect, with appropriate controls for all within-time associations and&#xD;
      stability coefficients. Hence, we can investigate, for instance, whether parents actually&#xD;
      predict illness identity resolutions over time or whether reciprocal effects emerge with, for&#xD;
      instance, illness acceptance also leading to more support. Further, mediation will be tested&#xD;
      from a longitudinal perspective, allowing us to examine, for instance, whether illness&#xD;
      identity resolutions mediate the associations between parental support and outcomes. To chart&#xD;
      developmental trajectories over time, latent growth curve modeling estimates both linear and&#xD;
      non-linear growth and uses information collected at all different time points to derive&#xD;
      parameters of change (i.e., intercept and slope). Finally, latent class growth analysis will&#xD;
      be used to identify distinct developmental trajectory classes in terms of personal and&#xD;
      illness identity resolutions.&#xD;
