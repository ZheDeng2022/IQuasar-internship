    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I/II trial studies the side effects and how well nivolumab and ipilimumab in&#xD;
      combination with chemotherapy and radiation therapy work in treating patients with gastric&#xD;
      cancer that can be removed by surgery. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      nivolumab and ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may&#xD;
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy,&#xD;
      such as oxaliplatin and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy uses thin beams of radiation of different&#xD;
      strengths aimed at the tumor from many angles. This type of radiation therapy may reduce the&#xD;
      damage to healthy tissue near the tumor. Giving nivolumab, ipilimumab, chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiation therapy may work better in treating patients with gastric cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity profile of intravenous nivolumab in combination with&#xD;
      ipilimumab after standard chemotherapy and followed by intravenous nivolumab in combination&#xD;
      with fluoropyrimidine and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for the treatment of&#xD;
      localized gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) and/or gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the efficacy of double checkpoint inhibition (nivolumab + ipilimumab) followed&#xD;
      by nivolumab plus chemoradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the overall safety and tolerability of adjuvant nivolumab in subjects with&#xD;
      resected GEJ or gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate disease free survival (DFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore changes in tumor stroma profile before and after immunotherapy and radiation&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To bank tumor and blood specimen for future correlative analysis, including, but not&#xD;
      limited to, biomarker analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive oxaliplatin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours and&#xD;
      fluorouracil IV over 48 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 4 courses&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes and ipilimumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
      Treatment with nivolumab repeats every 2 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning course 4, patients also receive fluorouracil&#xD;
      IV continuously for 5 days per week and undergo 25 fractions of IMRT for 5 weeks. Patients&#xD;
      undergo surgical resection 5-7 weeks after completing radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 8-12 weeks post-surgery, patients with residual disease may receive nivolumab IV over&#xD;
      30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 8 courses (16 weeks) then every 4&#xD;
      weeks for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 84 days, every 12&#xD;
      weeks for 2 years, then every 6-12 months for up to 3 years.&#xD;
