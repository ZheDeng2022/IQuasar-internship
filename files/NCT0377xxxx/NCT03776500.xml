  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose study&#xD;
      conducted at one study center in Switzerland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four (4) panels (A, B, C and D) of 8 male subjects (6 active and 2 placebo) each receiving&#xD;
      multiple doses of PBTZ169 or a matching placebo, at increasing dose levels, once or twice&#xD;
      daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will participate in only one panel. Blocks of 4 subjects (3 under active treatment,&#xD;
      1 under placebo) will be investigated in parallel. Panels will start sequentially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed throughout the study; serial ECGs and serial blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected for the safety and PK assessment of PBTZ169.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation will be allowed once the Trial Safety Board has determined that adequate&#xD;
      safety and tolerability after each panel completion has been demonstrated to permit&#xD;
      proceeding to the next panel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a preliminary assessment of the drug interaction potential of PBTZ169 will be&#xD;
      done by the measurement of inhibition or induction of human cytochromes through the&#xD;
      metabolism of microdoses of standard probe substrates&#xD;
