      In this study the investigators will explore dosimetry in transcranial electrical stimulation&#xD;
      using a novel magnetic resonance imaging technique that can determine how electrical&#xD;
      stimulation distributes within the brain. The investigators will then combine this imaging&#xD;
      technique with functional MR imaging to attempt mechanistic associations. If successful, the&#xD;
      study outcomes will be an improved understanding of the interactions between electric current&#xD;
      distributions and structures presumed to be targeted by stimulation.&#xD;

      Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) techniques such as transcranial DC stimulation&#xD;
      (tDCS) and transcranial AC stimulation (tACS) have been indicated for conditions as diverse&#xD;
      as stroke rehabilitation, epilepsy and for improvements in memory tasks. Thousands of tES&#xD;
      studies have been published since 20001. In typical tDCS procedures a pair of large&#xD;
      electrodes (e.g., 25cm2) is attached to the scalp and a constant current of 1-2 mA passed&#xD;
      between them for periods of 10-30 min. In tACS, the constant current intensity is similar,&#xD;
      but an alternating sinusoidal waveform is usually employed. Variations on these techniques&#xD;
      exist. For example, in oscillatory tDCS, a temporally oscillating current is combined with a&#xD;
      DC offset current. In transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) temporally random currents&#xD;
      with a fixed maximum intensity are applied. These transcranial electrical neuromodulation&#xD;
      strategies have been indicated for a wide range of conditions, including stroke&#xD;
      rehabilitation, treatment of epilepsy and for improving cognitive, motor and language and&#xD;
      memory performance in healthy subjects. Details of the underlying mechanisms of both tDCS and&#xD;
      tACS remain unclear. It has been assumed that the effects of tDCS are greatest in brain&#xD;
      structures nearest to stimulating electrodes and that these structures experience the largest&#xD;
      electric fields or current flow. In tDCS applied at 1 mA current intensities, it has been&#xD;
      found that excitatory effects broadly correlate with placement of more positive electrodes&#xD;
      over a targeted structure, and inhibitory effects are observed in structures under cathodes.&#xD;
      It has been hypothesized that this is because externally applied field either depolarizes or&#xD;
      hyperpolarizes resting membrane voltages in targeted tissue, leading to increased&#xD;
      excitability or inhibition respectively. This suggests that increased excitability or&#xD;
      inhibition would result when current intensity is increased. However, there is also evidence&#xD;
      that at 2 mA intensity increased excitability is observed, regardless of polarity. The&#xD;
      effects observed may also depend on the total stimulation time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In tACS, it has been found that at low frequencies (up to 80 Hz) tACS excitation frequencies&#xD;
      may entrain neural networks with excitatory or inhibitory effects that depend on the&#xD;
      frequency chosen, the current intensity and the phase of current application relative to&#xD;
      underlying EEG rhythms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intersubject variability has been reported in both tDCS and tACS, and study reproducibility&#xD;
      has been problematic. Apart from factors relating to the subject initial state, individual&#xD;
      neuroanatomy and differences in cerebrospinal fluid volume, it has also been suggested that&#xD;
      major contributions to variability between individual sessions of a study or may be&#xD;
      inconsistencies in electrode application protocol. In particular, overuse of saline contact&#xD;
      medium can result in the effective electrode area increasing beyond the electrode face, and&#xD;
      if fastening straps are thinner than electrodes, contact area may be reduced. Electrodes may&#xD;
      also move during sessions, or be placed inconsistently on different subjects. Between sites,&#xD;
      reproducibility may be degraded because electrode shapes, types and placements are not&#xD;
      consistent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge of the exact distribution formed within the brain by the externally applied&#xD;
      currents would clarify many study outcomes and most importantly allow more precise&#xD;
      explorations of mechanism. Further, the effects of different current application protocols,&#xD;
      electrode designs and study procedures could easily be resolved. Thus, a method for measuring&#xD;
      current distributions formed by tDCS or tACS would answer many questions in this active&#xD;
      field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of methods for easily measuring or imaging current flow distributions,&#xD;
      computational models have been used extensively to predict flow patterns. A large literature&#xD;
      exists using computational models to explore effects of different montages, electrode areas&#xD;
      and geometries on voltage distributions, electric fields or current flow. Increasingly&#xD;
      sophisticated approaches have been devised to model the head subject to tDCS stimulation. As&#xD;
      the field has grown, head model complexity has increased from spherical uniform, spherical&#xD;
      four-compartment, realistic geometry, to high-resolution anisotropic models of the human head&#xD;
      subject to electrical stimulation. This last category has involved merging source images&#xD;
      based on MR images with diffusion-weighted images of the subject to predict white matter&#xD;
      conductivity tensors. One approach to this uses water translational diffusion tensor&#xD;
      eigenvectors to determine the direction of the conductivity tensor (assuming they are&#xD;
      co-aligned) in combination with literature values of white matter conductivities. Another&#xD;
      approach involves direct scaling of the white matter diffusion tensor to conductivity values.&#xD;
      Most other model tissue conductivities are chosen from values measured on bulk tissues in the&#xD;
      literature. However, to date no validation of these models has been possible in human&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some efforts have been made to measure current distributions resulting from tDCS. In a recent&#xD;
      paper, Opitz et al. measured electric field distributions caused by transcranial stimulation&#xD;
      via electrodes placed in a bilateral montage (left and right temples) using electrode arrays&#xD;
      placed near the cortical surface of patients being monitored to identify epilepsy seizure&#xD;
      foci. tACS was applied at 1-15 Hz with an intensity of 1 mA, and maximum electrical field&#xD;
      strengths of 0.36 and 0.16 mV/mm were identified. A slight frequency dependent increase in&#xD;
      conductivity (ca. 10%) was observed, and little capacitive effect. Again, these field&#xD;
      strengths would not normally be sufficient to cause direct tissue stimulation, and support&#xD;
      theories that slight depolarizations may be responsible for tDCS effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers seeking to understand tES mechanisms have initiated fMRI studies to investigate&#xD;
      the correlation of therapeutic current administration and brain activity as evidenced by&#xD;
      changes in the BOLD contrast18-20. In the course of this research it has been noted that&#xD;
      current administration creates artifacts on MR images. In another paper, fMRI analysis&#xD;
      methods were used to find voxel clusters correlating with current flow features22. However,&#xD;
      to date, there have been no attempts to non-invasively image tDCS or tACS current density&#xD;
      distributions in humans directly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique of Current Density Imaging (CDI) as suggested by Scott et al. (1991) is a&#xD;
      method for translating the phase part of magnetic resonance images into individual magnetic&#xD;
      flux density vector components caused by an externally applied current flow. These&#xD;
      measurements can then be used to compute current density distributions using Ampere's law.&#xD;
      The basic CDI technique requires the external current to be injected into subjects in concert&#xD;
      with a sequence of RF pulses and gradient fields used to create MR images. The technique was&#xD;
      demonstrated in phantoms and used to image current flow in a rabbit brain. Unfortunately, it&#xD;
      is infeasible in humans because of the need to rotate the subject twice inside the scanner&#xD;
      bore in order to obtain all three components of the magnetic flux density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MR Electrical Impedance Tomography (MREIT) has been developed over the last decade as a&#xD;
      method for imaging current density and conductivity distributions in the human body. As in&#xD;
      CDI, MREIT requires current to be applied to a subject in conjunction with a particular MR&#xD;
      sequence. However, MREIT methods make it possible to reconstruct conductivity, electric field&#xD;
      and current density distributions in subjects by using only one component (Bz) of magnetic&#xD;
      flux density vectors. A recently developed MREIT method, DT-MREIT, can be used to reconstruct&#xD;
      full anisotropic conductivities and current density distributions using MREIT and DTI data&#xD;
      gathered from the same subject, and has recently been demonstrated in canines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this work, the investigators will use MREIT methods to produce:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Quantitative physical measures demonstrating tES reproducibility, exploring effects of&#xD;
      current intensity, sex and neuroanatomic differences on measured current distributions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Comparisons of actual current density distributions developed in a target structure&#xD;
      (DLPFC) with fMRI measures of activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies will provide the first tests of the assumptions that&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  effects of tDCS stimulation are largest in the targeted region&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  that the largest field and current flow is found in the targeted region These studies&#xD;
           therefore have the potential to revolutionize understanding of tES mechanisms and&#xD;
           practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work has three aims, one focused on technical improvements in our present MREIT&#xD;
      acquisition procedures, another targeted at quantifying replicability, measuring current flow&#xD;
      distributions at different current intensities, and finally, in assessing correlations of&#xD;
      electric field and current density distributions with brain activity measures using fMRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1 (SA1) MREIT Pulse Sequence Acceleration and Improvements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2 (SA2) Replicability and Consistency in tDCS/tACS Protocols Current density&#xD;
      distributions will be imaged in normal volunteers using an F3-F4 montage with three different&#xD;
      current intensities, and repeat the measure at intervals of at least one week. Each time, the&#xD;
      montage will be reapplied and subjects re-imaged. Both intra- and inter-subject variations in&#xD;
      measured current and electric field distributions will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3 (SA3) Correlation of functional measures with measured electrical distribution&#xD;
      measures Participants' performance on a 2-back/0-back memory task will be compared in both&#xD;
      Sham and Active subjects, using either 1, 1.5 or 2 mA intensity stimulation.&#xD;
