        Adults with melanoma with involvement of lymph nodes or metastatic disease who have&#xD;
        undergone complete resection, and who receive adjuvant nivolumab under real-world&#xD;
        conditions in Belgium or Luxembourg. Patients will be enrolled after complete surgical&#xD;
        resection and following a screen procedure (according to standard practice) that shows no&#xD;
        evidence of disease. Patients currently enrolled in an interventional clinical trial will&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a primary diagnosis of melanoma with involvement of lymph nodes or&#xD;
             metastatic disease who have undergone complete resection and have no evidence of&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Decision to treat with adjuvant nivolumab therapy has already been taken&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 18 years of age at the time of treatment decision&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who provide written informed consent to participate in the study (for&#xD;
             retrospectively enrolled patients who are deceased at time of study start, a consent&#xD;
             waiver will be sought)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patient with a diagnosis of persisting advanced melanoma prior to first&#xD;
             administration of nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patient currently enrolled in an interventional clinical trial for his/her&#xD;
             melanoma treatment (note: patients who have completed their participation in an&#xD;
             interventional trial or who are no longer receiving the study drug and are only&#xD;
             followed up for Overall Survival (OS)/ Relapse Free Survival (RFS) can be enrolled. In&#xD;
             case of a blinded study, the treatment arm needs to be known).&#xD;
