  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Yellow Fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic disease caused by the Yellow Fever Virus (YFV), a&#xD;
      re-emerging arbovirus transmitted by the same mosquito vector (Aedes aegypti) that transmits&#xD;
      Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). YFV is endemic in tropical and subtropical areas&#xD;
      of South America and Africa, causing an estimated 200,000 infections and 30,000 deaths&#xD;
      annually. It has now become a growing public health problem, rapidly spreading throughout the&#xD;
      two (2) continents in a cyclical pattern. With climate change, global travel and&#xD;
      urbanisation, which increase the chance for mosquito-borne diseases to spread rapidly, the&#xD;
      risk of YFV establishing its foothold in the Asia-Pacific region with periodic epidemic&#xD;
      bursts remains a real public health concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is currently a safe and effective vaccine available on the market, global&#xD;
      shortages of supplies have severely hampered any efforts in the prevention and control of YFV&#xD;
      outbreaks. To date, no YFV therapy (biologic or small molecule) has advanced to clinical&#xD;
      trials. TY014 will be the first therapeutic in the world, specifically targeting YFV, to&#xD;
      enter clinical trials. It is anticipated that a monoclonal antibody therapeutic could be&#xD;
      administered to infected cases to reduce disease severity within the patient and their&#xD;
      contacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase 1, first-in-human TY014, YFV monoclonal antibody (mAb), study to be conducted&#xD;
      in two (2) arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety Arm (1A): Healthy adult volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy Arm (1B): Healthy adult volunteers challenged with YF-17D Vaccine Strain 24&#xD;
           hours prior to TY014 dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
      TY014 will be administered once through single IV infusion over 30 minutes. Total duration of&#xD;
      study participation is estimated at approximately 114 days from the date of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of this study are to: (a) evaluate the safety of TY014 in healthy adult&#xD;
      volunteers, and (b) evaluate the safety of TY014 in YF-17D Vaccine Strain-challenged healthy&#xD;
      adult volunteers. Percentage aviremia of YF-17D Vaccine Strain-challenged subjects within 48&#xD;
      hours after IV infusion of TY014 will also be assessed.&#xD;

      Safety Arm (1A):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Arm is a phase 1A First-in-Human, Time Lagged, Single Ascending Dose Study of TY014 in&#xD;
      Healthy Adult Volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety, tolerability and PK of TY014 will be assessed. The dose escalation will include 27&#xD;
      healthy volunteers in five (5) dose cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  0.5 mg/kg, N = 2 TY014 + 5 Placebos&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 mg/kg, N = 5 TY014&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 mg/kg, N = 5 TY014&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 mg/kg, N = 5 TY014&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  20 mg/kg, N = 5 TY014 Subjects will be required to be inpatient at the trial site for&#xD;
           approximately 72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalations will be guided by a safety review of clinical signs, adverse events (AEs),&#xD;
      and laboratory tests (excluding lipase) of the prior group (up to 48 hours post-dose for&#xD;
      cohort 1, and up to Day 7 post-dose for cohorts 2 - 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 20-hour interval from the first TY014 treatment subject dosing must take place&#xD;
      before the second TY014 treatment subject can be dosed within each cohort. No such time&#xD;
      interval will be required for dosing of subsequent TY014 treatment subjects (third subject&#xD;
      onwards) within the same cohort, as well as Placebo dosing in dose cohort 1 (i.e. all five&#xD;
      placebos can be dosed at the same time).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 72 hours, subjects will be discharged from trial site and to return for scheduled&#xD;
      follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed for up to approximately Day 84 for PK sampling, with serum samples&#xD;
      taken at specified times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalations for the Safety (1A) Arm will be guided by a safety review of clinical signs,&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs), and laboratory tests (excluding lipase) of the prior dose cohort (up to&#xD;
      Day 7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar safety review (up to Day 7) will also be completed for the equivalent dose in Safety&#xD;
      Arm (1A) prior to the commencement of the Efficacy Arm (1B) for each specified dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Arm (1B):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Arm is a phase 1B Sequential Time Lagged, Parallel-Group, Randomised,&#xD;
      Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind, Single Ascending Dose Study of TY014 in YF-17D Vaccine&#xD;
      Strain-Challenged Healthy Adult Volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety, tolerability and time to achieve aviremia through negative YFV isolation from blood&#xD;
      in YF-17D Vaccine Strain-challenged healthy adult volunteers when given an IV infusion of&#xD;
      TY014 will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be randomised into TY014 or Placebo Group in each cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose escalation will include up to 40 healthy volunteers in up to four (4) dose cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 mg/kg, N = 5 TY014 + 5 Placebos&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 mg/kg, N = 5 TY014 + 5 Placebos&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 mg/kg, N = 5 TY014 + 5 Placebos&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  20 mg/kg, N = 5 TY014 + 5 Placebos Efficacy Arm (1B) will be based on an adaptive trial&#xD;
           design, with ten (10) YF-17D vaccinated subjects from each dose cohort being randomised&#xD;
           1:1 into either TY014 or Placebo group, five (5) subjects in each group. After TY014 or&#xD;
           placebo administration, safety and efficacy of TY014 in YF-17D Vaccine Strain-Challenged&#xD;
           subjects will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           i) If current dose of TY014 shows safety but not efficacy*, Efficacy Arm (1B) will&#xD;
           escalate to the next dose cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) If current dose of TY014 is safe and efficacious*, efficacious dose of TY014 is&#xD;
      established and the Efficacy Arm (1B) of the trial is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Efficacy of TY014 is defined as aviremia by virus isolation being observed in 100% of&#xD;
      vaccinated subjects within 48 hours post-dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be required to be inpatient at the trial site for approximately 96 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be vaccinated with the YF-17D Vaccine on Day -1. On Day 0, 24 hours after&#xD;
      vaccination, subjects will then be administered TY014 or Placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 20-hour interval from the first two (2) subjects dosing (1 treatment and 1&#xD;
      placebo concurrently) must take place before the third subject can be dosed within each&#xD;
      cohort. No such time interval will be required for dosing of subsequent subjects (fourth&#xD;
      subject onwards) within the same cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 96 hours, subjects will be discharged from trial site and are to return for scheduled&#xD;
      follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PD and PK measurements will be conducted at various time points throughout the study.&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed for up to approximately Day 84 post-dose. Samples for PD (serum and&#xD;
      urine) and PK (serum) assessments will be taken at specified time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalations for the Efficacy (1B) Arm will be guided by a safety review of clinical&#xD;
      signs, adverse events (AEs), laboratory tests (excluding lipase) and presence of viremia (via&#xD;
      virus isolation) of the prior dose cohort (up to Day 14). Escalation to the next dose cohort&#xD;
      (e.g. from dose cohort 1 (2 mg/kg) to dose cohort 2 (5 mg/kg), from dose cohort 2 (5 mg/kg)&#xD;
      to dose cohort 3 (10 mg/kg) and from dose cohort 3 (10 mg/kg) to dose cohort 4 (20 mg/kg))&#xD;
      will only be conducted if from prior dose cohort (e.g. dose cohort 1 (2 mg/kg), dose cohort 2&#xD;
      (5 mg/kg) and dose cohort 3 (10 mg/kg) respectively):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. safety (up to Day 14 post-dose) has been established through a safety review, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. presence of viremia (up to 48 hours post-dose) via virus isolation in any of the&#xD;
           TY014-treated subjects.&#xD;
