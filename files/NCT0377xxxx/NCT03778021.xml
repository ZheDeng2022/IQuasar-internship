  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we will estimate changes in healthy eating and gardening behaviors associated&#xD;
      with the intervention using a randomized controlled trial design, with the comparison arm&#xD;
      receiving a delayed intervention in the following school year.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The small randomized controlled trial of an intensive curriculum and school garden&#xD;
      intervention will be implemented in elementary schools in two communities (Shiprock and&#xD;
      Tsaile). The study will begin in year 1 with a period of engagement and recruitment of&#xD;
      schools in each community; with the goal of recruiting three schools in each community to&#xD;
      start the run-in phase. The run-in period will include time for greater engagement with the&#xD;
      school community, an assessment of the potential garden site and an assessment of evaluation&#xD;
      readiness. Depending on whether all three schools in the community qualify for the study at&#xD;
      the end of run-in, or only two schools per community, we will randomize three or two schools&#xD;
      to intervention or delayed intervention status in each community. We will have either two&#xD;
      intervention schools and 4 delayed intervention schools, or 2 intervention schools and 2&#xD;
      delayed intervention schools, depending on the run-in information. We will conduct baseline&#xD;
      data collection (T1) at the beginning of the school year in Year 2 with both children and&#xD;
      parents. Students in the intervention group will receive the curriculum and school garden&#xD;
      during that academic school year. At the end of the school year, we will conduct the T2&#xD;
      assessment in children and parents. The main evaluation period is between T1 and f2, and the&#xD;
      statistical analysis methods refer to the T2 versus T1 change in outcome measures (healthy&#xD;
      eating and gardening). After that, at the beginning of the next school year (Year 3), the&#xD;
      delayed intervention schools will receive the intervention. During Year 3, we will also&#xD;
      conduct quarterly community gardening workshops for adult family members in all schools.&#xD;
      Attendance at these will be tracked. A final assessment (T3) will be conducted at the end of&#xD;
      the second school year in all the randomized schools to describe behaviors in children and&#xD;
      parents over time, using a quasiexperimental design that estimates change in the delayed&#xD;
      intervention group between T2 and T3, attributable in part to the delayed intervention.&#xD;
