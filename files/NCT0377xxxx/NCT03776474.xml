      The study objectives are :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine standards of plasma levels of casein-specific immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) and&#xD;
      egg-specific immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) as a function of age, in non-allergic children, in&#xD;
      allergic children, and in cured former allergic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyze the plasma IgG4 / IgE ratio, according to the result of the oral provocation test&#xD;
      (tolerance versus allergy) and, in the event of a reaction, according to the reactogenic dose&#xD;
      (dose which caused the reaction).Determine whether analysis of the plasma metabolome can&#xD;
      identify children with a cured allergy to cow's milk protein or to egg from those with a&#xD;
      persistent allergy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated allergies to cow's milk and hen's egg affects 2-3% and&#xD;
      0.5-2.5% of children respectively. These allergies expose to the risk of immediate&#xD;
      anaphylactic reaction that may be life-threatening. Approximately 70-80% of children with IgE&#xD;
      mediated allergies to cow's milk and hen's egg will tolerate these foods by the age of 6&#xD;
      years. However, in the absence of reliable biomarker of tolerance, to determine whether oral&#xD;
      tolerance is obtained, it is recommended to perform an oral food challenge (OFC) in a&#xD;
      hospital setting. This procedure is expensive, time consuming, and carries the risk of&#xD;
      anaphylactic reactions. Many studies have tried to find predictive markers of reactivity&#xD;
      during the OFC. Improving the prediction of the response to OFC would be very useful to&#xD;
      better select children in whom an OFC can be performed without risk to confirm the&#xD;
      acquisition of tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For instance, serum specific IgE positive values beyond which 95% of patients would have an&#xD;
      allergic reaction have been proposed. These values are highly variable from one study to&#xD;
      another because of methodological differences and heterogeneity of populations, and cannot be&#xD;
      used in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The regular dosage of serum specific IgE and its evolution over time is used in clinical&#xD;
      practice to predict a possible persistence of IgE mediated food allergy. Indeed, an initial&#xD;
      high rate and/or elevation of specific IgE levels may be predictive of a persistent allergy,&#xD;
      while initial low rates and a decrease in specific IgE may predict tolerance. When tolerance&#xD;
      develops, there is a decrease in specific IgE levels, however, even if tolerance is obtained,&#xD;
      they can remain positive at pathological levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During continuous exposure to an allergen, the specific immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) response is&#xD;
      physiological. Oral immunotherapy studies in food allergies showed an elevation of specific&#xD;
      IgG4, associated with an elevation in the number of regulatory T lymphocytes (LTreg) and the&#xD;
      production of interleukin (IL)-10. The development of spontaneous oral tolerance, without the&#xD;
      intervention of immunotherapy, also seems to involve IgG4. In a prospective follow-up of a&#xD;
      cohort of children with an IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy, the elevation of specific IgG4&#xD;
      was observed in those who cure of their allergy, with rates higher than those observed in&#xD;
      children whose allergy persists. In children with cow's milk and/or egg allergies, a low&#xD;
      concentration of specific (IgG4 of B-Lactoglobulin or ovalbumin is associated with the need&#xD;
      for a more prolonged exclusion diet. The balance between specific IgE and IgG4 therefore&#xD;
      appears to be important in the development of tolerance and may reflect the balance between&#xD;
      effector T cells and LTreg. However, the normal serum levels of IgG4 to cow's milk and hen's&#xD;
      egg are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recently published study of Doctor Guillaume Lezmi and Professor Karine Adel-Patient shows&#xD;
      that children with an IgE-mediated allergy to cow's milk protein and those who outgrew this&#xD;
      allergy, have distinct plasma metabolomic signature. This suggests that plasma metabolomic&#xD;
      analysis may be a useful too to differentiate children with a persistent cow's milk protein&#xD;
      allergy from those who acquired tolerance to cow's milk. If confirmed, the metabolic&#xD;
      signature may be useful to better identify children to whom an oral food challenge with cow's&#xD;
      milk protein could be propose. These results need to be confirmed in a larger population and&#xD;
      in other food allergies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objectives are :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine standards of plasma levels of casein-specific immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) and&#xD;
      egg-specific immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) as a function of age, in non-allergic children, in&#xD;
      allergic children, and in cured former allergic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyze the plasma IgG4 / IgE ratio, according to the result of the oral provocation test&#xD;
      (tolerance versus allergy) and, in the event of a reaction, according to the reactogenic dose&#xD;
      (dose which caused the reaction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine whether analysis of the plasma metabolome can identify children with a cured&#xD;
      allergy to cow's milk protein or to egg from those with a persistent allergy.&#xD;
