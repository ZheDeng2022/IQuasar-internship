      This study evaluates changes in knowledge, attitudes, practices and coverage of key&#xD;
      reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health (RMNCH) areas, including malaria, family&#xD;
      planning (FP), nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), and gender equity among the&#xD;
      population in Nampula and Sofala provinces targeted by the Maternal and Child Survival&#xD;
      Program (MCSP) in Mozambique.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific objectives of the study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess changes in knowledge, attitudes, practices and coverage (KAPC) of high-impact&#xD;
           interventions related to MNCH (antenatal care, delivery, post-partum/natal care, and&#xD;
           sick child care), immunization, family planning and reproductive health, nutrition, WASH&#xD;
           and malaria among mothers and fathers of children age 0-23 months in MCSP supported&#xD;
           areas;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the effectiveness of male engagement interventions that encourage couples&#xD;
           communication at increasing antenatal care (ANC) attendance, joint birth preparedness&#xD;
           and complication readiness (BPCR) plans, institutional birth, and use of modern FP;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the feasibility and acceptability of male engagement interventions on RMNCH&#xD;
           services for clients and providers;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Explore how decisions between couples are made and what may influence their decisions&#xD;
           about seeking RMNCH services; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Explore the experiences of women who were referred to a health facility for themselves&#xD;
           or their child for obstetric, newborn or child health complications, and examine the&#xD;
           factors contributing to whether and how those referrals were completed in Nampula&#xD;
           Province.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a final program evaluation that will use a mixed methods approach, including&#xD;
      both quantitative and qualitative data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data will be collected through a cross-sectional KAPC household survey of&#xD;
      mothers and fathers of children age 0-23 months, replicating the same KAPC questionnaire that&#xD;
      was conducted at baseline in 2016 in the same geographic areas. Questions were harmonized&#xD;
      with the DHS and MICS where appropriate. Findings from the endline KAPC survey will be&#xD;
      compared to findings from the baseline survey to assess changes over time in the primary&#xD;
      outcomes of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data will be collected through focus group discussions (FGDs) and in-depth&#xD;
      interviews (IDIs) with clients (mothers and fathers of children age 0-23 months) and health&#xD;
      providers in MCSP-supported areas. The qualitative component will be conducted to help us&#xD;
      gain a more in-depth understanding of the influence of male engagement interventions on&#xD;
      couples' decision-making and care-seeking related to RMNCH as well as the barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators that affected the experience of identified women who were referred to health&#xD;
      facilities for obstetric or newborn complications. We will explore both client and provider&#xD;
      experiences with gender-equitable male engagement practices, as well as individual client&#xD;
      referral narratives related to obstetric or newborn complications.&#xD;
