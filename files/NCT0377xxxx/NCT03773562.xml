  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify changes in brain function and structure that correlate with response to&#xD;
           erenumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Develop models using imaging data +/- clinical data to predict which patients will&#xD;
           respond to erenumab. Pre-treatment and early post-treatment imaging data will be used&#xD;
           separately for predictive modeling.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include 50 participants with migraine aged 18-65 years who have 10-25 migraine&#xD;
      days per month at baseline. Following a 4-week headache diary run-in phase, participants will&#xD;
      receive two treatments with once monthly subcutaneous injections of erenumab 140 mg.&#xD;
      Questionnaires, structured interviews, cognitive tests, quantitative sensory testing and&#xD;
      brain imaging will be performed prior to and following erenumab treatment. These data will be&#xD;
      collected at early time points after the first treatment as well as at eight weeks following&#xD;
      the first treatment to allow for identification of early and late effects of erenumab on&#xD;
      clinical, physiologic, and imaging outcomes and to determine if early physiologic and imaging&#xD;
      outcomes predict clinical outcomes at eight weeks. Physiologic and imaging data will be&#xD;
      compared to already collected data from healthy controls so as to interpret changes that are&#xD;
      seen following treatment with erenumab.&#xD;
