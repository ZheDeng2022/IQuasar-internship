  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced (stage IIIB/IV) non-small-cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC) remains short after the first line of treatment with a median OS of 12.2 months in&#xD;
      non squamous NSCLC and 9.2 months in squamous NSCLC . In this setting the programmed death&#xD;
      1/ligand 1 (PD-1/-L1) were targeted with nivolumab (IgG4) in advanced squamous and&#xD;
      nonsquamous NSCLC leading to an increase of the 1-year OS rate of approximately 10-15% in&#xD;
      both histologies. Nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab are now considered a standard of&#xD;
      care in 2nd line advanced NSCLC and in 1st line for pembrolizumab but but prognosis still&#xD;
      remains poor in advanced NSCLC. Overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced (stage&#xD;
      III/IV) NSCLC remains limited with a median OS of 12.2 months in non-squamous NSCLC and 9.2&#xD;
      months in squamous NSCLC if anti-PD1 alone. It is of around 16 months if pembrolizumab is&#xD;
      combined with chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical data indicates that anti-tumor efficacy is increased when anti-PD-1/-L1 are&#xD;
      combined with irradiation (IR). Radiotherapy alone can elicit tumor cell death which can&#xD;
      increase tumor antigen in the blood stream, favoring recognition by the immune system and its&#xD;
      activation against tumor cells outside of the radiation field (=&quot;abscopal effect&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IR may also reverse acquired resistance to PD-1 blockade immunotherapy by limiting T-cell&#xD;
      exhaustion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of these preclinical and clinical data several studies analysing the combination of&#xD;
      IR and anti-PD1 in NSCLC are ongoing. Among them, two studies are testing the administration&#xD;
      of IR and nivolumab in stage III NSCLC: the NCT02768558 phase III trial (RTOG), and the&#xD;
      NCT02434081 phase II trial (ETOP). Antonia et al [2017] tested the use of anti-PD-L1 after&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy in unresectable stage III NSCLC. Median time to distant metastasis was&#xD;
      increased (23.2 months vs. 14.6 months, p&lt;0.001). An increase of OS is consequently expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, no study involving concurrent RT and pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy in&#xD;
      advanced NSCLC is ongoing, which is the purpose of the present study, NIRVANA-Lung.&#xD;

    <description>In the experimental arm, patients will receive the same treatment as the control arm (chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab) in addition with conformal 3D radiotherapy (3D-CRT) or stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) that will be delivered at C2D1, 21 days after the beginning of pembrolizumab using photons/electrons with standard field encompassing tumour.&#xD;
Irradiation technique (3D-CRT or SABR) will be at physician discretion. Ideally, oligometastatic patient (defined by the presence of less than 6 metastases) should be treated with SABR and those with non-oligometastatic disease should be treated with 3D-CRT.&#xD;
Radiotherapy will be delivered a dose of at least 18 Gy in 3 X 6 Gy for 3D-CRT (cf. protocol for possible schemes and volumes restriction).&#xD;
Irradiated tumor size will be ≤5 cm (GTV &lt;65 mL sphere); partial tumor irradiation should be delivered if larger tumor size while respecting dose constraints.</description>
