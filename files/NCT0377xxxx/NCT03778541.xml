  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-center randomized phase III trial was conducted to investigate the feasibility and&#xD;
      safety of adding temozolomide to hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for large brain&#xD;
      metastases.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A previous single arm phase II trial and propensity- matched study of our institution have&#xD;
      shown that HFSRT combined with concurrent TMZ was safe and efficient for patients with BMs of&#xD;
      ≥ 6cc in volume. The 1-year local control, intracranial progression free survival,&#xD;
      progression free survival and overall survival rates were better than HFSRT alone group.&#xD;
      Thus, the investigator conducted this randomized phase III trial to broad the sample size and&#xD;
      verify our previous results. To finish the study in time, the investigator designed a&#xD;
      multi-center trial.&#xD;
