      Background &amp; Aim: Presence of microvascular invasion (mvi) in the explanted liver defines a&#xD;
      higher risk of recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver transplantation (LT).&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate pre LT selection models of HCC recurrence specifically&#xD;
      in patients without mvi in the explanted liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Three multicenter cohorts are going to be included: a Latin American, a French and&#xD;
      an Italian cohort of consecutive adult patients with HCC a first LT performed during two&#xD;
      different periods: 2005-2011 and 2012-2016. AFP model is going to be compared against Milan&#xD;
      and San Francisco criteria according to each models accuracy and prediction of HCC recurrence&#xD;
      among patients without microvascular invasion in the explanted liver considering these&#xD;
      candidates as &quot;Low-risk patients&quot;. Multivariate Cox regression analysis, with hazard ratios&#xD;
      (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for 5-year recurrence is going to be done with&#xD;
      Competing Risk Regression analysis and corresponding Subhazard Ratios (SHR).&#xD;

      Introduction Recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver transplantation (LT) is&#xD;
      a catastrophic event, with limited therapeutics and poor survival [1]. Prior to 1990s,&#xD;
      transplantation for HCC was a limited option with high recurrence and poor recipient&#xD;
      survival, largely because of a lack of accurate selection of transplant candidates and a late&#xD;
      diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Milan criteria have remained as the gold standard selection criteria, with&#xD;
      post-transplant 5-year recurrence less than 15% and 5-year survival over 70% [2]. These&#xD;
      criteria do not contemplate a relevant histological variable and a risk marker of recurrence,&#xD;
      microvascular invasion (mvi). Presence of mvi in the explanted liver has been identified as&#xD;
      an independent variable related to recurrence that categorizes patients with low and high&#xD;
      risk of HCC recurrence [3]. That is why other selection criteria, beyond Milan criteria, have&#xD;
      tried to find pre-transplant surrogate markers of mvi or other related risk factors for&#xD;
      recurrence [4-6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a marker of renewed interest as a selection criterion, which&#xD;
      has been identified as an independent risk variable associated with recurrence and as a&#xD;
      surrogate marker of mvi [4,5,7,8]. Evaluation of mvi before LT by a tumor biopsy has many&#xD;
      caveats; on the one hand, the risk of tumor seeding, bleeding and other complications and on&#xD;
      the other hand, the absence of it does not exclude of its presence in the explanted liver&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, while it is known that the presence of mvi defines a greater risk, its absence&#xD;
      generates uncertainty regarding the risk of recurrence in this population. The Up-to 7&#xD;
      criteria showed that the occurrence of mvi at any size and tumor number was paralleled by a&#xD;
      significant lower patient survival and higher recurrence [3]. However, the Metroticket&#xD;
      calculator excluded important pre transplant variables such as serum AFP and tumor treatment&#xD;
      or progression while on the waitlist [9]. A recently predicting model, the RETREAT score,&#xD;
      showed that when considering pre and post transplant variables, the AFP at different&#xD;
      cut-offs, presence of mvi and the sum of the largest tumor diameter and tumor number were&#xD;
      associated with HCC recurrence [7]. While it has been published earlier in Italian and French&#xD;
      cohorts that the prevalence of mvi is 24% [4,11], in another Latin American validation cohort&#xD;
      of the AFP model the prevalence of mvi was 22.2% [10].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objective therefore, is to evaluate the AFP model against Milan and San Francisco&#xD;
      criteria (UCSF) in the prediction of HCC recurrence and patient survival specifically in&#xD;
      patients without mvi in the explanted liver and evaluate if the AFP model can assure and&#xD;
      identify good candidates for LT that are beyond Milan and UCSF in this subgroup of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods Study design, setting and participating centers This study is going to&#xD;
      include three multicenter cohorts of consecutive adult patients (&gt;17 years of age) who&#xD;
      underwent a first LT between January 1 2005 and December 31 2016 [4,10,11]. Participating&#xD;
      centers will appoint a study coordinator responsible for data collection. In cases of&#xD;
      conflicting or missing data, central revision and resubmission were requested. All the&#xD;
      requested variables are going to be included in a written CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria and study variables Criteria for inclusion required patients to be adult&#xD;
      cirrhotic or non-cirrhotic recipients with confirmed HCC in the explanted liver. Patients are&#xD;
      going to be excluded if: 1) other tumors than HCC are confirmed in the explanted liver, or 2)&#xD;
      there are missing relevant information; 3) extrahepatic or macrovascular tumor invasion were&#xD;
      observed during pre transplant evaluation or in the explanted liver 4) incidental HCC, 5) had&#xD;
      a previous liver transplant and 6) patients with microvascular invasion in the explanted&#xD;
      liver (this latter criteria is going to be assessed for the final inclusion criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recipient characteristics, pre-transplant tumor characteristics and serum α-fetoprotein (AFP)&#xD;
      levels are going to be recorded at listing and at last pre-LT evaluation. Subjects with HCC&#xD;
      diagnosis prior to transplant based on imaging criteria are going to be classified according&#xD;
      to Milan (MC) and University of California San Francisco (UCSF) [12] and the AFP model [4],&#xD;
      depending on size and number of lesions detected on pre-LT computerized tomography (CT) or&#xD;
      magnetic resonance images (MRI) and on serum pre-LT AFP levels ng/ml including the following&#xD;
      cut-offs values ≤100 ng/ml, 101-1000 ng/ml, and &gt;1000 ng/ml [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor treatment before transplantation is going to be recorded (date and type of treatments&#xD;
      performed) including trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE), radiofrequency ablation (RFA),&#xD;
      percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) and liver resection (LR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explanted liver findings will include macroscopic and microscopic evaluation of each nodule,&#xD;
      number and diameter (cm) of each, presence of mvi, and degree of tumor differentiation&#xD;
      according to Edmonson-Steiner grading system. Nodules of largest diameter are going to be&#xD;
      identified as the major nodule. Necrotic nodules are going to be also measured including&#xD;
      necrotic and viable tumor diameter. Finally, Milan and Up-to seven criteria are going to also&#xD;
      be applied to the explanted liver specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study end-points Primary end-points analyzed are going to be 5-year patient survival and HCC&#xD;
      recurrence. Recurrence is going to be determined on the basis of imaging criteria plus serum&#xD;
      AFP or by biopsy. Time to recurrence (TTR) is going to be calculated considering it a robust&#xD;
      clinical outcome measure and calculated as the time in months elapsed between transplantation&#xD;
      and diagnosis of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims include the development of tumor progression while on the waitlist according&#xD;
      to RECIST 1.1 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Categorical data were compared using Fisher's exact test or Chi-Square&#xD;
      (Χ2) test (2-tailed). Continuous variables were compared with Student's T test or Wilcoxon&#xD;
      rank-sum test according to their distribution, respectively. First of all, in order to&#xD;
      evaluate if microvascular invasion in the explant is an independent risk variable for&#xD;
      recurrence, a multivariate Cox regression analysis, with hazard ratios (HR) and 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals (95% CI) for identifying explanted liver risk variables for 5-year&#xD;
      recurrence is going to be carried out evaluating potential confounding variables. After&#xD;
      calculation of each adjusted HR separately in each overall cohort (French, Italian and&#xD;
      LATAM), cumulative incidence of recurrence by a competing risk regression analysis with death&#xD;
      is going to be compared among patients with or without mvi (&quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; risk patients,&#xD;
      respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, after evaluating the effect of mvi as a selection criteria of &quot;low&quot; and &quot;high&quot; risk&#xD;
      patients, the following analysis is going to be done after excluding patients with mvi in&#xD;
      each cohort in order to evaluate the performance of the AFP model in these &quot;low-risk&quot;&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multivariate Cox regression analysis (HR, 95% CI) is going to be done in order to identify&#xD;
      the effect of each pre-LT model on prediction of HCC 5-year recurrence adjusted with&#xD;
      potential confounding variables. Variables with a P value &lt;0.05 after the univariate analysis&#xD;
      are going to be included in the multivariate model, generated by stepwise forward elimination&#xD;
      evaluating P values (Wald test) and considering adjusted HR with confounding variables (&gt;20%&#xD;
      of change in crude HR). For each multivariate model, 1 variable per 10 events were included.&#xD;
      Adjustment of each final model is going to be evaluated with proportional hazards through&#xD;
      graphic and statistical evaluation (Schoenfeld residual test). Calibration is going to be&#xD;
      assessed by comparison of observed and predicted curves and evaluation of the goodness of fit&#xD;
      of the model by Harrell's c-statistic index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, a competing risk analysis with death and recurrence is going to be done with&#xD;
      calculation of subharzard ratios (SHR) and 95% CI. Kaplan Meier survival curves were compared&#xD;
      using the log-rank test (Mantel-Cox). Collected data were analyzed with STATA 10.0.&#xD;
