  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In literature there is a huge amount of works demonstrating the direct correlation between&#xD;
      volemic overload or fluid deficit and hypoperfusion and the increase in the rate of major&#xD;
      postoperative complications in patients with high cardiovascular risk and chronic renal&#xD;
      failure candidate to kidney transplantation from cadaver. It is also widely demonstrated that&#xD;
      in certain populations with high surgical and post-operative complications risk, the adoption&#xD;
      of targeted haemodynamic and clinical-therapeutic management protocols is indicated. The&#xD;
      current trend is therefore to guarantee greater precision in the intraoperative management of&#xD;
      patients undergoing kidney transplantation from cadaver by using a specific protocol that can&#xD;
      be framed in the recent and innovative concept of Perioperative Gold Directed Therapy (PGDT),&#xD;
      resulting from the adoption of an advanced minimally invasive hemodynamic monitoring&#xD;
      technology with a special sensor called FloTrac (Edwards Lifesciences), already extensively&#xD;
      tested in an extensive case series of high perioperative risk patients underwent to major&#xD;
      abdominal surgery, major vascular surgery, major orthopedic surgery and cardio-thoracic&#xD;
      surgery. In the present study there will be enrolled all patients who are candidates for&#xD;
      kidney transplant from cadaver at the University Hospital &quot;G. Rodolico&quot; of Catania that meet&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria of the study and will give their informed consent to participation.&#xD;
      The enrolled patients will be monitored for a maximum period of 7 days from transplantation.&#xD;
      As control group there will be considered an historical cohort of patients who underwent&#xD;
      kidney transplantation from cadaver in 2015, in which a PGDT protocol was not used, but a&#xD;
      common hemodynamic monitoring, based on parameters such as central venous pressure and / or&#xD;
      invasive arterial pressure, was performed according to the international guidelines.&#xD;
