  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer remains the most lethal malignancy in both sexes around the world. It is&#xD;
      estimated that lung cancer caused 234,030 deaths in the United States in 2016, accounting for&#xD;
      28% of all cancer-related deaths. In 2012 alone, a total of 6,697 deaths from lung cancer&#xD;
      were registered in Mexico; this number exceeds the death toll from other common solid&#xD;
      neoplasms (i.e., stomach, prostate, breast, and liver). In addition to its high incidence,&#xD;
      lung cancer patients face a dismal prognosis, with an overall 5-year survival ranging from&#xD;
      5-16%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last two decades, the outlook for a subset of Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)&#xD;
      patients has shifted. Novel approaches have been able to identify that a significant number&#xD;
      of patients present tumors with actionable mutations, opening the possibility of treatment&#xD;
      with targeted therapies, which have increased survival outcomes in these patients. A number&#xD;
      of specific therapies have been developed over the past decade, such as epidermal growth&#xD;
      factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, treatment options for patients with NSCLC with actionable mutations has&#xD;
      increased in the last two decades, with several third generation inhibitors available, which&#xD;
      have different efficacy and tolerability profiles, nonetheless, global 5-year survival rates&#xD;
      remain below 20%, which highlights the need to explore therapeutic combinations which might&#xD;
      derive in greater long-term survival for this patient subgroup. Although encouraging data has&#xD;
      been reported in terms of adding Bevacizumab to EGFR-TKIs, this scheme has not been explored&#xD;
      for patients who have ALK-rearranged NSCLC and who are candidates for ALK-inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, Alectinib has been shown to offer several advantages compared to first-generation&#xD;
      ALK-TKIs, including a stronger ALK-inhibition, better outcomes in patients with Central&#xD;
      Nervous System (CNS) involvement and longer duration of response. However, the addition of&#xD;
      Bevacizumab to therapy with Alectinib in treatment naïve or previously treated NSCLC patients&#xD;
      remains unexplored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this data and the need to continue searching for safe and effective therapeutic&#xD;
      options, a phase II, single arm trial assessing Alectinib in combination with Bevacizumab in&#xD;
      untreated and previously treated patients with Advanced or Metastatic Non-Squamous&#xD;
      ALK-rearranged NSCLC has been designed.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND The burden of Lung Cancer Lung cancer remains the most lethal malignancy&#xD;
      worldwide, claiming more lives compared to any other malignant disease in both developed and&#xD;
      developing countries, as well as globally. Although some countries have accomplished a&#xD;
      decrease in incidence rates, most regions, particularly those in the developing world, face&#xD;
      the challenge of an epidemic of paramount importance, which is likely to take hundreds of&#xD;
      thousands of lives in the coming years. In Latin America, regional trends show that lung&#xD;
      cancer incidence and mortality are on the rise, in México, for example, trends from the&#xD;
      Global Cancer Statistics group (GLOBOCAN) show that it is likely that incident lung cancer&#xD;
      cases will double by 2030, compared to those reported in 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of lung cancer, therefore, requires a surge in our efforts. For many decades,&#xD;
      lung cancer treatment was based on the use, alone or in combination, of radiotherapy, surgery&#xD;
      and chemotherapy. The scarce therapeutic options were further limited by their lack of&#xD;
      long-term efficacy, with a 5-year survival rate for lung cancer patients which ranged from&#xD;
      5-16%, and which remained unchanged from the 1970´s to the dawn of this new century.&#xD;
      Nowadays, the therapeutic outlook for lung cancer patients is changing dramatically. Novel&#xD;
      data regarding the molecular mechanisms of the disease led to the development of targeted&#xD;
      treatments, including Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) which can dramatically improve&#xD;
      outcomes in specific subgroups of lung cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase Translocation (ALK) Between 6-8% of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer&#xD;
      cases have been shown to harbor the fusion gene of echinoderm microtubule based protein-like4&#xD;
      (EML4) and the anaplastic lymphoma Kinase (ALK) because of a chromosomal inversion in 2p21&#xD;
      and 2p23.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The formation of ALK fusion proteins results in the activation and deregulation of gene&#xD;
      expression and signaling, which contributes to increased cell proliferation and survival in&#xD;
      tumors expressing these genes. This is supported by reports which state that the TRK-fused&#xD;
      gene (TFG) and kinesin family member 5B (KIF5B) genes may also serve as ALK fusion partners&#xD;
      in some patients with NSCLC. Expression of these ALK fusion genes causes their transformation&#xD;
      and enhanced proliferation. Tumors that contain the EML4-ALK fusion oncogene or its variants&#xD;
      are associated with specific clinical features, including never or light smoking history,&#xD;
      younger age, and adenocarcinoma with signet ring or acinar histology. Alterations of the ALK&#xD;
      gene are generally found in a mutually exclusive relationship with mutations in epidermal&#xD;
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) or Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS). Nonetheless, EGFR mutations may&#xD;
      develop as a resistance mechanism after treatment with ALK inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wild-type ALK is hardly expressed in most normal human tissues, but is expressed at higher&#xD;
      levels in a few limited types of tissues such as developing and mature tissue of the nervous&#xD;
      system (glial cells, neurons, endothelial cells and pericytes. In contrast, an aberrant ALK&#xD;
      with constitutively active kinase results from the formation of the EML4-ALK fusion gene by&#xD;
      chromosomal translocation and will likely be expressed in cells with this genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with advanced NSCLC who have this genetic abnormality are preferably treated with an&#xD;
      ALK inhibitor. This observation is based on a previous phase III study which compared&#xD;
      treatment with standard chemotherapy vs. crizotinib (ALK-TKI) in treatment-naïve patients&#xD;
      with ALK-rearrangement. Results from this trial demonstrated a prolonged progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) along with an improved response rate and quality of life in patients treated&#xD;
      with crizotinib. Due to a potentially confounding crossover effect, differences in overall&#xD;
      survival (OS) did not reach statistical significance. In spite of these encouraging results,&#xD;
      patients treated with crizotinib have short-lived responses, with an average of 10 months of&#xD;
      therapy before discontinuation. Other shortcomings of first-generation ALK-inhibitors include&#xD;
      their ineffectiveness in the context of the central nervous system as well as the development&#xD;
      of resistance mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Alectinib Alectinib is a second-generation ALK inhibitor that has activity in&#xD;
      crizotinib-resistant disease. Additionally, Alectinib has been shown to provide adequate CNS&#xD;
      activity and has a more complete blockade of ALK. It received FDA approval for first-line&#xD;
      treatment of ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC, as well as for patients who have progressed on or&#xD;
      are intolerant to crizotinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial approval of Alectinib for ALK-rearranged NSCLC previously treated with crizotinib&#xD;
      came in 2015. Bases for approval were derived from an initial study, in which 122 patients&#xD;
      with evaluable, ALK-rearranged, crizotinib-resistant disease were included. Eighty percent&#xD;
      had progressed after prior platinum-based chemotherapy. With a median follow-up of 47 weeks,&#xD;
      Alectinib was associated with an overall objective response rate (ORR) of 50%, a disease&#xD;
      control rate (DCR: objective response plus stable disease) of 79%, and a median duration of&#xD;
      response of 11 months. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 8.9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second phase II study including 69 patients with measurable advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC&#xD;
      who had progressed on crizotinib found that Alectinib was associated with an ORR of 48% at a&#xD;
      follow-up of 4.8 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, Alectinib received approval in 2017 and is now recommended as a first-line&#xD;
      therapeutic option in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. Approval was based on results from the trial&#xD;
      comparing alectinib (Alecensa) with crizotinib (Xalkori) as first-line treatment against&#xD;
      ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (ALEX) trial, a global study including 303 patients&#xD;
      which compared treatment with Alectinib vs. crizotinib for ALK-rearranged metastatic NSCLC&#xD;
      patients who had not received previous systemic therapy. Study results reported an improved&#xD;
      PFS, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.53. Additionally, patients receiving Alectinib had a&#xD;
      significantly lower incidence of CNS progression (12% vs. 45%) and a higher proportion of&#xD;
      patients with response duration of ≥12 months (64% vs. 36%). Further, grade 3 to 5 toxicities&#xD;
      were less frequent with Alectinib (41% vs. 50%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In another study published in 2017, the J-ALEX trial, 207 Japanese ALK-rearranged,&#xD;
      crizotinib-naïve NSCLC patients were randomly assigned to Alectinib vs. crizotinib. At a&#xD;
      planned interim analysis, results demonstrated improved PFS with Alectinib; median PFS was&#xD;
      not reached in the Alectinib arm compared to 10.2 months in the crizotinib arm (hazard ratio&#xD;
      [HR] 0.34, 99.7% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.17-0.70). Alectinib was also better tolerated,&#xD;
      with the most frequent adverse event being constipation (36%). Patients receiving crizotinib&#xD;
      experienced nausea (74%), diarrhea (73%), visual disturbances (55%), and alanine&#xD;
      aminotransferase (ALT)/ aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevations (&gt;30%), among other&#xD;
      toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to support the FDA approval for those who have progressed on or are intolerant to&#xD;
      crizotinib comes from two phase II studies, both demonstrating response rates to Alectinib of&#xD;
      approximately 50 percent in patients with ALK-rearranged locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC&#xD;
      who had progressed on crizotinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Brain Metastases Alectinib appears to have important clinical activity in patients with&#xD;
      brain metastases, including patients with symptomatic brain metastases, patients with&#xD;
      leptomeningeal disease, and patients who have CNS relapse on ceritinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alectinib has also demonstrated improved outcomes relative to crizotinib among patients with&#xD;
      brain metastases in 2 phase III trials. In the J-ALEX study, among 43 patients with&#xD;
      ALK-positive NSCLC with brain metastases, Alectinib demonstrated improved PFS relative to&#xD;
      crizotinib (HR 0.08, CI 0.01-0.61). Similarly, in ALEX, among those with CNS metastases,&#xD;
      Alectinib improved PFS relative to crizotinib (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.25-0.64) and intracranial&#xD;
      response rate (81% versus 50%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence of the activity of Alectinib among patients with brain metastases who have&#xD;
      crizotinib-resistant disease comes from phase II studies. In a pooled analysis of two phase&#xD;
      II studies, among 136 patients with baseline CNS metastases (70% of whom had prior CNS&#xD;
      radiotherapy) the CNS ORR, DCR, and duration of response for Alectinib were 43%, 85%, and&#xD;
      11.1 months, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a&#xD;
      potent endothelial-specific angiogenic factor that is expressed in a wide array of tumors. In&#xD;
      NSCLC, high levels of VEGF expression are associated with a poor prognosis, suggesting that&#xD;
      treatment targeted toward this pathway might be useful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One approach to blocking the VEGF pathway is the administration of bevacizumab, a recombinant&#xD;
      humanized monoclonal antibody (MoAb) that binds VEGF, thereby preventing its interaction with&#xD;
      the VEGF receptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For good performance status patients with non-squamous NSCLC, the addition of bevacizumab to&#xD;
      a platinum based doublet offers a higher response rate, a longer PFS, and improved OS&#xD;
      compared with chemotherapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of adding bevacizumab to platinum-based doublets is illustrated by the two largest&#xD;
      trials, in which bevacizumab was continued as maintenance after completion of the planned&#xD;
      chemotherapy In the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group trial E4599, 878 previously untreated&#xD;
      patients with advanced, non-squamous NSCLC were randomly assigned to paclitaxel plus&#xD;
      carboplatin or the same chemotherapy plus bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) on day 1 of each cycle.&#xD;
      Bevacizumab was continued as monotherapy on the same schedule after completion of six cycles&#xD;
      of chemotherapy until there was evidence of progressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receiving chemotherapy plus bevacizumab had statistically significant increases in&#xD;
      the ORR (35% vs. 15% with paclitaxel plus carboplatin alone), OS (median 12.3 vs. 10.3&#xD;
      months), one-year and two-year survival rates (51% vs. 44% and 23% vs. 15%, respectively),&#xD;
      and PFS (6.2 vs. 4.5 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the AVAiL trial, 1043 patients were randomly assigned to cisplatin plus gemcitabine every&#xD;
      three weeks with either low-dose bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg), high-dose bevacizumab (15 mg/kg),&#xD;
      or placebo on day 1 every three weeks. The cisplatin plus gemcitabine was continued for a&#xD;
      maximum of six cycles, while the bevacizumab or placebo was continued as maintenance until&#xD;
      there was evidence of progressive disease. PFS was significantly improved with both low-dose&#xD;
      and high-dose bevacizumab (median 6.7, 6.5, and 6.1 months, for the 7.5 mg/kg, 15 mg/kg, and&#xD;
      placebo groups, respectively). With a median follow-up of 13 months, the benefit in terms of&#xD;
      PFS was maintained, as was the improvement in response rate (38%, 35%, and 22%,&#xD;
      respectively). However, there were no significant differences in OS when comparing the three&#xD;
      treatment arms (median survival 13.6, 13.4, and 13.1 months respectively; HR for death 0.93&#xD;
      and 1.03 vs. placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a meta-analysis based upon four trials (2194 patients), the addition of bevacizumab&#xD;
      significantly increased both OS and PFS compared to chemotherapy alone (hazard ratios for&#xD;
      death or progression 0.90, 95% CI 0.81-0.99 and 0.72, 95% CI 0.66-0.79, respectively). The&#xD;
      effect on OS was significantly greater in patients with adenocarcinoma compared to other&#xD;
      histology subtypes. The addition of bevacizumab increased the risk of grade ≥3 toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bevacizumab and TKI (Anti EGFR) The combination therapy of bevacizumab plus a TKI has&#xD;
           been previously explored in a phase II trial. The study included 154 previously&#xD;
           untreated patients who were randomly assigned to erlotinib plus bevacizumab or erlotinib&#xD;
           alone. All patients´ tumors contained either an exon 19 deletion or the amino acid&#xD;
           substitution at position 858 in EGFR, from a leucine (L) to an arginine (R) (L858R)&#xD;
           mutation. PFS, the primary endpoint of the trial, was significantly increased with the&#xD;
           combination regimen (median 16 versus 9.7 months, HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.36-0.79). A similar&#xD;
           magnitude of benefit was seen with both types of mutation. OS data are pending.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alectinib and Bevacizumab To this date there is no published data of interaction and&#xD;
           clinical efficacy of a combination therapy with Alectinib plus bevacizumab in patients&#xD;
           with advanced NSCLC.&#xD;

The scale consists of two segments, one completed by the patient (9 items) and one completed by the health care professional (6 items). Scoring is assigned as follows: The patient scale consists of 9 visual analogue scales (100 mm horizontal line). Patient puts a mark on line to indicate intensity of response to the items in question (0 = lowest rating). The observer scale consists of a 5-point categorical scale (100=none; 75=mild; 50=moderate; 25=marked; 0=severe). The score is equal to the length of line marked by patient. An average of the aggregate score of all 9 items is the total score (0-100, 0= least symptom burden).</description>
