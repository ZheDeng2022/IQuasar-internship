  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is a randomized, non-blinded, single-centre trial in patients presenting&#xD;
      with 5 to 20 brain metastases. Eligible patients will be randomized to receive either&#xD;
      stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) alone or SRS plus whole brain radiation (WBRT).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current standard of care for patients with limited brain metastases (1 to 4) is&#xD;
      stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) alone. This has evolved from the traditional standard of care&#xD;
      in treating patients with whole brain radiation (WBRT). Studies in patients with limited&#xD;
      (less than 5) brain metastases have shown that WBRT is harmful with respect to neurocognition&#xD;
      and does not improve patient survival compared to SRS alone. As a result, SRS alone now is&#xD;
      considered the standard of care treatment for patients with limited metastases. However,&#xD;
      there is a lack of high quality prospective randomized evidence on the role of SRS in&#xD;
      patients with 5 or more brain metastases to guide treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study seeks to compare SRS alone versus SRS plus WBRT in patients with 5 to&#xD;
      20 brain metastases in a randomized, non-blinded, single-centre trial.&#xD;
