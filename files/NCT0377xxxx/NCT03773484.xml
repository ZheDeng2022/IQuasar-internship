      There is a lack of evidence that long-term opioid use offers benefit for noncancer pain and&#xD;
      an abundance of evidence of harm. The objective of the R21 pilot phase of the Application of&#xD;
      Economics &amp; Social psychology to improve Opioid Prescribing Safety (AESOPS) is to develop and&#xD;
      test novel behavioral nudges to encourage adherence to pain and CDC guidelines for opioid&#xD;
      prescribing for persons with noncancer pain. Interventions will leverage the electronic&#xD;
      health record (EHR) to discourage unnecessary opioid prescribing through the application of&#xD;
      &quot;behavioral insights&quot;-empirically-tested social and psychological interventions that affect&#xD;
      choice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a lack of evidence that long-term opioid use offers benefit for noncancer pain and&#xD;
      an abundance of evidence of harm. In 2017, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#xD;
      (CDC) issued the &quot;CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain&quot; to encourage safe&#xD;
      and effective alternatives to opioids, discontinuation of opioids when patients do not resume&#xD;
      normal activities and prudent dosing strategies. However, poor guideline adherence is a&#xD;
      general concern and may impede uptake. Our prior studies have used insights from behavioral&#xD;
      economics and social psychology to increase guideline adherence. The objective of the R21&#xD;
      pilot phase of the Application of Economics &amp; Social psychology to improve Opioid Prescribing&#xD;
      Safety (AESOPS) is to develop and test novel behavioral nudges to encourage adherence to pain&#xD;
      and CDC guidelines for opioid prescribing for persons with noncancer pain. At the time of&#xD;
      opioid prescribing, clinicians will be prompted with an EHR nudge when the prescribing&#xD;
      history for the patient falls into one of the following three mutually exclusive categories:&#xD;
      Opioid naïve, At-risk for long term use, or Long-term opioid recipient. The primary outcome&#xD;
      is average weekly morphine milligram equivalents (MME) prescribed per-clinician.&#xD;
