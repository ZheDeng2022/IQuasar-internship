  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate a decision support tool for patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Today, guideline concordant care options for patients diagnosed with DCIS are lumpectomy&#xD;
      (with or without radiation treatment) and mastectomy, with optional endocrine therapy.&#xD;
      Several ongoing trials are evaluating the safety of active monitoring (AM) as an alternative&#xD;
      to immediate surgery for select patient groups. Little is known about women's acceptability&#xD;
      of AM after a diagnosis with DCIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here the study team seeks to answer the question: if AM is found to be a safe alternative to&#xD;
      immediate surgery, how likely are women to choose it as their first course of treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, women are asked to imagine having recently been diagnosed with DCIS. For some&#xD;
      in the intervention arm, in-depth information about surgical options and AM are presented&#xD;
      with a web-based decision support tool. After exploring the decision support tool,&#xD;
      participants are asked to make a hypothetical treatment choice and to answer a series of&#xD;
      additional questions about their decision-making process and personal preferences. Women in&#xD;
      the control arm receive a reduced version of the decision support tool that only provides&#xD;
      in-depth information about the surgical options (AM is mentioned as an experimental&#xD;
      approach).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching hypothesis of this study is that patients who are offered AM as a&#xD;
      guideline-concordant care option (a potential future scenario if ongoing trials confirm the&#xD;
      safety of AM) are more likely to choose it compared to women in current clinical practice&#xD;
      (who receive information about surgical options only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary research question: Compared to presenting active monitoring (AM) as an experimental&#xD;
      option, does presenting AM as a guideline-concordant care option increase its uptake as&#xD;
      treatment choice?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary research questions: Compared to presenting active monitoring (AM) as an&#xD;
      experimental option, does presenting active monitoring as a guideline-concordant care option&#xD;
      increase AM acceptability, decrease perceived AM riskiness, and decrease uptake of mastectomy&#xD;
      as treatment choice?&#xD;
