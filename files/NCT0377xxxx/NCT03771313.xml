  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single center, prospective study of patients with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      cystic fibrosis (CF) and a history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA),&#xD;
      also known as oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ORSA), being treated with&#xD;
      intravenous ceftaroline. Patients will have intravenous ceftaroline dosed according to&#xD;
      current recommendations based upon its approved usage in pediatric patients for community&#xD;
      acquired pneumonia. The investigators will analyze pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      (PD) data using serum concentrations of ceftaroline measured at various time-points following&#xD;
      infusion of ceftaroline to develop PK/PD guided dosing strategies of ceftaroline in pediatric&#xD;
      CF patients that would be tailored to account for bacterial susceptibility and disease&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;

      This is an open-label, single center, prospective study of patients with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      cystic fibrosis (CF) and a history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA),&#xD;
      also known as oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ORSA), being treated with&#xD;
      intravenous ceftaroline. Patients will have intravenous ceftaroline dosed according to&#xD;
      current recommendations based upon its approved usage in pediatric patients for community&#xD;
      acquired pneumonia. The investigators will analyze pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      (PD) data using serum concentrations of ceftaroline measured at various time-points following&#xD;
      infusion of ceftaroline to develop PK/PD guided dosing strategies of ceftaroline in pediatric&#xD;
      CF patients that would be tailored to account for bacterial susceptibility and disease&#xD;
      progression and determine if current dosing regimes used are appropriate for this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected prior to infusion of ceftaroline and at approximately 1 hour&#xD;
      (+/- 10 minutes), 1.5 hours (+/- 10 minutes), 3 hours (+/- 30 minutes), and 6 hours (+/- 30&#xD;
      minutes) after initiation of infusion. The blood samples (0.5 to 1 ml) will be collected&#xD;
      through intravenous access, venipuncture, or capillary blood puncture. Samples will be&#xD;
      centrifuged at 1500g at 4°C for 15 minutes within 15 minutes of collection. Serum will be&#xD;
      separated into two aliquots of a minimum of 0.2 mL and stored at -70°C until analysis.&#xD;
      Determination of serum ceftaroline concentrations will be measured using high-performance&#xD;
      liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with ultraviolet (UV) detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key clinical data (PK/PD) that will be collected includes age, sex, genotype, growth&#xD;
      parameters, airway microbiology, sweat chloride values, pulmonary function test (FEV1),&#xD;
      concomitant medications, and comorbid disorders (i.e.: CF related diabetes, CF liver disease,&#xD;
      short gut, renal dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, coagulopathy).&#xD;
