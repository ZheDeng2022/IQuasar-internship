    <textblock>
      Treatment options for multiple myeloma have increased significantly over the last years with&#xD;
      the approval of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) and proteasome inhibitors (PIs). These&#xD;
      therapies have markedly improved overall survival for these patients to a median of 5-7&#xD;
      years. Due to the advanced age, the myeloma patient collective has a high prevalence of&#xD;
      pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities. In addition, the primary disease process&#xD;
      contributes to cardiovascular complications. With the beginning of anti-tumor therapy, an&#xD;
      increased incidence of cardiovascular complications in myeloma patients can be determined.&#xD;
      This includes hypertension, left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure and both arterial and&#xD;
      venous thromboembolic events. The detailed mechanism by which proteasome inhibitors and&#xD;
      immunomodulatory agents lead to increased cardiovascular events is not established at this&#xD;
      time. Endothelial dysfunction, as a possible mechanism of cardiovascular toxicity, is&#xD;
      difficult to assess. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is an noninvasive method to measure&#xD;
      endothelial function by assessing the change in the vasodilatative reserve of the brachial&#xD;
      artery. Several independent recent investigations implicate that vascular (endothelial)&#xD;
      dysfunction precedes hypertension and heart failure. This has been related to a reduced level&#xD;
      of metabolites of the l-arginine-nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        1. Anti-myeloma therapy exert vascular toxicity by limiting endothelial function.&#xD;
           Endothelial function, assessed by the change in the vasodilatative reserve of the&#xD;
           brachial artery (flow-mediated dilation = FMD) decreases after myeloma therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Treatment options for multiple myeloma have increased significantly over the last years with&#xD;
      the approval of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) and proteasome inhibitors (PIs). These&#xD;
      therapies have markedly improved overall survival for these patients to a median of 5-7&#xD;
      years, many continue to live for more than 10 years. Due to the advanced age, the myeloma&#xD;
      patient collective has a high prevalence of pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities. In&#xD;
      addition, the primary disease process contributes to cardiovascular complications. With the&#xD;
      beginning of anti-tumor therapy, an increased incidence of cardiovascular complications in&#xD;
      myeloma patients can be determined. This includes hypertension, left ventricular dysfunction,&#xD;
      heart failure and both arterial and venous thromboembolic events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proteasome inhibitors including bortezomib and carfilzomib, and immunomodulatory agents, e.g.&#xD;
      lenalidomide, represent cornerstone therapies for multiple myeloma. The most common therapy&#xD;
      choices are Bortezomib-based therapy (VCD, VC) and Carfilzomib-based therapy (KRD, KD).&#xD;
      Induction therapy is given 4-6 cycles followed by autologous hematopoietic cell&#xD;
      transplantation. Thereafter, many patients receive consolidation therapy. In patients not&#xD;
      eligible for autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation, a prolonged course of initial&#xD;
      chemotherapy is typically administered. The proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib is used&#xD;
      predominately in the front line setting, while second-generation carfilzomib is used in&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite their efficacy, increased rates of cardiovascular complications occur in patients&#xD;
      exposed to these particular therapies. Higher incidences of cardiac adverse events including&#xD;
      hypertension, arrhythmia, heart failure, ischemic heart disease and cardiomyopathy has been&#xD;
      reported in patients receiving carfilzomib and bortezomib. Immunomodulatory agents are known&#xD;
      to increase the risk of venous thromboembolic disease particularly when combined with&#xD;
      dexamethasone or other chemotherapy. Furthermore, increased incidence of myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (MI) and cerebrovascular events has been demonstrated in patients treated with&#xD;
      lenalidomide. The mechanism of PI- and IMiD-associated cardiotoxicity is not fully&#xD;
      elucidated. PIs inhibit proteasome activity, leading to the accumulation of abnormal proteins&#xD;
      which in turn activates apoptotic pathways in myeloma cells. IMiDs bind cereblon, a component&#xD;
      of the E3 ubiquitin ligase which promotes proteasome-mediated degradation of the&#xD;
      transcription factors, IKZF1 and IKZF. It is unclear if the protein degradation properties of&#xD;
      these drugs contribute to cardiotoxicity, although clinical features of the toxicity suggest&#xD;
      endothelial cell injury and dysfunction. It is possible that CV events may be augmented when&#xD;
      these two classes of medications are co-administered and further enhanced by the additional&#xD;
      endothelial stress conferred by steroids. The detailed mechanism by which proteasome&#xD;
      inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents lead to increased cardiovascular events is not&#xD;
      established at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial dysfunction, as a possible mechanism of cardiovascular toxicity, is difficult to&#xD;
      assess. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is an noninvasive method to measure endothelial function&#xD;

      independent recent investigations implicate that vascular (endothelial) dysfunction precedes&#xD;
      hypertension and heart failure. This has been related to a reduced level of metabolites of&#xD;

    <description>The questionnaire is comprised of 21 important physical, emotional and socioeconomic ways heart failure can adversely affect a patient's life. After receiving brief standardized instructions, the patient marks a 0 (zero) to 5 scale to indicate how much each itemized adverse of heart failure has prevented the patient from living as he or she wanted to live during the past 4 weeks. The questionnaire is simply scored by summation of all 21 responses.</description>

    <description>The SF-36 consists of 36 questions and is a general health questionnaire that provides information about the health status of the patient through 8 different dimensions. He makes statements about:&#xD;
General Health Perception, Physical Health, Restricted physical role function, Physical pain, Vitality, Mental Healt, Restricted emotional role function, Social functioning. For the evaluation of the SF-36 questionnaire v1.0 you first recode all answers in predefined points using a recoding table. Then you calculate the average score of all questions of the respective health dimension, e.g. physical health, so you have 8 average points for the 8 dimensions. These 8 scores now describe the health status of the patient in their respective dimensions, which can then be assessed using comparison charts.&#xD;
The possible score ranges from 0 to 100 points. 0 points represent the greatest possible restriction of health, while 100 points represent the absence of health restrictions.</description>
