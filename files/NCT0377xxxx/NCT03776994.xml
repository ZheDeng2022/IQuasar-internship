    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      non-adjuvanted and adjuvanted monovalent VEE VLP Vaccine in healthy adults (ages 18-50 years)&#xD;
      when administered via intramuscular (IM) injection at escalating doses of 2 μg, 10 μg, and 20&#xD;
      μg as a 2-dose primary series (Day 0, Day 28) with a Day 140 booster dose. The secondary&#xD;
      objective of the study is to evaluate immunogenicity of the vaccine at the aforementioned&#xD;
      time points&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 dose escalation study will evaluate safety and immunogenicity of both&#xD;
      non-adjuvanted and adjuvanted VEE VLP vaccine in three dose groups (2 μg, 10 μg, and 20 μg)&#xD;
      given as a 2-dose primary series IM injection (Days 0 and Week 4 [Day 28]) followed by a&#xD;
      booster dose injection (Week 20 [Day 140]). Each group will consist of 30 subjects, for a&#xD;
      total of 90 study subjects. Each group of 30 subjects will be randomized to receive either&#xD;
      non-adjuvanted vaccine (Subgroup A; n=15) or adjuvanted vaccine (Subgroup B; n=15). Subjects&#xD;
      will be blinded to receiving the non-adjuvanted versus adjuvanted vaccine, but will not be&#xD;
      blinded to the vaccine dosage. Enrollment will utilize a sentinel dose design, with only one&#xD;
      subject receiving a vaccine dose the initial day, 2 subjects the following day, and 3&#xD;
      subjects the subsequent day, before proceeding with further enrollments in that group.&#xD;
      Subjects in each Group will be randomized to receive the vaccine dose either without adjuvant&#xD;
      (Subgroup A) or with adjuvant (Subgroup B).&#xD;

    <masking_description>Subjects will be blinded to receiving the non-adjuvanted versus adjuvanted vaccines, but will not be blinded to the vaccine dosage. Vaccines will be brought into the subject rooms in a concealed container, and subjects will be asked to turn away from the dosing arm so that the SRI Clinical Trials' Unit (CTU) staff can prepare and administer the dose. Subjects may be unblinded if subject experiences a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) and upon notification to the data review team, called Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT).</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of subjects reporting solicited local adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Through the study duration of 44 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>• The solicited local adverse events (SLAEs) are specified and collected in daily diary questionnaires for 1 week after each vaccination in each arm of the study (Days 0-7, 28-35, and 140-147). These SLAEs include pain, tenderness, induration or swelling, and erythema. Symptoms are counted once if subjects experienced the symptom at any severity during the reporting period. The number of local symptoms is the total of one or more local symptom at any severity. The severity of the SLAEs will be graded as Mild (Grade 1), Moderate (Grade 2), Severe (Grade 3) or Potentially Life Threatening (Grade 4). SLAEs will be characterized according to the &quot;Toxicity grading scale for healthy adult and adolescent volunteers enrolled in preventative vaccine trials&quot; FDA Guidance for Industry (Sept 2007). The frequency of SLAEs will each be expressed as the number of subjects experiencing these adverse events for the 3 vaccinations within each of the 6 arms of the study.</description>

Symptoms are counted once if subjects experienced the symptom at any severity during the reporting period. The number of systemic symptoms is the total of one or more systemic symptom at any severity.
