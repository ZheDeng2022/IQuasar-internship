  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perinatal (around the time of birth) mental health disorders are common difficulties of&#xD;
      pregnancy. Perinatal depression is made up of major and minor depressive events during&#xD;
      pregnancy and the first 12 months after delivery. It is estimated that 11%-19% of mothers&#xD;
      suffer from perinatal depression. However, rates may be significantly higher among some&#xD;
      subpopulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Left untreated, post partum depression (PPD) is linked with several significant negative&#xD;
      health impacts on the mother, her infant, and their families. PPD is linked with lower&#xD;
      quality maternal-child relationship, and this change in emotional attachment can lead to&#xD;
      physiologic changes and poorer cognitive outcomes in the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maternal mental health effect of postpartum&#xD;
      depression screening and intervention during infants' short term hospitalizations. The study&#xD;
      is also aiming to define effects of PPD short term hospitalization interventions on maternal&#xD;
      PPD follow up and child health based on well child care (WCC), emergency department (ED)&#xD;
      visits, hospital readmissions, and parent's feelings on child's health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Study participants will complete a survey about their general needs and access to resources&#xD;
      and a survey to screen for postpartum depression to determine if the participant will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Based on the answers provided, the study team may recommend that the participant&#xD;
      seek additional medical care, and may notify the participant's doctor, the child's doctor,&#xD;
      and hospital officials if the study team believes that the participant needs further medical&#xD;
      care for depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Half of the study participants will receive a social work consult and treatment with&#xD;
      psychology therapy in the hospital. The psychology therapy will be 2-3 fifty-minute therapy&#xD;
      sessions while the child is in the hospital. An outpatient psychiatry/psychology follow up&#xD;
      appointment will be offered if needed as per routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discharge Follow Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A discharge follow up questionnaire and survey will be completed on an electronic tablet&#xD;
      around the time of the baby's discharge home from the hospital or within 1 week of being at&#xD;
      home. The survey can be completed over the phone or it can be sent via email or text to&#xD;
      complete the survey online.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One Month Follow Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A one-time follow up questionnaire and survey will be completed 1 month after discharge from&#xD;
      the hospital. The survey can be completed in approximately 5 - 10 minutes over the phone or&#xD;
      it can be sent via email or text to complete the survey online.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other half of the study participants will receive social work consult with information&#xD;
      about follow up options for PPD per current standard of care for mothers identified as having&#xD;
      postpartum depression in the hospital setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of this study a review of the child's medical record, including data collection, will&#xD;
      be performed.&#xD;

    <description>PPD score will be measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). A score less than 8 suggests depression is not likely. A score of 9-11 suggests depression is possible. A score of 12-13 indicates fairly high possibility of depression. A score of 14 and higher suggest probable depression. Positive score of 1, 2 or 3 on question 10 suggests there is a suicidality risk.</description>
