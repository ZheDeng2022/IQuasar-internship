  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a new anti-cancer drug durvalumab (MEDI4736) with or without&#xD;
      another new anti-cancer drug Oleclumab (MEDI9447) before surgery for bladder cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Durvalumab (MEDI4736)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oleclumab (MEDI9447)&#xD;

      This research study is a Feasibility Study, which is the first time investigators are&#xD;
      examining these drugs, Durvalumab (MEDI4736) and Oleclumab (MEDI9447) in patients with&#xD;
      muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) cancer prior to surgery. Cisplatin-containing&#xD;
      chemotherapy given before surgery is the standard of care in patients with MIBC because it&#xD;
      increases the rate of cure after surgery. Participants may still be eligible for this study&#xD;
      if their doctor determines that participants are able to receive cisplatin-containing&#xD;
      chemotherapy, but the participants elect not to undergo chemotherapy before surgery,&#xD;
      understanding the potential benefits of chemotherapy. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration) has not approved Durvalumab (MEDI4736) for localized bladder cancer prior to&#xD;
      surgery, but it has been approved for other uses, including for locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic bladder cancer after progression on platinum-containing chemotherapy. The FDA (the&#xD;
      U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Oleclumab (MEDI9447) as a treatment for&#xD;
      any disease. Durvalumab is a monoclonal antibody (an antibody is a protein produced by the&#xD;
      body's immune system) that works by blocking the Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1), a&#xD;
      protein on cancer cells that stops the body's immune system from killing cancer cells, to&#xD;
      increase the body's immune response to prevent or slow down cancer growth. Oleclumab is a&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody that works by reducing the amount of adenosine, a small molecule called a&#xD;
      metabolite that binds to adenosine receptors on immune cells to regulate the immune system&#xD;
      and suppress the immune response. Reducing the amount of immunosuppressive adenosine can&#xD;
      increase the body's immune response to kill cancer cells. It is hoped that by combining&#xD;
      Oleclumab with Durvalumab, an even greater immune response against the tumor will be&#xD;
      generated. This research study is designed to see if the new anti-cancer drug Durvalumab&#xD;
      (MEDI4736) with or without another new anti-cancer drug Oleclumab (MEDI9447) can be safely&#xD;
      administered before surgery for bladder cancer&#xD;
