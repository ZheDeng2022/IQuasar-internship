  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the effect of rapid maxillary expansion with&#xD;
      and without microosteoperforation in patients with skeletal maxillary&#xD;
      constriction.Theoretically, the force generated by the activation of the Hyrax expander leads&#xD;
      initially to the compression of the periodontal ligament, bending of the alveolar bone, and&#xD;
      tipping of the anchor teeth. This in turn contributes to the unfavorable changes in the&#xD;
      supporting tissues; such as root resorption, buccal crown tipping, reduction of buccal bone&#xD;
      thickness, marginal bone loss and alveolar bone fenestration and dehiscence. In this trial,&#xD;
      it is assumed that by reducing the cortical bone resistance, using micro-osteoperforation&#xD;
      (MOP), the alveolar bone bending and buccal tipping that usually occur during expansion will&#xD;
      be reduced and thus facilitating the bone expansion.&#xD;

      The study consists of 2 groups that are divided divided equally and randomly.The first group&#xD;
      will receive a tooth borne Hyrax expander supported on first premolar and first permanent&#xD;
      molar , whereas the second group will receive the same appliance associated with&#xD;
      microosteoperforation(MOP). The MOP will be performed on the buccal segment bilaterally along&#xD;
      the maxilla starting from the distal of the canine till the distal of the first permanent&#xD;
      molar. The assessment will be done using CBCT scans immediately after expansion and 6 months&#xD;
      postretention.&#xD;
