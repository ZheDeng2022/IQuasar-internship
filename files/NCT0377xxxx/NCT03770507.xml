  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to understand how different kinds of exercise affect&#xD;
      the human body and the health of the heart and lungs. For example, some people like to&#xD;
      exercise continuously for relatively long periods of time while others like to exercise for&#xD;
      short periods of time with rest periods in between. Children tend to exercise in frequent&#xD;
      bouts of brief exercise interspersed with periods of rest. Also, some people like running or&#xD;
      treadmill exercise while others like to work out on stationary bicycles. To date, standard&#xD;
      exercise testing is based on a century-old paradigm used predominantly for adults that&#xD;
      involves maximal exercise protocols (cardiopulmonary exercise testing-CPET). Moreover,&#xD;
      different but widely used exercise modalities such as cycle ergometer and treadmills are&#xD;
      currently impossible to compare in children, and this has limited the clinical and research&#xD;
      application of such testing in the pediatric age-range. A major premise of this laboratory is&#xD;
      that laboratory testing of cardiopulmonary fitness in children should be based on protocols&#xD;
      that mimic naturally occurring patterns of exercise in children, rather than those that have&#xD;
      been artificially employed to assess maximal efforts in adults. This research project&#xD;
      designed to begin the process of systematically identifying protocols can be best used for&#xD;
      children and young adults. Participants will exercise in different protocols on a bicycle&#xD;
      ergometer or treadmill. This research could lead to improved and more accurate fitness&#xD;
      assessment and pave the way to an improved personalized exercise program in health and&#xD;
      illness.&#xD;
