  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a florid presentation of alcoholic liver disease characterized by&#xD;
      liver failure in the context of recent and heavy alcohol consumption. The condition carries a&#xD;
      high fatality risk; patients with severe AH have a 30% mortality rate at 90 days after&#xD;
      presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there is no effective treatment for severe alcoholic hepatitis. Based on our&#xD;
      current understanding of the disease pathogenesis IL-1 (interleukin) is a key mediator of&#xD;
      hepatic inflammation responsible for metabolic disturbances, fibrogenesis stellate cell&#xD;
      activation and consequently portal hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Canakinumab is a licensed monoclonal antibody inhibitor of IL-1 and may consequently reverse&#xD;
      the adverse effects of the cytokine in patients with this disorder. Therefore, the main&#xD;
      objective of the ISAIAH trial is to explore the potential benefits of the IL-1β antibody,&#xD;
      Canakinumab (solution for injection), in the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ISAIAH is a multicentre, double blind, randomized (1:1), placebo controlled trial. The trial&#xD;
      will follow patients up for 90 days and will be conducted in centres across the United&#xD;
      Kingdom. Twenty-six patients will be recruited to each arm of the trial: total 52 patients.&#xD;

      The main objective of the ISAIAH trial is to explore the potential benefits of the IL-1β&#xD;
      antibody, Canakinumab (solution for injection), in the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ISAIAH is a multicentre, double blind, randomized (1:1), placebo controlled trial. The trial&#xD;
      will follow patients up for 90 days and will be conducted in centres across the United&#xD;
      Kingdom. Twenty-six patients will be recruited to each arm of the trial: total 52 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be conducted in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis (mDF* ≥ 32 and MELD&#xD;
      ≤27) with treatment initiated during an index hospital admission with the condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the trial is histological improvement of alcoholic hepatitis on liver&#xD;
      biopsy after 28 days of treatment compared to baseline. Histological improvement is defined&#xD;
      as a reduction in lobular inflammation (regardless of cell type).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients meeting the eligibility criteria will be randomized and treated. A single dose of 3&#xD;
      mg/kg Canakinumab or identical placebo will be administered intravenously at baseline (Day&#xD;
      1). Canakinumab will be made up by dilution in 100 ml 5% Dextrose by an unblinded research&#xD;
      personnel at each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with AST &gt;2 x ULN on Day 28 will receive a second dose of 3 mg/kg study drug&#xD;
      administered i.v. on Day 28. Patients who received placebo on baseline will receive placebo.&#xD;
      Patients who received canakinumab on baseline will receive canakinumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total follow up time for each patient is 90 days.&#xD;
