             medications 7 days prior to admission. Occasional use of paracetamol or ibuprofen (up&#xD;
             to 1000 mg and 400 mg/day respectively) are acceptable. Routine vitamins and&#xD;
             supplements are permissible at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to allow intravenous medication to be administered.&#xD;

             a condom and a second highly effective method (i.e., hormonal contraceptive,&#xD;
             intra-uterine device) or abstinence for the duration of the study. Should a woman&#xD;
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must&#xD;
             inform her treating physician immediately. Males should continue with the&#xD;
             aforementioned contraception for 90 days after the last dose and females should&#xD;
             continue with the aforementioned contraception for 60 days after last dose.&#xD;
