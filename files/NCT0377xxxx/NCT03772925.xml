    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies side effects and best dose of pevonedistat and belinostat in&#xD;
      treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome that has come back&#xD;
      (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Chemotherapy drugs, such as&#xD;
      pevonedistat and belinostat, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for a regimen&#xD;
      combining MLN4924 (pevonedistat) with belinostat in patients with refractory/relapsed acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the toxicities of this regimen. II. To observe and record anti-tumor activity.&#xD;
      III. If responses are observed, to determine what relationship, if any, exists between such&#xD;
      responses and TP53/FLT3 mutational status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To describe pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions, if any, between MLN4924 (pevonedistat) and&#xD;
      belinostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To test the feasibility of performing correlative studies involving nuclear RelA,&#xD;
      phosphorylated (p)-ATR, p-Chk1, Cdt-1, gammaH2A.X, p-HH3, ClCasp3, NQO1, SLC7A11, ATF3, B2M,&#xD;
      GCLM, GSR, MAG1, RPLP0, SRXN1, TXNRD1, UBC, p-BRCA1, p-FANCD2, Ac-H3K56, Ac-H4K16, p-Wee1,&#xD;
      CtIP, BCL-2, BIM, BCL-xL, or MCL-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive belinostat intravenously (IV) once daily (QD) over 30 minutes on days 1-5&#xD;
      and pevonedistat IV QD over 60 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5. Cycles repeat every 21 days in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 2&#xD;
      months for 2 years.&#xD;

An ordinal regression (where best clinical responses are considered as an ordinal outcome variable) and a logistic regression (where best responses are dichotomized as yes or no responses) will be used to test the association between responses and TP53/FLT3 mutational status, with adjustment of potential factors (e.g., dose level, age, sex, etc.).</description>

          -  Pregnant or nursing. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test performed within 7 days prior to the start of study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Pregnant women are excluded from this study because MLN4924 (pevonedistat)&#xD;
                  is a NEDD8 inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects&#xD;
                  and because belinostat may cause teratogenicity and/or embryo-fetal lethality by&#xD;
                  virtue of targeting actively dividing cells. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
                  potential risk for adverse events (AEs) in nursing infants secondary to treatment&#xD;
                  of the mother with MLN4924 (pevonedistat) or belinostat, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
                  discontinued if the mother is treated with MLN4924 (pevonedistat)/belinostat&#xD;
