  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to determine whether it is safe and practical to&#xD;
      give CK0801 (a Cord blood-derived T-regulatory cell product) to patients with bone marrow&#xD;
      failure syndrome. Researchers want to determine the highest possible dose that is safe to be&#xD;
      given. Researchers also want to learn if CK0801 may improve the symptoms of bone marrow&#xD;
      failure syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in this study will all have been diagnosed with treatment refractory bone&#xD;
      marrow failure syndrome (which includes aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or&#xD;
      myelofibrosis). Participants eligible to participate in this study are unable or unwilling to&#xD;
      be treated with standard therapy or have failed standard therapy.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine dose-limiting toxicity of CK0801 as defined as any of the events each start at&#xD;
      the time of CK00801 infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Severe (grade 3 or 4) infusion toxicity within 24 hours (NCI-CTCAE V4.0)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Regimen related death within 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Severe (grade 3 or 4) Cytokine Release Syndrome within 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Preliminary assessment of disease-specific response&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Duration of disease-specific response&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects who fulfill the diagnostic criteria of bone marrow failure syndrome&#xD;
             including: aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or myelofibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. HLA matched (≥ 3/6) cord blood unit available for CK0801 generation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects age ≥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Bilirubin ≤ 2 x ULN and SGPT (ALT) ≤ 2 x ULN (unless Gilbert's syndrome is&#xD;
             documented).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Calculated creatinine clearance of &gt; 50mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault equation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Zubrod performance status ≤ 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Female subjects of child bearing potential (FPCP) must have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test. NOTE: FPCP is defined as premenopausal and not surgically sterilized.&#xD;
             FPCP must agree to use maximally effective birth control or to abstain from&#xD;
             heterosexual activity throughout the study. Effective contraceptive methods include&#xD;
             intra-uterine device, oral and/or injectable hormonal; contraception, or 2 adequate&#xD;
             barrier methods (e.g., cervical cap with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject has agreed to abide by all protocol required procedures including&#xD;
             study-related assessments, visits and long term follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject is willing and able to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has received an investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to CK0801 infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has received radiation or chemotherapy within 21 days prior to CK0801&#xD;
             infusion.&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Subjects with uncontrolled inter-current illness that in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator would place the patient at greater risk of severe toxicity and/or impair&#xD;
             the activity of CK0801&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects is pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
