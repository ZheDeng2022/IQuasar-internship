  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Essential tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder in the United States and affects&#xD;
      up to 5% of the population. ET patients experience involuntary shaking of the hands, head&#xD;
      and/or voice that can range from mildly limiting to severely disabling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment options are limited and there are currently no medications specifically designed to&#xD;
      treat it, and medications that are prescribed to relieve tremors are often limited by either&#xD;
      inadequate efficacy or intolerable side effects. A subset of essential tremor patients whose&#xD;
      tremors are inadequately treated by medication choose to undergo deep brain stimulation (DBS)&#xD;
      of the ventral intermediate thalamic nucleus. DBS has been shown to be highly effective for&#xD;
      tremor suppression. However, DBS carries significant risks. As a result, a very small (less&#xD;
      than 3%) percentage of essential tremor patients undergo DBS therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical technology company Cala Health has developed a wristband device (the Cala TWO)&#xD;
      that offers individuals with essential tremor a novel non-pharmacological, non-invasive&#xD;
      alternative, in the form of stimulation of peripheral nerves, to aid in hand tremor relief.&#xD;
      This innovative form of therapy has the potential to have important health, quality of life,&#xD;
      and economic benefits for essential tremor patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present pilot study (Aim 1) will assess the effectiveness of 3-month twice daily&#xD;
      treatment with the Cala TWO device to aid in the relief of hand tremors in adult essential&#xD;
      tremor subjects that have been approved to undergo deep brain stimulation surgery at Mayo&#xD;
      Clinic - Rochester. This study is a prospective, within subject, non-significant risk study&#xD;
      at Mayo Clinic - Rochester, enrolling approximately 20 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A completely optional component of this study (Aim 2) is seeking to perform three standard&#xD;
      PET/CT sessions on a subset of these subjects (n=10) at Mayo Clinic - Rochester to evaluate&#xD;
      changes in brain metabolic activity as a result of 3 months treatment with the device. The&#xD;
      first session would take place upon a subjects entry into the study (start of month 1) and&#xD;
      prior to any treatment with the Cala device, a second the following day after a 40 minute&#xD;
      treatment period with the Cala device, and a third session at the end of the third month.&#xD;
      This study is a prospective, within subject, greater than minimum risk study.&#xD;

      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary research question is whether customized patterned transcutaneous afferent&#xD;
      electrical stimulation to the median and radial nerves via the Cala TWO wrist-band device&#xD;
      significantly reduces hand tremors in individuals diagnosed with essential tremor that have&#xD;
      been approved as candidates for deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. A second research&#xD;
      question is whether three months of treatment with the Cala TWO device leads to significant&#xD;
      changes in regional brain metabolism that is associated with therapeutic efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims, purpose, or objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Determine the clinical efficacy of the Cala TWO device to transiently reduce hand&#xD;
      tremors in the treated hand of subjects with essential tremor (n=20) over a three month&#xD;
      treatment period prior to their undergoing DBS surgery for treatment of essential tremor at&#xD;
      Mayo Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Compare regional brain metabolism between baseline, after acute stimulation with the&#xD;
      Cala TWO device, and at exit 3 months after therapeutic treatment with the Cala TWO device.&#xD;
      18Ffluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/Computerized Tomography (CT)&#xD;
      scans will be applied in a subset (n=10) of essential tremor subjects to evaluate changes in&#xD;
      brain tissue metabolic activity corresponding to regional glucose uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the Cala TWO device Study: Subjects will be recruited exclusively from adult&#xD;
      essential tremor (ET) patients that have been approved by Mayo Clinic Deep Brain Stimulation&#xD;
      Group (comprised of neurosurgeons, neurologists, psychiatrists, and radiologists) to undergo&#xD;
      deep brain stimulation surgery at Mayo Clinic - Rochester for the treatment of ET. As such,&#xD;
      subjects that consent to this study are expected to readily meet the pre-specified inclusion&#xD;
      criteria noted below for participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless, all subjects will be pre-screened against the inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
      through face-to-face interviews. Additionally, baseline function and tremor severity will be&#xD;
      collected in the first visit phase of the study. Subjects already taking medications for ET&#xD;
      will be permitted these medications during the study with no changes in medication type or&#xD;
      dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be fitted with a Cala TWO device based on the subject's wrist circumference&#xD;
      (small, medium, or large) and stimulation hand (right or left) at the beginning of the study&#xD;
      visit. The stimulation hand will be the hand with more severe tremor (or the dominant hand if&#xD;
      both hands had equal tremor severity) as determined by the TETRAS task completed during the&#xD;
      baseline evaluation and pre-surgery clinical evaluation by the Mayo Clinic DBS group. Once&#xD;
      the Cala TWO device has been fitted to the subject's hand a frequency calibration procedure&#xD;
      will be conducted in which the subject's tremor frequency will be determined while the&#xD;
      subject performs a forward postural hold task. This frequency will then be incorporated into&#xD;
      the therapeutic stimulation waveform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulation will consist of a series of charge balanced biphasic pulses delivered at a&#xD;
      frequency of 150 Hz, 300 µs pulse width, and 50 µs inter-pulse period. The stimulation will&#xD;
      be alternated between the median and radial nerve at a frequency equal to tremor frequency&#xD;
      (i.e. for a measured 5 Hz tremor frequency, stimulation will be applied over the median nerve&#xD;
      for 200 msec, then alternated to be applied over the radial nerve for 200 msec). To determine&#xD;
      the stimulation amplitude, the site study neurologist will increase the stimulation level by&#xD;
      0.25 mA steps until the subject reports sensation of the stimulus in areas in the hand or&#xD;
      finger area. Final stimulation amplitude will be chosen to be the highest level of&#xD;
      stimulation below muscle contraction that the subject finds comfortable (mean: 5.4 mA +/-&#xD;
      2.9). Once the maximum tolerable stimulation level has been identified, subjects will receive&#xD;
      stimulation at that level during the 40-minute stimulation session. Adverse events will be&#xD;
      collected before, during, and after each stimulation session. Subjects will then receive&#xD;
      device training and instructions by on-site study personnel for conducting daily home&#xD;
      stimulation sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Statement: This is a pilot study with a unique subject cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be used to assess the statistical significance&#xD;
      of the difference in the mean change in tremor before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be measured as the change in the TETRAS scale measure of upper limb tremor&#xD;
      following stimulation compared with pre-stimulation. Additional analyses will include the&#xD;
      Bain &amp; Findley 4-point scale assessment of typical Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and the&#xD;
      Patient Global Impression - Severity (PGI-S) 7-point scale of the subjects' personal&#xD;
      assessment of how much their tremor level improved or worsened relative to their baseline&#xD;
      state prior to the stimulation session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary safety endpoint will be an analysis of adverse events types and rates for all&#xD;
      enrolled subjects, where the adverse event rate will be calculated as the percentage of total&#xD;
      subjects with an adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to recruit subjects (n=10; age 21-70) from the population of&#xD;
      subjects that have enrolled in the Cala TWO device which is a 3-month treatment duration&#xD;
      study with the Cala TWO device prior to subject's scheduled deep brain stimulation surgery.&#xD;
      This optional component of this study will perform three standard PET/CT sessions on these&#xD;
      subjects at the Mayo Clinic Molecular Research Imaging Facility to evaluate changes in brain&#xD;
      tissue metabolic activity as a result of 3 months treatment with the device. The advanced&#xD;
      clinical PET scanner PET/CT will be used in this study, equipped with digital silicon&#xD;
      photomultiplier detectors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First session: Takes place upon a subject's entry into the Cala TWO study (start of month 1)&#xD;
      and prior to any treatment with the Cala device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second session: Takes place the following day after a 40 minute treatment period with the&#xD;
      Cala device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third session: Takes place at the end of the third month of use of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimizing the Radiation Risk: By using an advanced clinical PET scanner, equipped with&#xD;
      digital silicon photomultiplier detectors, the investigators will be using a reduced&#xD;
      intravenous delivered dose of FDG (8 mCi).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attenuation Correction Scans: For PET/CT, a low-dose CT fusion skull scan (~1min) will be&#xD;
      acquired for attenuation correction and anatomical co-registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step-by-Step Schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDG scan slots are available at 7:30am, 8:00am, 8:30am, and 10:30am. Participants with&#xD;
      head tremor would present problems in obtaining quality scans. If this is the case, a head&#xD;
      secure procedure will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A 4 hour fast is required prior to FDG injection. Patients are given instructions to&#xD;
           remain well-hydrated and have a low carbohydrate diet 18 hours before their appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. No significant alcohol or caffeine consumption and no usage of the Cala TWO device&#xD;
           within 8 hours of a PET session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Blood sugar level will be checked by a finger-poke blood test. Fasting blood glucose&#xD;
           should be under 200 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Women of child-bearing potential will go through a urine-pregnancy test, unless there is&#xD;
           proof of negative results within 48 hours before the exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 8 mCi FDG injection through IV and rest at the uptake room (eyes open in a dimly lit&#xD;
           room).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. At 30 minute uptake time, conduct a PET/CT scan for a 15 min. A 1 min CT fusion skull&#xD;
           image will be acquired for attenuation correction and anatomical co-registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Statement: This is a pilot study with a unique subject cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CortexID (GE Medical Systems, LLC) and MIMneuro (MIM Software Inc.) will be used to confirm&#xD;
      quality control of the PET image. Additional quantitative analysis of PET images will be&#xD;
      conducted using SPM, FSL, and Analyze. CortexID. This quantification procedure uses a&#xD;
      patient-specific FDG z-score map derived by comparing the surface projection map (z-SPM) with&#xD;
      an age- and sex-matched normal control FDG database.&#xD;
