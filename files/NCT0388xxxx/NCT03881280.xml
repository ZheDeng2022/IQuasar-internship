  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to test an evidence-based intervention, allocated to a mobile app&#xD;
      designed to parents and their children with 3 to 6 years old, identified by family doctors or&#xD;
      nurses at well-child care visits as overweight or obese for age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This intervention aims to improve parent's perceptions and attitudes regarding children's&#xD;
      weight status and food intake, leading to better dietary intake and children's' eating&#xD;
      behaviors through positive parental child-feeding practices. In this study, the investigators&#xD;
      aim to assess the feasibility of the intervention and explore its impact on the beliefs and&#xD;
      attitudes of parents.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will enroll parents and their children with 3 to 6 years old, identified by&#xD;
      family doctors or nurses at well-child care visits as overweight/obese for age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant's eligibility will be assessed. Participants will be randomized to: 1) control&#xD;
      group; 2) intervention group. The control group will receive treatment as usual. Parents in&#xD;
      the intervention group will be provided with the app and invited to use it for 4 weeks.&#xD;
      During the 4 weeks, the administrator monitors the app usage and call once to parents to&#xD;
      improve it, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will perform a pre- and post-test, evaluating parent's perceptions and attitudes&#xD;
      regarding children's weight status and food intake; eating behaviors and parental&#xD;
      child-feeding practices.&#xD;

    <description>Increase Children's Satiety Responsiveness. This was evaluated by the mean score of 5 items of Children's Eating Behavior Questionnaire.Satiety Responsiveness reflects the ability to regulate the amount of food eaten, based on perceived fullness. Parents answered in a 5-point Likert scale (0 = never; 5 = always), with higher values reflecting higher punctuation in each subscale. A version of this questionnaire has been previously validated and adapted to Portuguese children aged 3-13 years (Viana, Sinde, &amp; Saxton, 2008).</description>

    <description>Parenting education program through the app Fammeal. It includes educational content, tailored to parents and centered on positive parenting child-feeding practices. The app will also include a virtual-pet game for children, in order to help them self-regulate their intake.&#xD;
Through the app, parents will:&#xD;
Fill in a registration questionnaire, which will tailor recommendations.&#xD;
Receive information and video content recommendations.&#xD;
Set goals related to their child's lifestyle and tracking progress.&#xD;
Earn points by watching the contents.&#xD;
Invite children to play a serious game.&#xD;
Exchange messages with other users.&#xD;
The investigators created a support website that connects to the main server to get data gathered from the mobile app and game.</description>
