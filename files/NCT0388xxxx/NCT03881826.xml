  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This cohort study aims to investigate the composition and activity of the gut microbiota of&#xD;
      patients newly diagnosed for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), in relationship with their food&#xD;
      habits and cachectic hallmarks. The recruitment for this study is currently ongoing with the&#xD;
      help of clinicians, nurses and data managers at the Saint-Luc clinics, University Hospital&#xD;
      Leuven (Campus Gasthuisberg) and University Hospital Gent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      •To assess the composition and activity of the gut microbiota in patients with acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (AML) compared to matched control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate correlations between the gut microbiota, cachectic hallmarks and gut&#xD;
           microbiota-related markers in the blood (gut permeability markers, microbial compounds,&#xD;
           microbial metabolites).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the changes in the gut microbial ecosystem that are induced by&#xD;
           chemotherapy and associated with colitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess whether the composition of the gut microbiota can predict the severity of&#xD;
           chemotherapy-related colitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an academic multi-centric prospective study. The study is composed of two cohorts&#xD;
      (Fig. 1). In Cohort A, patients are included before any chemotherapy. Biological samples&#xD;
      (urine, feces, blood) are collected, alongside information on nutritional habits, appetite&#xD;
      and medical records. Muscle strength and body composition are also measured. Only patients&#xD;
      receiving a standard chemotherapy are included in Cohort B. In Cohort B, biological samples&#xD;
      are collected and body composition, muscle strength and appetite are evaluated at 2 different&#xD;
      time points, at the end of the chemotherapy (T1) and at discharge (T4).&#xD;
