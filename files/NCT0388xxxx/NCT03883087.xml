  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of HQP1351 in patients with chronic&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP) harboring T315I mutation. The efficacy of HQP1351&#xD;
      was determined by evaluating the subjects' major cytogenetic response (MCyR).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open, single-arm, multi-center phase 2 clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of oral administrated HQP1351(40mg, QOD) in CML-CP patients with T315I mutation in&#xD;
      China. A total of 40 CML-CP patients will be included in this pivotal study. After screening,&#xD;
      eligible subjects will receive oral HQP1351 40mg on a continues once every other day dosing&#xD;
      regimen , until disease progression, drug intolerance, or meet other treatment conditions to&#xD;
      discontinue the study. During the course of treatment, each subject will be assessed&#xD;
      regularly for hematological, cytogenetic and molecular responses. At the same time, safety&#xD;
      information also will be evaluated.&#xD;
