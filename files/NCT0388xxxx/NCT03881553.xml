      This pilot project will evaluate independently two non-pharmacological interventions, 1)&#xD;
      Neurosensory, Environmental Adaptive Technology (NEATCAP) and 2) Stochastic Vibrotactile&#xD;
      Stimulation (SVS), as adjuvant non-pharmacological interventions for improving sleep and&#xD;
      cardio-respiratory function in hospitalized infants. Within-subject design allows subjects to&#xD;
      serve as their own control and receive periods of routine care with and without intervention.&#xD;
      One intervention will be evaluated per study session. Infants may participate in up to four&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infants and children treated in the hospital often present with autonomic and sleep&#xD;
      disturbances that may be related to prematurity, opioid and other drug exposures in utero,&#xD;
      illness, surgery, medical procedures, and/or treatment medications. In addition, patients&#xD;
      treated in neonatal and pediatric units often require prolonged hospitalization with medical&#xD;
      monitoring and life-sustaining devices equipped with patient safety alarms. Such bedside&#xD;
      equipment may result in patients being exposed to loud and/or persistent noises that may&#xD;
      further disrupt sleep and autonomic function and compromise recovery and outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will study three separate pediatric populations being treated in neonatal&#xD;
      and pediatric hospital units: 1) Premature Infants; 2) Opioid-exposed newborns requiring&#xD;
      medication for Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome; and 3) Hospitalized infants treated for illness&#xD;
      or surgery. Subjects will participate in up to 4 study sessions during their hospitalization,&#xD;
      testing independent effects of two interventions complementary to routine care: 1)&#xD;
      Neurosensory, Environmental Adaptive Technology (NEATCAP), and 2) stochastic vibrotactile&#xD;
      stimulation (SVS). Within-subject design will allow for comparisons between periods, i.e.,&#xD;
      with and without the study-session intervention, separately for each device, for improving&#xD;
      sleep and cardio-respiratory function in three independent groups of hospitalized infants.&#xD;
