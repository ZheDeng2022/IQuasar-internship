  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sub-Saharan African women continue to face socio-economic challenges and limited reproductive&#xD;
      freedoms, which diminishes their ability to exercise agency and choice in their lives and&#xD;
      their environment. The goal of this study is to generate rigorous scientific evidence on&#xD;
      empowering women individually and in households through a cluster randomized control trial.&#xD;
      The trial will test the efficacy of a multi-sectoral program targeting three critical domains&#xD;
      of female empowerment through gender socialization education, counseling and improved access&#xD;
      to family planning, financial literacy among couples in Ibadan, Nigeria. The innovation in&#xD;
      this approach is the focus on creating a supportive intra-familial environment to accelerate&#xD;
      progress towards female empowerment, not just with the multi-sectoral intervention, but also&#xD;
      by targeting both partners of couples, individually and together. It is hoped that there will&#xD;
      be a shift of broader community norms by building the capacity of study couples to transfer&#xD;
      their newly acquired knowledge and skills to other couples in their community, thereby&#xD;
      creating a ripple of change.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Despite the growing influences of modernization and westernization, most Nigerian&#xD;
      subcultures remain largely traditional. Household division of labor continues to follow&#xD;
      traditional gendered roles with the male partner being the breadwinner and decision-maker,&#xD;
      while women are ascribed tasks such as childcare and homemaking. These traditional roles&#xD;
      often disempower the woman such that she has no say regarding how household funds will be&#xD;
      spent and inhibit her from making important household decisions such as whether or when she&#xD;
      or her children will receive preventive, curative or rehabilitative healthcare. Moreover, in&#xD;
      Nigeria, both the customary law and the major religions stipulate that a woman should be&#xD;
      submissive to her husband. The sociocultural and religious contexts appear to be in a&#xD;
      conspiracy against women, and favor men who are encouraged to &quot;be in control&quot; of their homes.&#xD;
      In some cases, this translates to the controlling husband preventing his wife from working&#xD;
      outside the home, making it difficult for her to become economically independent and own&#xD;
      assets. Such women, and those who lack the education and/or skills to join the labor force&#xD;
      are further disempowered in the sense that they are unable to contribute to the family&#xD;
      income, a quality known to improve women's status and decision-making autonomy. Women who do&#xD;
      not work for cash or kind often find themselves fully dependent on their husbands for both&#xD;
      economic and social identity, predisposing them to intimate partner violence, IPV. This lack&#xD;
      of decision-making autonomy penetrates all spheres of women's lives, including reproduction,&#xD;
      such that many women are unable, on their own, to choose to use modern contraception to space&#xD;
      or limit births, without their husbands' permission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study goal and design: The goal of this study is to generate rigorous evidence on how to&#xD;
      empower women individually and in households, by targeting both partners in a couple, with a&#xD;
      multi-sectoral approach that affects three critical domains of female empowerment - creating&#xD;
      more equitable spousal relationships, expanding reproductive choice, and increasing economic&#xD;
      empowerment, and is potentially sustainable and can be scaled-up. By influencing these three&#xD;
      domains of female empowerment, while simultaneously involving male partners, the intervention&#xD;
      aims to set into motion a set of processes that will generate equitable and supportive gender&#xD;
      relationships at the household level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To rigorously evaluate the intervention, a cluster randomized control design was chosen. The&#xD;
      primary goal of the evaluation is to test the impact of the gender socialization arm, the key&#xD;
      intervention, and the added improvements in female empowerment and spousal supportiveness&#xD;
      measures that may be seen with the incorporation of financial literacy and family planning&#xD;
      interventions. The trial consists of 4 arms: Arm 1 - couples participate in a structured&#xD;
      group education program on gender socialization; Arm 2 - couples participate in a structured&#xD;
      financial literacy education program, in addition; Arm 3 - couples receive the complete&#xD;
      package of interventions (gender socialization education, financial literacy and family&#xD;
      planning counseling and services, with vouchers for the poorest women); Arm 4 - control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypotheses: Couples receiving the complete package of interventions will have stronger&#xD;
      female empowerment outcomes as reflected through measures of spousal supportiveness and&#xD;
      equitable gender relationships in households as compared to couples receiving fewer&#xD;
      components of the intervention, or no intervention. In addition, couples that receive only&#xD;
      the gender socialization intervention or a combination of interventions will have stronger&#xD;
      female empowerment outcomes as compared to couples in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study area: The study is taking place in Ibadan, the capital of Oyo State, Nigeria. As part&#xD;
      of the 2006 population census, the Nigerian National Population Commission prepared a list of&#xD;
      665,000 EAs that has served as a sampling frame for many national and subnational surveys,&#xD;
      where a census enumeration area is defined as a cluster and is the primary sampling unit.&#xD;
      Enumeration areas consist of approximately 211 inhabitants or 48 households. Enumeration&#xD;
      areas form localities, localities form Local Government Areas (LGAs), and LGAs form states.&#xD;
      The LGA is a large enough area, where multiple intervention arms can be implemented while&#xD;
      avoiding contamination, but at the same time couples residing in an LGA are more likely to be&#xD;
      similar as compared to couples living elsewhere. The research team worked in two urban&#xD;
      (Ibadan North and Ibadan Southwest) and two peri-urban (Akinyele and Oluyole) LGAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations: These were based on the use of selective empowerment measures for&#xD;
      Oyo state from raw data available from the 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey dataset&#xD;
      (www.measuredhs.com). Assuming the intervention would improve each of the three main outcome&#xD;
      measures by 15%, 80% power, a 2-sided type 1 error of 5%, and the proportion of&#xD;
      married/cohabiting women ages 18-35 years who were involved in decisions regarding large&#xD;
      household purchases to be 0.275, 225 participants in each arm would be required. An&#xD;
      intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.015 was assumed in the calculations, as well as a&#xD;
      fixed number of clusters of 12 per arm (48 in all). Adjustments for 20% loss to follow up&#xD;
      rates gave a total of 282 couples per study arm. Calculations based on the above assumptions&#xD;
      produced a minimum sample size of 1125 couples. Sample size calculations for other outcomes&#xD;
      were smaller.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling strategy: Study participants were selected through a 3-stage randomization process.&#xD;
      First, geographical landmarks/boundaries were used to split the 11 LGAs (5 urban, 6&#xD;
      peri-urban) in Ibadan into two roughly equal halves. Then one urban and one periurban LGA was&#xD;
      selected randomly from each half, using the random number generator application, after&#xD;
      assigning numbers to LGAs in each half. Second, using a map of each of the four selected LGAs&#xD;
      displaying localities, alternate distinct localities were selected in a serpentine fashion,&#xD;
      following a random start. This was done to ensure that 12 geographically distinct clusters&#xD;
      were selected from each LGA. Using a sampling frame of enumeration areas by locality in each&#xD;
      of the 4 LGAs, one index enumeration area, and its adjoining enumeration area with a higher&#xD;
      code was randomly selected to form study clusters. Thereafter, household-listing surveys were&#xD;
      conducted in the selected EA clusters to enable identification and recruitment of 282&#xD;
      eligible couples, ages 18-35 years, per study arm to participate in the study. Where there&#xD;
      were not enough listed couples, additional adjacent EAs were listed. Couple selection only&#xD;
      took place once, at the beginning of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training: Training was conducted in multiple phases. Initially, a 3-day training was&#xD;
      conducted to introduce team members to human subjects' research, the study protocol,&#xD;
      interviewing techniques and the study instruments. Thereafter, once the team was ready to&#xD;
      start, a refresher training was held to describe and practice the protocol for the listing&#xD;
      and recruitment exercise. Another refresher training was held, and pre-testing done once the&#xD;
      final instruments were field-ready. A subset of the field workers, all with at least high&#xD;
      school education, were retained to serve as facilitators for the intervention. A 3-day&#xD;
      training of trainers' workshop was organized to prepare the facilitators to train the couples&#xD;
      that had been recruited into the study. Thereafter, weekly refresher trainings were held to&#xD;
      ensure facilitators were fully ready for the roll out of the weekly intervention sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection: Formative research was conducted to assess the feasibility of the proposed&#xD;
      program design. In all, five focus group discussions were held among men, women and couples.&#xD;
      Co-investigators facilitated the FGDs which held in neutral places that were acceptable to&#xD;
      the respective groups. All sessions were audio-recorded and later transcribed. Where the&#xD;
      session took place in Yoruba, the local language, both transcription and translation were&#xD;
      done. A quick analysis was performed so that the information obtained could be used to refine&#xD;
      the implementation of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Following selection of clusters, recruitment of couples, and baseline&#xD;
      interviews, a statistician conducted block randomization with stratification (block size of&#xD;
      4) whereby each LGA had all 4 study arms represented. Clusters were randomly allocated into&#xD;
      one of four study arms (Arm 1: gender socialization training; Arm 2: gender socialization +&#xD;
      financial literacy training; Arm 3: gender socialization + financial literacy training + FP&#xD;
      counseling/service; Arm 4: control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: A total of 3 gender socialization (GS) and 2 financial literacy (FL) workshops&#xD;
      were held weekly by cluster, separately for male and female participants to avoid any&#xD;
      potential gender conflicts. To minimize loss to follow up, those who received both of these&#xD;
      interventions had the sessions back to back, on the same day. Such sessions lasted a total of&#xD;
      3 hours, at most. Additionally, one couple session was conducted for both the husband and&#xD;
      wife together for each of these interventions, as well as one joint workshop of family&#xD;
      planning counseling for the arm that was randomized to the full intervention. The workshops&#xD;
      were interactive and organized around lectures, exercises, role-play and group activities.&#xD;
      Peer learning formed an important part of the skill acquisition process. Gender socialization&#xD;
      workshops raised awareness on gender, its social construction and inequality, notions of&#xD;
      masculinity and femininity, division of labor, access and control over resources. The&#xD;
      workshop also included skill-building sessions on effective communication and negotiation and&#xD;
      relationship building. Financial literacy workshops promoted knowledge and skills in&#xD;
      budgeting, financial planning and accessing and using financial services and income&#xD;
      generating activities. Couples were provided with study materials for their own review and to&#xD;
      facilitate their subsequent teaching activities. Immediate post-intervention surveys were&#xD;
      conducted immediately after the final intervention session for each group, or within a week&#xD;
      for couples who did not attend the last session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FP component of the intervention package was delivered by FP providers in NURHI-supported&#xD;
      health facilities. These facilities were well stocked and had training and re-training&#xD;
      activities for the providers. Couples were referred to these facilities, but had the option&#xD;
      of choosing any facility they would like to attend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the FP arm, the poorest participants were invited to be part of a voucher system to secure&#xD;
      a contraceptive method of their choice from a health facility. Most contraceptive methods are&#xD;
      available free of cost in public sector health facilities in Nigeria. However, users have to&#xD;
      pay a registration fee, pay for a pregnancy test, and in some facilities, there is an&#xD;
      additional fee associated with consumables, and the insertion of IUDs and implants, as well&#xD;
      as sterilization. A team member, the voucher officer, was responsible for accompanying women&#xD;
      to the health facility of their choice to obtain FP counseling and their method of choice.&#xD;
      The voucher officer paid all the bills at the health facility and refunded the woman her&#xD;
      transportation expenses. She was also responsible for reminding the woman of an upcoming&#xD;
      appointment prior to the date, usually 3-5 days in advance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-intervention assessments: Surveys were conducted immediately following the last&#xD;
      intervention session (Immediate post-intervention) for all three intervention arms, and 6&#xD;
      months post-intervention for all 4 study arms (Endline). At endline, six focus group&#xD;
      discussions were also conducted in order to better understand the impact the intervention had&#xD;
      on participants.&#xD;
