    <textblock>
      Nuedexta is FDA approved for the treatment of pseudobulbar affect in ALS patients and&#xD;
      anecdotal reports of improvements in speech, salivation or swallowing have been reported.&#xD;
      However, no prospective study has been conducted to comprehensively examine and determine the&#xD;
      physiologic impact of Nuedexta on both speech and swallowing physiology in a large group of&#xD;
      ALS individuals. These data are needed in order to provide evidence-based guidance to the&#xD;
      management of bulbar dysfunction in ALS.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although advances in the management of bulbar dysfunction in ALS have been disappointing,&#xD;
      recent interest has surfaced regarding the therapeutic potential of a pharmaceutical agent,&#xD;
      Nuedexta (dextromethorphan HBr and quinidine sulfate), for the treatment of bulbar&#xD;
      symptomology in individuals with ALS. Although Nuedexta received approval from the Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration (FDA) to target symptoms of pseudobulbar affect (PBA) in ALS; anecdotal&#xD;
      reports of improvements in speech, salivation or swallowing were reported from Neurologists&#xD;
      treating ALS individuals who were administered Nuedexta. Subsequently, a Phase II clinical&#xD;
      trial was conducted that reported improvements in speech, swallowing and salivation following&#xD;
      30-days of Nuedexta treatment. One serious limitation of this study, however, is the fact&#xD;
      that the primary outcome employed was a perceptual patient-report scale (PRO) (Center for&#xD;
      Neurological Study Bulbar Function Scale, CNS-BFS), with no objective physiologic outcomes to&#xD;
      confirm actual change in bulbar physiology. The absence of any objective clinical physiologic&#xD;
      outcomes is particularly important when examining effects of Nuedexta, given that it contains&#xD;
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), or serotonergic antidepressants, that can&#xD;
      impact the regulation of emotional expression, feelings of wellbeing and modulation of&#xD;
      depression (all known to impact the response an individual will provide on a PRO measure).&#xD;
      Furthermore, findings based on PRO's must be validated with studies that utilize objective&#xD;
      physiologic outcomes of speech and swallowing function. Great excitement exists regarding the&#xD;
      potential impact of Nuedexta on bulbar function in ALS with many neurologists prescribing&#xD;
      Nuedexta to treat these symptoms in ALS patients. To date, however; no data exists to examine&#xD;
      and determine the physiologic impact of Nuedexta on speech or swallowing physiology. These&#xD;
      data are needed in order to validate the initial patient-reported outcomes of the Phase II&#xD;
      clinical trial and to provide evidence-based guidance to the management of bulbar dysfunction&#xD;
      in ALS.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Dynamic Imaging Grade of Swallowing Toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>The validated Dynamic Imaging Grade of Swallowing Toxicity (DIGEST) will be performed on all collected videofluoroscopic swallowing studies to assess global swallowing function. The DIGEST total score is determined using the composite of individual airway safety and bolus efficiency subscores (range: 0-4). The DIGEST total is rated on a 5-point ordinal score ranging from 0 (no dysphagia) to 4 (life-threatening dysphagia).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline; Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Peak expiratory cough flow will be collected during maximum effort voluntary cough testing. Peak expiratory cough flow is calculated as the flow rate (L/s/s) between the end point of the compression phase of cough to the point of maximum expiration. Three trials will be performed at each evaluation and the maximum flow rate of the three epochs will be utilized for statistical analysis.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline; Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>The Sentence Intelligibility Test (SIT) will be performed to assess the change in speaking intelligibility over the 30 day period. The primary outcome of the SIT will be the percentage of sentence intelligibility (%) during oral reading.</description>

    <description>The CNS-BFS is a validated patient-reported scale that assess self-reported impairments in the domains of speech, salivation and swallowing. Each domain contains 7 questions with ratings ranging from 1-7 with 7 considered the worst, with total scores ranging from 21 (no impairment) - 112 (severe impairment in all domains).</description>

    <description>All eligible and enrolled study participants will be administered the study drug, Nuedexta, as recommended by their treating neurologists.The drug will be administered per the efficacy and safety protocol, with no changes in administration method or recommended dose for individuals with ALS. Prior to commencing treatment with Nuedexta, participants will undergo a comprehensive bulbar evaluation of swallowing, airway protection, speech functions, and complete validated patient-reported surveys. Following 30 days of Nuedexta treatment, participants will be e-evaluated using the same battery of assessments.</description>
