  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and&#xD;
      tolerability profile of cebranopadol (GRT6005) in patients with varying degree of renal&#xD;
      impairment and participants with normal renal function after an oral single dose&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was a Phase 1, multi-center, non-randomized, open-label, parallel group,&#xD;
      single-dose study in up to 24 male and female patients with varying degree of renal&#xD;
      impairment and participants with normal renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 14 days before the administration of cebranopadol the general eligibility of the&#xD;
      participants for the study was assessed according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was determined according to the Modification of&#xD;
      Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A treatment period from Day -1 to Day 8 was performed, with participant confinement to the&#xD;
      study site from Day -1 to Day 6 and an outpatient visit on Day 8. A single dose of&#xD;
      cebranopadol 200 Î¼g was administered on Day 1. Multiple blood and urine samples were drawn&#xD;
      for pharmacokinetic evaluations and safety laboratory monitoring. Additional blood samples&#xD;
      were taken prior investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration to assess serum&#xD;
      creatinine concentration and protein binding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An End-of-Trial Visit was performed at the time, or within 7 days, of the final blood sample&#xD;
      on Day 8 or at early withdrawal.&#xD;
