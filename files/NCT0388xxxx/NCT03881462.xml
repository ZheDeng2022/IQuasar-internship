  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is only one study in the literature about the quantitative effect of M. deltoideus on&#xD;
      the movement of the shoulder. Here, the author described a 35-80% loss of abduction power&#xD;
      after selective blockade of the N. axillaris. Gerber, on the other hand, found a loss of&#xD;
      abduction force of 73-86% after blockade of the suprascapular nerve. These results are partly&#xD;
      contradictory, which is why the investigators think that further investigation is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For many questions in the field of shoulder orthopedics, this knowledge would provide an&#xD;
      important additional basis for therapeutical decision-making. For example, in the treatment&#xD;
      of rotator cuff ruptures but also in the implantation of both inverse and anatomical shoulder&#xD;
      prostheses. Also, statements about different outcome prognoses could be made more precisely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators would like to perform muscle strength measurements of the&#xD;
      deltoid muscle on 12 healthy volunteers on the dominant arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abduction, flexion, external rotation and internal rotation Mm. Infraspinatus, Supraspinatus&#xD;
      and Subscapularis are tested respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to carry out the measurements three times before and after&#xD;
      an-anaesthesiological nerve block of the axillary nerve thus inactivating the deltoid muscle&#xD;
      (performed exclusively by an anesthesiologist specialized in regional anesthesia). The&#xD;
      success of the nerve block is confirmed by needle electromyographies (EMG) by a neurologist&#xD;
      specialized in electrophysiology. Using EMG neurogenic pathologies within the tested muscles&#xD;
      are also ruled out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to exclude relevant rotator cuff pathologies the investigators will perform shoulder&#xD;
      radiography in three planes and sonography of the rotator cuff before conducting the&#xD;
      experiment described above.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In order to exclude relevant rotator cuff pathologies the investigators will perform plain&#xD;
      shoulder radiography in three planes and sonography of the rotator cuff before conducting the&#xD;
      experiment described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The force of abduction, flexion, external rotation and internal rotation is measured in a&#xD;
      clinically standardized manner with a measuring device (IsoForceControl V1.1) and reported in&#xD;
      Newton. These measurements are taken before and after the blockage of the axillary nerve,&#xD;
      which is described below. Furthermore, before and after the blockade, an EMG of the rotator&#xD;
      cuff and deltoid muscle will be performed in order to rule out neurogenic pathology and&#xD;
      confirm the success of the nerve block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the anesthesia induction area, standard monitoring (electrocardiography, blood oxygen&#xD;
      saturation, non-invasive arterial pressure measurement) and peripheral venous access are&#xD;
      attained and Ringer's solution will be connected to the venous access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Axillary nerve block block (AXNB):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AXNB is performed with the participant in the supine position using ultrasound with a 6-&#xD;
      to 13-megahertz (MHz) linear probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anesthesiologist, wearing a facemask, cap, and sterile surgical gloves after surgical&#xD;
      hand disinfection performs skin disinfection with a two-layer application of an alcoholic&#xD;
      povidone-iodine solution. Three minutes later, the area of the puncture point will be&#xD;
      surrounded with sterile drapes and the ultrasound probe will be covered with a sterile cover&#xD;
      to allow sterile skin contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultrasound probe is placed transversally in the infraclavicular region with the arm in&#xD;
      90° abduction. The brachial plexus and its cords are identified l lateral to the brachial&#xD;
      artery. The posterior cord is identified by ultrasound and is blocked - or, if the axillary&#xD;
      nerve visible too - the axillary nerve is selectively blocked when it leaves the posterior&#xD;
      cord and lies on the subscapular muscle accompanied by the posterior circumflex humeral&#xD;
      artery. Using an in-plane technique, a short bevel needle (UPC 90, Te-mena) connected to a&#xD;
      nerve stimulator with the setting 0.5 milliampere (mA) current intensity, 0.1 ms impulse&#xD;
      duration and 2 Hz impulse frequency for dual guidance, will be advanced until its tip is&#xD;
      positioned near the nerve without eliciting motor contractions. After careful negative (for&#xD;
      blood) aspiration local anesthetic will be applied until the targeted neuronal structure is&#xD;
      surrounded by the injected fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of insufficient visualization of the nerve structures with this approach, the&#xD;
      investigators will use a modified technique: the volunteer is placed in the sitting position,&#xD;
      the shoulder in the neutral position but rotated 45° inward and the elbow flexed at 90° while&#xD;
      the hand rested on the knees. Using an in-plane caudad-to-cephalad ultrasound probe placement&#xD;
      parallel to the longitudinal axis of the shaft of the humerus and approximately 2cm below the&#xD;
      postero-lateral part of the acromion on the dorsal side of the arm the investigators will&#xD;
      identify the surgical neck and the shaft of the humerus and the cross section of the&#xD;
      posterior circumflex humeral artery (PCHA), The axillary nerve is located cranially in close&#xD;
      relation to the PCHA. The nerve will be blocked using the same material as mentioned&#xD;
      above.All blocks will be performed by an anesthesiologist specialized in regional anesthesia&#xD;
      (U.E. and J.A.) under standard monitoring in an anesthesia working area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Block success is evaluated assessing the degree of sensory block (cold test) over the&#xD;
      distribution area of the axillary nerve every 5 min. The degree of motor block will be&#xD;
      assessed by active abduction of the arm every 5 min. After a complete axillary nerve block is&#xD;
      documented, the electrophysiological and strength tests will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral venous line removal and participant ambulation will be performed after complete&#xD;
      motor and sensory recovery of the hand and arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be assessed for neurological status of the blocked extremity by the&#xD;
      anaesthesiologist prior to discharge and 24h after the regional anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A photo will be taken for documentation of the elevation function. Electromyographic studies&#xD;
      will be performed by experienced neurologists certified in clinical neurophysiology (J.R. &amp;&#xD;
      M.S.). Needle EMG serves to verify the axillary block in all three portions of the deltoid&#xD;
      muscle, to exclude pathology in the rotator cuff muscles and concomitant anaesthesia thereof.&#xD;
      Assessment of possible spontaneous activity, recruitment pattern and motor unit potentials&#xD;
      will be performed according to standard methods routinely applied in clinical&#xD;
      neurophysiology. Patients on therapeutic anticoagulation will be excluded from needle&#xD;
      electromyographic assessments.&#xD;
