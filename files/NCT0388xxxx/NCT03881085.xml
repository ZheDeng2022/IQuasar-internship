  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite increased access to early detection and the availability of more effective&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies, African American women continue to experience excess rates of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality from breast cancer. An emerging hypothesis about breast cancer&#xD;
      disparities is that social conditions and physiological responses to social stressors&#xD;
      influence biological processes that are important to the initiation and progression of&#xD;
      disease. This hypothesis is based on data from animal studies which have shown that rats that&#xD;
      are exposed to social stressors such as isolation are likely to develop mammary tumors that&#xD;
      are histologically and etiologically similar to those that develop among African American&#xD;
      women. The HPA axis plays a central role in regulating the physiological stress response;&#xD;
      dysregulation of the HPA has been suggested as a mechanism through which social and&#xD;
      biological factors contribute to racial disparities in breast cancer outcomes. Many African&#xD;
      Americans experience stressful life events and circumstances, including economic,&#xD;
      discriminatory, and other stressors. These social factors may contribute to an increased risk&#xD;
      of advanced stage disease, but not all African American women who are exposed to adverse&#xD;
      social factors develop advanced stage disease and those who have a limited number of&#xD;
      psychosocial stressors can develop advanced stage breast cancer, regardless of early&#xD;
      detection. This may be because stress reactivity, or one's physiological and psychological&#xD;
      responses to a stressor, is highly individualized and dependent on psychological and social&#xD;
      determinants as well as genetic factors. But, these biological and psychosocial pathways have&#xD;
      not been examined among women at increased risk for disparities. Therefore, this study will&#xD;
      characterize stress reactivity and emotional regulation among African American breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors and measure the association between these responses and decisions about cancer&#xD;
      control and treatment compliance. As part of providing empirical data on biological and&#xD;
      psychological pathways that contribute to breast cancer disparities, the investigator's study&#xD;
      will identify novel intervention targets that can be used to improve self-management in a&#xD;
      population that is at risk for limited cancer control.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Dysregulation of the HPA has been suggested as a mechanism through which social and&#xD;
      biological factors contribute to racial disparities in breast cancer outcomes.The HPA axis&#xD;
      plays a central role in regulating the physiological stress response;a prolonged and elevated&#xD;
      glucocorticoid (GC) response following a social stressor predicts tumor growth rates and the&#xD;
      development of mammary cancer in rats that histologically and etiologically resembles human&#xD;
      disease.Many African Americans experience stressful life events and circumstances, including&#xD;
      economic, discriminatory, and other stressors. These psychosocial factors may contribute to&#xD;
      an increased risk of advanced stage breast cancer among African American women, but not all&#xD;
      African American women who are exposed to adverse psychosocial and social stressors develop&#xD;
      advanced stage breast cancer and African American women who have a limited number of&#xD;
      stressors also develop advanced stage breast cancer, regardless of early detection. This may&#xD;
      be because stress reactivity, or one's physiological and psychological responses to a&#xD;
      stressor, is highly individualized and dependent on psychological and social determinants.&#xD;
      However, empirical data are not available on stress reactivity among African American breast&#xD;
      cancer survivors and how these reactions vary among women based on their exposure to chronic&#xD;
      stressors and psychological characteristics. Empirical data are also lacking on the&#xD;
      association between stress reactivity and cancer control behaviors among African American&#xD;
      breast cancer survivors even though prior studies have shown that these women are less likely&#xD;
      than whites to engage in health behaviors that are important to cancer control and research&#xD;
      is now being conducted to understand how stress affects these behaviors.This research is&#xD;
      testing the hypothesis that stress: (1) promotes temporal discounting; (2) has an adverse&#xD;
      effect on self-efficacy, and (3) reduces executive functioning (e.g., goal setting,&#xD;
      planning). However, stress reactivity, and the association between these responses and cancer&#xD;
      control behaviors (e.g., diet, physical activity, and treatment compliance), have not been&#xD;
      examined among African American breast cancer survivors. Prior studies have shown that&#xD;
      African Americans have a dysregulated stress response as a result of persistent exposure to&#xD;
      chronic and acute and stressors; this may alter stress responses and lead to high levels of&#xD;
      allostatic load. In order to develop effective behavioral interventions for African American&#xD;
      breast cancer survivors, an important first step is to verify that the mechanisms (e.g.,&#xD;
      temporal discounting, self-efficacy) involved in health behaviors for cancer control (e.g.,&#xD;
      diet, physical activity, treatment compliance) are associated with stress reactivity among&#xD;
      these women. Therefore this study will characterize stress reactivity among African American&#xD;
      breast cancer survivors and validate the association between these responses and targeted&#xD;
      mechanisms of behavior change.&#xD;
