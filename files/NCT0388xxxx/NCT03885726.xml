  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pilot/feasibility study evaluates the ability of High Velocity Nasal Insufflation (HVNI)&#xD;
      therapy to facilitate ambulation and mobilization in patients experiencing shortness of&#xD;
      breath, as compared to simple oxygen therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that HVNI therapy, when implemented in conjunction to ambulatory practices,&#xD;
      will be more effective than TAU to improve patient mobility by reducing the patient's&#xD;
      perceived dyspnea and exertion via maintaining oxygenation (reduced desaturation) and&#xD;
      supporting ventilation (reduced work of breathing [WOB]). The primary endpoint is exercise&#xD;
      performance, defined as the distance and duration of patient ambulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To provide a sample data set, The investigators will enroll up to 32 subjects to complete&#xD;
      this feasibility assessment, with a calculated sample size of N=26 plus a 20% failure rate.&#xD;
      This will provide sufficient initial data to inform the appropriate sample size of a&#xD;
      follow-on randomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a feasibility study, performed as a prospective, crossover controlled trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the potential patient improvement during ambulation while on HVNI relative to TAU.&#xD;
      Patients who fit the criteria for inclusion will perform ambulation for each study arm: the&#xD;
      control arm (TAU) followed by the test arm (HVNI). Control group will receive the site TAU&#xD;
      (not HVNI), and the test group will receive HVNI therapy. In both cases the clinical&#xD;
      management will otherwise remain unchanged based on the site SOC practices. The patient FiO2&#xD;
      and flow values will be recorded while on any supplemental oxygen. Subjects will wear&#xD;
      appropriate gear and, when applicable, have mobile carts to provide supplemental oxygen&#xD;
      therapy (e.g. HVNI VTU) during ambulation. If they meet criteria for intubation or are deemed&#xD;
      to need intubation by the critical care team, they will undergo prompt intubation and be&#xD;
      managed according to standard practice. After each of the study arms, the clinicians will&#xD;
      complete perception score assessments.&#xD;
