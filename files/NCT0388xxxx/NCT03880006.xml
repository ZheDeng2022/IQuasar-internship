  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Senegal plans a rapid scale up of HIV treatment for all people living with HIV, regardless of&#xD;
      cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count or viral suppression. However, limited data exist on&#xD;
      how to achieve sustained viral suppression outside of a controlled setting, and with&#xD;
      significant barriers to effective antiretroviral therapy delivery, uptake, and adherence. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to develop and assess the feasibility, fidelity, and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of a universal coverage of Antiretroviral Treatment (ART) intervention&#xD;
      among people living with HIV who are not virally suppressed in Dakar and Ziguinchor, Senegal.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this study is to assess the feasibility, fidelity, and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of a universal coverage of Antiretroviral Treatment (ART) intervention&#xD;
      among individuals living with HIV who are not virally suppressed in Dakar and Ziguinchor,&#xD;
      Senegal. Specific aims and hypotheses are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Compare the effectiveness and durability of (a) the existing Standard of Care&#xD;
      (SOC) in Senegal versus (b) individual Case Management (CM) programs to achieve sustained&#xD;
      viral suppression (SVS) among people living with HIV in Senegal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: The null hypothesis is that standard of care and case management will be&#xD;
      equally effective at achieving sustained viral suppression. The alternate hypothesis is that&#xD;
      case management will be 30% more effective at sustained viral suppression at 12 months&#xD;
      compared to standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Determine the cost-effectiveness of the universal treatment approach using&#xD;
      the CM intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: A Case Management approach will be more cost-effective at achieving sustained&#xD;
      viral suppression among people living with HIV (PLHIV) versus the existing standard of care&#xD;
      in Senegal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that uses an effectiveness-implementation&#xD;
      hybrid design to test the effectiveness and durability of CM interventions in achieving SVS&#xD;
      among PLHIV who are not virally suppressed. CM vs. SOC approaches will be assessed using an&#xD;
      individual-level RCT of case management to improve viral suppression of those living with HIV&#xD;
      at 12 months compared to the Senegal SOC. While viral suppression will be a primary outcome&#xD;
      of this intervention, significant attention will be given to the collection of service and&#xD;
      implementation outcomes to assess both the SOC and CM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study sites will include two government HIV treatment facilities in Ziguinchor, and two in&#xD;
      Dakar. Participant enrollment into the study will take place at the study sites, and study&#xD;
      arms (SOC or CM) will be assigned through individual randomization at the clinic level.&#xD;
      Notably, the HIV treatment facilities in this study are existing government facilities given&#xD;
      the partnership between this study and the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Senegal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants recruited through the study site health facilities will go through the&#xD;
      consent process in private rooms within the project office and complete a structured 1-hour&#xD;
      interviewer-administered questionnaire, which will serve as the baseline assessment.&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled into the study, by trained study staff at a study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessment of study participants will include a socio-behavioral questionnaire and&#xD;
      biological testing. The baseline questionnaire will assess demographic characteristics,&#xD;
      socioeconomic status, mobility and migration history, behavioral characteristics, health and&#xD;
      HIV treatment history, and HIV acquisition risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up will involve visits at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the first visit. Questionnaires&#xD;
      will be administered at each visit. Questionnaires assessing behavioral characteristics,&#xD;
      mental health, social support, and ART treatment adherence will be administered at 6 months,&#xD;
      and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abbreviated questionnaires will be re-administered at 3 and 9 months though no biological&#xD;
      assessments will be completed at these time points. The questionnaires leverage existing&#xD;
      instruments that have detailed assessments engagement in ART services as well as enacted,&#xD;
      perceived, and intersectional stigma. In addition, the investigators will use implementation&#xD;
      indicators that explore measures of acceptability, fidelity, appropriateness, and&#xD;
      routinization of the CM intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological samples using either aliquots of serum or dried blood spots (DBS) will be taken at&#xD;
      baseline, 6 months, and 12 months to support syphilis testing, HIV viral load, and other&#xD;
      sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Biological testing taken at baseline and will include&#xD;
      testing currently being implemented through the SOC, and testing conducted at the additional&#xD;
      visits will be supported by the study. All participants will also have the opportunity to&#xD;
      receive referrals for additional medical care as needed at the clinics in which the study&#xD;
      sites are housed.&#xD;

    <description>Case management intervention is a multi-step process to coordinate care and provide a family-like support system for people living with HIV. Individuals are assigned to a specific case manager who will provide support throughout the study. The case management approach has five key components: 1) initial meeting between person living with HIV and case manager; 2) follow up meeting between case manager and participant; 3) biweekly automatic text messages sent to participant; 4) monthly phone calls from case manager; and 5) face-to-face meetings between case manager and participant every 6 months.</description>
