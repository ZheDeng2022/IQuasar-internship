      - Brief Summary: Prospective, cohort, open-label study. The cohort consists of people who&#xD;
      have a chronic balance dysfunction due to a mild to moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI).&#xD;
      All participants will participate in a 14-week PoNS Treatment protocol - a combination of&#xD;
      symptom specific physical exercises and repeated use of the PoNS device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet the initial screening entrance criteria will be scheduled for a baseline&#xD;
      assessment to evaluate balance and gait. Subjects will then begin the PoNS Treatment program&#xD;
      and re-perform some assessments at 2, 5 and 14 weeks evaluating their functional&#xD;
      improvements.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Criteria for Inclusion/Exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must present with a chronic balance deficit due to mild-to-moderate TBI. However,&#xD;
        other potentially related symptoms, such as gait disturbance, mild to moderate recurrent&#xD;
        headaches, sleep, memory, attention, and cognitive deficits, will be noted on the data&#xD;
        collection form at screening and each subsequent evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria: Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be included in the&#xD;
        study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. At least 18 years of age, inclusive, at the time of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Acceptable results (as determined by the investigator) of a full history and physical&#xD;
             performed or supervised by the investigator at each site. This will include a careful&#xD;
             examination of the tongue and oral cavity for any abnormalities. History should&#xD;
             include the nature and duration of any prior physical therapy program the subject may&#xD;
             have participated in to address the balance and/or gait symptoms of their TBI. Prior&#xD;
             participation in therapy is not a prerequisite for enrollment in the program&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Documentation on the history of a qualifying TBI, mild to moderate in severity. For&#xD;
             reference, the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch (AFHSB) definitions of mild and&#xD;
             moderate TBI will be used. The definitions are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Mild TBI: Confused or disoriented state which lasts less than 24 hours; or loss of&#xD;
             consciousness for up to 30 minutes, or memory loss lasting less than 24 hours.&#xD;
             Excludes penetrating TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Moderate TBI: Confused or disoriented state which lasts more than 24 hours; and/or&#xD;
             loss of consciousness for more than 30 minutes but less than 24 hours, or memory loss&#xD;
             lasting greater than 24 hours but less than seven days; or meets criteria for Mild TBI&#xD;
             except an abnormal CT scan is present. Excludes penetrating TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
             The investigator will ascertain whether the prior medical records and information&#xD;
             collected during the clinical interview are sufficiently detailed to support the&#xD;
             classification of the TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Acceptable results from within the last three (3) months as determined by the site&#xD;
             investigator of basic standard blood work to include CBC, TSH, HbA1C, Liver and Kidney&#xD;
             panels, and a 12-lead ECG with automated reporting capability. Any abnormal result&#xD;
             that is judged clinically significant by the investigator will be communicated to the&#xD;
             subject and if treated by their personal physician and deemed recovered, the subjects&#xD;
             may be reconsidered for inclusion. If the investigator is uncertain he or she will&#xD;
             communicate with the Sponsor's Medical Officer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. If female, the subject is not pregnant, not breastfeeding and has a negative pregnancy&#xD;
             test prior to receipt of the PoNS device&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Note: Pregnancy testing will be repeated at end-of-study (EOS) (i.e., end of at-home&#xD;
             period).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. If female is of childbearing potential, the subject agrees to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception from screening and throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
             A female of non-childbearing potential is defined as a subject who is postmenopausal&#xD;
             (continuous amenorrhea for 12 months) or surgically sterile (defined as bilateral&#xD;
             tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Balance disorder as indicated by the NeuroCom® Sensory Organization Test (SOT)&#xD;
             composite score at least 16 points below normal [adjusted for age and height, based on&#xD;
             normative data] due to a mild-to-moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. At least three (3) months post most recent TBI at the time of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Stable neurologic status, as determined from subject's medical records and the study&#xD;
             physician's opinion based on no new or changing symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Qualifying MRI report to be entered into the data collection form. For all&#xD;
             participants who do not have a qualifying MRI, a new MRI will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Ambulatory and able to walk continuously over-ground or on a treadmill for 20 minutes,&#xD;
             level grade (no inclination) and at any speed, with support, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Able to understand the study procedures and give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Willing and able to adhere to the study schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Willing to complete a neuropsychological evaluation if deemed necessary by the&#xD;
             investigator prior to inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Exclusion Criteria: Subjects meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded&#xD;
             from the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Medical findings from screening history, physical examination or radiological test&#xD;
             that the investigator deems clinically significant or that would otherwise impact&#xD;
             patient safety or data integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Planned use or use of any investigational product (i.e., not approved by the FDA),&#xD;
        pharmaceutical or device, within 30 days preceding receipt of the PoNS device and during&#xD;
        the entire period of subject participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Any previous use of the Portable Neuromodulation Stimulator (PoNS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Balance or gait deficits due to lower extremity injury or neurological condition other&#xD;
        than TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Severe TBI defined as an injury with a confused or disoriented state which lasts more&#xD;
        than 24 hours; and/or loss of consciousness for more than 24 hours, or memory loss for more&#xD;
        than seven days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Penetrating brain injury, refractory subdural hematoma, tumor, other space occupying&#xD;
        lesion, arteriovenous malformation or craniotomy unrelated to the resolution of qualifying&#xD;
        traumatic brain injury. Investigator discretion may be exercised on an individual case&#xD;
        where surgery was performed that did not remove or significantly alter brain tissue (e.g.,&#xD;
        to treat a brain aneurysm). Surgery must have been performed at least 6 months prior to&#xD;
        screening and a CT scan must be provided to demonstrate no large residual lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Oral health problems active at the time of recruitment. Any history of oral health&#xD;
        problems (e.g., gum disease or cankers) will be noted on the data collection form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Oral surgery within 3 months of screening. 9. History of oral cancer. 10. Non-removable&#xD;
        metal orthodontic devices (e.g., braces) or oral cavity piercings that could interfere with&#xD;
        PoNS use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        11. Presence of metallic implant or other MRI-incompatible device. 12. Known allergy to&#xD;
        gold, nickel or copper. 13. Blood pressure abnormalities considered clinically significant&#xD;
        by the study physician. If the subject has an average systolic blood pressure of &lt;100 mmHg,&#xD;
        they will be evaluated for orthostatic hypotension and if the investigator deems this a&#xD;
        risk for the subject's health or safety they will be excluded. If systolic blood pressure&#xD;
        &gt;160 mm Hg (average of 3 measurements) at screening and the subject is on medications, the&#xD;
        subject will be re-evaluated once the treating physician deems them to have stable blood&#xD;
        pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Note: BP should be measured seated, legs uncrossed, after resting for 5 minutes, with&#xD;
             measurements taken 2 minutes apart. Two BP readings should be taken and averaged. If&#xD;
             the first two readings differ by &gt;5 mm Hg, a third measurement should be taken and an&#xD;
             average calculated for all 3 values.&#xD;
&#xD;
             14. Use of Coumadin or any other anticoagulant other than aspirin in the last six&#xD;
             months.&#xD;
&#xD;
             15. Untreated or undiagnosed diabetes - the subject will be referred to their family&#xD;
             physician and may be re-evaluated at a later date. Undiagnosed diabetes is defined as&#xD;
             an HbA1C taken during screening above the upper limit of normal at the study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
             16. Diabetic neuropathy. 17. Active or recent (within 1 year) treatment for any&#xD;
             cancer, excluding basal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
             18. Neurological disorders other than those attributed to the primary diagnosis,&#xD;
             (e.g., neurodegenerative diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease&#xD;
             (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD) or other dementia, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).&#xD;
&#xD;
             19. History of epileptic or other seizure disorders. 20. Known ischemic heart disease&#xD;
             (angina, stent, history of myocardial infarction, &gt;70% stenosis or cardiovascular&#xD;
             imaging) and/or history or atrial or ventricular arrhythmias with or without syncope.&#xD;
             Any abnormality on the screening ECG will be referred to the subject's family&#xD;
             physician for evaluation and clearance and then the subject can be re-evaluated for&#xD;
             inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             21. Any other untreated or unstable acute or chronic, clinically significant medical&#xD;
             condition for which the subject is currently undergoing treatment (e.g., autoimmune or&#xD;
             immunodeficient disorders) and that the investigator deems unsuitable for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
             22. Use of a lower extremity biomechanical prosthetic with the exception of a splint&#xD;
             to address foot drop.&#xD;
&#xD;
             23. Chronic use of any potentially interfering drug such as a neuroactive (ototoxic,&#xD;
             anti-seizure, anti-convulsive) medication, or chronic/PRN use of any medication that&#xD;
             would, in the opinion of the investigator, compromise the subject's ability to&#xD;
             function or perform the study activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
             24. Addition of and/or major change in type or dosage of any prescription medication&#xD;
             within 3 months prior to receipt of the PoNS device at the time of screening, subject&#xD;
             to physician discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
             25. Active alcoholism documented by the investigator at the time of screening. The&#xD;
             investigator will have the right to exclude subject participation if, in their&#xD;
             opinion, the subject seems intoxicated at time of screening and/or during any study&#xD;
             appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             26. History of drug abuse as documented by the investigator at the time of screening.&#xD;
             The investigator will have the right to exclude subject participation if, in their&#xD;
             opinion, the subject seems intoxicated at time of screening or presentation for&#xD;
             treatment 27. Recent (6 months) history of smokeless tobacco use (i.e., chewing&#xD;
             tobacco, oral tobacco, spit or spitting tobacco, dip, chew, snuff*) (*NCI definition)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Note: Cigarette, cigar, pipe, and/or e-cigarette use is not exclusionary 28. Any&#xD;
             reason, considered by the principal investigator or designee to preclude subject&#xD;
             enrollment in the study that might represent a threat to health, safety, or an&#xD;
             inability to comply with the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
             29. Subject is incompatible with the device. 30. Subject is currently in a focused&#xD;
             physical rehabilitation program for balance or gait symptoms resulting from their TBI&#xD;
             and has not been deemed by their treating clinician to have reached a plateau.&#xD;
