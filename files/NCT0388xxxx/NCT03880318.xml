      the investigators want to obtain a functional and radiological outcome of peroneus brevis,&#xD;
      tertius and extensor digitorum longus muscles lengthening together with calcaneal osteotomies&#xD;
      in the treatment of the spasmodic flat- foot.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the most common foot complaints is the &quot;flatfoot&quot; deformity. Clinical evaluation of&#xD;
      flatfeet primarily focuses on differentiation between the two main types: flexible and rigid.&#xD;
      The rigid flatfoot deformity is an uncommon diagnosis (occurring one-third as often as the&#xD;
      flexible type) but often is symptomatic and requires treatment&quot;. Multiple causes of rigid&#xD;
      flatfeet have been identified such as rheumatoid arthritis, tarsal coalitions (being the most&#xD;
      common cause) that are excluded from that research. Triple arthrodesis is used for treatment&#xD;
      of rigid flat foot but the patient satisfaction is not good as there is some stiffness in the&#xD;
      foot .but here the investigators want to know what is the effect of extensor digitorum&#xD;
      longus, peroneus brevis and tertius lengthening together with osteotomies in alignment of&#xD;
      spasmodic flat- foot. In patient with rigid flat- foot or spasmodic flat- foot will often&#xD;
      have the hind-foot alignment to the outside. Alignment of the heel influences how&#xD;
      weight-bearing stress is applied to the foot, ankle, knee and hip. So, these patients may&#xD;
      benefit from the calcaneal osteotomies and extensor digitorum longus, peroneus brevis and&#xD;
      tertius lengthening to improve that alignment.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) consists of a straight line with the endpoints defining extreme limits such as 'no pain at all' and 'pain as bad as it could be'. The patient is asked to mark his pain level on the line between the two endpoints. The distance between 'no pain at all' and the mark then defines the subject's pain. This tool was first used in psychology by Freyd in 1923</description>
