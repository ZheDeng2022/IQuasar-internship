      The purpose of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics of HQP1351 in participants&#xD;
      with resistant chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (CP) after high-fat and&#xD;
      fasting meals separately（Selection of high-fat meal spectrum：《The Food - Effect&#xD;

      The drug being test in this study is HQP1351，the study will characterize the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of HQP1351 in participants with resistant chronic myeloid leukemia（CML）in chronic&#xD;
      phase（CP）after high-fat meal and fasting meal separately at a dose of 30mg，single-dose. The&#xD;
      study will enroll 12 subjects totally and be randomly divided into 2 groups（A group and B&#xD;
      group）. Every group will have 6 subjects. The experiment is divided into two periods，in&#xD;
      period 1, subjects in the group A will be given HQP1351 30mg after fasting meal，and the group&#xD;
      B will be given HQP1351 30mg after 30 minutes of high-fat meal. Then after a seven-day of&#xD;
      cleaning time the two groups of subjects took the drug interchangeably in the period 2.&#xD;
