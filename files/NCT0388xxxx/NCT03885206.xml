  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Demographic changes in the industrialized world are expected to prompt a need for better&#xD;
      organized and more efficient health care services. In order to curb costs, health care&#xD;
      providers in many countries are searching for viable alternatives to hospitalizations.&#xD;
      Norwegian white papers and reform documents presume that the municipalities will play a&#xD;
      central role in meeting the growth in demand for health services. Central public policy&#xD;
      documents and national research strategies highlight that we need pathways characterized by&#xD;
      good quality and safe care, and which are responsive to needs, based on user involvement,&#xD;
      continuity of care and successful collaboration within and between service levels. The 2012&#xD;
      Coordination Reform placed new responsibilities on municipalities in the delivery of primary&#xD;
      health care services and on hospitals as deliverers of specialist services, as well as on the&#xD;
      integration and collaboration between the two organizational levels. This reform mandates&#xD;
      that all 428 Norwegian municipalities are obliged to establish or co-operate on establishing&#xD;
      Municipal Acute Wards (MAW) (In Norwegian: Kommunale akutte døgnplasser), so as to alleviate&#xD;
      pressure on hospitals. However, the research basis for these units is relatively weak. Hence,&#xD;
      there is little information on the outcomes regarding the quality, cost-effectiveness,&#xD;
      patient-reported as well as personnel-reported outcomes of this new level of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims at assessing the outcome of admissions to MAWs compared to a general hospital&#xD;
      for patients in need of acute care, that can be treated at a lower and decentralized level of&#xD;
      health care, with potentially less resources than traditional hospitalizations. The study&#xD;
      will use a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) design. It builds on previous research and&#xD;
      systematic reviews, and aims to assess several outcomes, including health-related quality of&#xD;
      life (HRQoL), patient experiences, cost-effectiveness, short-term mortality and morbidity,&#xD;
      and draws on linkages to national registers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      No other randomized, controlled studies have been conducted to compare healthcare services as&#xD;
      offered in MAWs to those offered in hospital. The study will undertake an economic evaluation&#xD;
      and study other outcomes of an intervention, using an RCT design, which is a strong study&#xD;
      design. The study also includes measures of HRQoL and patient experiences. The project is&#xD;
      interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral, and it represents research in, about and with support&#xD;
      from the municipalities, which is a prioritized area of research, together with health&#xD;
      services research, for the owners of the Østfold Hospital Trust, Helse Sør-Øst (HSØ). The&#xD;
      project incorporates users in the planning of the project, which may contribute better&#xD;
      acceptance of and a successful completion of the project. This proposal addresses key aspects&#xD;
      of the CR and other national strategic documents. The CR has mandated the establishment of&#xD;
      MAWs all over Norway as of 2016, without any strong scientific documentation of&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness. The study builds on data from previous research, stating that there is a&#xD;
      need for more solid documentation about new levels of acute hospital care. The proposed study&#xD;
      will assess the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and several aspects of quality of care and&#xD;
      will contribute useful information for evaluation and future planning of MAWs, as an&#xD;
      alternative to hospitalization. Therefore the researchers think this project is timely. The&#xD;
      MAWs in Østfold County are small to medium-sized and are expected to be representative for&#xD;
      the majority of MAWs in Norway, and therefore of broad national interest. These outputs will&#xD;
      be important for authorities, politicians, healthcare leaders, and professionals as well as&#xD;
      researchers involved in developing, implementing and refining decentralized acute health care&#xD;
      services as an alternative to hospitalization- to the best of the patients. Moreover, the&#xD;
      project outputs will be of international interest, in particular in countries with national&#xD;
      health insurance with broad coverage, as in the Nordic countries, the UK, Canada and&#xD;
      Australia.&#xD;

    <description>Health related quality of life. The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.&#xD;
The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the patient's own judgement</description>
