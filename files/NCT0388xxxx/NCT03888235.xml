  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      60 participants with low back pain will be examined to determine the direction and extent of&#xD;
      sacroiliac malrotation. If malrotation exists, they will be randomized to 3 treatment groups:&#xD;
      1 will be taught how to use their thigh to push the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS)&#xD;
      backwards for an anterior malrotation and their sartorius and rectus femoris to pull their&#xD;
      ASIS and anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS) forward for a posterior malrotation. 2: will be&#xD;
      given a pelvic stabilization belt. 3: will return in one month. At the second visit at one&#xD;
      month all participants will be treated with both exercise and belt. They will be reassessed&#xD;
      at the third visit one month later: the scores for immediate and delayed treatment groups&#xD;
      will be compared. Their response to these exercises and/or the pelvic belt will be tested at&#xD;
      the first second and third visits, using the brief pain inventory pain, the Oswestry&#xD;
      disability scores and the distance between the (posterior superior iliac spine) (PSIS)&#xD;
      levels, filled out at every contact. Their satisfaction with previous treatments used will be&#xD;
      compared to their satisfaction when using the exercise and belt.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential participants with low back pain will answer a questionnaire to eliminate lumbar or&#xD;
      hip pathology, ankylosing spondylitis or major leg length discrepancy as cause. If they state&#xD;
      they do not have these, they will be given an appointment to be assessed to eliminate the&#xD;
      presence of these conditions and to determine if they suffer from sacroiliac malrotation. To&#xD;
      this effect, the sacroiliac forward flexion test (SIFFT) will be done: leaning on a counter&#xD;
      with their body horizontal to tilt the pelvis forward and lower the sacrum and their legs&#xD;
      vertical to push the innominate bones upwards via the hip joints, to expose the posterior&#xD;
      superior iliac spines (PSISs). Pressure below the PSISs will be used to assess their inferior&#xD;
      limits which will be marked and their levels assessed using a carpenter's level. The distance&#xD;
      between the PSIS levels will be recorded. If there is tenderness under the higher PSIS, the&#xD;
      ilium is malrotated anteriorly on the sacrum. If the area under the lower PSIS is tender, the&#xD;
      ilium is malrotated posteriorly on the sacrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are then randomized into three groups: group 1 is taught how to assess the&#xD;
      direction of the malrotation, then how to perform the appropriate corrective exercise:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  With the foot of the anteriorly rotated side and the knee on the posteriorly rotated&#xD;
           side on the floor, hands on the floor on either side of the foot, the participant leans&#xD;
           forward hard to push his anteriorly rotated ilium posteriorly with his thigh and&#xD;
           stretches the opposite thigh posteriorly to pull the posteriorly rotated ilium forward.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anterior malrotation can also be corrected by placing the foot on the malrotated side on&#xD;
           a chair seat, flexing the other knee to touch the seat edge and pulling with both hands&#xD;
           up on the seat while leaning back, to drive the thigh against the anterior superior&#xD;
           iliac spine (ASIS), thus pushing it backwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If unable to do these, participants can lie supine on the table, thigh on the posterior&#xD;
           side extended. On the anterior side the knee is flexed and the foot is on the&#xD;
           assistant's sternum as he/she leans forward, pushing the thigh against the ASIS.&#xD;
           Downward pressure on the sartorius and rectus femoris just above the knee causes the&#xD;
           ASIS and the anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS) to be pulled on, rotating the ilium&#xD;
           anteriorly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each position is held for 2 minutes, with up to 2 repetitions as needed. At home, the&#xD;
      procedure is repeated as needed for pain relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 are given a pelvic stabilization belt and taught how to apply it: tightly around the&#xD;
      pelvis below the anterior superior iliac spines (ASISs), to stabilize the sacroiliac joints&#xD;
      as malrotation occurs as a result of pelvic instability. The belt is used for activities&#xD;
      known to cause back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 are instructed to continue their usual treatments and given an appointment to return&#xD;
      one month later to receive instruction for the exercise and given the belt At 1 month all are&#xD;
      reassessed. Group 1: use and effectiveness of the exercises is recorded and they are given&#xD;
      the belt. Group 2: use and effectiveness of the belt is recorded and they are taught how to&#xD;
      examine and correct their sacroiliac joints. Group 3: use and satisfaction with their current&#xD;
      treatment is recorded. They are then taught the examination and corresponding exercise and&#xD;
      given the belt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 2 months, when all participants have used both treatments for one month, all are&#xD;
      reassessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      at the first visit: Diagnoses associated with low back pain: lumbar spondylosis, hip&#xD;
      arthritis, hypermobility, leg length discrepancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conditions associated with sacroiliac malrotation, tendinitis of sacroiliac joint stabilizer&#xD;
      muscles and lateral femoral cutaneous neuropathy. Muscle insertions tested include quadratus&#xD;
      lumborum, gluteus medius and minimus, piriformis, iliopsoas, biceps femoris, semimembranosus&#xD;
      and semitendinosus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief pain inventory pain severity (BPI PS), the Oswestry low-back disability scores (ODI)&#xD;
      and the distance in centimetres between the posterior superior iliac spine levels from the&#xD;
      SIFFT test (PSISL), at intake, one month and two months visits. Together with the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of pain medications alcohol and marijuana Use and satisfaction with other treatments for&#xD;
      back pain relief (physiotherapy, acupuncture, yoga, core exercises, chiropractor, massage).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Position of the malrotated sacroiliac joint or joints. Distance in centimetres between the&#xD;
      levels of the PSISs before and after the corrective exercise. (Visits 2 and 3 for all, visits&#xD;
      1, 2, 3 for group 1) Numeric rating scale pain score after the corrective exercise. Use of&#xD;
      and satisfaction with the SI corrective exercise at first visit for group 1 and at the second&#xD;
      and third visit for all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of and satisfaction with the pelvic belt at the first visit for group 2 and at the second&#xD;
      and third visits for all.&#xD;

    <description>The sacroiliac forward flexion test (SIFFT) finds the position of each innominate bone. Subjects learn 1 of 3 exercises. To correct anterior rotation, flex the thigh hard against the ilium, pushing it backwards. To correct posterior rotation, hyperextend the thigh to pull the ilium forward. 1.Genuflect, anterior foot and posterior knee on the floor hands on the floor on either side of the foot, sliding the knee backwards to hyperextend the thigh. 2. Supine, anterior foot on an assistant's sternum, posterior thigh hyperextended. Assistant leans forward, forcing the anterior thigh against the ilium and pushing down on the posterior thigh. 3. For anterior rotation alone: anterior foot on a chair seat, pulling up hard with both hands, leaning back, forcing the thigh against the ilium. Hold position for 2 minutes. Use as needed for pain control. They are reassessed one month later when they receive the pelvic support belt. Both treatments used together will be assessed one month after.</description>

    <description>Participants will be given a pelvic support belt to stabilize their sacroiliac joints. The belt is fitted tightly around the pelvis, over the sacrum and below the anterior superior iliac spines (ASISs) to prevent opening the joint. (The upper part of the innominate bones flares out so pushing them inwards will move the lower part outwards, away from the sacrum, opening the sacroiliac joints, increasing their instability). They will use this belt for activities which have in the past precipitated back pain. They will be reassessed one month later.&#xD;

          <title>Immediate Corrective Exercises</title>
          <description>After the sacroiliac forward flexion test (SIFFT) has determined the position of each innominate bone, depending on their ability, subjects are given 1 of 3 exercises to correct their sacroiliac malrotation. All 3 correct anterior malrotation, by flexing the thigh hard against the ilium, pushing it posteriorly. Posterior malrotation, is corrected by hyperextending the thigh, using the sartorius and rectus femoris to pull the ilium anteriorly. These exercises are:&#xD;
Genuflect, anterior foot and posterior knee on the floor hands on the floor on either side of the foot, sliding the knee backwards to hyperextend the thigh.&#xD;
In supine position anterior foot on an assistant's sternum, posterior thigh hyperextended. Assistant leans forward, forcing the anterior thigh against the ilium and pushing down on the posterior thigh.&#xD;
For anterior malrotation alone: anterior foot on a chair seat, pulling up hard with both hands, leaning back, forcing the thigh against the ilium.&#xD;
Hold the position for 2 minutes. They will use the exercise as needed for pain control and will be reassessed one month later.&#xD;
At that time they will be given the pelvic support belt and the concurrent use of both treatments will be assessed at their last visit one month after that.</description>

          <title>Immediate Use of Pelvic Support Belt</title>
          <description>Participants will be given a pelvic support belt to stabilize their sacroiliac joints. The belt is fitted tightly around the pelvis, over the sacrum and below the anterior superior iliac spines (ASISs) to prevent opening the joint. (The upper part of the innominate bones flares out so pushing them inwards will move the lower part outwards, away from the sacrum, opening the sacroiliac joints, increasing their instability). They will use this belt for activities which have in the past precipitated back pain. They will be reassessed one month later.&#xD;
At that time they will be given the exercises to correct their sacroiliac malrotation and the concurrent use of both treatments will be assessed at their last visit one month later.</description>

          <description>These participants will continue using their current therapies to deal with their low back pain for one month prior to being scheduled for a treatment visit. At the treatment visit, one month later they will be given both the exercise and the belt.&#xD;
The concurrent use of both treatments will be assessed at their last visit one month after that.&#xD;
Delayed treatment: Participants will continue the treatments they are currently using to relieve their low back pain for one month prior to being treated with the intervention.</description>

          <description>Participant stands flexed at the hips, body horizontal, legs vertical. PSISs are located by pressing down with the ulnar side of the thumbs advancing them cephalad towards the PSISs starting on either side of the inter-gluteal cleft. When the PSISs are reached, bony resistance is felt. Ask the participant on which side they feel pain i.e. where the joint is malrotated.&#xD;
The examiner then marks the area between his/her thumb and each PSIS. With the participant standing, a horizontal level is placed on the lowest mark and the distance between the level and the highest mark is measured in cm.</description>

All 3 correct anterior malrotation, by flexing the thigh hard against the ilium, pushing it posteriorly. Posterior malrotation, is corrected by hyperextending the thigh, using the sartorius and rectus femoris to pull the ilium anteriorly. These exercises are:&#xD;
Genuflect, anterior foot and posterior knee on the floor hands on the floor on either side of the foot, sliding the knee backwards to hyperextend the thigh.&#xD;
In supine position anterior foot on an assistant's sternum, posterior thigh hyperextended. Assistant leans forward, forcing the anterior thigh against the ilium and pushing down on the posterior thigh.&#xD;
For anterior malrotation alone: anterior foot on a chair seat, pulling up hard with both hands, leaning back, forcing the thigh against the ilium.&#xD;
Hold the position for 2 minutes. They will use the exercise as needed for pain control and will be reassessed one month later.&#xD;
At that time they will be given the pelvic support belt and the concurrent use of both treatments will be assessed at their last visit one month after that.</description>

A higher painful PSIS has anterior, a lower one has posterior malrotation. They are given the appropriate exercise to correct their sacroiliac malrotation. Anterior rotation is corrected with the flexed thigh pushing hard on the anterior superior iliac spine to force it posteriorly. Posterior rotation is corrected by hyperextending the thigh, using the sartorius and the rectus femoris to pull the ilium anteriorly. 3 techniques: - genuflection, anterior side foot and posterior side knee on the floor, hands on either side of the foot, knee stretched backwards, - anterior side foot on chair, pull up on chair to force the thigh against the ilium, - in dorsal decubitus assistant with anterior side foot on their sternum leans forward to push the thigh against ilium and pushes down on extended posterior side thigh to overstretch it. All these are held for 2 minutes. They are then fitted with a sacroiliac stabilization belt to wear as needed for back pain producing activities.

A higher painful PSIS has anterior, a lower one has posterior malrotation. They are given the appropriate exercise (PSISE) to correct their sacroiliac malrotation. Anterior rotation is corrected with the flexed thigh pushing hard on the anterior superior iliac spine to force it posteriorly. Posterior rotation is corrected by hyperextending the thigh, using the sartorius and the rectus femoris to pull the ilium anteriorly. 3 techniques: - genuflection, anterior side foot and posterior side knee on the floor, hands on either side of the foot, knee stretched backwards, - anterior side foot on chair, pull up on chair to force the thigh against the ilium, - in dorsal decubitus assistant with anterior side foot on their sternum leans forward to push the thigh against ilium and pushes down on extended posterior side thigh to overstretch it. All these are held for 2 minutes. They are then fitted with a sacroiliac stabilization belt to wear as needed for back pain producing activities. They are reassessed one month later at their two month visit once again using the BPI pain score.</description>

            <description>The sacroiliac forward flexion test (SIFFT) will determine the level of each posterior superior iliac spine (PSISL). The distance in centimetres between the levels of the PSISs will be recorded. Depending on their ability, subjects are given 1 of 3 exercises to correct their sacroiliac malrotation. All 3 correct anterior malrotation by flexing the thigh hard against the ilium, pushing it posteriorly. Posterior malrotation, is corrected by hyperextending the thigh, using the sartorius and rectus femoris to pull the ilium anteriorly. These exercises are:&#xD;
Genuflect, anterior foot and posterior knee on the floor hands on the floor on either side of the foot, sliding the knee backwards to hyperextend the thigh.&#xD;
In supine position anterior foot on an assistant's sternum, posterior thigh hyperextended. Assistant leans forward, forcing the anterior thigh against the ilium and pushing down on the posterior thigh.&#xD;
For anterior malrotation alone: anterior foot on a chair seat, pulling up hard with both hands, leaning back, forcing the thigh against the ilium.&#xD;
Hold the position for 2 minutes. They will use the exercise as needed for pain control and will be reassessed with the PSISL one month later.&#xD;
At that time they will be given the pelvic support belt. The concurrent use of both treatments will be assessed at their last visit one month later using the PSISL.</description>

            <description>The sacroiliac forward flexion test (SIFFT) will determine the level of each posterior superior iliac spine (PSISL). The distance in centimetres between the levels of the PSISs will be recorded. Following this, participants will be given a pelvic support belt to stabilize their sacroiliac joints. The belt is fitted tightly around the pelvis, over the sacrum and below the anterior superior iliac spines (ASISs) to prevent opening the joint. (The upper part of the innominate bones flares out so pushing them inwards will move the lower part outwards, away from the sacrum, opening the sacroiliac joints, increasing their instability). They will use this belt for activities which have in the past precipitated back pain. They will be reassessed one month later with the PSISL.&#xD;
At that time they will be given the exercises to correct their sacroiliac malrotation and the concurrent use of both treatments will be assessed with the PSISL at their last visit one month later.</description>

            <description>After the sacroiliac forward flexion test (SIFFT) determined the position of each innominate bone, depending on their ability, subjects were given 1 of 3 exercises (SIFFTE) to correct their sacroiliac malrotation. All 3 correct anterior malrotation, by flexing the thigh hard against the ilium, pushing it posteriorly. Posterior malrotation, is corrected by hyperextending the thigh, using the sartorius and rectus femoris to pull the ilium anteriorly. One of 3 different exercises was used depending on the participants' ability to perform them.&#xD;
The position is held for 2 minutes. They used the exercise as needed for pain control.&#xD;
Participants were also given a pelvic support belt to stabilize their sacroiliac joints. The belt is fitted tightly around the pelvis, over the sacrum and below the anterior superior iliac spines (ASISs) to prevent opening the joint. (The upper part of the innominate bones flares out so pushing them inwards will move the lower part outwards, away from the sacrum, opening the sacroiliac joints, increasing their instability). They used this belt for activities which had in the past precipitated back pain.&#xD;
They were reassessed one month later. At that time, they were asked how satisfied they were with each treatment on a scale from 0 - 3. (0 = not at all, 1 = sometimes, 2 = most of the time, 3 = always satisfied) and which treatment they preferred, exercise, belt, both or neither. The score for the preferred therapy was recorded.</description>

        <description>At baseline, participants answered the satisfaction questionnaire: &quot;on a scale of 0 - 3 where 0 = not at all, 1 = sometimes, 2 = most of the time, 3 = always, how satisfied were you with the treatments you received from your chiropractor?&quot; Two months later, after using the corrective exercise (SIFFTE) and the pelvic support belt for one month they were asked the same satisfaction questions for the corrective exercise (SIFFTE) and the pelvic support belt, following which they were asked whether they preferred the exercise, the belt, both or neither. If they chose the exercise, the satisfaction score for the exercise was used, if they chose the belt the satisfaction score for the belt was used, if they chose both the higher satisfaction score was used, if they chose neither the lower satisfaction score was used. The minimum value was 0, the maximum value was 3. Higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>

          <title>Immediate Corrective Exercises</title>
          <description>After the sacroiliac forward flexion test (SIFFT) has determined the position of each innominate bone, depending on their ability, subjects are given 1 of 3 exercises to correct their sacroiliac malrotation. All 3 correct anterior malrotation, by flexing the thigh hard against the ilium, pushing it posteriorly. Posterior malrotation, is corrected by hyperextending the thigh, using the sartorius and rectus femoris to pull the ilium anteriorly. These exercises are:&#xD;
Genuflect, anterior foot and posterior knee on the floor hands on the floor on either side of the foot, sliding the knee backwards to hyperextend the thigh.&#xD;
In supine position anterior foot on an assistant's sternum, posterior thigh hyperextended. Assistant leans forward, forcing the anterior thigh against the ilium and pushing down on the posterior thigh.&#xD;
For anterior malrotation alone: anterior foot on a chair seat, pulling up hard with both hands, leaning back, forcing the thigh against the ilium.&#xD;
Hold the position for 2 minutes. They will use the exercise as needed for pain control and will be reassessed one month later.&#xD;
At that time they will be given the pelvic support belt and the concurrent use of both treatments will be assessed at their last visit one month after that.</description>

          <title>Immediate Use of Pelvic Support Belt</title>
          <description>Participants will be given a pelvic support belt to stabilize their sacroiliac joints. The belt is fitted tightly around the pelvis, over the sacrum and below the anterior superior iliac spines (ASISs) to prevent opening the joint. (The upper part of the innominate bones flares out so pushing them inwards will move the lower part outwards, away from the sacrum, opening the sacroiliac joints, increasing their instability). They will use this belt for activities which have in the past precipitated back pain. They will be reassessed one month later.&#xD;
At that time they will be given the exercises to correct their sacroiliac malrotation and the concurrent use of both treatments will be assessed at their last visit one month later.</description>

The concurrent use of both treatments will be assessed at their last visit one month after that.&#xD;
Delayed treatment: Participants will continue the treatments they are currently using to relieve their low back pain for one month prior to being treated with the intervention.</description>
