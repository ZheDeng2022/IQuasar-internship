  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia (NH) is common among healthy neonates and normally resolves&#xD;
      within a week. Untreated pathological hyperbilirubinaemia, however, can result in long-term&#xD;
      neurological sequelae, which compromise childhood development, or may result in perinatal&#xD;
      death. True population-based data from middle to low-income countries are scarce and NH&#xD;
      contribution to morbidity and mortality remains unclear. With this study the investigators&#xD;
      aim at assessing the prevalence of neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia in a cohort of newborns in a&#xD;
      maternity hospital in Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and at evaluating the&#xD;
      possible risk factors for NH in the mother and the baby.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia is common among healthy neonates and normally resolves within a&#xD;
      week. Untreated pathological hyperbilirubinaemia, however, can result in long-term&#xD;
      neurological sequelae, which compromise childhood development, or may result in perinatal&#xD;
      death. Worldwide, this condition aï¬€ects at least 481,000 term or near term newborn babies&#xD;
      annually, causing 114,000 deaths and more than 63,000 cases of moderate or severe disability.&#xD;
      In high-income settings, early diagnosis and treatment in neonatal intensive care units have&#xD;
      dramatically improved the outcome for babies at risk. However, true population-based data&#xD;
      from middle to low-income countries are scarce and NH contribution to morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      remains unclear. The Democratic Republic of Congo is one of the 5 countries with the highest&#xD;
      neonatal mortality rate: 29 per 1000 live births, with an estimated 96,963 annual deaths. NH&#xD;
      diagnosis is mostly performed by visual inspection, which is not very reliable, and it is not&#xD;
      systematically reported in maternity records. The primary objective is to evaluate the&#xD;
      prevalence of neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia in a cohort of in-hospital consecutive live&#xD;
      births. The secondary objective is to evaluate the possible risk factors for NH in the mother&#xD;
      and the baby. The results of this survey will provide essential baseline data for the&#xD;
      community. If the frequency of the NH and severe NH in the area is higher than routinely&#xD;
      reported, prompt and appropriate management guidelines can be put in place to improve&#xD;
      treatment to decrease neonatal mortality and neurological disabilities.&#xD;
