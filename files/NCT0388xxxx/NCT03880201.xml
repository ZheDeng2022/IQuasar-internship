      The aim of this study to evaluate the ability of perfusion index to detect ulnar sparing and&#xD;
      to estimate the proper time for the perfusion index ratio to determine successful block.&#xD;

      On arrival to the operating room, patients will be connected to standard continuous&#xD;
      monitoring; i.e. 5 lead electrocardiography (ECG), pulse oximetry, and automated non-invasive&#xD;
      blood pressure monitoring (NIBP) every 5 minute. Two radical-7 (masimo set) devices will be&#xD;
      connected the patient through two probes. The probes will be connected to both index and&#xD;
      fifth digit to have a baseline reading before block performance. After block performance, PI&#xD;
      will be continuously monitored for 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2-Anesthetic technique&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supraclavicular block:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Equipment and preparation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasound machine with linear transducer (8-14 MHz) (Siemens acusonx300, Korea).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5-cm, 22-gauge insulated block needle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sterile gloves, sterile sleeve, and gel (Or other coupling medium; e.g. Saline)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  20 to 25 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine + 2% lidocaine in equal volumes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient position:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The block can be performed while the patient is in the supine, semi-sitting, with the&#xD;
      Patient's head turned away from the side to be blocked with slight elevation of the head of&#xD;
      the bed which is often more comfortable for the Patient and allows for better drainage and&#xD;
      less prominence of the neck veins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After sterilization and local anaesthetic infiltration of skin, the linear transducer will be&#xD;
      applied firmly above the clavicle in the coronal oblique plane to view the transverse section&#xD;
      of the subclavian artery, pleura, first rib and brachial plexus (which is recognized as&#xD;
      around or oval compact groups of hypo-echoic nerves, located lateral and superficial to the&#xD;
      pulsatile subclavian artery and superior to the first rib). The 22-gauge needle will be&#xD;
      inserted at the lateral side of the ultrasound probe using In-plane approach. The block&#xD;
      needle will be advanced along the long axis of the transducer (from lateral to medial). The&#xD;
      needle will be advanced towards the target nerves inferior, lateral and superficial to&#xD;
      subclavian artery respectively. Local anesthetic solution is injected so as to cause hydro&#xD;
      dissection of the planes around the plexus the volume of local Anesthetic used is usually&#xD;
      between 20 to 25 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor block will be assessed as inability to flex elbow and hand joints against gravity and&#xD;
      will be tested for each nerve as follow Radial nerve = Push the arm by extending the forearm&#xD;
      at the elbow against the resistance, musculocutaneous nerve = Resisting the pull of the&#xD;
      forearm at the elbow, median nerve = Thumb and second digit pinch, ulnar nerve = Thumb and&#xD;
      fifth digit pinch (15). Sensory block will be assessed by using piece of ice in the&#xD;
      distribution of median, ulnar, radial and musculocutaneous nerves. This assessment will take&#xD;
      place every 5 minutes till 30 minutes and the block will be considered failed if the patient&#xD;
      reports pain at the examined dermatomes during assessment time which needs conversion to&#xD;
      general anesthesia. If the patient reports no sensation in the whole upper limb apart from&#xD;
      the dermatomes supplied by ulnar nerve, which is not relieved after local infiltration of&#xD;
      skin by local anesthetic this will be considered ulnar nerve sparing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The block assessment will be correlated with Masimo pulse oximetry readings during the first&#xD;
      30 minutes of the block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Masimo reading of PI values will be recorded every minute (at both index and fifth digits)&#xD;
      for 10 minutes then every 3 minutes for 7 readings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of HR, MAP and pulse oximetry will be recorded before the block and every 5&#xD;
      minutes for 30 minutes after the block, then every 15 minutes till the end of surgery.&#xD;
