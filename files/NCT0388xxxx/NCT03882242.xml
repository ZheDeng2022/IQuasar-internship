    <textblock>
      The study will examine, through quantitative and qualitative research, how the delivery of&#xD;
      the program &quot;In Favor of Myself&quot; to school children influences the program facilitators&#xD;
      themselves, and the effect on their self-esteem, body-image, and media literacy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent decades, the existence of prevention and intervention programs has gained momentum&#xD;
      and has become an important part of our culture. Programs are delivered around the world in a&#xD;
      wide variety of fields and subjects. They serve as an auxiliary tool for the improvement,&#xD;
      awareness, empowerment, treatment and response to a range of social and personal behavioral&#xD;
      issues and behaviors, eradication of harmful behaviors, and more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature there is ample evidence and proof of the nature of the effects and impact&#xD;
      of different programs on the group of participants involved. Many successes in these programs&#xD;
      relate to the contents of the program, the level of interest among the participants, the way&#xD;
      the program is delivered, the degree of interaction between the facilitators and the&#xD;
      participants, and more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yet there is little reference in the literature to the aspect that examines the program&#xD;
      facilitators themselves and the potential impact that the programs will have on a variety of&#xD;
      aspects and personal measures in the lives of the facilitators. Among these measures is the&#xD;
      experience of instruction, including the experience of teaching and learning embodied in it,&#xD;
      the involvement of the ego and the involvement of the facilitator in the tasks, the impact on&#xD;
      the values and the personal level of the facilitators, including impact on their self-esteem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine, through quantitative and qualitative research, how the delivery of&#xD;
      the program &quot;In Favor of Myself&quot; to school children influences the program facilitators&#xD;
      themselves, and the effect on their self-esteem, body-image, and media literacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research hypothesis is that the self-esteem, body image, media literacy, the sense of&#xD;
      ability, and personal empowerment of the group of facilitators who delivered the program will&#xD;
      be increased, and their behavior will change according to the subjects of the program.&#xD;

    <description>Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1965)- 10 items. Scoring involves a method of combined ratings. Low self-esteem responses are &quot;disagree&quot; or&#xD;

Two or three out of three correct responses to items 3, 7, and 9 are scored as one item. One or two out of two correct responses for items 4 and 5 are considered as a single item; items 1,8, and 10 are scored as individual items; and combined correct responses (one or two out of two) to items 2 and 6 are considered to be a single item.</description>
