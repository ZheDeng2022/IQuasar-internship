  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I open-label, single-arm, multicenter clinical trial designed to observe and&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, cell metabolokinetics, and efficacy of CAR-GPC3 T cells infused&#xD;
      intravenously at single escalating doses in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of CAR-GPC3 T cells infused intravenously at&#xD;
      escalating doses in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives：&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the metabolic kinetics of single infusion of CAR-GPC3 T cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the overall safety and tolerability of infusion of CAR-GPC3 T cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To observe the efficacy of CAR-GPC3 T cells in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular&#xD;
