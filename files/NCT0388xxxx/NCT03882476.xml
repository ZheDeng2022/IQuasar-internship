  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The focus of this study will be to conduct a prospective, multi-center randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT) at Cape Regional Medical Center (CRMC), Oroville Hospital (OH), and UCSF Medical&#xD;
      Center (UCSF) in which a machine-learning algorithm will be applied to EHR data for the&#xD;
      detection of sepsis. For patients determined to have a high risk of sepsis, the algorithm&#xD;
      will generate automated voice, telephone notification to nursing staff at CRMC, OH, and UCSF.&#xD;
      The algorithm's performance will be measured by analysis of the primary endpoint, in-hospital&#xD;
      SIRS-based mortality.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      From January 2020 to February 2021, inclusive, investigators will perform a multi-center&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) at CRMC, OH, and UCSF. All aims of this study have been&#xD;
      have been submitted for approval by the Pearl Institutional Review Board with a waiver of&#xD;
      informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study period, all patients over the age of 18 presenting to the emergency&#xD;
      department or admitted to an inpatient unit at the participating facilities will&#xD;
      automatically be enrolled in the trial, until the target enrollment for the study is met.&#xD;
      Enrollment will entail randomization to either the control or the experimental arms. Patients&#xD;
      will be assigned to the experimental group or control group based on a random allocation&#xD;
      sequence, generated by a computer program before the start of the trial, using simple&#xD;
      randomization, with a 1:1 allocation ratio. This allocation sequence will be concealed to&#xD;
      patients, healthcare providers and study investigators. However the trial will have an&#xD;
      open-label design, as full blinding is not possible as some group assignments will become&#xD;
      naturally revealed upon receipt of telephonic alerts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two arms in the study. The control arm will involve patients with the usual&#xD;
      standard of care, and the experimental arm will involve patients monitored by InSight. If the&#xD;
      applicable algorithm determines a patient to be at a high risk for sepsis, a telephonic alert&#xD;
      will be sent to the charge nurse on duty in the patient's current location. Response to&#xD;
      alerts will follow the protocol from our previous sepsis clinical trial. The procedure&#xD;
      consists of a nurse conducting a patient bedside evaluation to rule out suspected infection.&#xD;
      This includes assessment of patient vital signs, EHR notes, and recent laboratory results. If&#xD;
      the nurse suspects sepsis, a physician subsequently assesses the patient and, if appropriate,&#xD;
      places an order for administration of the standard sepsis treatment bundle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the administration of clinical trials, some open-label studies are cluster-randomized&#xD;
      while others are randomized at an individual patient level. Cluster randomization is&#xD;
      frequently used to minimize &quot;contamination&quot; between treatment and control groups, because&#xD;
      exposure of providers to patients from both arms in an open-label study often invites&#xD;
      unintentional behavioral biases. These biases may cause providers to adjust their&#xD;
      interventions in the control group to mimic their actions in the experimental group, thereby&#xD;
      masking the intervention's effect and skewing the study results towards the null. Although&#xD;
      open-label, cluster-randomized trials are effective in minimizing contamination among groups,&#xD;
      they have several significant disadvantages, including greater complexity in design and&#xD;
      analysis as well as larger patient enrollment requirements to achieve the same statistical&#xD;
      power. Because larger sample sizes often necessitate increases in cost, length, or complexity&#xD;
      of a trial, current research has indicated that trialists should use individual randomization&#xD;
      if possible due to the drawbacks of cluster allocation. Given these considerations,&#xD;
      investigators concluded that individual randomization was the best strategy for the trial, as&#xD;
      it affords a significant amount of increase in statistical power and allows each patient&#xD;
      outcome to be assessed independently of every other patient. To minimize possible bias,&#xD;
      investigators also decided to make the automated phone call text identical in both arms. The&#xD;
      successful use of patient-level randomization in a previous sepsis clinical trial conducted&#xD;
      by investigators gives confidence in this trial design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the discharge of the last enrolled patient, investigators will evaluate whether the&#xD;
      primary endpoint of in-hospital SIRS-based mortality is met. Additional outcome measures of&#xD;
      interest for each SIRS-based group will include: time to completion of each element of the&#xD;
      Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) bundle; ventilator-free days; ICU days; and 30-day hospital&#xD;
      readmission rate. The 1-hour SSC bundle consists of obtaining blood cultures, measuring&#xD;
      lactate level, administering broad-spectrum antibiotics, administering 30 mL/kg of&#xD;
      crystalloid fluid for hypertension or lactate &gt;4 mmol/L, and applying vasopressors if patient&#xD;
      is hypotensive during or after fluid resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators plan to draw from EHR-based clinical data for primary endpoint analysis, as&#xD;
      opposed to claims-based data, due to its ability to provide more objective measurements on&#xD;
      patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the study, significant findings will be published as scientific papers.&#xD;
