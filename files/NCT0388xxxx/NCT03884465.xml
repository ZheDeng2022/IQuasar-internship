    <intervention_model_description>Subjects will be enrolled in 4 sequential cohorts, each with an increasing initial dose of inhaled dry powder treprostinil (LIQ861) at 25μg, 50μg, 75μg, and 100μg capsule strengths (8 subjects at each dose level). Subjects will undergo right heart catheterization (RHC) at Day 1 to assess hemodynamic response.&#xD;
Subjects enrolled in Germany will continue in a follow-up hemodynamic and long-term safety study beginning immediately after the conclusion of the post-RHC assessments on Day 1 of Part A. Subjects will continue on therapy at four times daily (QID) on Day 1 and until Week 16 and may be titrated up or down by no more than one 25 μg increment per week, based upon symptomatic relief or side effects experienced by the subject. Investigators may also initiate Part B dosing at 25 μg before following this titration schedule.</intervention_model_description>
