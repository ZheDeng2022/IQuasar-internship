    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) witnessed relevant therapeutic progress in the last decade. Following&#xD;
      the extraordinary progress in the treatment of relapsing-remitting (RR) multiple sclerosis&#xD;
      (MS), two major unmet needs remain to be addressed by translational research in this field:&#xD;
      progressive MS and the &quot;dream&quot; of a world free of MS. As far as the latter is concerned, the&#xD;
      investigators can hope to make the dream come true by understanding the etiology of the&#xD;
      disease and hence design definitive cures. A more realistic and pragmatic perspective may be&#xD;
      the prevention of the clinical onset of the disease, a research field that promises to become&#xD;
      increasingly important as the integration of genetic data with endophenotypes, magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging and other biomarkers ameliorates the ability to predict the development of&#xD;
      the disease under clinical circumstance. Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine has been&#xD;
      tested with encouraging results in early MS and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). The&#xD;
      knowledge that disease-modifying therapies work best when used early in the demyelinating&#xD;
      process raises the question about whether to try this approach - which is safe, cheap and&#xD;
      handy - in individuals with radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiologically isolated syndrome is a new entity, diagnosed when the unanticipated magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) finding of brain spatial dissemination of focal white matter (WM)&#xD;
      lesions highly suggestive of MS occurs in subjects without symptoms of MS, and with normal&#xD;
      neurological examinations. Conversion to clinically isolated syndromes (CIS) were described&#xD;
      in 84% of RIS individuals with spinal cord lesions over a median time of 1.6 years from the&#xD;
      date of the first MRI. Whether or not to treat this condition remains currently a clinical&#xD;
      conundrum. Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine may have these characteristics since it&#xD;
      resulted beneficial in early MS and first demyelinating episodes. Being safe, cheap and&#xD;
      handy, the investigators propose to investigate its use to prevent progression of the&#xD;
      demyelinating process in radiologically isolated syndrome. An approach such as BCG vaccine&#xD;
      seems appropriate as a front-line immunomodulatory approach for RIS people. In a pilot study&#xD;
      BCG vaccine was safe and effective in reducing disease activity at MRI, and the risk of&#xD;
      developing persistent T1-hypointense lesions ('black holes' -BH- expression of tissue damage)&#xD;
      in subjects with MS.&#xD;

      Multiple sclerosis (MS) witnessed relevant therapeutic progress in the last decade. This&#xD;
      notwithstanding, safety, quality of life and overtreatment remain elements of strong concern&#xD;
      for the subjects. Safe and manageable therapies that can be used since the (biological) onset&#xD;
      of the disease, without risk of overtreatment, are important unmet needs in MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the extraordinary progress in the treatment of relapsing-remitting (RR) multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis (MS), two major unmet needs remain to be addressed by translational research in&#xD;
      this field: progressive MS and the &quot;dream&quot; of a world free of MS. As far as the latter is&#xD;
      concerned, the investigators can hope to make the dream come true by understanding the&#xD;
      etiology of the disease and hence design definitive cures. Unfortunately this perspective is&#xD;
      neither at hand, nor it can be taken for granted that the etiologic targets, once discovered,&#xD;
      will be readily treatable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A more realistic and pragmatic perspective may be the prevention of the clinical onset of the&#xD;
      disease, a research field that promises to become increasingly important as the integration&#xD;
      of genetic data with endophenotypes, magnetic resonance imaging and other biomarkers&#xD;
      ameliorates the ability to predict the development of the disease under clinical&#xD;
      circumstance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiological data supporting vitamin D supplementation and smoking avoidance are candidate&#xD;
      approaches for primary and secondary prevention of the disease. Among other interventions&#xD;
      that may have characteristics compatible with those of a preventive treatment, Bacille&#xD;
      Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine has been tested with encouraging results in early MS and&#xD;
      clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). The knowledge that disease-modifying therapies work best&#xD;
      when used early in the demyelinating process raises the question about whether to try this&#xD;
      approach - which is safe, cheap and handy - in individuals with radiologically isolated&#xD;
      syndrome (RIS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiologically isolated syndrome is a new entity, diagnosed when the unanticipated magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) finding of brain spatial dissemination of focal white matter (WM)&#xD;
      lesions highly suggestive of MS occurs in subjects without symptoms of MS, and with normal&#xD;
      neurological examinations. Approximately one-third and two-thirds of individuals experience&#xD;
      respectively clinical onset and/or radiological progression over a mean follow-up of five&#xD;
      years. However, predictors (male sex, age &lt; 37, spinal cord involvement) of higher risk of&#xD;
      progression have been identified and conversion to clinically isolated syndromes (CIS) were&#xD;
      described in 84% of RIS individuals with spinal cord lesions over a median time of 1.6 years&#xD;
      from the date of the first MRI; the same predictors have recently been shown to precede&#xD;
      evolution toward primary progressive MS. Whether or not to treat this condition remains&#xD;
      currently a clinical conundrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine may have these characteristics since it resulted&#xD;
      beneficial in early MS and first demyelinating episodes. Being safe, cheap and handy, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to explore its use to prevent progression of the demyelinating process&#xD;
      in radiologically isolated syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An approach such as BCG vaccine seems appropriate as a front-line immunomodulatory approach&#xD;
      for RIS people. This project is proposed in the context of the activity of the Center for&#xD;
      Experimental Neurological Therapies (CENTERS - a special project by the Fondazione Italiana&#xD;
      Sclerosi Multipla - FISM). CENTERS is especially dedicated to phase II trials of this nature&#xD;
      (independent, repurposing studies, that may be only funded by not-for-profit institutions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Preliminary Results&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental and epidemiological evidences suggested benefit of exposure to microbial&#xD;
      products (in the absence of infection, as is the case of vaccinations) in autoimmunity,&#xD;
      including MS. In a pilot study BCG vaccine was safe and effective in reducing disease&#xD;
      activity at MRI, and the risk of developing persistent T1-hypointense lesions ('black holes'&#xD;
      -BH- expression of tissue damage) in subjects with MS. A placebo-controlled trial in people&#xD;
      with clinically isolated syndrome supported the findings of the pilot study. The researchers&#xD;
      observed benefit on disease activity at MRI, reduced development of BH, benefit on conversion&#xD;
      to clinically definite MS over 5 years, during which the subjects took interferon beta&#xD;
      beginning from six months after BCG or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators consider timely an extension of the adjuvant approach to subjects with RIS,&#xD;
      also considering recent achievements in 'metrics' suitable to analyze this condition:&#xD;
      neuroimaging has recently allowed to improve the characterization of RIS (including the&#xD;
      identification of individuals at higher risk of progression to MS; and to disclose cortical&#xD;
      lesions and axonal damage in RIS brain; immune-metabolic profiling provides a complex&#xD;
      correlation between immunometabolic cellular variables, that seems especially apt to analyze&#xD;
      preclinical phase of neuroinflammation and to study an approach whose underlying mechanisms&#xD;
      of actions remain largely unknown, in spite of encouraging clinical results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Scientific rationale and main objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      BCG vaccine showed beneficial effects on disease activity and possibly on tissue damage in&#xD;
      relapsing-remitting MS and clinically isolated syndrome. The investigators now propose to&#xD;
      evaluate whether and how BCG vaccine exerts favorable biological effects in individuals with&#xD;
      RIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present it is unclear whether the neuroprotective/neurorepair potential of BCG is a&#xD;
      consequence of its ability to reduce central nervous system (CNS) inflammation or it depends&#xD;
      on additional and specific mechanisms. Notably, neuroprotection after BCG vaccination was&#xD;
      reported in models of Parkinson disease, suggesting a neuroprotective vaccine paradigm in&#xD;
      which general (nonself-reactive) immune stimulation in the periphery can limit potentially&#xD;
      deleterious microglial responses to a neuronal insult. Accordingly, convergent evidences&#xD;
      suggest a role of BCG, as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-inducer, in another immune-mediated&#xD;
      disease, type I diabetes: TNF receptor 2 may mediate, at least in part, beneficial effects of&#xD;
      BCG in neuroinflammation and type 1 diabetes by favoring apoptosis of autoreactive T cells,&#xD;
      counteracting T cell regulatory deficit and last, but not least, fostering tissue repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic abnormalities suggestive of axonal damage were reported in a substantial proportion&#xD;
      of RIS subjects and cortical lesions of fronto-temporal lobes were associated with predictors&#xD;
      of evolution to multiple sclerosis (MS), such as spinal cord involvement, presence of&#xD;
      oligoclonal bands on cerebrospinal fluid and dissemination in time on brain MRI. The&#xD;
      researchers aim at verifying potential beneficial effects of BCG vaccination in people with&#xD;
      RIS, evaluating MRI metrics of macroscopic brain damage, as well as subtle tissue damage as&#xD;
      assessed by both conventional and non conventional MRI techniques. On the immunological side&#xD;
      the investigators will assess the immune-metabolic status of RIS people as well as their&#xD;
      regulatory T cell potential: a multiple parameter analysis will provide a meta-immunologic&#xD;
      profiling that has been recently shown to be impaired in MS. This will be aimed at creating a&#xD;
      follow-up scheme which should allow to monitor RIS people over time, before and after BCG&#xD;
      vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reach the above purposes the investigators propose a 3 years longitudinal study project,&#xD;
      considered appropriate taking into account the relative rarity of RIS condition as well as&#xD;
      the need of an adequate follow-up to obtain informative outcome measures (see methods).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The groups that engendered the above achievements are collaborators of this project, thus&#xD;
      warranting the experience and competence to pursue the proposed research.&#xD;
