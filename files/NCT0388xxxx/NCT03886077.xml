    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-blinded cohort study that will assess the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      and antiviral efficacy of glecaprevir/pibrentasivir therapy given post-discharge to&#xD;
      HCV-negative recipients of HCV infected donors. Patients who meet entry criteria will be&#xD;
      enrolled while on the transplant waitlist. At the time of transplant, some donors will be HCV&#xD;
      positive / NAT positive and some will not be infected. Enrolled patients who receive an HCV&#xD;
      negative donor will serve as contemporaneous controls. All study subjects who receive an HCV&#xD;
      positive organ will be confirmed to have acquired HCV infection and genotype will be assessed&#xD;
      prior to treatment with therapy.&#xD;

      4. STUDY PROCEDURES 4.1 Subject Enrollment The patient is considered to be enrolled when they&#xD;
      sign study consent. This may be months or years prior to the date of transplantation and&#xD;
      therefore all study patients will be asked to affirm consent at the time of transplantation.&#xD;
      There are 2 non-randomized study groups: Those patients who receive a non-HCV donor and those&#xD;
      who receive a donor with HCV infection. Subjects will re-sign the consent on the line&#xD;
      reserved for this purpose at the time of the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient presented with a hepatitis C donor heart decides not to take that heart, they&#xD;
      would remain in the study and when a suitable heart is found (infected or not), they would be&#xD;
      followed post-transplant in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Study Procedures Following transplantation with an HCV infectious donor, HCV viral load&#xD;
      (RNA assay) will be measured at days 3,7 and 14 days post-transplant. The HCV viral load&#xD;
      assay is a routine FDA cleared laboratory test which is one of the standard labs available at&#xD;
      Sentara Norfolk General Hospital. It involves a blood sample of 5 cc which is then processed&#xD;
      in the lab. Based on prior work, it is likely that all transplant recipients with infectious&#xD;
      donors will seroconvert within this time frame. If these patients remain negative for HCV&#xD;
      RNA, it will be rechecked every month for a total of 6 months. This routine testing is&#xD;
      covered by insurance as this is the clinical standard for donors with elevated risk (Public&#xD;
      Health Service increased risk).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a patient seroconverts to HCV positive, insurance authorization for treatment will be&#xD;
      sought for treatment with glecaprevir/pibrentasivir. Based on input from Dr. Michael Ryan of&#xD;
      Gastroenterology, insurance carriers are approving therapy given the noted efficacy, low&#xD;
      comparative cost and the recent FDA approval of this drug in renal and liver transplant&#xD;
      recipients. The study treatment is oral glecaprevir/pibrentasivir, 3 tablets daily with food,&#xD;
      for a total of 12 weeks. The medication will be paid by the patient's insurance prescription&#xD;
      coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serial measurements of HCV NAT (every month) will be conducted including through 24 weeks&#xD;
      post-transplant. In addition, coronary angiography plus coronary intravascular ultrasound&#xD;
      will be conducted at 6-12 weeks post-transplant and at one-year post transplant which will&#xD;
      allow careful evaluation for cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Of note, it has been the policy&#xD;
      of the Sentara Heart Transplant program for more than 5 years to perform baseline (early&#xD;
      post-transplant) and annual coronary angiography and coronary intravascular ultrasound, and&#xD;
      regardless of study participation, all patients will undergo this standard of care&#xD;
      surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-transplant standard of care visits include frequent routine clinic labs (comprehensive&#xD;
      metabolic panel, hepatic function panel, CMV viral load by PCR, creatinine kinase, complete&#xD;
      blood count, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), tacrolimus or cyclosporine level if&#xD;
      appropriate, sirolimus level if appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 Post-Treatment Assessments Patients will have clinical standard of care visits to the&#xD;
      transplant clinic, typically monthly in the first 6 months following transplantation. HCV NAT&#xD;
      testing will be obtained at each visit for patients who received an infected donor, along&#xD;
      with standard of care testing including cardiac biopsies, echocardiograms, chest-x-rays and&#xD;
      other needed assessments. NAT testing is standard of care for recipients of increased&#xD;
      infectious risk donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A visit will be mandatory at 12 weeks following the last dose of glecaprevir/pibrentasivir to&#xD;
      draw HCV NAT testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failure of HCV treatment If HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ at end of treatment (12 weeks of therapy) or viral&#xD;
      relapse occurs in the Post-treatment follow-up, consultation with infectious disease and&#xD;
      hepatology will be obtained. Testing for HCV drug resistance will be performed and patient&#xD;
      will be treated as clinically indicated by the AHF team in consultation with specialists.&#xD;
      Patients will be followed in regard to outcomes and achievement of SVR-12 until this occurs,&#xD;
      or the patient dies or otherwise withdraws from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4 End of Study Subjects are considered to have completed the study at 1 year&#xD;
      post-transplant or the 1 year cardiac catheterization / IVUS is conducted, whichever is&#xD;
      later.&#xD;

        50 subjects listed for cardiac transplantation will be enrolled. Patients will be educated&#xD;
        about this protocol prior to transplant, and informed consent obtained. Enrolled subjects&#xD;
        who receive a transplant with a NAT positive HCV infected donor will undergo NAT testing&#xD;
        and surveillance post-operatively. In addition, patients who are offered an HCV infectious&#xD;
        organ will be &quot;re-consented&quot; at the time of transplantation admission.&#xD;
