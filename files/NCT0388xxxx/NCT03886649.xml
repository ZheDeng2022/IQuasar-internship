  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A significant number of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) are not cured with available&#xD;
      treatments and will eventually relapse. Those patients might not be able to tolerate more&#xD;
      bone marrow toxicity, limiting their treatment options. Preclinical in vitro studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated a synergism of venetoclax and copanlisib in different lymphomas. This may&#xD;
      represent a safe and effective therapy for patients who relapsed or did not respond to&#xD;
      standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this phase I trial is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of copanlisib in combination with venetoclax in patients&#xD;
      with relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are many different types of NHL. A lot of progress has been made over the last years in&#xD;
      the management of NHL, and while some can be cured with available treatments, for others new&#xD;
      treatments are necessary. A significant number of patients that cannot be cured with the&#xD;
      available treatments will eventually relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dysregulation of apoptosis via overexpression of the antiapoptotic BCL-2 protein is paramount&#xD;
      for several subtypes of NHL. On the other hand, PI3K is a central pathway in the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of lymphoma, and PI3K signaling is critical for the proliferation and survival of malignant&#xD;
      cells such as follicular lymphoma (FL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), and others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of copanlisib (PI3K inhibitor) and venetoclax (BLC-2 inhibitor) is&#xD;
      interesting given their known single agent activity in B-cell NHL and their synergy observed&#xD;
      in B-cell NHL preclinical models. The pharmacologic inhibition of PI3K by copanlisib has&#xD;
      translated into significant clinical activity in different lymphoma subtypes. Venetoclax has&#xD;
      proven successful in CLL and the first results in NHL are encouraging. Both compounds are&#xD;
      currently in other combination studies in SLL/CLL and NHL but there are currently no clinical&#xD;
      trials studying this particular combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need to further improve approaches in the relapsed/refractory setting of patients&#xD;
      with NHL in need of systemic therapy and this combination may provide an opportunity for an&#xD;
      active and well-tolerated regimen that does not present the short and long-term toxicities of&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase Ib study here proposed will evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary&#xD;
      antitumor activity of the novel combination of copanlisib with venetoclax, two drugs with&#xD;
      single agent activity across different lymphoma subtypes in the dose escalation and in two&#xD;
      small cohorts of patients with FL and MZL in the expansion phase.&#xD;
