      This study attempts to assess the effect of orthodontic treatment on the stability of&#xD;
      pre-orthodontic recession coverage by connective tissue graft- a randomized controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial and thus facilitate better evidence based treatment protocol.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Gingival recession is the location of the gingival margin apical to the cemento-enamel&#xD;
      junction. The consequences of gingival recession range from impairment of esthetics,&#xD;
      development of dentin hypersensitivity, root caries and an especially high incidence of&#xD;
      non-carious cervical lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology of gingival recession is held to be multifactorial with various predisposing and&#xD;
      precipitating factors recognized. The most commonly implicated risk factors include bone&#xD;
      dehiscence/fenestration, tooth malposition (especially facially positioned teeth), thin&#xD;
      gingival phenotype, the narrow width of keratinized gingiva, frenum pull, the presence of&#xD;
      gingival inflammation, overzealous toothbrushing, and faulty dental restorations. Apart from&#xD;
      these, certain types of orthodontic tooth movements are also assumed to precipitate gingival&#xD;
      recession although conclusive evidence in support of this postulation is still needed and if&#xD;
      indeed true, the precise underlying mechanism still unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the studies have focused on the contribution of orthodontic treatment induced incisor&#xD;
      proclination (outside the dentoalveolar envelope) as a causative factor for the development&#xD;
      of gingival recession and the findings have been indecisive. While some studies support this&#xD;
      premise, others have observed no such correlation. Correspondingly, the issue of periodontal&#xD;
      intervention in order to prevent development and/or progression of gingival recession in&#xD;
      patients scheduled for orthodontic treatment remains unclear. One approach supports&#xD;
      performing gingival augmentation prior to initiation of orthodontic tooth movement. The basis&#xD;
      for this approach rests in the concept of the importance of the minimum amount of attached&#xD;
      gingiva needed for dissipating forces of muscle pull, unattached mucosa and masticatory&#xD;
      stresses and facilitation of patient performed oral hygiene procedures. Esthetic improvement,&#xD;
      management of dentinal hypersensitivity and prevention of root caries are other expected&#xD;
      benefits specifically associated with performing root coverage surgery. Moreover, improvement&#xD;
      of gingival tissue dimensions before orthodontic tooth movement is expected to prevent&#xD;
      further deterioration of preexisting gingival recession and better withstand orthodontic&#xD;
      forces. Therefore, this approach is typically a preventive one. However, supporters of the&#xD;
      other perspective, i.e. waiting for gingival augmentation surgery until after orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment is over believe that it is best to wait until the gingival recession develops into&#xD;
      a pathological entity and becomes a real clinical problem warranting corrective treatment. In&#xD;
      fact, they regard the aforementioned preventive approach as a sort of 'overtreatment' and&#xD;
      therefore avoidable. There are also concerns expressed regarding the long-term stability of&#xD;
      gingival marginal levels achieved with mucogingival surgery performed before orthodontic&#xD;
      tooth movement. Based on the above discussion, it is apparent that there is wide subjectivity&#xD;
      regarding clinical decision making in cases where orthodontic treatment is planned in&#xD;
      patients displaying gingival recession. Currently, both the indications as well as the timing&#xD;
      of carrying out root coverage procedures in patients scheduled for orthodontic treatment are&#xD;
      not very well elaborated. A thorough search of the literature revealed a very modest level of&#xD;
      evidence - one study with prospective and retrospective data collection and the other a&#xD;
      retrospective study. In both the studies, gingival augmentation surgery was carried out&#xD;
      before the orthodontic intervention. Therefore, a need is felt for conducting a well-designed&#xD;
      research in order to dissipate the conflict of opinions existing over this vital clinical&#xD;
      issue. The high prevalence of gingival recession among patients needing orthodontic treatment&#xD;
      renders this question even more vital. The current study has thus been conceived and designed&#xD;
      so as to help resolve this clinical decision making conundrum. In the proposed study, a&#xD;
      comparative evaluation of clinical and radiographic parameters pre and post-orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment in teeth with gingival recession between participants undergoing gingival recession&#xD;
      coverage before the initiation of orthodontic tooth movement with participants not undergoing&#xD;
      pre-orthodontic root coverage will be done. The root coverage procedure chosen is&#xD;
      sub-epithelial connective tissue graft since it is recognized as the gold standard among all&#xD;
      recession coverage surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present prospective, analytical, randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted&#xD;
      in the Department of Periodontics and Oral Implantology in collaboration with Department of&#xD;
      Orthodontics, Post Graduate Institute of Dental Sciences, Rohtak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemically healthy individuals having slight crowding in the anterior region, with at least&#xD;
      one tooth having a gingival recession in the same region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enlisted from the regular outpatient department of the Department of&#xD;
      Periodontics and Oral Implantology, Department of Orthodontics and Department of Oral&#xD;
      Medicine Diagnosis and Radiology after screening on the basis of inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria as detailed above. All participants will be given an outline of the study design and&#xD;
      all patient-specific considerations and concerns will be properly addressed. All participants&#xD;
      will be required to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients enrolled in the study will be further randomly divided into the following two&#xD;
      groups using computer-generated randomization table using block randomization of 4 and 6 by&#xD;
      the random allocation software system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Connective Tissue Graft before Orthodontic treatment (Test Group) - Scaling and root&#xD;
           planing will be performed and after resolution of periodontal inflammation, root&#xD;
           coverage will be done using subepithelial connective tissue graft. Orthodontic treatment&#xD;
           will be initiated 3 months following the grafting procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Orthodontic treatment only (Control Group) - Scaling and root planing will be performed&#xD;
           and after resolution of periodontal inflammation, orthodontic treatment will be&#xD;
           initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants of both the groups will be regularly motivated and expected to maintain&#xD;
      meticulous plaque control throughout the course of orthodontic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full mouth scaling and root planning will be performed using ultrasonic instruments and hand&#xD;
      instruments as needed. After administration of local anaesthesia, a partial-thickness flap&#xD;
      will be reflected with a horizontal incision 2 mm away from the tip of the interdental&#xD;
      papilla, and two vertical incisions will be made from the gingival margin of the line angles&#xD;
      of adjoining teeth. These incisions would extend at least one tooth wider mesiodistally than&#xD;
      the area of gingival recession. The incisions will be extended to the mucobuccal fold. A&#xD;
      connective tissue graft will be obtained from the palate near the gingival margin of molars&#xD;
      and premolars. The palatal wound will be sutured to obtain primary wound closure. The&#xD;
      connective tissue graft will then be placed on the denuded root surface and sutured to the&#xD;
      periosteum using resorbable sutures. The outer portion of the graft will be covered with the&#xD;
      partial thickness flap, and sutures will be placed interdentally. This will be followed by&#xD;
      placement of periodontal dressing. All the patients will be treated with the same fixed&#xD;
      mechanotherapy. Oral hygiene motivation and maintenance will be done during the entire course&#xD;
      of orthodontic treatment. Once the levelling and alignment (approximately 6-8 months) of&#xD;
      teeth has been completed, parameters will be recorded for both test group and control group.&#xD;

&#xD;
      DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Data recorded will be processed by standard&#xD;
      statistical analysis. The normality of distribution of data will be examined by Shapiro Wilk&#xD;
      test. Statistical analysis will be performed according to the distribution of data. If found&#xD;
      to be normal in distribution, intragroup comparison will be done by repeated ANOVA between&#xD;
      different time points followed by paired T-test between two-time points and inter group&#xD;
      comparison will be done by using Independent T-test between two groups. If it is in&#xD;
      non-normal distribution, intragroup comparison will be done by Wilcoxon signed rank test and&#xD;
      intergroup comparison will be done by Mann-Whitney U test. The Chi-square test will be&#xD;
      applied to analyze categoric data. Correlation and association between predictors and&#xD;
      dependent variables will be analyzed by correlation analysis and regression analysis.&#xD;
