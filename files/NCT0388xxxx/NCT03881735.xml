    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well enasidenib works in treating in patients with acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia with an IDH2 gene mutation that has come back or has not responded to&#xD;
      treatment. Enasidenib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. In this study we are investing if enasidenib can be used as&#xD;
      maintenance therapy post salvage induction chemotherapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the effect of IDH2 inhibition following conventional high dose salvage&#xD;
      chemotherapy with detectable IDH2 mutations on event free survival (EFS) in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the effect of IDH2 inhibitor maintenance therapy following intensive salvage&#xD;
      therapy: i.e., rate of hematocrit (HCT), duration of maintenance therapy and overall survival&#xD;
      in patients with IDH2 mutant relapsed/refractory AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the changes in IDH2 mutational variant allelic frequency and deoxyribonucleic&#xD;
      acid (DNA) methylation signature while on enasidenib therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT I: Patients receive enasidenib orally (PO) once daily (QD). Treatment repeats every 28&#xD;
      days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients then undergo a hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) 7-14 days after treatment.&#xD;
      Within 30-100 days following the transplant, patients receive enasidenib QD. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 28 days for 24 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT II: Patients receive enasidenib PO QD. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months and then yearly for&#xD;
      5 years.&#xD;
