  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The BIOPACT RCT tiral investigates the efficacy and safety of stenosis, restenosis or&#xD;
      occlusions in the femoropopliteal artery of patients presenting a rutherford classification&#xD;
      2,3 or 4 with a Passeo-18 Lux drug-coated balloon of Biotronik. The Paclitaxel eluting&#xD;
      balloons are designed for percutaneous transluminal angioplasties in which the balloon will&#xD;
      dilate the artery upon inflation and deliver the paclitaxel locally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An expected total of 151 patients will be treated with the Passeo-18 Lux and compared to a&#xD;
      control group of another 151 patients that will be treated with the IN.PACT Admiral&#xD;
      drug-coated balloon of Medtronic. Assignment to the treatment groups will be at random. The&#xD;
      study will be conducted in two phases. A first pilot study phase of 120 patients distributed&#xD;
      evenly over both treatment groups and a second phase to formally test the non-inferiority&#xD;
      hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The balloon is coated with Paclitaxel intended to avoid cellular proliferation. The drug is&#xD;
      released by means of rapid inflation as to release a high dose in a short amount of time.&#xD;
      Patients will be invited for a follow-up visit at 1, 6 and 12 months post-procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoints are defined as follows. Freedom from clinically-driven target&#xD;
      lesion revascularization at 12 months. Freedom from device- and procedure-related death&#xD;
      through 30 days post-index procedure, major target limb amputation through 12 months&#xD;
      post-procedure and clinically-driven target vessel revascularization through 12 months&#xD;
      post-index procedure. The secondary endpoints are defined as acute device success, acute&#xD;
      procedural success , freedom from all cause of death, major target limb amputation and&#xD;
      clinically driven target vessel revascularisation through 30 days post-procedure, sustained&#xD;
      clinical improvement, no major adverse events through 6 and 12 months post-procedure, primary&#xD;
      patency, target lesion revascularisation, target vessel revascularisation, binary restenosis,&#xD;
      major target limb amputation, thrombosis at target lesion, change of walking impairment&#xD;
      questionnaire score from baseline, change in target limb rutherford classification or ABI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical investigation is to assess the safety and efficacy of the&#xD;
      Passeo-18 Lux DCB for the treatment of stenotic, restenotic or occlusive lesions of the&#xD;
      femoropopliteal arteries. Furthermore a non-inferiority hypothesis will be tested with the&#xD;
      IN.PACT Admiral DCB as comparator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be selected based on the investigator's assessment, evaluation of the&#xD;
      underlying disease and the eligibility criteria. The patient's medical condition should be&#xD;
      stable, with no underlying medical condition which would prevent them from performing the&#xD;
      required testing or from completing the study. Patients should be geographically stable,&#xD;
      willing and able to cooperate in this clinical study, and remain available for long term&#xD;
      follow-up. The patient is considered enrolled in the study after obtaining the patients&#xD;
      informed consent, if there is full compliance with the study eligibility criteria and after&#xD;
      successful guidewire passage through the study target lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the index procedure the following will be collected: an informed consent for data&#xD;
      collection, demographics, medical history, medication record, physical examination, clinical&#xD;
      category of acute limb ischemia (Rutherford category), the resting ankle-brachial index&#xD;
      (ABI), blood sample test (complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel and if&#xD;
      applicable pregnancy test) and a walking impairment questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the procedure the guidewire will cross the entire study lesion after which the lesion&#xD;
      will be assessed through angiography. A pre-dilatation with a standard non-drug-coated&#xD;
      balloon will be performed followed by a dilatation of the lesion with either a Passeo-18 Lux&#xD;
      (Biotronik) or an IN.PACT Admiral balloon (Medtronic). If dilatation was not successful (&gt;30%&#xD;
      stenosis, perforation, occlusive or flow limiting dissection) prolonged inflation should be&#xD;
      attempted after which bail-out stenting with a bare nitinol stent is allowed in case of&#xD;
      inadequate results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The regular follow-up is necessary to monitor the condition of the patient and the results of&#xD;
      the procedure. The patients will be invited for the following required follow-up visits at&#xD;
      1,6 and 12 months. During these visit the following data will be collected: medication&#xD;
      record, physical exam, target limb ABI and Rutherford classification, duplex ultrasound of&#xD;
      target vessel, walking impairment questionnaire and possible adverse events.&#xD;
