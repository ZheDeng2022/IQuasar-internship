      Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a low-intensity protocol of inspiratory muscle&#xD;
      training (IMT) to improve respiratory strength, spirometric parameters and dyspnea in&#xD;
      patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Clinical trial. Randomized. Participants: 67 patients with MS, distributed in two&#xD;
      groups, intervention and control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Intervention group train using IMT for 12 weeks, 5 days/week, 15 minutes/day&#xD;
      (20% maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) during the first two weeks and 30% MIP after the&#xD;
      second week). Control group follow a respiratory exercise program involving nasal breathing&#xD;
      and maximum exhalation during 12 weeks, 5 days/week, 15 minutes/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations: Determination of the MIP and the maximum expiratory pressure (MEP); spirometry -&#xD;
      maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV), peak expiratory flow (PEF), tidal volume (TV); dyspnea&#xD;
      using the Borg scale and clinical evaluations.&#xD;

      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients from two MS associations will be recruited to participate in a 12-week randomized&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation determine that 31 participants in each group are required to&#xD;
      observe a minimum difference in the maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) of 12 cm H2O,&#xD;
      considering a power of 90%, a safety of 95% and a 10% dropout rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in the study are diagnosed with MS, are over 18 years old, have a disability&#xD;
      lower than 9 in the Expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and are able to understand the&#xD;
      objectives of the study. Those participants with a current or past neurological pathology&#xD;
      other than MS will be excluded from the study, as well as those who had had a relapse of MS&#xD;
      or any respiratory pathology during the 4 weeks prior to the start of the study, or any other&#xD;
      complication that may have impeded the performance of the evaluation tests or breathing&#xD;
      techniques. All patients will be asked to carry out the 5-day weekly program at home, and a&#xD;
      recording sheet will be provided to each participant so they will can record the time of each&#xD;
      daily respiratory training session. All participants signed an informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be assigned to the two groups randomly. The main researcher doesn´t meet&#xD;
      any of the participants until the initial assessment will be carried out. The intervention&#xD;
      group (n = 36) will receive a training protocol of IMT, while the control group (n = 31) will&#xD;
      follow a program of nasal breathing and maximum exhalations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants are evaluated at the beginning and end of the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of MIP and MEP is performed using a pressure transducer, Elka 15, which&#xD;
      obtains each measurement in millibar and converts it into the reference unit of centimeter of&#xD;
      water (cm H2O) (1 mbar = 1.01973 cm H2O .), following the rules of the American thoracic&#xD;
      society/European respiratory society (ATS / ERS) [19]. The procedure will be repeated until 3&#xD;
      values were obtained with a difference of less than 5%, and the highest value will be used&#xD;
      for the analysis. The MIP of the intervention group will be assessed every 2 weeks to set the&#xD;
      IMT workload.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung volumes are assessed using a datospir touch spirometer with a turbine transducer with a&#xD;
      maximum flow of 16 l/s and a maximum volume of 10 l. The ATS/ERS rules will be followed [19],&#xD;
      and the highest value of three correct measurements will be chosen. Data is collected for the&#xD;
      following parameters: maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV), forced expiratory volume in the&#xD;
      first second (FEV1), peak expiratory flow (PEF), mean expiratory flow (FEF25-75), vital&#xD;
      capacity (VC), tidal volume (TV) and forced vital capacity (FVC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dyspnea will be measured using the modified Borg scale [20]. All evaluations will be done in&#xD;
      the corresponding center, during the same time slot and by the same examiner for both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the intervention group, a protocol different from those referred to in the literature has&#xD;
      been designed to cover the respiratory deficiencies of MS patients using IMT. The device&#xD;
      incorporates a unidirectional valve independent of flow to guarantee constant resistance and&#xD;
      includes a specific pressure setting (in cm H2O). During the first two weeks a MIP load of&#xD;
      20% will be used, followed by a load of 30% for the rest of the training period. The protocol&#xD;
      includes 15 cycles lasting 1 minute, twice a day: one in the morning and one in the&#xD;
      afternoon. The participants rest for 1 minute between each cycle. In total, the protocol&#xD;
      includes 30 minutes of daily respiratory training. The patients will be instructed to inhale&#xD;
      with enough force to reach the opening of the valve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The training program of the control group involves nasal inhalations and maximum exhalations.&#xD;
      The following types of breathing exercises will be carried out for 3 minutes each with a 1&#xD;
      minute pause for resting: abdominal breathing, chest breathing, breathing and shoulder&#xD;
      flexion, shoulder breathing and abduction, breathing and shoulder abduction in the transverse&#xD;
      plane. The complete protocol involves 30 minutes of daily respiratory training.&#xD;
