  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients admitted to hospital typically experience periods of decreased activity or bed-rest.&#xD;
      This reduced activity level leads to deconditioning - a loss of muscle mass, muscle strength&#xD;
      (by 2-5% per day), and muscle shortening. Even among patients who were ambulatory at the time&#xD;
      of admission, deconditioning has been linked with deleterious effects, such as increased&#xD;
      rates of falls, functional decline, and frailty. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the&#xD;
      physiological stresses associated with hospitalization - including deconditioning, as well as&#xD;
      sleep deprivation and poor nutrition - makes discharged patients vulnerable to recurrent or&#xD;
      new illnesses and to frailty. This physiological stress-induced vulnerability has been coined&#xD;
      &quot;post-hospital syndrome&quot; and is thought to have a role in most hospital readmissions. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that by engaging ambulatory patients to walk with trained&#xD;
      volunteers, patients will increase their amount of walking, have less deconditioning and&#xD;
      functional decline, and consequently, fewer falls. Furthermore, the investigators anticipate&#xD;
      that patients who walk with a trained volunteer will have reduced length-of-stay in hospital&#xD;
      and decreased likelihood of readmission. Finally, as shown in other similar programs, the&#xD;
      investigators anticipate an overall improvement in the patient experience. The investigator's&#xD;
      novel initiative focuses on a single, volunteer-based intentional ambulation program that can&#xD;
      deliver the benefits of early mobility in a cost-effective way. The program design engages&#xD;
      trained volunteers to increase patient ambulation in a way that both increases patient&#xD;
      mobility and reduces healthcare professionals' workload.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      WalkMORE is a single-center randomized controlled trial. The investigators will enroll up to&#xD;
      800 ambulatory patients admitted to the Internal Medicine unit (located on the 4th floor of&#xD;
      University Hospital) who are &gt;18 years of age and are anticipated to require a &gt;48 hour&#xD;
      hospital admission. A maximum of 6 patients will be assigned to each treatment arm at any&#xD;
      given time. The investigators will recruit patients into the WalkMORE program over a 2 year&#xD;
      period. The research coordinator (RC) will screen patients admitted to the Internal Medicine&#xD;
      unit in the preceding 24-hour period to identify patients who fulfill the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria. Patients will be randomized via REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), a&#xD;
      secure, centralized web-based randomization module to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standard of care; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. WalkMORE Ambulation program + Standard of care. Patients will ambulate with a trained&#xD;
           WalkMORE Volunteer two times per day; once in the morning (0900-1200 hrs) and once in&#xD;
           the afternoon (1300-1600 hrs), Monday- Friday, until hospital discharge. Patients&#xD;
           randomized to the WalkMORE intervention will be assessed daily by the RC to ensure&#xD;
           patients remain fit for independent ambulation. The duration of each walking session&#xD;
           will be determined daily by the RC and the medical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining written informed consent from eligible patients the RC will randomize&#xD;
      patients, collect demographics and hospital admission details from patients' hospital charts&#xD;
      and perform the Barthel Index and complete the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) for all&#xD;
      patients. The Barthel Index (BI) measures the extent to which patients can function&#xD;
      independently and has mobility in their activities of daily living (ADL). The Charlson&#xD;
      Comorbidity Index categorizes and scores the comorbidities of patients. The CCI can be used&#xD;
      to predict short term and long-term outcomes such as function, hospital length of stay and&#xD;
      mortality rates. The CCI will be completed using information gathered from patients' hospital&#xD;
      chart.with all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be assigned a scientific pedometer on the day of randomization. The modus&#xD;
      Health StepWatch™ is an activity monitor worn on the ankle via a velcro strap. It is a small,&#xD;
      lightweight device that will count and record patients' steps throughout hospital stay,&#xD;
      ending at hospital discharge. Research personnel will be responsible for fitting the&#xD;
      StepWatch monitor to patients' ankle. The device is smaller than a deck of cards (7.5 x 5.0 x&#xD;
      2.0 cm) and weighs 38 grams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frailty and de-conditioning will be measured on Study Day 3. Frailty will be assessed using&#xD;
      the Jamar Hand Dynamometer. Patients are instructed to squeeze the handle of the instrument&#xD;
      with their maximum force for three seconds; the peak-hold (in kilograms) is recorded on the&#xD;
      instrument. Three successive peak-hold measurements will be recorded. The device measures 10&#xD;
      x 20 x 33cm and weighs 1.3 kg. Deconditioning will be measured using the Timed Up and Go&#xD;
      (TUG) test, patients will be asked to stand up from a chair, walk three metres, turn around,&#xD;
      and walk back to the chair and sit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After hospital discharge the RC will follow up with patients for 2 brief telephone&#xD;
      interviews. On the third day after discharge, Patient Satisfaction surveys will be conducted&#xD;
      by the RC to assess patient satisfaction with their hospital experience and with the WalkMORE&#xD;
      program. On day 30 after randomization, the RC will contact patients to conduct a brief&#xD;
      interview consisting of: a health status survey (EQ-5D), a functional status assessment&#xD;
      (Barthel Index) and to collect data regarding clinical outcomes (ER visits,&#xD;
      re-hospitalizations, and falls). Each telephone interview is expected to last approximately&#xD;
      10 minutes.&#xD;
