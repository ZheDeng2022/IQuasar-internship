  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if one acupuncture treatment approach is&#xD;
      more effective than another in helping to relieve chemo-therapy induced neuropathy in cancer&#xD;
      patients. If eligible to take part in this study, participants will be randomly assigned to 1&#xD;
      of 2 groups - group 1 participants will receive traditional acupuncture treatments 2 times a&#xD;
      week for a total of 20 sessions. Group 2 participants will have acupuncture sessions with&#xD;
      electrical stimulation 2 times a week for a total of 20 sessions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Peripheral neuropathy is a common problem among cancer patients who have received&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment. Peripheral neuropathy often causes weakness, numbness and pain,&#xD;
      usually in the hands and feet. It can also affect other areas of the body. People with&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy generally describe the pain as stabbing, burning or tingling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupuncture is a technique that may treat symptoms by inserting very thin, solid, sterile,&#xD;
      stainless steel needles into the skin at specific points. Research has shown that acupuncture&#xD;
      can reduce symptoms of pain and nausea by altering pain signaling along nerves. The effect of&#xD;
      acupuncture can be enhanced by additional movement of the needles called manual acupuncture,&#xD;
      which involves rotating the needle and moving it up and down. Another type of acupuncture is&#xD;
      called electro-acupuncture, which involves running a low level electrical current between two&#xD;
      needle points. Preliminary studies indicate that acupuncture may also be helpful to treat&#xD;
      chemotherapy related neuropathy. This trial will determine the relative effects of both&#xD;
      manual acupuncture and electro-acupuncture for treating chronic chemotherapy-induced&#xD;
      neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned to one of two groups: 1) manual acupuncture twice a week for 20&#xD;
      treatments or 2) electro-acupuncture twice a week for 20 treatments. Multiple assessments&#xD;
      will be performed at baseline and approximately every 2 weeks for a total of 16 weeks while&#xD;
      subjects are on study.&#xD;

Electrical stimulation will be applied to the needles concomitantly and continuously to acupuncture points by placing lead wires on the needles connected to an electro-acupuncture stimulator such as the Model IC-1107. The stimulator will be set on the Dense-Disperse wave setting with low frequency at 2-10 Hz and high frequency at 100-110 Hz. The needles will not be manually stimulated after electrical stimulation is applied.</description>
