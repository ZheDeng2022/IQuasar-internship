  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 cohort, dose-escalation, dose-expansion study of PRT543 in patients with&#xD;
      advanced cancers who have exhausted available treatment options. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to define a safe dose and schedule to be used in subsequent development of PRT543.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, sequential-cohort, dose-escalation, dose-expansion Phase 1&#xD;
      study of PRT543 in patients with advanced cancers who have exhausted available treatment&#xD;
      options. Enrollment will take place concurrently into two distinct patient groups (one for&#xD;
      solid tumors/lymphomas and one for hematological malignancies). The study will consist of 2&#xD;
      parts, a dose escalation part, and once the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) has been&#xD;
      determined, a cohort expansion part involving up to ten separate cohorts. For patients, the&#xD;
      study will include a screening phase, a treatment phase, and a post treatment follow-up&#xD;
      phase. An end-of-study visit will be conducted within 30 days after the last dose of PRT543.&#xD;
