  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in&#xD;
      participants 1 to less than 56 years of age who are allergic to peanut and at least two other&#xD;
      foods (including milk, egg, wheat, cashew, hazelnut, or walnut). While each participant may&#xD;
      be allergic to more than two other foods, the primary endpoint/outcome in this study will&#xD;
      only be assessed in peanut and two other foods for each participant. The primary objective of&#xD;
      the study is to compare the ability to consume foods without dose-limiting symptoms during a&#xD;
      double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC), after treatment with either&#xD;
      omalizumab or placebo for omalizumab.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Food allergy affects about 15 million people in the United States. This includes 6 million&#xD;
      children. The current treatment for food allergy is to avoid eating the foods that may cause&#xD;
      an allergic reaction and have medications such as epinephrine (adrenaline) in case of a&#xD;
      reaction. However, accidental exposures can be extremely difficult to avoid, particularly if&#xD;
      you are allergic to multiple foods. The risks of accidental exposures and life-threatening&#xD;
      reactions can place a large burden on patients and their families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators in this study would like to learn if omalizumab injections alone or in&#xD;
      combination with multi-allergen oral immunotherapy (OIT) will help people with multiple food&#xD;
      allergies eat foods to which they are allergic. Oral means that you will take the food&#xD;
      allergen (peanut and 2 other foods to which you are allergic) by mouth. If you are allergic&#xD;
      to more than 3 foods, this study will only provide OIT for peanut and 2 other foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 3 stages to the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Stage 1, investigators would like to learn:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • If omalizumab stops or decreases allergic reactions to peanut and other common food&#xD;
      allergens after taking it for a length of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 will also have an extra part so that 60 participants will receive omalizumab and&#xD;
      everyone (the investigators conducting the research and study participants) will know it.&#xD;
      This is why it is called the open label extension. This part of the study will assist&#xD;
      investigators in learning if receiving omalizumab for a longer time may work better at&#xD;
      decreasing allergic reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Stage 2, investigators would like to learn:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • How a short course of omalizumab combined with Multi-allergen OIT compares with a longer&#xD;
      course of omalizumab in decreasing allergic reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Stage 3, investigators would like to learn:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • If, after participants stop both treatments, will they be able to eat the peanut and the 2&#xD;
      other foods in the form that is normally eaten.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all stages, investigators would like to learn:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How safe and effective the treatments are and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How the OIT affects the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last up to 56 months (4 years and 8 months).&#xD;
