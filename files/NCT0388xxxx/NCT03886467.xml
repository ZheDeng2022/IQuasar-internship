  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dairy animals are an important source of income, food and nutrition security at the household&#xD;
      level. However, substandard animal husbandry practices and limited understanding of disease&#xD;
      prevention and control may limit dairy animal productivity. Interventions to address these&#xD;
      issues may enhance milk production, substantially improving the well-being of smallholder&#xD;
      farmers. In addition to increasing household income, greater milk production may improve the&#xD;
      diet quality of household members, particularly children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, the investigators implemented a program in rural Nepal promoting enhanced animal&#xD;
      husbandry practices (GHP), focusing on mastitis control. Concurrently, the investigators&#xD;
      found child milk intake was strongly linked to better growth and development. However, milk&#xD;
      intake was limited and its availability was not examined. The investigators now propose to&#xD;
      build on these prior activities and examine strategies to increase child milk consumption.&#xD;
      The investigators plan to introduce a nutrition education program into 200 households (with&#xD;
      young children) which previously received GHP training. A comparison group of 200 households&#xD;
      will serve as the control. Household surveys will be conducted at baseline and endline to&#xD;
      assess (1) household milk production and the sustainability of adoption of GHP routines, (2)&#xD;
      the relationship of household milk production to child milk consumption, (3) household&#xD;
      factors influencing child milk consumption (participation in nutrition education, mother's&#xD;
      education, socioeconomic status, etc.), and (4) longitudinal child growth and development. In&#xD;
      addition, a pilot study will determine if households can accurately record milk production&#xD;
      and child milk intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is designed to enhance understanding of the links between milk availability and&#xD;
      child milk consumption in rural Nepal. It aims to explore whether milk consumption is limited&#xD;
      by availability or other factors (nutrition awareness, socioeconomic status, maternal&#xD;
      education). Additionally, the investigators will examine if optimization of milk consumption&#xD;
      by young children can further boost their growth and development, and whether instruction in&#xD;
      good animal husbandry practice and mastitis control is sustainable. These findings could more&#xD;
      appropriately and efficiently direct resources to improve child nutrition and development and&#xD;
      household dairy practices.&#xD;

      The study will be conducted in close collaboration with Heifer International Nepal, a&#xD;
      well-established branch of Heifer International, an international non-government organization&#xD;
      based in Little Rock, Arkansas. Heifer specializes in community development activities and&#xD;
      livestock management training; as part of Heifer's activities, participating households&#xD;
      receive 1 or more dairy animals. The proposed study will take place in 3 districts in western&#xD;
      Nepal (Bardiya, Surkhet, and Dang) where Heifer has been active and dairy animals have been&#xD;
      distributed. Households (n=400) will be eligible for participation if there is at least one&#xD;
      child between the ages of 6-66 months and at least one dairy animal. Household clusters&#xD;
      (separated geographically) will be randomly assigned to receive either nutrition education or&#xD;
      to control status (no education). Households assigned to control status will be offered the&#xD;
      nutrition education after completion of data collection for the proposed project (12 months&#xD;
      later).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be one adult in each household (usually the child's mother), and any&#xD;
      children in the household between the ages of 6-66 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design involves 3 household visits, spaced over 12 months (thus: baseline, 6&#xD;
      months, and endline). In addition, information about household dairy animal milk production&#xD;
      will be collected on a monthly basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline and endline household visits, the mother (or other caretaker) of the target&#xD;
      child will be asked to respond to a questionnaire. The questionnaire will be based on&#xD;
      standardized tools developed by &quot;Measure Demographic and Health survey (DHS)&quot;, specifically&#xD;
      the version used in the &quot;2016 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey&quot; conducted by the&#xD;
      Government of Nepal (Ministry of Health et al. 2017) (Ministry of Health and Population Nepal&#xD;
      et al. 2012). The questionnaire will address (A) household attributes, (B) child diet, (C)&#xD;
      child growth, and (D) child development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (A) Household attributes: basic demographics, possessions (used to determine wealth score by&#xD;
      standard principal components analysis), hygiene practices, animal ownership, mother's&#xD;
      knowledge/attitudes/practices related to child nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (B) Child diet: Consumption of animal source foods (ASFs: meat, fish, offal, eggs, or dairy)&#xD;
      in the past 24 hours by all children in the household (ages 12-60 months) will be recorded&#xD;
      (Ruel 2003, Steyn et al. 2007), along with the frequency of intake. The quantity of milk and&#xD;
      other dairy foods ingested will also be determined. In addition, 16 specific foods/food&#xD;
      groups will be documented (Kennedy et al. 2013). Milk and &quot;other dairy products&quot; (yogurt,&#xD;
      paneer, cheese, etc.) will be recorded separately. In addition, the number of times in the&#xD;
      previous week that the child consumed each of the 16 individual food items will be recorded.&#xD;
      A diet diversity score (DDS) will be constructed by aggregating the food groups into 8&#xD;
      categories: starchy staples (grains and white potatoes); vitamin-A rich fruits and&#xD;
      vegetables; other fruits and vegetables; offal, meat, and fish; eggs; legumes, nuts, and&#xD;
      seeds; milk and dairy products; oils (Swindale et al. 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      (C) Child growth will also be assessed by standard anthropometric techniques (see (Miller et&#xD;
      al. 2017) for details) using Seca scales and stadiometers and paper measuring tapes (for head&#xD;
      and mid-upper arm circumferences).&#xD;
&#xD;
      (D) Child development: relevant sections of the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (UNICEF&#xD;
      2015), a standardized questionnaire developed by UNICEF (and validated in Nepal (Government&#xD;
      of Nepal 2014)) to assess early child development, will be administered by the enumerator.&#xD;
      The child's parent (usually the mother), will respond to questions related to child&#xD;
      literacy/numeracy, gross and fine motor skills, social-emotional development, and learning&#xD;
      skills. In addition, the age-appropriate version of the Ages and Stages Questionnaire will be&#xD;
      administered. This simple assessment serves as a screen test for developmental issues by&#xD;
      asking the child (or if the child is unable or unwilling to participate) to engage in&#xD;
      developmentally appropriate activities such as completing a puzzle, jumping, scribbling with&#xD;
      a crayon, or answering simple questions (&quot;How old are you&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The midline visit will include only child anthropometry and child diet record.&#xD;
