  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 500 total ankle prostheses are implanted each year in France. Wound healing issues are&#xD;
      the most common complications after Total Ankle Arthroplasty (TAA). In 2010, a French&#xD;
      retrospective study observed a wound infection rate of 8% among 592 prostheses implanted.&#xD;
      Wound infection rate can vary up to 28% from the data available in the literature. Delayed&#xD;
      wound healing is a known risk factor of surgical site infection (SSI). Even if it remains a&#xD;
      rare event, its consequences for the patient can be severe and lead to removal and/or&#xD;
      replacement of the prosthesis, arthrodesis, or transtibial amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) is an adjuvant therapy for wound management and&#xD;
      healing: it delivers a controlled negative pressure (sub-atmospheric) applied topically onto&#xD;
      the wound from a vacuum pump. The wound is filled with wound filler and sealed with an&#xD;
      airtight adhesive drape. It allows creating a moist wound environment, removing exudate, and&#xD;
      reducing edema and risk of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incisional NPWT can accelerate wound healing regardless of the surgery performed, including&#xD;
      orthopedics. A retrospective study compared the incidence of healing complications after TAA&#xD;
      between the administration of the NPWT PICO™ (Smith&amp;Nephew) and the standard of care of&#xD;
      postoperative wounds in 74 patients. A significant reduction of wound healing issues (3% vs.&#xD;
      24%, respectively; p=0.004) and a non-significant reduction of SSI (3% vs. 8%, respectively)&#xD;
      were observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the investigator knowledge, no randomized study has been conducted to assess the efficacy&#xD;
      of the NPWT PICO™ for postoperative wound healing after TAA: Investigators propose to set up&#xD;
      this study to obtain a high level of evidence in this population and investigators assume&#xD;
      that the use of the PICO™ system after TAA would reduce delayed wound healing compared to the&#xD;
      standard of care with conventional dressings.&#xD;
