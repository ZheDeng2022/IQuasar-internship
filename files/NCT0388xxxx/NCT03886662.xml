  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy (benefits) of an investigational&#xD;
      drug LB-100, for treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes. LB-100 has previously been&#xD;
      administered to patients with various solid tumors. In this study, LB-100 will be&#xD;
      administered as an intravenous infusion over 120 minutes. This study will be conducted in 2&#xD;
      phases. In phase Ib, escalating doses of LB-100 will be administered to patients to study the&#xD;
      safety and to determine a safe dose of LB-100. In phase 2, patients will be administered&#xD;
      LB-100 at the dose that was found to be safe in phase Ib. The efficacy (benefits) and safety&#xD;
      of LB-100 will be determined in this phase of the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
