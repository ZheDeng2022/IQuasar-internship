  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators propose to pilot test a brief, mindfulness shared decision&#xD;
      making intervention that begins shortly after receiving a diagnosis of breast cancer. A&#xD;
      mindfulness instructor will conduct an hour long session with consented participants before&#xD;
      the scheduled surgical appointment. The investigators hypothesize that a mindfulness&#xD;
      intervention delivered shortly after receiving a diagnosis of breast cancer may ultimately&#xD;
      lead to increased decisional satisfaction and alignment to participant's values and&#xD;
      preferences, and decreased anxiety. To measure this endpoint, participants will complete&#xD;
      three surveys via REDCap- at baseline, before surgery, and 6 months postoperatively. Surveys&#xD;
      will include questions on quality of life, anxiety, and participant satisfaction with the&#xD;
      mindfulness program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The primary aim of this study is to identify if a mindfulness intervention is feasible before&#xD;
      the participant has their surgical consultation. The secondary aim is to measure the impact&#xD;
      of the mindfulness intervention on participant reported outcomes including anxiety, quality&#xD;
      of life and decisional satisfaction. Newly diagnosed female breast cancer patients will be&#xD;
      contacted over the phone after the patient learns of their diagnosis but prior to their&#xD;
      surgical appointment to discuss surgical options. Verbal consent will be obtained over the&#xD;
      phone and the participant will be directed to complete an online survey to answer baseline&#xD;
      questions on their anxiety and quality of life as well as to provide their contact&#xD;
      information and availability in order to schedule a mindfulness session with a certified&#xD;
      mindfulness teacher. The participant will then proceed to an hour-long mindfulness exercise&#xD;
      geared to help women apply these techniques to the decisional making process. The goal is to&#xD;
      empower women to approach their diagnosis and treatment decisions with greater stability and&#xD;
      improve their ability to focus on their values and preferences instead of just focusing on&#xD;
      the diagnosis. This will be measured by administering patient reported outcomes (PROs) via&#xD;
      REDCap online surveys at three timepoints. The first PRO &quot;baseline survey&quot; is administered&#xD;
      after the participant enrolls but before the mindfulness session. The second PRO &quot;before&#xD;
      surgery survey&quot; is completed after the surgical consultation but prior to the scheduled&#xD;
      surgery. The final PRO &quot;6-month survey&quot; is administered 6 months after the surgery to measure&#xD;
      quality of life, anxiety, and participant satisfaction with the mindfulness program. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that a mindfulness intervention delivered shortly after receiving a&#xD;
      diagnosis of breast cancer may ultimately lead to increased decisional satisfaction and&#xD;
      alignment to participant's values and preferences, and decreased anxiety.&#xD;
