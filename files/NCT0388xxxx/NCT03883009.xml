  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infection (SSI) is the most common healthcare-associated infection,&#xD;
      multifactorial in nature, and a typical preventable harm. Many healthcare systems require&#xD;
      hospitals to determine the corresponding infection rates as a quality indicator and often&#xD;
      stipulate public reporting of these data. Several agencies, among them the World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), have issued&#xD;
      evidence-based prevention guidelines. Despite efforts in implementing best practice, SSI&#xD;
      continue to be a relevant complication of modern surgical procedures and generate enormous&#xD;
      costs for the healthcare system. Moreover, prevention guidelines acknowledge that the&#xD;
      evidence backing their recommendations is low to moderate in most cases, which is partly due&#xD;
      to the complexity of SSI pathogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swissnoso, the Swiss expert group for infection prevention and hospital epidemiology,&#xD;
      oversees the nationwide collection of data on select procedures and the associated SSI. Since&#xD;
      the inception of this dedicated surveillance in 2009, more than 300'000 procedures have been&#xD;
      included and the corresponding patients were followed to ascertain SSIs. Although primarily&#xD;
      conceived as a national surveillance system and then used for public reporting starting in&#xD;
      2014, Swissnoso is a prime data source for better understanding the epidemiology of SSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, the investigators seek to raise the quality of evidence behind future prevention&#xD;
      guidelines. For this purpose, the investigators will move from a risk factor analysis for SSI&#xD;
      (of which a substantial part occurs after patient discharge from the hospital, rendering&#xD;
      surveillance difficult) to the collection of additional data (in order to better characterize&#xD;
      certain determinants of SSI and their recognition) and, finally, to a mathematical model&#xD;
      (which will simulate the probability of developing SSI so the investigators can test what may&#xD;
      modulate this risk).&#xD;

      Aim 1: Descriptive epidemiology and risk factors for (post-discharge) SSI: using the&#xD;
      Swissnoso SSI Surveillance data, the investigators will determine patient and institution&#xD;
      level risk factors for SSI in Switzerland (with a focus on those occurring post-discharge),&#xD;
      explore protective factors (such as antimicrobial prophylaxis and its timing), and describe&#xD;
      the epidemiology of SSI in terms of time of occurrence, microbiology, severity, patient&#xD;
      outcome, and variation by procedure type, case-mix, and hospital size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Determinants of SSI: The investigators will investigate determinants of SSI in the&#xD;
      following three areas:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) The surveillance system itself and how the thoroughness of the surveillance process&#xD;
      correlates with reported SSI rates; B) The operating room ventilation system and how its&#xD;
      parameters correlate with SSI rates; and C) A healthcare institution's perceived culture of&#xD;
      safety and how it correlates with infection rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do so, the investigators will enhance and complement the Swissnoso data with new&#xD;
      information at the institution level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: A mathematical model of surgical site infection: the investigators will construct a&#xD;
      mathematical model that simulates SSI pathogenesis based on data from Swissnoso and other&#xD;
      sources, and assesses the impact of different preventive measures. Interventions will be&#xD;
      ranked according to the simulated reduction of SSI rates in Switzerland.&#xD;
