  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a lipid storage disease that can present in infants,&#xD;
      children, or adults. Neonates can present with ascites and severe liver disease from&#xD;
      infiltration of the liver and/or respiratory failure from infiltration of the lungs. Other&#xD;
      infants, without liver or pulmonary disease, have hypotonia and developmental delay. The&#xD;
      classic presentation occurs in mid-to-late childhood with the insidious onset of ataxia,&#xD;
      vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, and dementia. Dystonia and seizures are common. Dysarthria&#xD;
      and dysphagia eventually become disabling, making oral feeding impossible; death usually&#xD;
      occurs in the late second or third decade from aspiration pneumonia. Adults are more likely&#xD;
      to present with dementia or psychiatric symptoms. The diagnosis of NPC is confirmed by&#xD;
      biochemical testing that demonstrates impaired cholesterol esterification and positive&#xD;
      filipin staining in cultured fibroblasts. Biochemical testing for carrier status is&#xD;
      unreliable. Most individuals with NPC have NPC1, caused by mutations in the NPC1 gene; fewer&#xD;
      than 20 individuals have been diagnosed with NPC2, caused by mutations in the NPC2 gene.&#xD;
      Molecular genetic testing of the NPC1 genes detects disease-causing mutations in&#xD;
      approximately 94% of individuals with NPC. Such testing is available clinically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NPC is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The phenotype (i.e., age of onset and&#xD;
      severity of symptoms) usually runs true in families. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives&#xD;
      and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible when the two&#xD;
      disease-causing mutations have been identified in the family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though NPC is a pan-ethnic disorder, the prevalence of this autosomal-recessive disorder is&#xD;
      elevated in countries with a higher frequency of consanguinity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the goal of the study to prepare a cell culture from patients affected with&#xD;
      Niemann Pick disease in order to identify novel pathways and proteins involved in disease&#xD;
      progression that allow for an earlier diagnosis (i.e. before symptom onset) and that are&#xD;
      suitable targets for an individualized therapeutic approach able to address not only the&#xD;
      hepatic form, but also the neurologic form of the disease, which is less responsive to the&#xD;
      current therapeutic approaches.&#xD;

    <description>The aim of this study is to generate patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells and then differentiate them into neural cells to study the misfolded proteins in endoplasmic reticulum, their role in untranslated protein response, and possible mechanisms to shuttle the misfolded proteins into lysosomes.</description>

      The skin biopsy will be carried out for patients with a diagnosis of Niemann Pick. The biopsy&#xD;
      is performed by the physician by means of punch biopsy (diameter 2-3 mm) under local&#xD;
      anesthesia, preferably on the forearm (alternatively: thigh). The biopsy is immediately&#xD;
      transferred to sterile cell culture medium and sent by center representative for the quickest&#xD;
      possible processing to CENTOGENE's laboratory located in Germany or to professional&#xD;
      collaborators being part of the project.&#xD;
