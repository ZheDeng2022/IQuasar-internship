  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to determine the safety and effectiveness of drug coated balloon (DCB)&#xD;
      treatments on esophageal stricture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 subjects are planned to be enrolled and treated with the study device at up to 5&#xD;
      clinical sites outside of US. Subjects will be followed up post-treatment to one year and&#xD;
      then annually for up to 5 years. The annual follow up after the first year is optional.&#xD;
