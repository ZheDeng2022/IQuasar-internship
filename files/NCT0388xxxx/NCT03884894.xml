      Although advances in neonatal care have improved survival and reduced complications in&#xD;
      preterm infants, sepsis still contributes significantly to mortality and in Neonatal&#xD;
      Intensive Care Units (NICUs), in particular for very-low-birth-weight (VLBW, &lt;1500 g) and&#xD;
      extremely-low-birth-weight (ELBW, &lt;1000g). Based on the timing of the infection neonatal&#xD;
      sepsis has been classified into early-onset sepsis (EOS) and late-onset sepsis (LOS), with&#xD;
      differences in the mode of transmission and predominant organisms. EOS is defined as onset in&#xD;
      the first 3 days of life generally due to vertical transmission of bacteria from mothers to&#xD;
      infants during the intrapartum period. LOS occurs after 3 days of life and it is attributed&#xD;
      to pathogens acquired postnatally (horizontal transmission). Considering generally neonatal&#xD;
      sepsis in Europe, 90% of the responsible bacteria resulted to be: Streptococcus agalactiae,&#xD;
      Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, e Listeria monocytogenes. The diagnosis is difficult&#xD;
      because clinical signs, particularly early in the course of disease, are subtle and&#xD;
      nonspecific, and laboratory tests and blood culture are not always reliable. Moreover. blood&#xD;
      culture (considered the 'gold standard) takes 48-72 hours for result. In fact the cultural&#xD;
      method requires the presence of living and vital germs, depends on the volume of the sample -&#xD;
      serious problem in neonatal population -, several hours are needed to process the sample,&#xD;
      possibly resulting falsely negative in subjects undergoing concomitant antibiotic treatment&#xD;
      or a false positive result can be found by contamination. The method based on molecular&#xD;
      biology does not require living germs and, therefore, is not characterised by the sensitivity&#xD;
      limitations. Such method can result to be extremely effective in patients receiving&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, when an infant has to undergone blood sample for bacteria culture to&#xD;
      verify a possible sepsis, a residual blood (200µl) is processed in the same time using a kit&#xD;
      based on molecular biology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This kit is designed to obtain the highest sensitivity and specificity in the determination&#xD;
      of most invasive bacterial diseases (meningitis, sepsis, pneumonia, etc.) affecting&#xD;
      full-term, preterm infants to determine any presence of bacterial DNA belonging to all&#xD;
      serotypes of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and Listeria&#xD;
      monocytogenes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target bacteria have been chosen on the basis of the current Italian epidemiological&#xD;
      context, so as to include germs causing about 90% of the meningitis/sepsis cases among the&#xD;
      neonatal population. The detection system can unmistakably identify the germ against which it&#xD;
      is directed and without causing any cross-reaction with other germs or human DNA..&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results obtained with this method have demonstrated a 100% specificity (no false positive&#xD;
      result) The sensitivity of this method compared with the cultural method has turned out to be&#xD;
      twice as high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to compare the efficacy of the blood culture method and the&#xD;
      kit for molecular detection of bacterial DNA (all serotypes of Klebsiella pneumoniae,&#xD;
      Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and Listeria monocytogenes) considering the&#xD;
      relevant epidemiology of our NICU, in order to verify the relative frequency of sepsis (EOS&#xD;
      and LOS) caused by the target bacteria on the whole frequency of the bacteria responsible of&#xD;
      all the sepsis in our ward.&#xD;

      Neonatal sepsis remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality both among term&#xD;
      and preterm infants. Although advances in neonatal care have improved survival and reduced&#xD;
      complications in preterm infants, sepsis still contributes significantly to mortality and in&#xD;
      Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs).in particular for very-low-birth-weight (VLBW, &lt;1500 g)&#xD;
      and extremely-low-birth-weight (ELBW, &lt;1000g).The signs and symptoms of neonatal sepsis are&#xD;
      non specific. These include fever or hypothermia, respiratory distress including cyanosis and&#xD;
      apnea, feeding difficulties, lethargy or irritability, hypotonia, seizures, bulging&#xD;
      fontanel... Based on the timing of the infection neonatal sepsis has been classified into&#xD;
      early-onset sepsis (EOS) and late-onset sepsis (LOS), with differences in the mode of&#xD;
      transmission and predominant organisms. EOS is defined as onset in the first 3 days of life&#xD;
      generally due to vertical transmission of bacteria from mothers to infants during the&#xD;
      intrapartum period. LOS occurs after 3 days of life and it is attributed to pathogens&#xD;
      acquired postnatally (horizontal transmission). The epidemiology of neonatal sepsis is a&#xD;
      changing landscape, nevertheless an increasing rates of EOS Escherichia coli sepsis,&#xD;
      particularly among preterm infants, and Streptococcus group B (GBS), in particular S.&#xD;
      agalactiae, - resulted to be 70% of the responsible microorganisms, In a study on 6215&#xD;
      infants admitted to National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal&#xD;
      Research Network (NRN) centres, 70% of first episode late-onset infections were caused by&#xD;
      gram-positive organisms, with coagulase-negative staphylococci accounting for 48% of the&#xD;
      infections. Considering generally neonatal sepsis in Europe, 90% of the responsible bacteria&#xD;
      resulted to be: Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, e Listeria&#xD;
      monocytogenes. The diagnosis of neonatal sepsis is difficult because clinical signs,&#xD;
      particularly early in the course of disease, are subtle and nonspecific, and laboratory tests&#xD;
      and blood culture are not always reliable, moreover blood culture, (the 'gold standard) takes&#xD;
      48-72 hours or more for result. In fact the cultural method shows a number of weak points: it&#xD;
      requires the presence of living and vital germs, it depends on the volume of the collected&#xD;
      sample - serious problem in neonatal population -, several hours are needed to process the&#xD;
      sample, possibly resulting falsely negative in subjects undergoing concomitant antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment or a false positive result can be found by contamination. The methods based on&#xD;
      molecular biology do not require living germs and, therefore, are not characterised by the&#xD;
      sensitivity limitations that are typical of cultural methods. For this reason, such methods&#xD;
      can result to be extremely effective in patients who have already received an antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy, and are not affected by rapid transport (so much so that samples can be stored at&#xD;
      room temperature even for a few days) and, finally, do not require any culture medium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, when an infant has to undergone blood sample for bacteria culture to&#xD;
      verify a possible sepsis, a residual blood (200µl) is processed in the same time using a kit&#xD;
      based on molecular biology. This kit is designed to obtain the highest sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity in the determination of most invasive bacterial diseases (meningitis, sepsis,&#xD;
      pneumonia, etc.) affecting full-term, preterm infants to determine any presence of bacterial&#xD;
      DNA belonging to all serotypes of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus&#xD;
      agalactiae and Listeria monocytogenes The target bacteria have been chosen on the basis of&#xD;
      the current Italian epidemiological context, so as to include germs causing about 90% of the&#xD;
      meningitis/sepsis cases among the neonatal population. The detection system can unmistakably&#xD;
      identify the germ against which it is directed and without causing any cross-reaction with&#xD;
      other germs or human DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results obtained with this method have demonstrated a 100% specificity (no false positive&#xD;
      result). The sensitivity of this method compared with the cultural method has turned out to&#xD;
      be twice as high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to compare the efficacy of the blood culture method and the&#xD;
      kit for molecular detection of bacterial DNA (all serotypes of Klebsiella pneumoniae,&#xD;

      relevant epidemiology of our NICU, in order to verify the relative frequency of neonatal&#xD;
      sepsis (EOS and LOS) caused by the target bacteria on the whole frequency of the bacteria&#xD;
      responsible of all the sepsis in our ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The observational estimated period to collect 100 measurable samples, is 18 months from the&#xD;
      beginning of the enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples correspond to the enrollment of term o preterm neonates who needed a blood withdrawal&#xD;
      for a suspect of sepsis, that are processed by both mothods.&#xD;
