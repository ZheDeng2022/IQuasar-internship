  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine whether the use of a systemic antimicrobial&#xD;
      (metronidazole) as an adjunct to periodontal surgery provides additional clinical and&#xD;
      microbiological beneficial effects compared to periodontal surgery alone plus a placebo, in&#xD;
      patients with non treated periodontitis (stage III and IV) positive to Porphyromonas&#xD;
      gingivalis.&#xD;

      Design: pilot, randomized, parallel, placebo controlled and triple blind clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample: Patients with generalized severe chronic periodontitis (stages III and IV) and&#xD;
      positive to Porphyromonas gingivalis who potentially need periodontal surgery were recruited&#xD;
      from those who attended the postgraduate program in periodontics at the Complutense&#xD;
      University in Madrid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly assigned to the test group (periodontal surgery + metronidazole) or&#xD;
      control group (periodontal surgery + placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examiner calibration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recruitment of patients. Screening. Data collection (clinical and microbiological&#xD;
           variables)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Non surgical periodontal therapy (2 visits) performed by second year students.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Reevaluation at 6 weeks. Data collection (clinical and microbiological variables).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of study participants (patients with probing pocket depth &gt; 5mm in ≥ 2 teeth&#xD;
      per sextant or those presenting multiple sites with probing pocket depth ≥ 5mm and bleeding&#xD;
      on probing in ≥ one mouth quadrant and positive to Porphyromonas gingivalis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need of the surgical procedure was supervised in every case by more than one experienced&#xD;
      periodontist (clinical teachers). Finally patients were randomly assigned to their study&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II. Surgical Periodontal Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Periodontal surgery sessions performed by second year students. In the last surgery&#xD;
                the patient received a recipient containing the pills (metronidazole or placebo&#xD;
                according to randomization) and the instructions for use.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Suture removal 1 week after the surgery. Data collection 1 week after antibiotic&#xD;
                consumption after the last surgery (patient-centered variables on the side effects&#xD;
                of antibiotics). Pills recipients were collected in order to evaluate patient&#xD;
                compliance. An individual not involved in the study protocol was in charge of doing&#xD;
                the data and recipient collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase III. Periodontal Maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Maintenance 1(3 months postsurgery). Data collection (clinical and microbiological&#xD;
                variables)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Maintenance 2 (6 months postsurgery). Data collection (clinical and microbiological&#xD;
                variables)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Maintenance 3 (9 months postsurgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Maintenance 4 (12 months postsurgery). Data collection (clinical and&#xD;
                microbiological variables)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Security protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patient exhibiting worsening in periodontal clinical parameters during the maintenance&#xD;
      phase were excluded from the study and inestable sites were re-treated. Inestable sites were&#xD;
      considered those exhibiting clinical attachment loss &gt; 2mm between two consecutive visits&#xD;
      (Haffajee et al. 1983) after the treatment.&#xD;
