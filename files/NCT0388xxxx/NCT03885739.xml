      Background- Despite clinical guidelines favoring surgical repair of hip fracture (HF) within&#xD;
      48 hours of injury, patients may wait considerable periods of time for their turn in the&#xD;
      operating room. In this context, continuous nerve blocks are an attractive alternative for&#xD;
      pain management. However, the ideal block technique is not yet defined. Recently a new&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided approach for selective blockade of the articular branches to the hip, the&#xD;
      PENG (Pericapsular Nerve Group) block, has been proposed with potentials advantages for&#xD;
      perioperative hip fracture analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective- To describe the analgesic efficacy and feasibility of continuous Pericapsular&#xD;
      Nerve Group block (CPENGB) in patients with HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design-Interventional study. Setting-Academic Level 3 center. Methods- Two experienced&#xD;
      anesthesiologist completed 15 sonographically guided Pericapsular Nerve Group (PENG)&#xD;
      injections and catheter insertion in patients with severe pain awaiting HF surgery. Each&#xD;
      injection consisted of 20 mL of local anesthetics followed by a 0.1% bupivacaine continuous&#xD;
      infusion at a constant rate of 8 ml per hour. Pain at rest and on 15° leg lift of the&#xD;
      fractured leg were assessed before procedure, 10 and 30 minutes after block performance, and&#xD;
      each 24 hours until surgery. A reduction of severe or moderate dynamic pain to mild pain or&#xD;
      no pain, and a pain relief of 2 (moderate) were clinically significant findings. To determine&#xD;
      feasibility time and number of attempts to perform the procedure were measured.&#xD;

      Methods: 15 sonography-guided PENG injections and catheter placement were performed in&#xD;
      consecutive HF patients who were admitted to a single level 3 center and who report severe&#xD;
      pain despite a standardized analgesia protocol. Patients were assessed by the Pain Service as&#xD;
      part of a multidisciplinary care pathway and CPENGB was offered as a component of a&#xD;
      multimodal analgesic regimen. All patients, or their legal representatives, provided written&#xD;
      informed consent for procedure. Demographic and clinical characteristics were reviewed. To&#xD;
      determine feasibility, time to perform the procedure was recorded, number of attempts and&#xD;
      complications. To assess pain control, patient reported pain scores were used and the amount&#xD;
      of morphine intravenous equivalent consumption (MIVEC) before and after block. Patients were&#xD;
      asked to rate the severity of their pain on a 4-point numeric rating scale (Verbal Rating&#xD;
      Scale with four response categories, VRS-4): 1) no pain, 2) mild pain, 3) moderate pain, and&#xD;
      4) severe pain or ''worst pain imaginable''. Pain at rest and on movement (pain on 15° leg&#xD;
      lift of the fractured leg) were evaluated at baseline and at different times after procedure&#xD;
      (10 minutes, 30 minutes, 24 hours and 48 hours after procedure) while the catheter was in&#xD;
      situ. Pain relief [PR, 0 (none), 1 (slight), 2 (moderate), 3 (lots), 4 (complete)] was&#xD;
      recorded at 30 minutes after procedure. A reduction of severe dynamic pain to mild pain or no&#xD;
      pain, according to verbal report of patients, and a pain relief of 2 (moderate) were&#xD;
      clinically significant findings. Type of fracture (extra or intracapsular), periprocedural&#xD;
      complications, the presence of analgesic-related adverse effects and bromage score (30&#xD;
      minutes after catheter placement and each 24 hours during routine medical round) were also&#xD;
      recorded. Complications were assessed until first orthopedic review (at 3-6 week&#xD;
      postoperative). Procedure: All procedures were performed by two anesthesiology&#xD;
      co-investigators who had more that 5 years of experience performing regional techniques in&#xD;
      clinical practice and who underwent one prior training PENG blocks to standardize the&#xD;
      approach. Injections were performed using a curvilinear low-frequency ultrasound probe (3.5-&#xD;
      to 5-MHz). The lateral border of iliopsoas tendon in an oblique axial plane at level of&#xD;
      iliopectineal eminence provides target for needle placement. Toggling the transducer was&#xD;
      necessary to optimize visualization of the iliopsoas tendon secondary to anisotropy.&#xD;
      Injections were performed using an 18-gauge Tuohy needle under sterile conditions. Following&#xD;
      negative aspiration, a test injection was performed using 10 ml 1% lidocaine in 3-mL&#xD;
      increments while observing in real time for ensure adequate peritendinous fluid spread of&#xD;
      local anesthesia. Then, 10 mL 0.25% bupivacaine was administered and a 20-G polyamide&#xD;
      catheter (connect to a filter) was advanced into the space. The end point of the catheter&#xD;
      placement was the direct visualization of microbubbles in a peritendinous distribution using&#xD;
      a bolus of agitated saline applied through threaded catheter connected to not purged filter.&#xD;
      After catheter placement patients received a 0.1% bupivacaine continuous infusion at a&#xD;
      constant rate of 8 ml per hour. If needed per anesthesiologist discretion, rescue bolus was&#xD;
      administrated and continuous infusion rate was increased until adequate analgesia was noted.&#xD;
      In addition, patients received a standardized analgesia protocol (preoperatively and later in&#xD;
      the ward) consisting of 1 g paracetamol orally 2-3 times a day and opioid rescue analgesia as&#xD;
      needed if pain moderate or severe was reported (0.05-0.1 mg/kg of intravenous morphine, or&#xD;
      hydromorphone or tramadol equivalent, 4-6 times a day). Patients in who there were other&#xD;
      possible causes of pain (per example: multiples traumatic lesions) received an opioid regimen&#xD;
      by schedule plus rescue doses or intravenous patient-controlled analgesia under standardized&#xD;
      protocols.&#xD;
