  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Definity (perflutren lipid microspheres, Lantheus Medical Imaging) is an ultrasound contrast&#xD;
      indicated for use in patients with suboptimal echocardiograms to opacify the left ventricular&#xD;
      chamber and to improve the delineation of the left ventricular endocardial border. MVT-100&#xD;
      (the investigational pharmaceutical) is similar to Definity, with the exception of the&#xD;
      removal of one lipid in the lipid blend and substitution of another lipid. This study is&#xD;
      intended to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MVT-100 using a single ascending dose design&#xD;
      in healthy volunteers. Patients are randomized to receive either MVT-100 or Definity and&#xD;
      undergo echocardiograms after receiving either MVT-100 or Definity via bolus or IV infusion&#xD;
      administration. The primary endpoints evaluated are safety and endocardial border&#xD;
      delineation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound is one of the most common imaging examinations and has advantages of absence of&#xD;
      ionizing radiation, portability and relatively low cost. Ultrasound contrast agents are used&#xD;
      to improve the accuracy of ultrasound and Definity (perflutren) is the world's leading&#xD;
      ultrasound contrast agent but perflutren has to be refrigerated and has a side effect of back&#xD;
      pain. The investigators have developed a new, improved perflutren, MVT-100, with potential&#xD;
      for room temperature storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound contrast agents are used to increase the backscatter (signal intensity of blood&#xD;
      vessels and tissues to improve diagnostic accuracy) of ultrasound imaging. In the US&#xD;
      ultrasound contrast agents are FDA approved for echocardiography to improve endomyocardial&#xD;
      border definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MVT-100 reflects the ultrasound to provide strong back-scattering. MVT-100 microbubbles&#xD;
      resonate with ultrasound to provide strong harmonic signals. MVT-100 microbubbles will&#xD;
      cavitate with higher levels of ultrasound and cavitation may be stable or inertial depending&#xD;
      upon acoustic parameters and other factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a multi centre ascending dose comparison of Definity and MVT-100 for use in&#xD;
      echocardiography and will be performed in a sample of healthy volunteers who are randomized&#xD;
      to receive either Definity or MVT-100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will assess safety and evaluate the following imaging metrics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the optimal dose of MVT-100 by comparing MVT-100 vs Definity in the change&#xD;
           from baseline of quantitative left ventricular opacification&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of qualitative left ventricular opacification (LVO)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of endocardial border delineation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of endocardial border length&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of duration of useful contrast&#xD;
