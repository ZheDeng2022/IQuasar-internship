      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To characterize the infectivity of the new lot of Plasmodium falciparum strain 3D7 within&#xD;
      the standard WRAIR CHMI model as compared to the current lot (historical data)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess safety of the new lot of P falciparum parasites&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the kinetics of detecting parasitemia and parasite clearance by quantitative&#xD;
           polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) as compared to blood smear&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain plasma samples to restore the testing control pool for malaria serology&#xD;
           testing and for future malaria research&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open label CHMI study. CHMI will consist of exposure to Plasmodium&#xD;
      falciparum sporozoites through the bites of infected mosquitoes. After the challenge,&#xD;
      subjects will be evaluated daily for the development of malaria infection using a blood&#xD;
      smear. Unless previously diagnosed and fully treated, subjects will be required to stay in a&#xD;
      hotel for a maximum of 12 nights starting on or around the evening of Day 7 post challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects diagnosed with malaria infection based on smears will be prescribed a standard&#xD;
      malaria treatment regimen to begin on the day that parasitemia is detected. Subjects who do&#xD;
      not become parasitemic (via smear) by Day 19 will be empirically treated for malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the hotel phase, all challenged subjects will have a final scheduled follow-up visit on&#xD;
      Day 28 (±7 days).&#xD;

    <description>Time to parasitemia by blood smear method after the P falciparum challenge. Time to parasitemia is defined as the time from CHMI to a first positive malaria parasite result. Parasitemia was defined as the presence of 2 unambiguous malaria parasites on a single smear. Beginning on Day 1 after their challenge, subjects were seen and evaluated daily by a study investigator and blood was drawn for determination of parasitemia by qPCR. Beginning on Day 5 and through Day 19 after their challenge, blood from these daily draws was utilized to generate blood smears to evaluate the development of malaria infection. In addition to smears, subjects were also evaluated for the presence of parasitemia via qPCR. In addition to smears, subjects were also evaluated for the presence of parasitemia via qPCR. However, only blood smears were used for diagnosis during this trial and evaluation of treatment success.</description>

    <description>Time to parasitemia by qPCR method after the P falciparum challenge. Time to parasitemia is defined as the time from CHMI to a first positive malaria parasite result. Parasitemia was defined as the presence of 2 unambiguous malaria parasites on a single smear. On Day 0, subjects were evaluated by qPCR once prior to challenge, to establish a baseline. Beginning on Day 1 through Day 19 after their challenge, subjects were seen and evaluated daily by a study investigator and blood was drawn for determination of parasitemia by qPCR. Beginning on Day 5 and going through Day 19 after their challenge, blood from these daily draws was utilized to generate blood smears to evaluate the development of malaria infection. In addition to smears, subjects were also evaluated for the presence of parasitemia via qPCR. However, only blood smears were used for diagnosis during this trial and evaluation of treatment success.</description>

    <measure>Diagnostic Efficacy; Quantification of Parasite Clearance Time (PCT) by Blood Smear and qPCR Methods After Initiation of Antimalarial Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Time to Clearance was determined for all subjects for both smear and qPCR. Time to Clearance was defined as the time (in Days) from malaria diagnosis to confirmed clearance of parasitemia. Confirmed clearance of parasitemia by malaria smear was defined as the observation of 3 sequential negative (no parasites observed) daily smears. Confirmed clearance of parasitemia by qPCR was defined as 2 sequential daily (approximately 24 hours apart) negative qPCR assay results. For clarity, the day of the final test in each sequence (smear, PCR) was used as the day of confirmed clearance for calculation purposes.</description>

        <description>Time to parasitemia by blood smear method after the P falciparum challenge. Time to parasitemia is defined as the time from CHMI to a first positive malaria parasite result. Parasitemia was defined as the presence of 2 unambiguous malaria parasites on a single smear. Beginning on Day 1 after their challenge, subjects were seen and evaluated daily by a study investigator and blood was drawn for determination of parasitemia by qPCR. Beginning on Day 5 and through Day 19 after their challenge, blood from these daily draws was utilized to generate blood smears to evaluate the development of malaria infection. In addition to smears, subjects were also evaluated for the presence of parasitemia via qPCR. In addition to smears, subjects were also evaluated for the presence of parasitemia via qPCR. However, only blood smears were used for diagnosis during this trial and evaluation of treatment success.</description>

Parasitemia was defined as the presence of 2 unambiguous malaria parasites on a single smear. On Day 0, subjects were evaluated by qPCR once prior to challenge, to establish a baseline. Beginning on Day 1 through Day 19 after their challenge, subjects were seen and evaluated daily by a study investigator and blood was drawn for determination of parasitemia by qPCR. Beginning on Day 5 and going through Day 19 after their challenge, blood from these daily draws was utilized to generate blood smears to evaluate the development of malaria infection. In addition to smears, subjects were also evaluated for the presence of parasitemia via qPCR.

Time to Clearance was defined as the time (in Days) from malaria diagnosis to confirmed clearance of parasitemia.

Confirmed clearance of parasitemia by qPCR was defined as 2 sequential daily (approximately 24 hours apart) negative qPCR assay results. For clarity, the day of the final test in each sequence (smear, PCR) was used as the day of confirmed clearance for calculation purposes.</description>
