  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that children with NF1 can have weak muscles and suffer from tiredness. It is&#xD;
      also known that in similar conditions affecting children's muscles, standing on a vibration&#xD;
      device for a few minutes each day can strengthen muscles and improve their ability to perform&#xD;
      day-to-day activities. The investigators believe this vibrating platform can be used to&#xD;
      strengthen the muscles of children with NF1 also, beyond standard exercises, and therefore&#xD;
      allow them to perform day-to-day activities better, do more activity and feel less tired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If families are keen to take part in this study, the investigators will first need to check&#xD;
      they are suitable for the trial. This will be based on the participant's age (6-16 years),&#xD;
      their other medical problems that would affect use of the vibration device or tests to assess&#xD;
      how effective it is, and their level of muscle weakness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once families have agreed to take part, participants will be randomised either to receive a&#xD;
      muscle-strengthening exercise session delivered by a physiotherapist that children with weak&#xD;
      muscles should continue to perform daily for the next 6 months; or to receive a vibration&#xD;
      device to take home and use for a few minutes 5 days a week for 6 months as well as the&#xD;
      exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be invited to attend for a variety of activities and tests, just before&#xD;
      starting the trial and 6 months later at the end of the trial to see if there is any benefit&#xD;
      from the vibration device. The investigators will repeat these tests again 3 months later, to&#xD;
      see if any benefits observed remain, even after the device is removed. They will involve&#xD;
      jumping, hopping and balancing on a board, gripping a machine as hard and as long as&#xD;
      possible, being fitted with a device that measures activity for 7 days, walking as far as&#xD;
      possible for 6 minutes, scanning muscles using MRI, completing a tiredness and general&#xD;
      well-being questionnaires, and parents completing a questionnaire of the participant's&#xD;
      attention and intellect. The jumping will also be performed 3 months into the study, to see&#xD;
      if there is any early improvement in this key test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be given full details of what the trial involves before taking part. As&#xD;
      with any other trial, participants and their families are free to stop taking part at any&#xD;
      time. Although the investigators do not anticipate any safety issues, if any do arise, the&#xD;
      families will be asked to contact the trial team.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) have been shown in many studies to have reduced&#xD;
      muscle mass, strength and function. This could potentially contribute to the fatigue and low&#xD;
      quality of life reported in these children. However, to date interventions to improve muscle&#xD;
      mass, strength and function in these children have not been established. Whole body vibration&#xD;
      (WBV) has been demonstrated to improve walking speed and distance, muscle mass and strength,&#xD;
      spasticity and balance in children with other neuromuscular conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proposed preliminary matched-pairs interventional trial, the investigators aim to&#xD;
      identify whether a home-based WBV therapy programme (9 minutes twice daily for 5 days per&#xD;
      week) in addition to standard daily muscle-strengthening exercises improves muscle mass,&#xD;
      strength and function over a six month period in children with NF1 aged 6-16 years, compared&#xD;
      to daily muscle-strengthening exercises alone. Participants must have evidence of poor muscle&#xD;
      strength, with grip force used to assess for this. Key exclusion criteria include significant&#xD;
      learning difficulty or autistic spectrum disorder which would create difficulty in use of the&#xD;
      WBV device, focal skeletal abnormalities and contraindications to WBV therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be dynamic muscle function using mechanography to measure&#xD;
      peak power per kilogram on single two-legged jump.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary/exploratory outcome measures include the 6-minute walk test (to assess lower limb&#xD;
      muscle function and mobility), accelerometer data (as a surrogate marker of type and duration&#xD;
      of physical activity), hand-held dynamometry (to assess upper limb grip force and endurance),&#xD;
      measures on mechanography other than jumping power (to further assess dynamic muscle&#xD;
      function), MRI for muscle cross-sectional area and signal intensity, fatigue and general&#xD;
      well-being questionnaires and parental reports of attention and cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These measures will be undertaken at baseline, on completion of intervention at 6 months, and&#xD;
      again 3 months after to identify whether there is any sustained effect of the intervention&#xD;
      following removal. Halfway through the intervention period (3 months), participants will also&#xD;
      be invited just to complete the primary outcome of single two-legged jump on ground reaction&#xD;
      force plate, as an interim measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesise that WBV therapy will result in increased muscle mass and&#xD;
      passive muscle strengthening of the lower limbs, which will translate into better muscle&#xD;
      function in the lower limbs compared to baseline data and control group. As it is&#xD;
      hypothesised that muscle weakness contributes to the fatigue demonstrated in children with&#xD;
      NF1, the investigators would expect to see an improvement in their fatigue scores, which,&#xD;
      combined with greater muscle strength, will translate into greater physical activity. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesise that WBV may also have an impact on muscle function in the upper&#xD;
      limbs through central sensory stimulation and neuronal rewiring. Many children with NF1 have&#xD;
      evidence of attention problems, and the investigators hypothesise that this may improve with&#xD;
      WBV, again through central neuronal rewiring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be conducted in compliance with this protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP)&#xD;
      and applicable regulatory requirements.&#xD;
