  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the proposed study the investigators will develop an early prenatal preventive&#xD;
      intervention targeting anxiety and conduct a randomized controlled trial in Pakistan to test&#xD;
      its efficacy in reducing generalized anxiety disorder and major depression in mothers in late&#xD;
      pregnancy and the postnatal period. Investigators will evaluate the impact of the&#xD;
      intervention on fetal and infant growth restriction as well as examine how the impact of the&#xD;
      intervention is mediated (to elucidate mechanisms) and/or modified (to help optimize future&#xD;
      adaptations of the program) by various social factors. A cost-effectiveness evaluation will&#xD;
      shed light on the costs and benefits of intervention components in relation to outcomes,&#xD;
      enabling policy-makers and public health planners to scale up this intervention according to&#xD;
      resource budgeting requirements.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Common mental disorders (CMDs) such as anxiety and depression occur frequently in pregnancy&#xD;
      and the postnatal period in lower- and middle income countries (LMICs). Prenatal anxiety,&#xD;
      both subthreshold and clinical, adversely affects maternal wellbeing and outcomes among&#xD;
      offspring, and is a major predictor of subsequent depression. Preventive approaches have&#xD;
      enormous potential to reduce the negative effects of postnatal mental disorders in mothers&#xD;
      and improve child outcomes. The study team proposes to create a scalable and sustainable&#xD;
      early prevention intervention focusing on anxiety symptoms in pregnant women, to be delivered&#xD;
      by non-specialist providers (Aim 1). The investigators will evaluate this preventive&#xD;
      intervention through a trial by randomizing 1200 pregnant women from a public hospital in&#xD;
      Islamabad Pakistan to either our Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-based (CBT-based)&#xD;
      early-in-pregnancy program or to usual care. The investigators will study the effects of the&#xD;
      intervention on 1) CMDs in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy and at 6 weeks postpartum (Aim 2)&#xD;
      and on 2) fetal and newborn small-for-gestational age (SGA) outcomes (Aim 3). The&#xD;
      investigators will also examine if interpersonal violence, perceived stress and social&#xD;
      support mediate and/or modify the intervention effects on CMDs and perinatal outcomes (Aim&#xD;
      4). Finally, the investigators will conduct a cost-effectiveness evaluation, comparing costs&#xD;
      and healthcare utilization for women in the prenatal intervention and enhanced usual care&#xD;
      groups (Aim 5). Focusing on anxiety reduction is a major innovation; anxiety has not been&#xD;
      addressed within prenatal intervention packages in LMICs, despite its association with&#xD;
      increased postpartum depression and suboptimal fetal and infant outcomes. Pakistan has high&#xD;
      prevalence of both women with prenatal anxiety (35% to 49%) and SGA newborns (~47%),&#xD;
      providing an ideal research opportunity. The CBT-based approach, appropriate given its&#xD;
      indication for anxiety and depression, is grounded in preliminary work in this population,&#xD;
      where the investigators have previously successfully reduced postpartum depression.&#xD;
      Intervening early in pregnancy is a further innovation that is critical for building the&#xD;
      evidence base for preventative approaches to reduce maternal CMDs and related perinatal&#xD;
      outcomes. The proposed mediation and effect modification analyses will improve understanding&#xD;
      of mechanism(s) of action and help identify subpopulations for programmatic targeting. The&#xD;
      use of non-specialized providers and integration within the primary care environment will&#xD;
      guide scale up, while incorporating a cost-effectiveness analysis will aid policy-makers in&#xD;
      resource allocation decisions. This study will inform the integration of preventive&#xD;
      strategies that target anxiety with existing approaches for treatment of perinatal depression&#xD;
      to further the evidence-base for transdiagnostic mental health initiatives globally, and will&#xD;
      inform policies to support lifelong maternal mental health and resilience across generations&#xD;

    <masking>Double (Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>To maintain masking during the trial, intervention and assessment teams will not have any interaction during the trial, as they will be placed at separate locations within the Obstetrics Department of Holy Family Hospital (HFH). Furthermore, participants will be instructed not to disclose which type of treatment they are receiving to the assessment team. Fidelity of masking will be measured by having assessors guess the trial arm of each participant at the end of follow-up assessment. We hypothesize that assessors will only be able to correctly guess the condition of participants at a chance rate of nearly 50% at follow-up assessments, indicating that masking is maintained.</masking_description>

    <description>Pregnant women experiencing anxiety randomized to the Happy Mother Healthy Baby (HMHB) intervention receive a CBT-based psychosocial intervention (with six core and up to six booster sessions). HMHB is a facility-based intervention delivered by non-specialist providers. It is aimed to raise psychosocial awareness and facilitate positive change inter personal wellbeing, social support, and bonding with their baby during pregnancy. It addresses with relapse prevention, planning for the baby's arrival, and in management of emotional challenges in the early postnatal period. Family member/s will be invited to attend 3 core sessions.</description>

    <description>Women randomized to the control group will receive enhanced usual care (EUC). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 8 antenatal visits for a positive pregnancy experience, the number of visits our EUC control group participants will receive (depending on their gestational week). Usual care will also be enhanced by hospital staff receiving additional training in mental health treatment and counseling. Transportation will be facilitated to assist participants in attending appointments and medically indicated ultrasounds will be paid for (as in the intervention group).</description>
