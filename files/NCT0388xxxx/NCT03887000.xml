  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia affects an average of 2% of the French population. Data from the literature&#xD;
      report that low levels of magnesium could be associated with fibromyalgia. However, no study&#xD;
      to date has investigated the effect of oral magnesium administration on stress in&#xD;
      fibromyalgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial therefore aims to evaluate whether magnesium could improve stress and the various&#xD;
      disorders that contribute to the complexity of fibromyalgia, including pain, cognition, sleep&#xD;
      disorders and quality of life.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional, randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind study of the use of&#xD;
      magnesium in fibromyalgia. The effect of magnesium on stress measured by DASS-42 over 28 days&#xD;
      after taking magnesium / placebo will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives will evaluate the evolution of the scores of all the tests and&#xD;
      questionnaires carried out before taking magnesium or placebo (D0: Visit 2), then at D0 + 28&#xD;
      (visit 3) and D0 + 84 days (visit 4 corresponding to the end-of-study visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary parameters are the following :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact of fibromyalgia, heart rate variability, pain intensity, cognition, feelings of&#xD;
      patients, impression of change, sleep quality, fatigue intensity, social vulnerability,&#xD;
      catastrophism, presence of small fiber neuropathy, stress induced by colors, pain induced by&#xD;
      thermal stimulation, concentration of magnesium, analysis of microbiota and evaluation of&#xD;
      genetic factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood magnesium and magnesuria will be measured.&#xD;
