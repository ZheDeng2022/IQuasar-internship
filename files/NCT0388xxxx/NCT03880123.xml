    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to establish a safe and tolerable dose combination (the&#xD;
      &quot;maximum tolerated dose&quot;) of selinexor and ixazomib when used together for the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with certain types of advanced sarcoma. The study will enroll patients with advanced&#xD;
      dedifferentiated liposarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, alveolar soft part&#xD;
      sarcoma and Ewing sarcoma. Future studies to further evaluate the safety and anti-cancer&#xD;
      efficacy of this treatment for sarcoma will use the dose combination determined in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sarcoma is a rare form of cancer which originates from the soft tissues and bones of the&#xD;
      body. There are more than 50 different types of sarcoma. The primary treatment approach for&#xD;
      most types of advanced sarcoma involves chemotherapy, but newer treatment approaches are&#xD;
      needed because chemotherapy is not curative, sometimes does not work well, and often has&#xD;
      significant side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new treatment for certain types of sarcoma. The&#xD;
      new treatment involves two oral targeted drugs used in combination: selinexor and ixazomib.&#xD;
      Selinexor inhibits the transport of certain proteins between the nucleus and the cytoplasm of&#xD;
      the cell. Ixazomib is part of a class of drugs called proteasome inhibitors. Currently,&#xD;
      neither of these drugs is approved for the treatment of sarcoma. The researchers believe this&#xD;
      combination treatment may work effectively for certain types of sarcoma based on encouraging&#xD;
      laboratory research results. The types of sarcoma in which the treatment will be tested are:&#xD;
      dedifferentiated liposarcoma, alveolar soft part sarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath&#xD;
      tumor, and Ewing sarcoma. The purpose of this study is to define doses of selinexor and&#xD;
      ixazomib that are safe and tolerable for patients.&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Histologically confirmed de-differentiated liposarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve&#xD;
             sheath tumor, alveolar soft part sarcoma or Ewing sarcoma. Liposarcomas with areas of&#xD;
             well-differentiated disease are eligible if there is a biopsy-proven component of&#xD;
             dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Pathology is reviewed at Columbia University Medical&#xD;
             Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Disease which is locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic. Disease which may be&#xD;
             resected but with an associated level of morbidity deemed unacceptable by the treating&#xD;
             clinician is considered eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Measurable disease as assessed by RECIST criteria version 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Progression on, or intolerance to, at least one prior systemic regimen for sarcoma&#xD;
             (including systemic treatment used in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant settings). For&#xD;
             alveolar soft part sarcoma and dedifferentiated liposarcoma, there is no upper limit&#xD;
             on the number of prior therapies that may have been received. For Ewing sarcoma and&#xD;
             malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, patients may have received no more than 3&#xD;
             prior lines of therapy (excluding systemic treatment used in the adjuvant or&#xD;
             neoadjuvant settings).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Acceptable organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;

             100,000/mm3 Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 30 mL/min Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times&#xD;
             upper limit of normal Aspartate Transaminase (AST) /Alanine Transaminase (ALT) ≤ 3.0&#xD;
             times upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Upper limit of normal is defined by the clinical laboratory performing the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine clearance is obtained using the lean body mass formula (Modified&#xD;
                  Cockcroft Gault)&#xD;

                  presence of liver metastases, a total bilirubin ≤ 2.5 times the upper limit of&#xD;
                  normal and an Aspartate Transaminase (AST) and Alanine Transaminase (ALT) ≤ 2.5&#xD;
                  times the upper limit of normal are permissible. Patients with an elevated&#xD;
                  bilirubin level that is attributed to an inherited disorder, such as Gilbert's&#xD;
                  disease, may be enrolled at the discretion of the principal investigator.&#xD;
