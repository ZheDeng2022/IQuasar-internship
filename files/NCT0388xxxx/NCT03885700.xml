  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through a cluster randomized control trial, 148 male adolescents' students were randomly&#xD;
      assigned into either intervention group who received an educational program for two months&#xD;
      (n=79), or control groups (n=69) who didn't attend the program. The principle outcomes were&#xD;
      the changes in physical activities, consumption of healthy diet, sedentary life habits and&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements. The outcomes of the intervention group were compared with their&#xD;
      own baseline readings, as well as with the readings of the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Saudi adolescents are in need for more exploration of their health problems and related&#xD;
           health behaviors and application of intervention preventive services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As a National Guard community medicine resident : I have a major interest in the health&#xD;
           of adolescent and in fulfilling the aim of the school health programs of application of&#xD;
           interventional preventive service that will target this vulnerable risky group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Promote healthy life style among National Guard adolescents age group by application of&#xD;
      interventional preventive program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To measure physical activity patterns , sedentary behaviors and dietary habit among&#xD;
      randomly selected adolescent in intervention and control group at National Guard Schools in&#xD;
      Jeddah city 2014-2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To implement an interventional school promotional program among the school children from&#xD;
      the addressed age group in 2014-2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To measure the effect of the interventional school promotional program among the two&#xD;
      groups in relation to demographic, socioeconomic and other factors related to health in&#xD;
      2014-2015 .&#xD;

    <textblock>
      - Study design: Cluster randomized control trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Study setting: The National Guard health affairs department is a governmental&#xD;
      health-providing facility in Saudi Arabia. It is under the Ministry of the National Guard.&#xD;
      The National Guard has created residential cities to accommodate military personnel and their&#xD;
      families. These cities provide an independent residence with health services, security&#xD;
      education, and related services that support optimal living conditions. The National Guard&#xD;
      schools provide education from the nursery level up to high school for both males and&#xD;
      females, in cooperation with the Ministry of Education. In Jeddah, the National Guard&#xD;
      residential city (King Faisal residential city) is located conveniently near the highway&#xD;
      (Al-Haramain highway), which is connected to Makkah and Medina and provides quick access to&#xD;
      the National Guard medical city (20 minutes away).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The health services in the residential city have two components: the family medicine practice&#xD;
      provided by professional teams in Primary Health Care Clinics, and preventive medicine&#xD;
      services with implemented programs and activities. One of the major programs in operation in&#xD;
      the community and preventive center is the School Health Program, launched in the residential&#xD;
      city in 1995. The health affairs division of the National Guard is always on the lookout for&#xD;
      further improvement and the expansion of such programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Ministry of National Guard-Health Affairs division aims to improve the school health&#xD;
      programs and related activities and encourages all related interventions that have proven&#xD;
      effective to the health of the target populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the seven schools in the residential city, four are elementary, two are intermediate, and&#xD;
      one is a high school. The total number of students is 1473.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Sample size: From the previous study of adolescent lifestyle, the mean weekly moderate&#xD;
      activity METs score of male adolescent school students in Jeddah was 1020.4 METs-min/week,&#xD;
      (METs-minute ( Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) is the ratio of work metabolic rate to a&#xD;
      standard resting metabolic rate of 1 (4.184 kJ) kg 5-h- 5 , 1 MET is considered a resting&#xD;
      metabolic rate obtained during quiet sitting ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The least recommended weekly MET by Canadian physical activity guideline's last update was at&#xD;
      least 60 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity every day = 60 X 7days X 4 METs=&#xD;
      1680 METs-min/week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of Pass 13 computer program to calculate the sample size by difference between the&#xD;
      two means gives the following results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numeric Results for One-Sided Test. Power Clusters Per Clusters Difference Correlation&#xD;
      Deviation Alpha Beta 0.90 8 9 579.500 0.02500 1028.50 0.05 0.09&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Summary Statements: A sample size of 8 clusters per group with 9 individuals per cluster&#xD;
           achieves 90% power to detect a difference of 579.500 between the group means, when the&#xD;
           standard deviation is 1028.500 and the intracluster correlation is 0.02500 using a&#xD;
           One-Sided T-test with a significance level of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Taking 10% for the dropout value gives approximately 80 subjects in each group and a&#xD;
           total sample size of 160 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sampling technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the study is cluster-based, eight clusters were considered for each of the intervention&#xD;
      and control group. The eight clusters for each group consisted of two classes from the&#xD;
      primary schools; one from the 5thgrade and one from the 6th grade, three from the&#xD;
      intermediate level (one class from 1st grade, one from the 2nd grade and one from the 3rd&#xD;
      grade intermediate school); and three classes from high school (one class from 1st grade, one&#xD;
      from the 2nd grade and one from the 3rd grade high school).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since there were four elementary schools, two schools were selected using random sampling.&#xD;
      One school was chosen for the intervention group (Imam Malik's primary school) and one for&#xD;
      the control group (Imam Shafiee's primary school). Of the two intermediate schools, one was&#xD;
      assigned by random sampling for the intervention (Imam Qaloon's intermediate school), and the&#xD;
      second for the control (Abo Obedah's intermediate school). Since there were only one high&#xD;
      school, the intervention and control groups were selected by random sampling from the same&#xD;
      school (King Saud High School).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The classes were selected by random sampling. Imam Malik's primary school consisted of two&#xD;
      classes in the 5th grade and two in the 6thgrade. Two pieces of paper were taken and wrote&#xD;
      the names of the two classes on each of the two papers. One paper was drawn at random to&#xD;
      select the class that would participate in the intervention group in the study. The same&#xD;
      process was repeated for the 6th grade. Imam Shafiee's primary school also consisted of two&#xD;
      classes in each grade. Hence, the same process was repeated to select the two classes that&#xD;
      would participate in the control group. Imam Qaloon's intermediate school consisted of only&#xD;
      one class in each grade, and the same class was assigned to the intervention group. Abo&#xD;
      Obediah's intermediate school had four classes in each grade. Four pieces of paper with the&#xD;
      class names written on them were made for each grade, and one class was selected by random&#xD;
      sampling to participate in the control group. King Saud's high school had four classes in&#xD;
      each grade. Four pieces of paper were made for each grade, and two papers were selected from&#xD;
      each grade, one for the intervention group and the second for the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then the research team (which comprised the medical resident and a nurse) went the selected&#xD;
      schools, met the principal of the school, and the administration department, to seek their&#xD;
      agreement to apply the proposed interventional program. Copies of the list of students in&#xD;
      each class were taken from them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the students for the selected classes were written on pieces of paper, and ten&#xD;
      students were selected by random sampling. On the same day, the selected students were given&#xD;
      an informed consent form with their names on it and were asked to obtain their parents'&#xD;
      consent. The informed consent form consisted of a description of the study population, the&#xD;
      study group, the intervention, and the expected harm and benefit from the intervention, it&#xD;
      also contained a space for the parents of the selected students to indicate their willingness&#xD;
      to allow the child to participate in the study. The students were asked to bring the forms&#xD;
      the next day with their parent's signatures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the next day, the informed consent forms were collected. Students who were selected by&#xD;
      random sampling but did not agree to participate were replaced by students selected by a&#xD;
      second random sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tools of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Self-administered questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
                The Arab Teens Lifestyle Study Questionnaire was designed by Hazzaa M Al-Hazzaa&#xD;
                whose consent was sought before using it in the study. The Arab Teens Lifestyle&#xD;
                Study Questionnaire is a self-reported questionnaire that measures physical&#xD;
                activity patterns, sedentary behaviors, and dietary habits, and it was found to be&#xD;
                valid by Al-Hazza in his study, &quot;Convergent Validity of the Arab Teens Lifestyle&#xD;
                Study (ATLS) Physical Activity Questionnaire&quot; in 2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The questionnaire was designed to collect information on the frequency, duration,&#xD;
                and intensity of a variety of light-, moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical&#xD;
                activities during a typical (usual) week. These were assigned metabolic equivalent&#xD;
                (MET) values based on the compendium of physical activity. By calculating the total&#xD;
                METs-minutes per week spent on each of the physical activities, the participants'&#xD;
                levels of physical activity were determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. My plate:&#xD;
&#xD;
                My Plate is the nutrition guide published by the United States Department of&#xD;
                Agriculture, depicting a plate containing five food groups that are part of an&#xD;
                ideal diet and a glass. It is a new tool, which has been proven to be appropriate&#xD;
                for any age. Through its simplicity, it serves as a guide to help consumers choose&#xD;
                nutritionally balanced meals with the right portion size and make healthy choices.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Body composition analyser:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Tanita BC 418 segmental body composition analyzer was used as it had been shown to&#xD;
                be valid in 2009 by Haroun et al. in their study.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Other tools included a laptop for PowerPoint educational presentations and&#xD;
                educational pamphlets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Variables collected using the tools:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary habits, physical activity patterns, sedentary behaviours, weight, Body Mass Index&#xD;
      (BMI), fat percentage and fat mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Data collection techniques: The team went to the selected school and the students who had&#xD;
      received consent were brought by their teachers to the school clinic room; where, the height&#xD;
      of each student was measured using a validated measuring scale. The recorded height and age&#xD;
      were then entered into the second scale(Tanita BC 418) that measured weight, BMI, fat&#xD;
      percentage and fat mass and printed these values on a piece of paper. After the measurements&#xD;
      had been completed, each class was handed the self-administered questionnaire, and the&#xD;
      questions were explained and filled one at a time by the students under the team's guide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the study, a total of five schools were visited, and only 148 students&#xD;
      agreed to be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventional school promotional program was conducted for eight consecutive weeks;&#xD;
      while the control group did not receive any intervention for the eight weeks in question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After two months, the second assessment of the healthy behaviours under the study, the&#xD;
      weight, BMI, and body composition in the two groups was conducted.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Arab Teens Lifestyle Study Questionnaire was used to measures physical activity level.&#xD;
This Questionnaire was designed to collect information on the:1- frequency 2- duration 3- intensity of a variety of physical activities during a typical week (e.g brisk walking for 20 minutes 3 times per week).&#xD;
These activities were assigned metabolic equivalent (MET)values based on: the compendium of physical activity 2011.&#xD;
Then for each activity the MET equation was applied, METs-min per week for specific activity = duration in min per day × number of days in which the activity were performed per week × METs of that activity (based on the compendium of physical activity 2011).&#xD;
The total METs per week was calculated by combining the METs for all activities performed by each student in his regular week.</description>
