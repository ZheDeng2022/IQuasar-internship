      This is a Phase 2 study using talimogene laherparepvec, nivolumab, and trabectedin as first,&#xD;
      second or third line therapy for advanced sarcoma, including desmoid tumor and chordoma. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to determine progression-free survival (PFS) at month 12. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives are (1) To evaluate the best overall response (BOR) and duration of response (DOR)&#xD;
      by RECIST v1.1 via CT scan or MRI at 6,12,18, and 24 weeks post treatment, (2) To determine&#xD;
      progression-free survival rate (PFS) at 6 and 9 months, (3) To determine overall survival&#xD;
      rate at 6, 9, and 12 months, (4) To determine the incidence of conversion of an unresectable&#xD;
      tumor to a resectable tumor, and (5) To evaluate the incidence of adverse events related to&#xD;
      TALIMOGENE LAHERPAREPVEC in combination with nivolumab and trabectedin. The exploraratory&#xD;
      objective is to correlate response with immune cell trafficking in the tumor microenvironment&#xD;
      (TME) of resected tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is Progression free survival at month 12. The secondary endpoints are:&#xD;
      1) Best overall response (BOR) and duration of response (DOR) by RECIST v1.1 via CT scan or&#xD;
      MRI at 6,12,18 and 24 weeks post treatment, 2) PFS rate at 6 and 9 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Overall survival rate at 6, 9, and 12 months, 3) Incidence of conversion of an unresectable&#xD;
      tumor to a resectable tumor, 4) Incidence of adverse events related to TALIMOGENE&#xD;
      LAHERPAREPVEC in combination with nivolumab and trabectedin. The exploratory endpoint is&#xD;
      correlation of response with immune cell trafficking in the tumor microenvironment of&#xD;
      resected tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty male and female subjects &gt; 18 years of age, of any ethnicity, with advanced sarcoma,&#xD;
      including desmoid tumor and chordoma will be treated.&#xD;
