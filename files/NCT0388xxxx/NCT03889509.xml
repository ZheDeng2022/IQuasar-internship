      This protocol is of a systematic review for risk factors of pulmonary arterial hypertension&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A systematic review was conducted to determine the risk/associated factors for pulmonary&#xD;
      arterial hypertension in systemic sclerosis, including clinical/disease characteristics,&#xD;
      antibody status, test results and biomarkers. The frequency of publications featuring a&#xD;
      risk/association were reported. The following databases were searched: Medline, EMBASE, the&#xD;
      Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and SCOPUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following search terms were used:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ( essential pulmonary hypertension or familial primary pulmonary hypertension or&#xD;
      hypertension, pulmonary or hypertension,lung or hypertensive pulmonary vascular disease or&#xD;
      idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension or lung arterial hypertension or lung artery&#xD;
      hypertension or lung hypertension or primary pulmonary hypertension or pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      hypertension or pulmonary artery hypertension or pulmonary fixed hypertension or pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertensive disease or pulmonary hypertensive diseases or pulmonary hypertensive disorder or&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertensive disorders )&#xD;
&#xD;
      AND&#xD;
&#xD;
      ( generalised scleroderma or generalized scleroderma or progressive scleroderma or&#xD;
      progressive sclerodermia or progressive sclerosis,systemic or progressive systemic sclerosis&#xD;
      or scleroderma, generalised or scleroderma, generalized or scleroderma, progressive or&#xD;
      scleroderma, systemic or sclerosis,progressive systemic or sclerosis,systemic or&#xD;
      sclerosis,systemic progressive or systemic progressive sclerosis or systemic scleroderma or&#xD;
      systemic sclerosis,progressive or&#xD;
&#xD;
      scleroderma, limited or limited scleroderma or limited cutaneous scleroderma or&#xD;
&#xD;
      diffuse scleroderma or progressive diffuse scleroderma or scleroderma, diffuse )&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Studies were included they were (1) in patients with SSc; and if they (2) determined&#xD;
             PAH with right heart catheterization; (3) involved a comparison of SSc patients with&#xD;
             and without PAH; and (4) had sample size larger than 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Studies were excluded if they were review articles, and if the study was written in&#xD;
             languages other than English. When the same patients were used in more than one&#xD;
             analysis, the most recent or largest sample-size study was included.&#xD;
