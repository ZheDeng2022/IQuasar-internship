  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Small fiber neuropathy (SFN) is a form of peripheral neuropathy, which is characterized by&#xD;
      neuropathic pain and autonomic dysfunction. Mutations in SCN9A, the gene encoding for the&#xD;
      voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.7, are associated with SFN. SCN9A-associated SFN often&#xD;
      results in chronic neuropathic pain, which is difficult to treat. Chronic neuropathic pain&#xD;
      may cause structural and functional changes in the brain. Until now, only one small study&#xD;
      examined the structural and functional changes of the brain in SFN patients. No studies have&#xD;
      been performed in strictly defined SFN patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it would be interesting to explore whether in SFN patients with an SCN9A mutation,&#xD;
      the genotype will lead to a distinct brain activation pattern on functional MRI (fMRI) and if&#xD;
      the integrity or structural connectivity of the brain is altered using diffusion tensor&#xD;
      imaging (DTI). This may provide a better understanding of the pathophysiological pathways for&#xD;
      chronic pain and might serve as a biomarker for evaluating therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to explore whether there is an indication whether patients&#xD;
      with SCN9A-associated SFN have an abnormal brain activation pattern on resting state fMRI and&#xD;
      during advanced thermal stimulation and altered structural connectivity on DTI versus SFN&#xD;
      patients without a mutation and versus age- and gender-matched healthy controls. With this&#xD;
      knowledge, objective pain measurement for patients with SFN may serve as a biomarker in&#xD;
      evaluating efficacy of targeted therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Small fiber neuropathy (SFN) is a form of peripheral neuropathy, which is characterized by&#xD;
      neuropathic pain and autonomic dysfunction. It is caused by dysfunction of the AÎ´-fibers and&#xD;
      C-fibers. SFN is diagnosed if typical SFN symptoms are present, in combination with an&#xD;
      additional abnormal skin biopsy and/or abnormal quantitative sensory testing. The minimal&#xD;
      prevalence of SFN is estimated to be 53/100.000. SFN has a comprehensive list of causes. The&#xD;
      etiology encompasses metabolic, toxic, auto immune, infectious, and hereditable causes.&#xD;
      Mutations in SCN9A, the gene encoding for the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.7, are&#xD;
      associated with SFN, and can be found in 10-15% of SFN patients. The symptomatic treatment of&#xD;
      SFN is generally disappointing. Until now, antidepressants and anticonvulsants are mostly&#xD;
      recommended for SFN with limited pain reduction, often leading to chronic daily pain&#xD;
      experience. Understanding the pathophysiology of pain and identifying plausible specific pain&#xD;
      genotype-phenotype relations, might lead to improved treatment strategies. Therefore, the&#xD;
      focus should extend beyond the scope of peripheral mechanisms of the nervous system and&#xD;
      should include searching for pain complex central, thus brain based, mechanisms and patterns&#xD;
      (a pain network of somatosensory, limbic and associate structures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The International Association for the Study of Pain defined pain as 'an unpleasant sensory&#xD;
      and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in&#xD;
      terms of such damage'. A painful stimulus activates the peripheral nociceptors and is&#xD;
      transmitted through the small fibers, via the dorsal horn in the spinal cord, to the brain.&#xD;
      Pain stimuli are processed in the cortex, subcortical structures, and the midbrain. In the&#xD;
      cortical area the somatosensory, anterior cingulate, prefrontal, and insular cortex are the&#xD;
      most important structures, whereas important subcortical areas encompass the hippocampus,&#xD;
      basal ganglia, amygdala, and thalamus. Furthermore, the cerebellum is suggested as an&#xD;
      important area contributing to pain sensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic pain may lead to structural changes in the brain, and imaging revealed morphological&#xD;
      alterations in gray matter (both an increase and a decrease). The pattern of alterations may&#xD;
      differ among different pain syndromes and may be reversible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional imaging studies have displayed specific brain activity patterns in patients with&#xD;
      different types of pain syndromes. Recently, also in a small SFN patients study functional&#xD;
      connectivity changes using a 3.0 Tesla scanner were shown. However, whether a specific&#xD;
      activation pattern can be seen depends on many factors, such as type of brain imaging&#xD;
      modality.7 It is conceivable that a particular type of pain (stimulus) may enhance a specific&#xD;
      pain brain pattern, but also specific person factors (for example gender and genetic factors)&#xD;
      may influence the pain activation network. Psychological modulation as well as chronicity of&#xD;
      pain may influence the activation network, and should therefore be taken into account.&#xD;
      Furthermore the specific location of pain can display different kinds of patterns because of&#xD;
      partially somatotopic organization, such as described in the S1 cortex. To date, in human no&#xD;
      functional imaging studies using a 7.0 Tesla fMRI-scan have been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now, an objective tool to measure pain is lacking. Most studies in pain syndromes&#xD;
      including patients with SFN have been using a great variety of surrogate pain scales, such as&#xD;
      the Visual Analogue Pain Scale (VAS), the Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale, the Brief&#xD;
      Pain Inventory and the Neuropathic pain scale (NPS). Therefore, an objective measure for pain&#xD;
      would be a great advantage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients with a SCN9A-associated SFN will be analyzed to determine possible&#xD;
      central nervous system pain network patterns. The voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.7 plays a&#xD;
      central role in pain processing. Research in rats revealed areas of the brain that express&#xD;
      Nav1.7 channels. These channels were restricted to the hypothalamic/preoptic area, brain&#xD;
      stem, and the subfornical organ. Our goal is to examine whether gain-of-function mutations in&#xD;
      NaV1.7 may lead to a specific pain pattern in the human brain by scanning with a 3.0 Tesla&#xD;
      fMRI-scan. Some patients will be included to undergo an extra fMRI-brain scan (Tesla 7.0).&#xD;
      Due to the high field strength, new opportunities have arisen for brain imaging. The newly&#xD;
      acquired ultra high resolution facilitates the possibility of more detailed anatomical&#xD;
      imaging. When the 7.0 Tesla fMRI-scan appears to yield more useful information than the 3.0&#xD;
      Tesla fMRI-scan, the first-mentioned will be used for follow-up studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the resting state and the effect on heat stimuli of&#xD;
      patients with SCN9A-associated SFN on fMRI and the changes in structural connectivity using&#xD;
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). This may provide a better understanding of the&#xD;
      pathophysiological pathways for chronic pain. If successful, fMRI/DTI might be an additional&#xD;
      tool as biomarker for evaluating therapy, and may contribute in the evaluation of novel&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies.&#xD;
