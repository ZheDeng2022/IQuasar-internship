    <textblock>
      This cluster randomized controlled pilot study is designed to test the feasibility, and&#xD;
      potential effect of a multicomponent, community-based intervention aiming to improve quality&#xD;
      of life (QoL) and function for older patients receiving radiotherapy (RT), and thereby reduce&#xD;
      the needs for professional help. The intervention will be based on geriatric assessment and&#xD;
      management (GAM), i.e. systematic assessment and management of physical, mental and&#xD;
      functional problems frequently occurring in the elderly. It will target individual patients&#xD;
      according to needs and be carried out in collaboration between hospital and community&#xD;
      services from start of RT until 8 weeks post-treatment.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Older cancer patients (&gt; 65 years) represent the majority of the cancer population, and their&#xD;
      number grows due to an aging population. These patients often present with a multiplicity of&#xD;
      problems. They frequently suffer from physical- or mental health comorbidities, and are often&#xD;
      frail with impairment in mobility, daily life functioning and cognition. When diagnosed with&#xD;
      cancer and in need of therapy, they are at substantial risk of complications and functional&#xD;
      decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Geriatric assessment with management (GAM) has documented success in improving outcomes in&#xD;
      older patients with other diseases than cancer. Thus, GAM is strongly recommended as an&#xD;
      approach to optimize treatment and care for older cancer patients. Evidence for the potential&#xD;
      benefits is still scarce and in particular for older patients receiving radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although GAM has been proven successful in other contexts, there is no universally accepted&#xD;
      recipe for how such an intervention should be performed and implemented. To be feasible and&#xD;
      efficient, adjustments according to patient population, health care organization and&#xD;
      available resources are necessary. The present study will be conducted to provide the&#xD;
      evidence needed for a subsequent definitive evaluation of a GAM intervention for older&#xD;
      patients receiving radiotherapy in a larger RTC, aiming at improving quality of life (QoL)&#xD;
      and function, and thereby reduce the burden for the patients, their families and the society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The detailed objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. assess the potential short- and long-term effect of the intervention on global QoL and&#xD;
           physical functioning for older cancer patients receiving RT&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. assess the feasibility of the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. at the patient level (recruitment, compliance and adherence)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. at the organizational level (structures facilitating or impeding implementation and&#xD;
                collaboration across sectors and between professionals)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. study the use of health care services and related costs in the intervention and control&#xD;
           group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study emerges from Innlandet Hospital Trust and will be conducted in cooperation with&#xD;
      Trondheim University Hospital, and 30 municipalities in the catchment area of Innlandet&#xD;
      Hospital Trust, and Trondheim Municipality. The intervention is developed by an&#xD;
      interdisciplinary, experienced research group in close collaboration with user&#xD;
      representatives, hospital- and primary health care professionals. It is based on experience,&#xD;
      results and preliminary results from foregoing studies by our study group (including&#xD;
      NCT03071640 and NCT01742442) and focus group interviews with health professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design is cluster-randomized, randomizing municipalities and city districts. Patients&#xD;
      will be recruited at the radiotherapy units at Innlandet Hospital Trust (primary study&#xD;
      center) and Trondheim University Hospital (second study center). Anticipated number of&#xD;
      participants from the two hospitals is 102 patients and 60 patients, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible, consenting patients will be included by the start of radiotherapy (RT), and enter&#xD;
      the control or intervention groups in accordance with the assignment of the municipality or&#xD;
      city district in which they reside. They will be followed with study specific assessments for&#xD;
      one year after end of RT, and for survival for five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      By the time of inclusion, demographic and medical characteristics (including cancer&#xD;
      diagnosis, stage of disease, former and ongoing tumor treatment, ECOG performance status, RT&#xD;
      treatment aim (palliative or curative), and comorbidity. Detailed information about the RT&#xD;
      schedule will be registered by the end of RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient reported outcomes (EORTC QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D-5L) will be assessed at baseline, by the&#xD;
      end of RT, and thereafter 4, 8, 16, 32 and 52 weeks after RT. Physical performance tests,&#xD;
      i.e. Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), Timed Up and Go (TUG), grip strength and&#xD;
      one-legged balance test, will be applied at baseline and 8 and 16 weeks after the end of RT.&#xD;
      Cognitive function will be tested at baseline using the MiniCog.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention in comparison to control (standard&#xD;
      care), detailed information on the patients' use of health care services (home based and&#xD;
      institutional care) will be registered throughout the intervention period and during&#xD;
      follow-up (one year, week 52).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility will be assessed by a process evaluation, aiming to identify facilitators and&#xD;
      barriers for a successful implementation, using mixed methodology. Measures recommended for&#xD;
      each patient's intervention plan will be consecutively registered, as will patients'&#xD;
      compliance and adherence through weekly contact with the coordinating nurse (log notes).&#xD;
      Further data will include interviews with patients and providers. Questionnaires to involved&#xD;
      primary health care nurses and other relevant professionals will also be applied.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The present study is a controlled cluster-randomized pilot study. Cluster-randomization is chosen to avoid contamination of the control group. Before patient recruitment commences, a selection of 32 municipalities and city districts (= clusters) will be stratified into blocks in accordance with number of inhabitants. The selection will include city districts, large and smaller municipalities to ensure sample size and representativity. Clusters within each block will be randomly assigned to intervention or control by using a computer-generated code, 1:1, i.e. 16 in each group&#xD;
Eligible, consenting patients from municipalities/city districts randomized to control will enter the control group. Eligible, consenting patients from municipalities randomized to intervention will enter the intervention group</intervention_model_description>

    <description>We will calculate the intervention cost based on a micro-costing approach. Cost-effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated by calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) that is the difference in mean costs divided by the difference in mean Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). We calculate QALYs by an area under the curve approach under the assumption of piecewise linear change in EQ-5D-5L-index values over time. Missing data will be imputed by multiple imputation and the uncertainty of the ICER will be assessed by performing sensitivity analysis including application of bootstrapping techniques.</description>

    <description>A multicomponent intervention, carried out in cooperation between hospital and community services, based on a geriatric assessment (GA) followed by individually adapted measures targeting identified needs.&#xD;
The GA and the start of the intervention will be handled by a PhD student (geriatrician) or project cancer nurse at start of RT. Pre-planned guidelines will be followed. Contribution from relevant hospital professionals will be sought according to needs. Then the intervention will be offered in the primary health care taking advantage of existing services, e.g. home care, rehabilitation services, exercise groups etc. A community-based coordinating nurse will follow the patients with weekly contacts throughout RT and to end of intervention 8 weeks post-RT. To ensure that each patient's intervention is properly adjusted to changing needs, repeated clinical assessments will be performed by the end of RT and 4 weeks post-RT.</description>
