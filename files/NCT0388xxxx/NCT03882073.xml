    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this research protocol is that the investigators will be able to redesign&#xD;
      the manner in which upper limb amputations are performed so as to enable volitional control&#xD;
      of next generation prosthetic devices and restore sensation and proprioception to the&#xD;
      amputated limb. The investigators will test this hypothesis by performing modified above&#xD;
      elbow or below elbow amputations in ten intervention patients, and compare their outcomes to&#xD;
      ten control patients who have undergone tradition amputations at similar levels. The specific&#xD;
      aims of the project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To define a standardized approach to the performance of a novel operative procedure for&#xD;
           both below elbow (BEA) and above elbow amputations (AEA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To measure the degree of volitional motor activation and excursion achievable in the&#xD;
           residual limb constructs, and to determine the optimal configuration and design of such&#xD;
           constructs&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To describe the extent of proprioceptive feedback achievable through the employment of&#xD;
           these modified surgical techniques&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To validate the functional and somatosensory superiority of the proposed amputation&#xD;
           technique over standard approaches to BEA and AEA&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To develop a modified acute postoperative rehabilitation strategy suited to this new&#xD;
           surgical approach&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a phase I/pilot clinical trial to be performed over a three-year period as a&#xD;
      collaborative initiative involving Brigham &amp; Women's Hospital/Brigham &amp; Women's Faulkner&#xD;
      Hospital (BWH/BWFH), Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC), and the&#xD;
      Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The investigators will plan to perform 6 of the&#xD;
      10 amputations at BWH/BWFH, and 4 of the amputations at WRNMMC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upper extremity amputation is among the oldest known surgical procedures in medical history,&#xD;
      with many of its technical principles having first been elucidated by Hippocrates. Despite&#xD;
      the passage of more than two millennia, relatively little has changed in the operative&#xD;
      approach to upper limb sacrifice. An estimated 58,000 patients in the United States currently&#xD;
      suffer from upper extremity limb loss at either the above elbow (AEA) or below elbow (BEA)&#xD;
      level, and the prevalence of upper limb amputation is expected to rise to approximately&#xD;
      95,000 patients by 2050.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal function of the upper limb is enabled through the dynamic interplay of multiple muscle&#xD;
      groups acting in concert. Manual dexterity is a remarkably orchestrated biomechanical process&#xD;
      that is dependent upon a complex feedback loop involving the central and peripheral nervous&#xD;
      systems and the musculoskeletal system. In their native state, the muscles of the upper&#xD;
      extremity exist in a balanced agonist/antagonist situation in which volitional activation of&#xD;
      one muscle leads not only to its contracture, but also to passive stretch of its opposite.&#xD;
      Changes in muscle tension manifest through this interaction of agonist and antagonist units&#xD;
      lead to stimulation of specialized receptors within the muscle fibers (e.g., muscle spindle&#xD;
      fibers and Golgi tendon organs) that transmit joint position information to the cerebral&#xD;
      cortex. Such feedback, in conjunction with cutaneous sensory information from skin&#xD;
      mechanoreceptors, provides us with a sense of limb proprioception that ultimately enables&#xD;
      high fidelity limb control, even in the absence of visual feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the standard operative approach to upper limb amputation at either the AEA or&#xD;
      BEA level obliterates many of the dynamic relationships characteristic of the uninjured upper&#xD;
      extremity. Initial surgical exposure is typically accomplished through a fishmouth-pattern&#xD;
      incision, followed by progressive transection of muscles, vessels, nerves and bone at the&#xD;
      level of the incision. Tissues distal to the site of structural transection are discarded,&#xD;
      regardless of whether or not there may be viable segments, and the proximal residual muscles&#xD;
      are layered over the distal transected bone in order to provide insulation to this exposed&#xD;
      osseous surface. The surrounding skin is then advanced over the bone/muscle construct in&#xD;
      order to achieve definitive closure. The rudimentary approximation of discordant tissues in&#xD;
      the distal limb in this approach results in a disorganized scar mass in which normal dynamic&#xD;
      muscle relationships are destroyed. The uncoupling of native agonist/antagonist muscle&#xD;
      pairings results in isometric contraction of residual muscle groups upon volitional&#xD;
      activation, producing incomplete, unbalanced neural feedback to the brain that results in&#xD;
      aberrant perception of residual limb position. Such disturbed feedback not only leads to&#xD;
      impaired limb function with prostheses, but also manifests as pathological sensory perception&#xD;
      of the extremity in the form of phantom limb and phantom pain symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the limitations of these approaches have been tolerated due to the fairly simplistic&#xD;
      goal of upper limb amputation: to provide a stable, padded surface for mounting a prosthesis.&#xD;
      Historically, upper limb prostheses have afforded amputees the opportunity to recover at&#xD;
      least some measure of upper limb function. However, such devices have generally not been able&#xD;
      to recapitulate the complex biomechanics of the human upper limb due to limited ranges of&#xD;
      motion and lack of feedback control. These limitations have resulted in reported upper limb&#xD;
      prosthesis rejection rates ranging from 23% to 45%, including both body-powered and&#xD;
      myoelectric devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the capabilities of modern prostheses are now expanding remarkably. Technological&#xD;
      advances including increasingly miniaturized electronics, wireless communications and&#xD;
      ever-refined positional sensors have enabled prosthetic developers to create next-generation&#xD;
      bionic limbs with greatly enhanced degrees of freedom over prior models. Even more advanced&#xD;
      prostheses are currently being developed that have the potential to offer sensory feedback -&#xD;
      both tactile and positional - in a manner never before seen. Such prosthetic devices, while&#xD;
      not yet available commercially, are presently being studied in experimental settings. For&#xD;
      example, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) recently issued a request for&#xD;
      proposals under the Hand, Proprioception and Touch Interfaces (HAPTIX) Program incorporating&#xD;
      an upper limb prosthesis including six degrees of freedom at the wrist, thumb and all digits,&#xD;
      10 pressure sensors capable of providing sensory feedback, and joint angle and velocity&#xD;
      sensors capable of providing joint position data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these technological advances in prosthesis development, surgical methods regarding&#xD;
      management of the residual limb have not kept pace with these enhanced prosthesis&#xD;
      capabilities. Classic techniques of upper limb amputation do not provide innervated&#xD;
      interfaces that can serve as relays for complex prosthetic control; without such biological&#xD;
      actuators in the residual limb to provide afferent and efferent conduits for information&#xD;
      exchange, next generation prostheses are of little use. Stated another way, next generation&#xD;
      prosthetic devices currently incorporate drivers and sensors capable of providing far more&#xD;
      enhanced functionality than ever before seen, but standard approaches to limb amputation do&#xD;
      not deliver a way to effectively link these prosthetics to their intended beneficiaries. An&#xD;
      evolution in the manner in which upper limb amputations are performed - one that will provide&#xD;
      a biological interface that will allow upper limb amputees to take advantage of the enhanced&#xD;
      capabilities offered by the remarkable prostheses currently under development - is now&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recognition of the increased need for effective neural interfaces for prosthetic limbs can be&#xD;
      seen in the expanding number of efforts in this sphere over the past decade. Initial efforts&#xD;
      to provide high-resolution control of distal prostheses were focused primarily on indirect&#xD;
      and direct brain interfaces, either through placement of electroencephalographic scalp&#xD;
      sensors or implantable parenchymal electrodes, respectively. However, such endeavors have&#xD;
      been plagued by poor resolution, inconsistencies in signal acquisition and, in the case of&#xD;
      implantable devices, progressive foreign body reactions leading to impulse degradation over&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the limitations of brain interfaces have become more evident, focus has shifted instead to&#xD;
      peripheral control loci. Efforts in this vein have included direct peripheral nerve&#xD;
      interfaces including interposed sieves and cuffs designed to transduce electrical signals&#xD;
      directly from individual nerve fascicles to distal prostheses. Such monitors have, however,&#xD;
      shown little clinical promise due to progressive nerve compression secondary to scarring, as&#xD;
      well as to significant neurological crosstalk and interference in biological models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most promising efforts regarding peripheral nerve interface development are now within&#xD;
      the realm of biological systems. These models consist of configurations in which native&#xD;
      tissues are innervated with distal nerve endings to create biological actuators for distal&#xD;
      prosthesis control and feedback. The two leading models in this sphere are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Targeted Muscle Re-innervation (TMR): Pioneered by Dumanian and Kuiken et al, TMR is a&#xD;
           technique whereby a series of nerve transfers is used to re-innervate specific target&#xD;
           muscles to create additional prosthesis control sites after distal limb amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regenerative Peripheral Nerve Interfaces (RPNI): Championed by Cederna et al, RPNI&#xD;
           offers an alternative version of an innervated biological interface. An RPNI is a&#xD;
           surgical construct that consists of a non-vascularized segment of muscle that is coapted&#xD;
           to a distal motor or sensory nerve ending.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While both TMR and RPNIs have demonstrated promise in offering improved functionality to&#xD;
      patients who have already undergone amputation, neither technique has been incorporated into&#xD;
      a fundamental redesign of the way in which amputations are performed in the first place; in&#xD;
      all cases of clinical implementation of TMR or RPNIs reported to date in the literature,&#xD;
      these techniques have been employed to further optimize the functionality of patients who had&#xD;
      already experienced limb loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical protocol proposes a reinvention of the manner in which upper limb amputations&#xD;
      are performed, building upon several of the principles established in the work already&#xD;
      performed in the realm of TMR and RPNIs. As elaborated below, the core innovation is the&#xD;
      utilization of distal limb tissues that would ordinarily be sacrificed in the course of&#xD;
      standard lower limb amputations to provide the substrate for natively innervated pairings of&#xD;
      agonist/antagonist muscles capable not only of intuitive, volitional motor activation but&#xD;
      also proprioceptive feedback. Conceptually, this idea consists of physical linkage of&#xD;
      biologically opposed muscles (e.g., the biceps and triceps) such that when neurologically&#xD;
      triggered contraction of one muscle is effected, simultaneous stretch of its partner is also&#xD;
      achieved, resulting in observable motion of the dyad and stimulation of standard&#xD;
      proprioceptive pathways. The investigators have named this construct the agonist-antagonist&#xD;
      myoneural interface (AMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The manner in which this dynamic agonist/antagonist muscle concept may be operationalized&#xD;
      clinically depends upon whether or not intact, innervated and vascularized native muscles are&#xD;
      present at the time of operative intervention. Over the past five years, the research group&#xD;
      has developed experimental models for a variety of clinical scenarios through a series of&#xD;
      preclinical investigations in both murine and caprine populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If healthy native muscle is available as a reconstructive substrate, coaptation of the distal&#xD;
      ends of disinserted agonist/antagonist pairs may be incorporated into the design of the&#xD;
      residual limb; when coupled with a native synovial canal as a gliding interface, a&#xD;
      pulley-like system can be established to provide a dynamic muscle construct. Construction of&#xD;
      AMIs in a rat model have demonstrated preservation of construct muscle bulk, viability over&#xD;
      time and production of graded afferent signals in response to ramp and hold stretches in a&#xD;
      manner similar to native muscle architecture. Furthermore, performance of an amputation at&#xD;
      the transtibial level with incorporation of AMI construction in a goat model has demonstrated&#xD;
      clear coupled motion of the agonist-antagonist pair in the presence of both natural neural&#xD;
      commands and artificial muscle stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these proof of concept animal studies, the investigators hypothesize that the AMI&#xD;
      offers the potential to provide a biological relay for volitional control that is superior to&#xD;
      other neural interface strategies, with the additional benefit of being able to restore limb&#xD;
      proprioception. When coupled with an appropriately adapted next-generation prosthesis, the&#xD;
      AMI thus may provide the first biological mechanism to achieve true closed-loop neural&#xD;
      interactivity with a mechanical limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators here propose a three-year, prospective, controlled assessment of the&#xD;
      functional and somatosensory advantages of the modified amputation model in an upper&#xD;
      extremity scenario. The investigators believe this model has the potential to provide upper&#xD;
      limb amputees with a biological interface that offers not only unprecedented, high-resolution&#xD;
      motor control of prostheses, but also is highly intuitive and capable of restoring limb&#xD;
      proprioception. If manifest, these augmented capabilities may result in improved&#xD;
      functionality and overall health outcomes, including more robust return to work status and&#xD;
      diminished psychological strain.&#xD;
