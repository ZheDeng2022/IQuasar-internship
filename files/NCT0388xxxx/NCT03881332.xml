  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our objective is to monitor glomerular filtration rate (GFR)during the perioperative phase of&#xD;
      patients undergoing robotic surgery for rectum or large bowel cancers. We will use both a&#xD;
      single injection and a continuous infusion of iohexol to measure kidney function for 72 hours&#xD;
      after surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The considerable morbidity and mortality associated with perioperative acute kidney injury&#xD;
      (AKI) is well documented and known to complicate recovery from surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accurate, direct measurements of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) may provide a tool to&#xD;
      monitor perioperative onset of rapidly changing renal function. This may subsequently lead to&#xD;
      design of randomized controlled trials examining the effects of earlier intervention with the&#xD;
      aim to reduce the incidence of perioperative AKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently a protocol for continuous infusion of low-dose iohexol (CILDI) as a measure of GFR&#xD;
      in stable patients over a range of GFR (28-128 mL/min/1.73 m2) has been developed. Accuracy&#xD;
      of this infusion protocol was confirmed with the single bolus injection (SBI) method. Data&#xD;
      also showed that the continuous infusion protocol of low-dose iohexol is an accurate and&#xD;
      precise method when measuring changing GFR even in critical ill patients with variable AKI&#xD;
      risks. Accordingly, SBI and CILDI together now allow us to explore unanswered research&#xD;
      questions related to perioperative change in renal function.&#xD;
