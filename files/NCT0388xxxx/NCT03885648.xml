  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer ranks first in women, and is the second cause of death in this gender. In&#xD;
      addition to genetics, the environment contributes to the development of the disease, although&#xD;
      the factors involved are not well known. Among the latter is the influence of microorganisms&#xD;
      and, therefore, attention is recently being paid to the mammary microbiota. The hypothesis of&#xD;
      this study is that the risk of breast cancer could be associated with the composition and&#xD;
      functionality of the mammary/gut microbiota, and that exposure to environmental contaminants&#xD;
      (endocrine disruptors, EDCs) might contribute to alter the microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a case-control clinical study that will be performed in women between 25 and 70 years&#xD;
      of age. Cases will be women diagnosed and surgically intervened of breast cancer (stages I&#xD;
      and II). Women with antecedents of cancer or advanced tumor stage (metastasis), or who have&#xD;
      received antibiotic treatment within 3 months prior to recruitment, or any neoadjuvant&#xD;
      therapy, will be excluded. Controls will be women surgically intervened of breast&#xD;
      augmentation or reduction. Women with oncological, gynecological or endocrine history, and&#xD;
      those who have received antibiotic treatment within 3 months prior to recruitment will also&#xD;
      be excluded. Blood, urine, breast tissue and stool samples will be collected. Data regarding&#xD;
      anthropometric, sociodemographic, reproductive history, tumor features and dietary habits&#xD;
      will be gathered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolomic studies will be carried out in stool and breast tissue samples. Metagenomic&#xD;
      studies will also be performed in stool and breast tissue samples to ascertain the viral,&#xD;
      fungal, bacterial and archaea populations of the microbiota. Quantitation of estrogens,&#xD;
      estrogen metabolites and EDCs in samples of serum, urine and breast tissue will also be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first time that the contribution of bacteria, archaea, viruses and fungi together&#xD;
      with their alteration by environmental contaminants to the risk of breast cancer will be&#xD;
      evaluated in the same study. Results obtained could contribute to elucidate risk factors,&#xD;
      improve the prognosis, as well as to propose novel intervention studies in this disease.&#xD;

      The study will follow the Declaration of Helsinki and the Spaniard legislation regarding&#xD;
      clinical research. Data obtained will be confidential and only the researchers and&#xD;
      participants, upon request, will have access to them. The study will also follow the data&#xD;
      protection legislation of Spain to guarantee data confidentiality, treatment and&#xD;
      availability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation is volunteer. Participants will be informed about the nature of the research&#xD;
      and the usage of biological samples. In addition to verbal information, participants will be&#xD;
      presented and read an informed consent. Permission has been granted by the Ethics Committee&#xD;
      of Andalusia (Spain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria. Women's age will range 25-70 years. Cases will be women&#xD;
      diagnosed and surgically intervened of incident breast cancer, stages I and II. Controls will&#xD;
      be women surgically intervened of breast augmentation or reduction. Women with antecedents of&#xD;
      cancer or advanced tumor stage (metastasis), or who have received antibiotic treatment 3&#xD;
      months prior to recruitment, or any neoadjuvant therapy, will be excluded of the study. Women&#xD;
      with oncological, gynecological or endocrine antecedents and those who have received of&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment 3 months prior to recruitment will be also excluded. Controls will be&#xD;
      matched to cases by age (± 2 years), category of body mass index and hospital of recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size. The number of breast cancer cases will include at least 100 women, matched with&#xD;
      100 control women. Three hospitals will participate in the recruitment: The University&#xD;
      Hospital of Jaén, Spain; the University Hospital Campus de la Salud of Granada, Spain; and&#xD;
      Ana Moreno Clinic (Granada, Spain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological samples. Blood, breast tissue, stool and urine samples from cases and controls&#xD;
      will be collected. Serum will be separated from blood by centrifugation. Breast tissue&#xD;
      samples will be taken during surgery, from a marginal area 3-5 cm apart from the tumor. For&#xD;
      controls, samples will be taken from any available breast tissue during breast reduction or&#xD;
      augmentation surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast and intestinal microbiota. Bacteria, archaea, fungi and viruses will be investigated&#xD;
      in feces and breast tissue samples. Samples will be pre-treated with pathogen lysis tubes L&#xD;
      and S (QIAGEN, Barcelona, Spain). DNA will be extracted with the QIAamp cador Pathogen Mini&#xD;
      kit (QIAGEN, Barcelona, Spain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA quantification. The DNA concentration of the samples will be evaluated in a NanoDrop2000c&#xD;
      (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metagenomic library construction and sequencing. The Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit&#xD;
      (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) will be used for metagenomic library construction. The&#xD;
      amplicon tagment mix (ATM) in Nextera XT, which includes the enzyme used for tagmentation,&#xD;
      will be diluted 1:10 in nuclease-free water for library construction using 1 to 100 pg input&#xD;
      DNA. Each 20 μL of the tagmentation reaction mixture consists of 10 μL TD buffer, 5 μL of&#xD;
      input DNA, and 5 μL of diluted ATM. PCR cycles for library construction will be 12, 14, 17,&#xD;
      and 20 cycles for 1,000, 100, 10, and 1 pg DNA, respectively, following the manufacturer's&#xD;
      protocol. The manufacturer recommends 12 cycles of the PCR reaction for no less than 1 ng&#xD;
      input DNA. Amplified libraries will be purified using AMPure XP (Agencourt, Brea, CA, USA).&#xD;
      The quality of the purified libraries will be assessed using an Agilent High Sensitivity DNA&#xD;
      Kit on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Santa Clara, CA, USA). The sequencing libraries will be&#xD;
      further quantified using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit. Metagenomic libraries will be&#xD;
      mixed with PhiX Control v3 (Illumina) at a ratio of 9:1 and sequenced with an Illumina MiSeq&#xD;
      Reagent Kit v3 (600 cycles). All samples to be analyzed will be combined in a pool before&#xD;
      starting the massive sequencing. The latter will be done with the MiSeq apparatus (Illumina).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data processing for metagenomic libraries. Metagenomic reads will be subjected to adaptor&#xD;
      clipping and quality trimming using Trimmomatic v0.3. The first three nucleotides with&#xD;
      quality scores less than 20 will be cut from the 3' and 5' read ends. Reads will be processed&#xD;
      using a sliding window method, cutting once the average quality within the window (4 base)&#xD;
      fell below the threshold (Q20). Reads with a length of fewer than 100 nucleotides will be&#xD;
      then removed. Low-complexity reads will be filtered out using PRINSEQ version 0.20.4. PCR&#xD;
      duplicates will be removed with Picard version 2.8.0&#xD;
      (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard). The processed high-quality and clean reads in each&#xD;
      library will be used in subsequent analyses. In the community analysis based on metagenomic&#xD;
      sequences, small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene sequences will be identified using Metaxa2 software.&#xD;
      Taxonomy assignments will be performed based on the results of a BLAST search against the&#xD;
      SILVA123 database, using the MEGAN program [23] with the following settings: Min Support 1,&#xD;
      Min Score 50, Max Expected 1xe-5, Top Percent 10.0. SSU rRNA gene community compositions were&#xD;
      compared among the metagenomic libraries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolomic study. Sample preparation. The samples will be prepared using the automated&#xD;
      MicroLab STARR (Hamilton Company, Salt Lake City, UT, USA) robot system. For quality control&#xD;
      (QC) purposes, a recovery standard will be added to 100 L of the serum samples before the&#xD;
      first step in the extraction process. The proteins will be precipitated with methanol by&#xD;
      vigorously shaking for 2 min. Next, the samples will be centrifuged to remove the proteins,&#xD;
      dissociate the small molecules bound to the proteins or trapped in the precipitated protein&#xD;
      matrix, and to recover chemically diverse metabolites (Glen Mills GenoGrinder 2000, Lebanon,&#xD;
      USA). Then, the samples will be placed on a TurboVapR (Zymark, California, USA) to remove the&#xD;
      organic solvent. For liquid chromatography (LC) analysis, the samples will be stored&#xD;
      overnight in nitrogen before preparation. For gas chromatography (GC) analysis, each sample&#xD;
      will be dried overnight under vacuum before preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality controls. Several types of control experiments will be performed in parallel with the&#xD;
      experimental samples. A pooled matrix sample, generated by taking a small volume of each&#xD;
      experimental sample, will serve as a technical replicate throughout the extracted data set.&#xD;
      Water aliquots will serve as process blanks. Moreover, a cocktail of QC standards carefully&#xD;
      chosen not to interfere with the measurement of endogenous compounds will be spiked into&#xD;
      every analyzed sample. This will allow instrument performance monitoring and aid in the&#xD;
      chromatographic alignment. The instrument variability will be determined by calculating the&#xD;
      median relative standard deviation (RSD) for the standards that will be added to each sample&#xD;
      before injection into the mass spectrometers (MS). The entire process variability will be&#xD;
      determined by calculating the median RSD for all the endogenous metabolites (i.e.,&#xD;
      non-instrument standards) present in 100% of the pooled matrix samples. The experimental&#xD;
      samples will be randomized across the platform run with the QC samples spaced every 5 or 10&#xD;
      injections to verify overall assay performance. The internal standards will be used to&#xD;
      measure the instrument variability and will have a median RSD of 3%. Additionally, the total&#xD;
      process variability will be 8%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The liquid&#xD;
      chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) portion of the platform to be used will employ a&#xD;
      Waters ACQUITY ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC), a Thermo Scientific Q-Exactive&#xD;
      high-resolution/accurate MS interfaced with a heated electrospray ionization (HESI-II)&#xD;
      source, and an Orbitrap mass analyzer operated at a 35,000 mass resolution. The sample&#xD;
      extract will be dried and reconstituted in acidic or basic LC-compatible solvents, each of&#xD;
      which will contain eight or more injected QC standards at fixed concentrations to ensure&#xD;
      injection and chromatographic consistency. One aliquot will be analyzed using acidic,&#xD;
      positive ion-optimized conditions, and another will be performed using basic, negative ion&#xD;
      optimized conditions in two independent injections using separate dedicated columns (Waters&#xD;
      UPLC BEH C18-2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 m). The extracts reconstituted in acidic conditions will be&#xD;
      gradient-eluted from a C18 column using water and methanol containing 0.1% formic acid. A&#xD;
      second aliquot, from the basic extract, will be similarly eluted from a C18 column using&#xD;
      methanol, water, and 6.5 mM ammonium bicarbonate. A third aliquot will be analyzed via&#xD;
      negative ionization following elution from a hydrophilic interaction chromatography column&#xD;
      (Waters UPLC BEH Amide 2.1 × 150 mm, 1.7 m) using a gradient consisting of water and&#xD;
      acetonitrile with 10 mM ammonium formate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The samples destined for analysis by GC-MS will be&#xD;
      dried under a vacuum for a minimum of 18 h before being derivatized under dried nitrogen with&#xD;
      bistrimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide. The derivatized samples will be separated on a 5%&#xD;
      diphenyl/95% dimethyl polysiloxane fused silica column (20 m × 0.18 mm id; 0.18 m film&#xD;
      thickness) with helium as the carrier gas and a temperature ramp from 60C to 340C over a&#xD;
      17.5-min period. The samples will be analyzed on a Thermo-Finnigan Trace DSQ fast-scanning&#xD;
      single-quadrupole MS using electron impact ionization (EI) operated at unit mass resolving&#xD;
      power. The scan range will be 50-750 m/z.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data extraction and compound identification. The raw data will be extracted, and the peaks&#xD;
      will be aligned and identified. QCs will be processed using specific hardware and software.&#xD;
      The peaks will be quantified using the area-under-the-curve (AUC) calculation. The compounds&#xD;
      will be identified comparing the data to library entries of purified standards or recurrent&#xD;
      unknown entities. The biochemical identifications will be based on three criteria: the&#xD;
      retention index (RI) within a narrow RI window of the proposed identification, an accurate&#xD;
      mass match to the library ± 0.005 amu, and the MS/MS forward and reverse scores between the&#xD;
      experimental data and authentic standards. The MS/MS scores will be based on a comparison of&#xD;
      the ions present in the experimental spectrum with the ions present in the library spectrum.&#xD;
      Although there may be similarities between these molecules based on one of these factors, the&#xD;
      use of all three data points can be utilized to distinguish and differentiate the&#xD;
      biochemicals with precision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitation of the exposure to EDCs in urine samples. Analysis of non-persistent EDCs will&#xD;
      be carried out by dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) and ultra-high performance&#xD;
      liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection (UHPLC-MS/MS). Briefly, urine&#xD;
      samples are thawed completely at room temperature, centrifuge at 2600 x g for 10 min to&#xD;
      sediment particulate matter and 0.75 mL are taken to carry out the analysis. In order to&#xD;
      determine total EDCs amount (free plus conjugated), each sample is spiked with 50 μL of&#xD;
      enzyme solution (β-glucuronidase/sulfatase) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The treated&#xD;
      urine is placed in a 15 mL screw-cap glass tube and spiked with 30 μL of the surrogate&#xD;
      standard solution (1.25 mg/L of BPA-d16). Urine is diluted to 10.0 mL with 5% NaCl aqueous&#xD;
      solution (w/v) and the pH is adjusted to 2.0. Next, 0.75 mL of acetone and 0.75 mL of&#xD;
      trichloromethane are mixed and injected rapidly into the aqueous sample with a syringe. After&#xD;
      manual shaking, centrifugation and evaporation of the extract, the residue is dissolved with&#xD;
      100 μL of a mixture consisting of water (0.1% ammonia)/acetonitrile (0.1% ammonia), 70:30&#xD;
      (v/v), and finally 10 μL is injected in the LC system. Urinary creatinine concentration is&#xD;
      determined using an automated colorimetric determination in the same urine samples in which&#xD;
      the environmental chemical is assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitation of urinary concentrations of the parent estrogens and estrogen metabolites.&#xD;
      Concentrations of estrone, estradiol and 13 estrogen metabolites will be determined adjusting&#xD;
      for urinary creatinine levels (mg/dl). The quantitation of urinary estrogens will be assessed&#xD;
      by gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry using a triple quadrupole analyzer. Briefly,&#xD;
      one mL of urine with 25 µL of internal standards solution is extracted using C18 SPE&#xD;
      cartridge (Sep-Pack C18) previously conditioned with 4 mL of methanol and 4 mL of water.&#xD;
      After loading the urine sample, the cartridge is washed with 4 mL of water. The treated urine&#xD;
      is then evaporated. Three mL of acetate buffer 0.1 M (pH 4.5) and 3 µL of β-glucuronidase are&#xD;
      added to the evaporated, and the mixture is incubated for 3 h at 55 °C. After cooling to room&#xD;
      temperature, pH was increased to approximately 9.5. Then, samples are extracted with 6 mL of&#xD;
      tert-butyl methyl ether by shaking and centrifuged. Finally, the organic layer is evaporated&#xD;
      to dryness under a stream of nitrogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other sources of information and covariables. Participants' anthropometric, sociodemographic&#xD;
      and reproductive features will be recorded. They will also grant permission to access their&#xD;
      clinical history. Tumor features and dietary habits will be recorded.&#xD;
