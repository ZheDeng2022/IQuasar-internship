  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to see if a medicine called Cysteamine, given along with&#xD;
      standard asthma care, will improve asthma symptoms and lung function.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma affects 25.7 million people in the US. Many people report symptoms despite taking&#xD;
      high-doses of inhaled asthma medications. This difficult-to-treat group accounts for more&#xD;
      than 50% of asthma related healthcare visits and hospitalizations. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to see if a medicine called Cysteamine, given along with standard asthma care, will&#xD;
      improve asthma symptoms and lung function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of cysteamine. A placebo&#xD;
      arm will be included to determine the comparative effectiveness of cysteamine in this&#xD;
      population. Eligible participants will be assessed 1, 4 and 8 weeks post randomization and&#xD;
      followed for an additional 4 weeks post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to enroll in this study, participants must be between the ages of 18-45 and have&#xD;
      uncontrolled asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include 4 visits and weekly phone calls, and will be in the study for 3-4&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the treatment period, participants will be placed in one of two treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cysteamine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will not be able to choose which group they are assigned. This assignment is&#xD;
      random and by chance, much like flipping a coin. Participants will not know if they are&#xD;
      receiving Cysteamine or placebo. Investigators will compare the study results between the&#xD;
      participants of each group.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in the Asthma Symptom Severity Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre-Treatment), V1 (4 weeks), V2 (8 weeks), Study End (4 weeks post-treatment, Follow-up Phone Call)</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma symptom severity score will be classified using the Expert Panel Report 3 (EPR-3) criteria for untreated asthma. The level of impairment is based on the most severe indication of the following criteria: 1. Symptoms, 2. Nighttime awakenings, 3. Short-Acting Beta Agonist (SABA) use for symptom control, 4. Interference with normal activity, and 5. Lung Function.</description>

    <description>Albuterol is a bronchodilator used as a rescue medication for treatment of asthma symptoms.</description>

    <description>FEV1 is the amount of air exhaled in 1 second during spirometry. This is used as a measurement of asthma severity.</description>

    <description>FEV1 will be obtained by peak flow measurement. This will be used as a measurement in asthma severity.</description>

    <measure>Change in Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (miniAQLQ) scores Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Visit 2 (8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The miniAQLQ will be used to measure the impact that asthma has on participants quality of life. The miniAQLQ will ask questions in the following domains: symptoms, activity limitations, emotional function, and environmental stimuli. There are 15 questions, each with a 7-point scale. An answer of 1 on a question represents the greatest impairment possible and a 7 represents the least impairment. Individual questions are equally weighted. The overall miniAQLQ score is the mean of the responses to each of the 15 questions.</description>
