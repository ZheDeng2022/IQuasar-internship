    <textblock>
      This was an open-label, multi-center, randomized phase 2 study. This is a two-stage design.In&#xD;
      the first stage, two dose groups were set up, the 100 mg bid dose group and the 200 mg qd&#xD;
      dose group, which were randomized at 1:1, with 50 subjects in each group, and a total of 100&#xD;
      cases in the two groups. In the second stage, approximately 36 subjects were added to the&#xD;
      randomized group.&#xD;

      According to the results of the interim analysis of the ZGJAK002 of Jaktinib, a comprehensive&#xD;
      evaluation of the benefits and risks of subjects in the 100mg bid and 200mg qd groups, the&#xD;
      investigator and the sponsor decided to expand the enrollment of approximately 36 subjects&#xD;
      taking 100mg bid.&#xD;
