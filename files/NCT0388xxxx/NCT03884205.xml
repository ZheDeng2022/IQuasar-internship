  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma (PTCL) is a heterogenic malignancy with poor outcome. There is no&#xD;
      standardized treatment protocol for this kind of lymphoma. So, clinical trials are encouraged&#xD;
      by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for those patients. Former studies confirmed&#xD;
      that GDP (Gemcitabine, Dexamethasone, and Cis-platinum) is superior with CHOP&#xD;
      (Cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, Vincristine, and Prednisone). Combination with etoposide can&#xD;
      improve the outcome of some patients with high risk factors. The aim of our study is to&#xD;
      compare the response and survival rate of GDPE/CEOPE (gemcitabine, cis-platinum, etoposide,&#xD;
      and dexamethasone/cyclophosphamide, vincristine, pharmorubicin, etoposide, and prednisone)&#xD;
      with those of CEOPE regimen, looking forward to its superiority in efficacy and safety for&#xD;
      the newly diagnosed adult patients with PTCL.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma (PTCL) is a heterogenic malignancy with poor outcome. Five-year&#xD;
      PFS (progression-free survival) and OS (overall survival) for these patients received classic&#xD;
      CHOP regimen is less than 30%. High-dose intensive chemotherapy doesn't demonstrate better&#xD;
      response. At present, there is no standardized treatment protocol for this kind of lymphoma.&#xD;
      So, clinical trials are encouraged by NCCN for those patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the less efficacy of CHOP or CHOP-like regimen, multi-drug combination strategy has been&#xD;
      the therapy tendency in PTCL. Zhang et al, reported that GDP compared with CHOP as the&#xD;
      therapy strategy for PTCL-NOS (Not Otherwise Specified). The response rate was 78.57% in GDP&#xD;
      group and 60.00% in CHOP group, respectively. DFS (disease-free survival) was 9.79 and 4.2&#xD;
      months in above two groups. They concluded that GDP is superior to CHOP. The main side-effect&#xD;
      of two regimens is hematological toxicity. Combination with etoposide can improve the outcome&#xD;
      of some patients with high risk factors. Furthermore, high-dose combined with ASCT&#xD;
      (autologous stem cell transplantation) has been the first-line therapy for PTCL. Some&#xD;
      refractory/relapsed patients with PTCL will benefit from allogeneic bone marrow&#xD;
      transplantation. However, about 30% patients with PTCL have no chance to receive ASCT for&#xD;
      multiple reasons. So, it is urgent to explore new combination-therapy regimen to improve the&#xD;
      outcome for patients with PTCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to compare the response and survival rate of GDPE/CEOPE (gemcitabine,&#xD;
      cis-platinum, etoposide, and dexamethasone/cyclophosphamide, vincristine, pharmorubicin,&#xD;
      etoposide, and prednisone) with those of CEOPE (/cyclophosphamide, vincristine,&#xD;
      pharmorubicin, etoposide, and prednisone ) regimen, looking forward to its superiority in&#xD;
      efficacy and safety for the newly diagnosed adult patients with PTCL.&#xD;
