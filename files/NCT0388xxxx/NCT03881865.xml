      Study Title:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early recorded P25/30 somatosensory evoked potentials are associated with neurologic&#xD;
      prognosis of comatose survivors after out of hospital cardiac arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, observational, non-interventional, study - prospective collection of data and&#xD;
      interpretation. Analysis of the data and assessment of prognostic value of the P25/30 in&#xD;
      critically ill patients post cardiac arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be the first attempt to validate the prognostic potential of early recording [between&#xD;
      24-36 hours post Return Of Spontaneous Circulation] of P25/30 potentials in comatose&#xD;
      survivors who are admitted to a British Intensive care unit after out of hospital cardiac&#xD;
      arrest and who are not treated by hypothermic targeted temperature management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Validation of the prognostication significance of P25/30 Somatosensory Evoked Potentials in&#xD;
      predicting neurologic outcome in comatose survivors post out of hospital cardiac arrest].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: Neurologic outcome assessed by Cerebral Performance Category score at&#xD;
      hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;

      Recruitment and Conduction: In the first 24 hours in the Intensive Care Unit [ICU] the&#xD;
      patients will be assessed for eligibility. If they meet the inclusion criteria, their Next Of&#xD;
      Kin will be approached by a member of the study team. An explanation of the study design, the&#xD;
      study protocol and the study objectives, as well as a specific relative information sheet for&#xD;
      the study, will be provided. Meeting with the NOK is done ideally before the SSEP&#xD;
      [SomatoSensory Evoked Potentials] recording or, in case of non-availability of the Next of&#xD;
      kin, after the SSEP recording. The next of kin will have at least 24 hours to decide whether&#xD;
      or not to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      N20 and P25/30 SSEP are expected to be recorded and then during the study interpretation of&#xD;
      the results the presence or absence of either or both with the neurological outcome will be&#xD;
      assessed The SSEP recording as a prognostication adjunct after out of hospital cardiac arrest&#xD;
      is part of the usual, established Derriford ICU policy for the management of the comatose&#xD;
      survivors after out of hospital cardiac arrest and is not added or at any way modified,&#xD;
      because of the study. The study purpose is the interpretation of the recording sheet of the&#xD;
      SSEP test in order to answer the question whether the P25/30 potential that is recorded along&#xD;
      with the N20 may have prognostic significance for the patients' neurological outcome. SSEPs&#xD;
      must be recorded between 24-36 hours after ROSC [Return of Spontaneous Circulation]. Mild to&#xD;
      moderate hypothermia â‰¥35 does not abolish the cortical N20 responses. Median or ulnar nerve&#xD;
      bilaterally will be stimulated. Cortical N20 and P25/30 response is to be described as&#xD;
      bilaterally absent (which is a good predictor of poor neurological outcome), or in other&#xD;
      cases in may be present on one or both sides. If the cortical N20 response is absent, the&#xD;
      presence of the peripheral N9 and N13 response must be present to ensure that the response&#xD;
      has arrived at the cortex. Cervical lesions need to be excluded if Cortical N20 response is&#xD;
      absent. After the SSEP recording, for those patients who informed consent is obtained from&#xD;
      their next of kins and are enrolled to the study, a copy of each recording will be produced&#xD;
      for the study purposes by one member of the study team who is not participating in the&#xD;
      interpretation of the recording. This copy will be anonymised by giving a specific number for&#xD;
      the study. After that, the anonymised copy will become available to the first and to the&#xD;
      second interpreter [both members of the study team (neurophysiology)] who will interpret the&#xD;
      recordings with regards to the presence and absence of the N20 and P25/30 SSEPs and they will&#xD;
      record the results of their interpretation in the results databank. The two interpreters will&#xD;
      be blinded for the personal and the clinical details of the patient. Also each one of the&#xD;
      interpreters will not be aware about the result of the interpretation of the other. The ICU&#xD;
      clinicians will not be aware about the results of the P25/30 interpretation as this will be&#xD;
      part of the study and should not be disclosed to them during the conduction of the study. In&#xD;
      this way, the P25/30 interpretation results will be impossible to affect the treatment of the&#xD;
      patients and / or any of the clinical decisions made about them by the ICU clinicians. In the&#xD;
      unlikely event that there was a discrepancy in interpretation of the SSEP recording between&#xD;
      the two delegated interpreters, then a third member [not a member of the study team] of the&#xD;
      Neurophysiology team would be asked to review the anonymised recording only in order to&#xD;
      decide about the result. As the P25/30 pottential could be generated in the absence of N20 as&#xD;
      they come from two distinct areas of the brain cortex, the presence of either the P25/30 or&#xD;
      the N20 would be confirmed when the amplitude of each one is equal or higher than the&#xD;
      amplitude threshold [0.5 microvolts] used for the analysis of the SSEPs. The presence and the&#xD;
      amplitude of P25/30 will not be dependent on the presence of N20 in the same recording as&#xD;
      each one of them can exist in the absence of the other. Measurement of the amplitude of&#xD;
      recorded P25/30 and N20 and their combinations. Test if there is a correlation of the&#xD;
      recorded amplitudes and their ratio [P25/30 to N20] with the positive predictive value of N20&#xD;
      for the favourable neurological outcome. After the SSEP recording has been conducted, between&#xD;
      24 and 36 hours post ROSC, the patients will be followed up by members of the study team.&#xD;
      Those members of the team will assess the patients, by Cerebral Performance Category and full&#xD;
      neurologic clinical examination, on the day of ICU discharge and on the day of their&#xD;
      discharge from Derriford Hospital. The online system SALUS of Derriford hospital will be used&#xD;
      to follow up the patients after their discharge from ICU and before their discharge from the&#xD;
      hospital. The neurologic outcome, assessed with the Cerebral Performance Category [CPC], will&#xD;
      be recorded. If a study participant died on ICU as a result of severe brain dysfunction or&#xD;
      after the decision of ICU Consultant to be withdrawn from invasive organ support due to&#xD;
      extremely poor prognosis, the discharge CPC would be the most recently recorded, after the&#xD;
      patient have remained consistently off sedation [for a period of time varied for different&#xD;
      sedatives or combination of sedatives]. If a participant died unexpectedly from another cause&#xD;
      rather than severe brain dysfunction, then the most recent CPC before death [if available]&#xD;
      will be recorded as indicative of neurologic outcome for the patients. In case the CPC could&#xD;
      not be assessed, the patient would be excluded from the study analysis. The Results of the&#xD;
      CPC assessment and the outcome of the patients will be stored in the general study databank&#xD;
      for further analysis. At the End of the study, all data will be merged and statistically&#xD;
      analysed and from the result of this analysis one or more relevant manuscripts must be&#xD;
      submitted to a peer-review journal within the first 4 months after the completion of the&#xD;
      study. For each one of the patients-participants, the following clinical data must be&#xD;
      collected prospectively, during the conduction of the study [at different stages i.e. at the&#xD;
      time of enrolment and follow up] and must be kept safely in an anonymised form in a suitable&#xD;
      database. The principles of patients' confidentiality and privacy must be applied at all&#xD;
      times. Age, Gender, Comorbidities, Pre-admission performance status [Assessed by the ECOG/WHO&#xD;
      (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group/World Health Organisation) performance status score,&#xD;
      Cardiac Arrest Rhythm [Rhythm that was initially recorded after cardiac arrest, usually at&#xD;
      scene], Bystander - witness of cardiac arrest and Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, Anoxic time&#xD;
      [total time between cardiac arrest was noted and ROSC]. If multiple episodes of cardiac&#xD;
      arrest then the sum of all anoxic times to be considered. GCS before intubation [total or&#xD;
      with components if available]. Aetiology of cardiac arrest [cardiac or non-cardiac or&#xD;
      unknown].CT [Computed Tomography] scan report if performed because it was clinically&#xD;
      indicated.Cerebral performance category at ICU discharge and Hospital discharge. Date of&#xD;
      death, number of days post ROSC that death occurred.ICU length of stay, hospital length of&#xD;

      hours post ROSC: mean SaO2 [arterial oxygen saturation], mean PaO2 [arterial partial pressure&#xD;

      blood pressure, mean Glucose levels, mean Lactate levels, mean pH, mean BE, Urea and&#xD;
      Creatinine levels, liver function tests, Plasma sodium levels, Temperature, Sequential Organ&#xD;
      Failure Assessment Score. No particulars tests needed for the study purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is the CPC score at hospital discharge with discrete values&#xD;
      ranging from 1 to 5. The score will be dichotomised as 1-2 (positive or good outcome) and 3-5&#xD;
      (negative or poor outcome). Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of P25/30 in&#xD;
      predicting poor outcome will be computed and the results compared to that of N20. Where&#xD;
      appropriate, parameter estimates will be presented with 95% confidence intervals. Significant&#xD;
      demographic and clinical predictors of poor neurological outcomes will be assessed and&#xD;
      identified using regression models. Statistical data analysis will be undertaken once data&#xD;
      collection from the required number of participants is completed. No interim analysis is&#xD;
      scheduled for this study. Analyses will be performed in SPSS [Statistical Package for the&#xD;
      Social Sciences] version 24 (or later). Sample size calculation was based on diagnostic test&#xD;
      accuracy (adequate sensitivity) of P25/30. Previous studies on patients treated by&#xD;
      hypothermic targeted temperature management showed that the sensitivity of P25/30 in&#xD;
      predicting poor outcome is 90.12% (95% Confidence Interval, 81.5-95.6%). Though the proposed&#xD;
      study will be based on those who are not treated by hypothermic targeted temperature&#xD;
      management, the result (90%) is the 'best' available information regarding pre-determined&#xD;
      sensitivity of P25/30. From experience of the team and analysis of the past three-years pilot&#xD;
      data, the prevalence of poor outcome was assumed to be 75%. In order the maximum marginal&#xD;
      error of estimate does not exceed from 5% with 95% confidence level, and adjusting for&#xD;
      drop-out/lack of consent at 3%, the total required sample size will be 191. No power was&#xD;
      assumed in the calculation of the sample size as there is no testing of hypothesis. Whenever&#xD;
      applicable, a 5% level of significance will be used. As this is not an interventional study,&#xD;
      the chance to terminate the trial is minimal. Spurious and/or missing data will be summarised&#xD;
      and reasons for missingness given where possible. All data analyses will be based on the&#xD;
      complete data only. Statistical analysis of the data will be performed at the end of the&#xD;
      study. If deemed necessary, a separate statistical analysis plan (SAP) can be prepared prior&#xD;
      to the completion of the study and approved by the oversight committee. The study team will&#xD;
      discuss any deviation from the analysis plan and report it to the oversight committee. Any&#xD;
      revisions to the SAP will be documented, including a brief justification and timing of&#xD;
      revision. All eligible participants will be included in the analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients enrolled in the study are expected to be in coma at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
      This is a reality about most of the ICU patients. Therefore, within the first 24 hours after&#xD;
      ICU admission, the members of the study group will discuss with the next of kin of the&#xD;
      patients regarding the potential participation in the study and the informed consent process.&#xD;
      f the participants in the study regain full mental capacity to provide informed consent and&#xD;
      make informed decisions after their enrollment in the study, then the participants will be&#xD;
      fully informed about the study by a member of the study group and they will be asked if they&#xD;
      agree to continue with their participation in the study. If the participants are happy to&#xD;
      remain in the study cohort then their data will be used for analysis and publication&#xD;
      purposes. If the participants decide anytime to withdraw from the study then their decision&#xD;
      will be respected but it will be explained that that their data already collected may still&#xD;
      be analysed as part of the study. The same options will be available for the next of kin that&#xD;
      would have consented initially for the participation of patients in the study.&#xD;
