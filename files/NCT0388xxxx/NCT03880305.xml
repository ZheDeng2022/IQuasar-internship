    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a complex condition initiated by a pathogen and mediated by cytokines followed by&#xD;
      immune, inflammatory, and coagulation homeostasis disturbances, its evolution being dictated&#xD;
      by a complicated balance between pro inflammatory and anti- inflammatory factors. Most of the&#xD;
      short and long-term complications of the neonatal sepsis are strictly related to inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators. Neonatal sepsis is associated with a mortality rate that ranges from 13 to 60%&#xD;
      inspite of improved antibiotic therapy and an increased morbidity in survivors .&#xD;

    <textblock>
      &quot;Suspected sepsis&quot; is one of the most frequently encountered diagnosis in neonatology&#xD;
      because: a) a large number of newborns are evaluated for early or late sepsis based on risk&#xD;
      factors and for fear of missing a correct diagnosis and a prompt treatment ; b) in neonates,&#xD;
      the clinical signs of infection are not specific, late, and the differential diagnosis with&#xD;
      neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, aspiration syndromes or neonatal maladaptation to&#xD;
      extra-uterine life is difficult ; c) blood culture - the golden standard in neonatal sepsis&#xD;
      diagnosis - provides late information, has a poor accuracy, and is not universally available;&#xD;
      and d) up to date, there is no an ideal diagnostic tool for neonatal infection . Therefore,&#xD;
      diagnosis of neonatal sepsis is still a challenge for neonatal medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotic therapy is often initiated based upon clinical suspicion and/or the presence of&#xD;
      risk factors, leading to excessive antibiotic therapy. Very often the diagnosis criteria for&#xD;
      neonatal sepsis consists in documenting an infection in a newborn with severe systemic&#xD;
      disease in which all possible noninfectious explanations for the patient's altered&#xD;
      physiological status are either ruled out or unlikely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;gold standard&quot;, definitive test for neonatal sepsis is the isolation of the pathogen&#xD;
      from blood. However, its accuracy is influenced by multiple factors a) contamination during&#xD;
      sampling; b) sampling after antibiotic therapy was started; c) insufficient sampling volume;&#xD;
      d) low colony count bacteremia. Accuracy of the blood culture varies between8 and 73% in&#xD;
      various studies .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite hundreds of published studies, there is still no consensus regarding the best&#xD;
      screening test or panel of tests for rapid detection of neonatal sepsis. Recently, new acute&#xD;
      phase proteins, cytokines, cell surface antigens, and bacterial genome are used to improve&#xD;
      the neonatal sepsis diagnosis but data are still under evaluation and most of these tests are&#xD;
      either not clinically available or they are expensive .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accumulating evidence indicates that the CBC is an effective predictor of prognosis and&#xD;
      mortality in many disease states, including hematological disease, neoplasms, and severe&#xD;
      infections. Therefore, non- specific changes in the CBC in critically ill neonates could be&#xD;
      considered a key prognostic factor in the evaluation of survival prediction in these patients&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some prognostic scoring systems with performance status, clinical symptoms and biochemical&#xD;
      parameters help to guide accurate prediction of the prognosis, such as the acute physiology&#xD;
      and chronic health evaluation, yet are considered too complex for general clinical use.&#xD;
      Therefore, the prediction of clinical events with laboratory parameters, including complete&#xD;
      blood cell count (CBC), has become an increased focus of research .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total leukocyte count (TLC), total neutrophil count, ANC, immature neutrophil count,&#xD;
      immature/total neutrophil ratio (I:T ratio), immature/mature neutrophil ratio (I:M ratio),&#xD;
      neutrophil degenerative changes (vacuolization, toxic granulations, and DÃ¶hle bodies), and&#xD;
      platelet count are the most used hematological parameters for Early Onset Sepsis evaluation .&#xD;
      Most of the hematological screening panels for Early Onset Sepsis use a total leukocyte count&#xD;
      &lt; 5000 cells/mm3 or &gt; 20.000 cells/mm3, an I:T ratio &gt; 0.2, and total outside the normal&#xD;
      range. TLC increases in severe neonatal infections (both mature and immature cells) possible&#xD;
      secondary to growth factors and cytokine release that stimulate the bone marrow production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thrombocytopenia is one of the early but non-specific indicator of neonatal sepsis with or&#xD;
      without DIC. It can be caused by bacterial, viral, fungal and parasitic infections and other&#xD;
      non-infectious causes. The overall prevalence of thrombocytopenia in neonatal age group&#xD;
      varies from1- 5%, and is reported to be much higher in newborns admitted to intensive care&#xD;
      units, i.e. ranging from 22% to 35%. Severe thrombocytopenia (50000/mm3) was found to be&#xD;
      present in 2.4% patients admitted in NICU.Bleeding is a major complication of&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia but is generally limited to infants with count&lt; 30000/mm3. Studies have&#xD;
      shown that approximately 50% cases of culture proven of sepsis get thrombocytopenia .Changes&#xD;
      in other platelet indices, like MPV(mean platelet volume) and PDW (platelet distribution&#xD;
      width) have also been examined in relationship to neonatal sepsis in some studies .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet indices (platelet counts, platelet distribution width-(PDW), mean platelet volume&#xD;
      (MPV)) are one such set of parameters which can be helpful for the diagnosis and hence early&#xD;
      treatment of neonatal sepsis. Advantages of platelet indices are that the sample for these&#xD;
      can be drawn at the same time as that for other investigations and require no special&#xD;
      sampling techniques and are easily available. Some studies had reported a low platelet&#xD;
      counts, high mean platelet volume and platelet distribution width was observed in sepsis&#xD;
      cases with a statistically significant difference as compared to controls .&#xD;
