  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is part of the global clinical assessment program of IQOS. It is designed to&#xD;
      provide scientific evidence to further substantiate the reduced risk potential of using a&#xD;
      heated tobacco product (IQOS) as compared to smoking cigarettes. The main goals of this&#xD;
      exploratory study are to assess whether switching from cigarette smoking to using IQOS will&#xD;
      influence 1) maximum oxygen uptake during incremental exercise (VO2max) and exercise&#xD;
      capacity, 2) ability to perform exercise training and thereby influence 3) VO2max after 12&#xD;
      weeks of exercise training, 4) physiological parameters and biological health markers, and&#xD;
      finally 5) physical activity levels in daily life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study, with healthy adult smokers, is designed as a study without product use&#xD;
      restrictions (ad libitum product use) in order to replicate as closely as possible &quot;real&#xD;
      life&quot; conditions. Subjects randomized to the cigarette and IQOS arms will be asked to buy&#xD;
      their own cigarettes or HeatSticks, respectively. Subjects randomized to the smoking&#xD;
      abstinence (SA) arm will be instructed to stay smoking abstinent until the end of the study.&#xD;
      Subjects in the SA arm will receive smoking abstinence support and, in order to prevent&#xD;
      relapse to cigarette smoking during the training program, will also be allowed to use&#xD;
      nicotine replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobile health technology will be used in the study to explore the impact on switching from&#xD;
      smoking to using IQOS on physical activity in daily real-world living conditions. The&#xD;
      wearable will enable non-invasive recording of physical activity in an objective manner&#xD;
      throughout the study.&#xD;
