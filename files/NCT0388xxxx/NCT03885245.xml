  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with obese late onset (after childhood) asthma can have lower FeNO levels, yet be&#xD;
      highly symptomatic and poorly responsive to inhaled steroids. This is a common asthma&#xD;
      phenotype, particularly among females. This reduction of NO occurs through increased arginase&#xD;
      activity and uncoupling of NO synthase (NOS), by accumulation of asymmetric di-methyl&#xD;
      arginine (ADMA), which further lowers the L-arginine/ADMA ratio, preferentially promoting&#xD;
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and inflammation at the expense of NO. Indeed, in&#xD;
      patients with obese late onset asthma, lower L-arginine/ADMA plasma ratios are associated&#xD;
      with reduced FeNO, increased bronchial hyperreactivity, and greater asthma morbidity. In our&#xD;
      pilot studies, the administration of L-citrulline, as an L-arginine donor, to patients with&#xD;
      obese late onset asthma increased the L-arginine/ADMA ratio, FeNO levels, and improved asthma&#xD;
      control and lung function. Therefore, the objectives of the protocol are to: a) determine the&#xD;
      efficacy of L-citrulline, as an add-on treatment to improve the asthma control and lung&#xD;
      function in obese late onset asthmatics; b) leverage the use of asthmatic and control cells&#xD;
      to further understand obesity-related changes in epithelial airway NO metabolism, and how&#xD;
      these changes relate to bronchoconstriction and lung function, c) determine airway epithelial&#xD;
      changes in mitochondrial function and bioenergetics in obese late onset asthmatics and how&#xD;
      these are modified by L-citrulline. To do this, 54 obese late onset asthmatics with&#xD;
      suboptimal control will be blindly randomized, in a cross over study, comparing 15g/day of&#xD;
      L-citrulline vs. placebo, in two 8-week treatment periods with a 6-week washout in between.&#xD;
      The co-primary study outcomes are asthma control (ACQ, ACT) and FeNO, and secondary endpoints&#xD;
      plasma L-arginine/ADMA, FEV1 and PC20 methacholine. Parallel to this study, a small study of&#xD;
      10 healthy obese controls will receive open label L-citrulline for 7 weeks to establish&#xD;
      comparative reference values for the study aims. During the initial treatment phase, 50% of&#xD;
      study participants will be randomly allocated to undergo pre and post L-citrulline treatment&#xD;
      bronchoscopy to obtain BAL and airway epithelial cells. The research group proposing this&#xD;
      study is highly experience in asthma clinical trials, implementation of cross over design&#xD;
      studies, and in the use of research bronchoscopies.&#xD;
