    <textblock>
      The investigator proposes an open label pilot study to investigate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      gamma interferon (γIFN) in patients with Friedreich's Ataxia (FRDA). yIFN, an approved drug&#xD;
      for treatment of granulomatous disease, has been shown to promote Frataxin expression in FRDA&#xD;
      models in vitro and in vivo as well as in pilot human studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will monitored by clinical surveillance and biohumoral periodic assessment. Efficacy&#xD;
      will be assessed by a combination of advanced neuroimaging techniques and established&#xD;
      clinical indicators. The investigators intend to recruit over a 6 months period 12 subject&#xD;
      with molecularly established FRDA. The protocol builds on a recently concluded observational&#xD;
      study which established the pattern of clinical and neuroimaging abnormalities characterizing&#xD;
      a cohort of patients with FA. The data already acquired through such study will constitute&#xD;
      the T-6/-12 point, and together with T0 assessment, carried out at study entrance, will&#xD;
      provide for each patient the exact appreciation of disease actual progression over a year&#xD;
      time. Recruited patients will receive for 6 months yIFN at a final dose of 200 ug/three times&#xD;
      a week. Patients will be evaluated clinically after 3 and 6 months (T3 and T6) of treatment&#xD;
      and 6 months after treatment end (T+6) and by neuroimaging at T6 and T+6. The neuroimaging&#xD;
      protocol, based on 3 Tesla scanner, consists in functional MRI, tractography. The clinical&#xD;
      protocol consists on specific ataxia scales administration. Regular monitoring with for&#xD;
      eventual adverse events will be provided. Frataxin levels in the peripheral blood mononuclear&#xD;
      cells will also be evaluated at T0, T3, T6, T+6. Furthermore, the thickness of the cardiac&#xD;
      ventricle and retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness with optical coherence tomography&#xD;
      (OCT) will be performed at T0, T6, T + 6.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that affects children and&#xD;
      young adults. Patients become progressively unable to coordinate movements and walking until&#xD;
      severe disability ensues. Most patients develop dilated cardiomyopathy and congestive heart&#xD;
      failure. The disease is non remissive and significantly shortens lifespan expectancy. FRDA is&#xD;
      a genetic disease inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. FRDA patients display abnormal&#xD;
      GAA triplet expansions within the first intron of the frataxin gene that prevent proper gene&#xD;
      expression. The levels of frataxin, a mitochondrial protein involved in iron metabolism and&#xD;
      energy production, are insufficient and cells undergo prolonged stress and premature death.&#xD;
      Mostly affected by frataxin deficiency are peripheral neurons of the dorsal root ganglia&#xD;
      (DRG) and neurons of the cerebellar nucleus dentatus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FRDA affects 1 in 50,000 individuals in western countries and has no approved therapy. It has&#xD;
      recently been shown that interferon gamma (γIFN), a natural regulator of the immune response&#xD;
      and iron metabolism, stimulates frataxin gene transcription and promotes frataxin&#xD;
      accumulation in cells, including frataxin-defective cells derived from FRDA patients.&#xD;
      Moreover, prolonged treatment of YG8R mice, an animal model for FRDA, with γIFN results in&#xD;
      accumulation of frataxin in DRG neurons and significantly prevents the deterioration of the&#xD;
      sensorimotor performances of the mice over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since γIFN is also a drug available on the market as a recombinant protein (γIFN - 1b, TD&#xD;
      Imukin® and Actimmune®), and already approved for two pediatric indications (malignant&#xD;
      osteopetrosis and chronic granuloumatous disease), it could represent a quickly accessible&#xD;
      therapeutic option for FRDA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major obstacle to efficiently establish efficacy of treatment in FRDA is the lack of&#xD;
      reliable and sensitive biomarkers. Clinical indicators (disease specific scales, timed&#xD;
      performance tests) are prone to inter-rater variability and, above all, while valid and&#xD;
      sensitive to long term changes, they are very inefficient in capturing changes in the short&#xD;
      time interval (months) typically used in randomized clinical trials (RCTs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advanced neuroimaging techniques such as Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM), Susceptibility&#xD;
      Weighted Imaging (SWI), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and functional Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      Imaging (fMRI) could offer objective indicators of the disease progression that could serve&#xD;
      as paraclinical end point in therapeutic trials. Surrogate end-points based on neuroimaging&#xD;
      indicators have been extensively used in other neurological diseases such as Multiple&#xD;
      Sclerosis, and their introduction speeded up significantly the recognition of effective&#xD;
      treatments and their longitudinal evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last years, in vivo MRI studies have provided information relative to the damage of&#xD;
      cerebellar, cerebral and spinal cord areas involved in FRDA and other genetically determined&#xD;
      ataxias, which could be useful to monitor disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the advent of the VBM, it is possible to quantify the degree of atrophy, to monitor it&#xD;
      in time and to identify various pattern typical of a specific form of ataxia. Various studies&#xD;
      have evidenced a significant correlation between the degree of the cerebellar atrophy, the&#xD;
      severity of the clinical picture and also the duration of the disease .&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study conducted in a cohort of 9 FRDA affected adolescents who underwent a 6 month&#xD;
      treatment with deferiprone, demonstrated a significant reduction in the mean R2* signal in&#xD;
      the cerebellar dentate nuclei, an iron tissue store index. Modifications of the fMRI pattern&#xD;
      in response to specific tasks involving both the motor and the planning ability have also&#xD;
      been demonstrated in FRDA patients, and fMRI based protocols could offer an adjunctive&#xD;
      indicator of disease progression or of therapy induced modification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and purpose of the proposed investigation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test safety of γIFN treatment given for 6 months at final dose of 200 mcg three times&#xD;
           weekly in FRDA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test the effect of γIFN treatment on disease specifc clinical scale (SARA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test the effect of such treatment on a set of secondary imaging, laboratory and clinical&#xD;
           end-points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  fMRI changes in FRDA patients performing the finger tapping protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  DTI parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Thickness of ventricular wall as measured by Ecocardiogram (EcoCG)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Thickness of RNFL as measured by OCT&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Frataxin levels in cell lysates prepared from peripheral blood mononuclear cells&#xD;
                (PBMC)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Changes in quality of life and disability impact measure. What previous work is&#xD;
                this project based on? Evidence for the possible efficacy of recombinant γIFN in&#xD;
                FRDA has been gathered both in the animal model for the disease and in FRDA&#xD;
                patients. In FRDA patients, a recently completed Phase II trial reported&#xD;
                significant improvement on the FARS evaluation after 3 months treatment on a 100&#xD;
                mcg, 3 times/weekly regimen. Moreover, another recently completed Phase II study&#xD;
                suggests that the dosing of 200 mcg is reasonably well tolerated in FRDA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An articulated MRI protocol for FRDA patients aged 12-50 which included DTI, VBM, and fMRI&#xD;
      following a selective motor paradigm has been tested, validated and implemented in the&#xD;
      investigators Institute. By this protocol the investigators evaluated 22 FRDA patients and 15&#xD;
      age and sex matched healthy controls, and found significant differences in DTI parameters (FA&#xD;
      &amp; MD) in the cerebellar white matter, long sensory and motor tracts, major commissural&#xD;
      tracts, and in BOLD signal intensity and distribution of BOLD signal during performance of a&#xD;
      finger tapping test. These latter disease specific changes were most evident in the&#xD;
      ipsilateral cerebellar cortex. The observed changes correlated with the degree of&#xD;
      neurological and functional impairment as measured with validated scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These preliminary results indicate that DTI and fMRI changes may function as efficient&#xD;
      surrogate end-points in RCT for FRDA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;

           for the following 22 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
           Imaging protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
           The MRI examination will be administered at 4 T points:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - T-12 to -6: for this point the data already stored along in the last year from the&#xD;
           published invesitgators' MRI study on 18 subjects will be used&#xD;
&#xD;
           - T0: at time of recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
           - T6: after 6 months of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
           - T+6: 6 months after treatment termination The protocol will be acquired on a 3 T&#xD;
           scanner equipped with a 32-channel head coil and will include morphological, structural&#xD;
           (DTI) and functional (fMRI) sequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A 3D T1-weighted TFE sequence (TR/TE=8.2/3.7, voxel size= 1x1x1 mm, 150 slices) will be&#xD;
           acquired in order to obtain morphological data suitable for volumetric analysis for&#xD;
           voxel-based morphometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The DTI data will be acquired by means of a T2-weighted EPI sequence (voxel size&#xD;
           =2.5x2.5x2.5 mm) along 32 non-collinear directions, with multiple b-values (0, 300, 1100&#xD;
           sec/mm2) and will be evaluated off-line with the Tortoise dedicated software. Functional&#xD;
           data will be acquired by means of a T2-weighted EPI sequence (TR/TE=2000/20,&#xD;
           thickness=2.5mm, 40 slices) covering the whole brain and cerebellum.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Functional images will be acquired during a task that implies manual coordination and&#xD;
           precision, in order to test possible effect of the treatment over the functional&#xD;
           organization of motor networks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Laboratory protocol Eco CG study will be performed at T0, T6, T+6 with established&#xD;
           protocol. Frataxin levels monitoring will be performed at T0, T3 (after 3 months) and T6&#xD;
           (after 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical measures and Safety monitoring A trained neurologist will visit each patient at&#xD;
           T0, T3, T6 and T+6 and report all vital signs and register other objective findings&#xD;
           including adverse event (AE).&#xD;
&#xD;
           A detailed checklist with all the known AE reported with γIFN treatment will be&#xD;
           presented to each participant at T0, T3, T6.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following blood test will be performed at T0, T3, T6 :&#xD;
&#xD;
           -Cell Blood Count, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate, Ca2+, Cl-, Na+, Mg2+, K+, Albumin,&#xD;
           Globulins, Glucose, Blood Urea Nitrogen, Uric Acid, Creatinine, Aspartate Transaminase,&#xD;
           Alanine Transaminase, Iron, Ferritin, Transferrin&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical analysis For the MRI protocol, each dataset will be processed with a&#xD;
           dedicated pipeline and appropriate software.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The T1 volumes will be processed following the standard FMRIB Software Library (FSL)&#xD;
           pipeline and performing VBM. As first step a study specific template of gray matter,&#xD;
           using the routine &quot;buildtemplateparallel&quot; of Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs), that&#xD;
           performs an iterative template construction with elastic transformations will be&#xD;
           created.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The DTI data will be corrected for eddy currents and motion artefacts and then the&#xD;
           diffusion tensor will be computed using the non-linear mono-exponential diffusion model,&#xD;
           obtaining maps of &quot;fractional anisotropy&quot; (FA), &quot;mean diffusivity&quot; (MD), &quot;radial&#xD;
           diffusivity&quot; (RD) and &quot;axial diffusivity&quot; (AD).&#xD;
&#xD;
           To quantify the statistical differences over time, the diffusion data of all subjects&#xD;
           will be moved to a common space through rigid, affine and diffeomorphic registrations&#xD;
           based on the diffusion tensor itself. Using the transformations computed on the tensors,&#xD;
           3 different tests will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Tract Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS);&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Voxel-wise statistical analysis based on permutations;&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Statistical analysis of regions of interest (ROI) with generalized linear models&#xD;
           (GLM).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The fMRI data will be processed using Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 (SPM8). A&#xD;
           first-level Fixed Effect analysis will be performed on each subject using global linear&#xD;
           model and motion parameters as confounds. For the group-level analysis a Random Effect&#xD;
           Analysis with contrasts obtained in the single subject step analysis will be performed.&#xD;
           A two sample t-test will finally be computed to check differences in activations over&#xD;
           time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All time-dependent data (including ROI-wise neuroimaging results) will be analyzed using&#xD;
           multivariate linear mixed models, including timepoints as a repeated within-subject&#xD;
           factor and included sex, age at onset, disease duration, years of education and number&#xD;
           of GAA1 repeats within the smaller FXN allele as covariates of no interest. N case of a&#xD;
           statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) overall effect of time, pairwise comparisons between&#xD;
           timepoints will be performed and corrected for multiple comparisons across pairs of&#xD;
           timepoints. Correlation analysis will also be performed between possible modifications&#xD;
           in SARA scores between consecutive time-points and the respective changes in the MRI&#xD;
           derived structural and functional measures.&#xD;
