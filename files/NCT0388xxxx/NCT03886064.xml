  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the world. 17.5 million people&#xD;
      died in 2012 due to CVD (31% of all causes of death). In Europe more than 50% of deaths are&#xD;
      due to CVD. The CVD mortality rate is higher in the lower socio-economic levels. Three&#xD;
      quarters of CVD deaths occur in developing countries (LDCs). According to estimates in 2030,&#xD;
      CVD will be responsible for more deaths than the sum of infectious, nutritional, maternal and&#xD;
      perinatal diseases in developing countries. The lack of an adequate primary care network in&#xD;
      developing countries limits the screening and treatment of people with CVRF. As a result,&#xD;
      these people do not benefit from appropriate prevention, are diagnosed late and remain&#xD;
      disabled or die at a young age, resulting in significant additional costs for families but&#xD;
      also at the macroeconomic level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular risk factor prevention measures (CVRF) have been shown to be effective.&#xD;
      Interventions are possible on a large scale (policies against smoking and unfavorable eating&#xD;
      habits, promoting physical activity, etc.). Actions are possible at the individual level,&#xD;
      both in primary prevention (fight against the FDRCV) and secondary, where many treatments&#xD;
      have proven their effectiveness. These interventions are effective and profitable from a&#xD;
      macroeconomic point of view. It has been estimated that the cost for such interventions would&#xD;
      not exceed 4% of health expenditure in developing countries and 1-2% in rich countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The World Health Organization (WHO) stresses the importance of the triad composed by the&#xD;
      patient and his family, the community and health professionals. Results are possible only&#xD;
      when these three components work together for the same purpose. Many studies show the benefit&#xD;
      of people's involvement in care in rich and developing countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPICES project builds on progress in HIV / AIDS treatment in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and&#xD;
      chronic disease management through the Innovative Care for Chronic Conditions (ICCC&#xD;
      Framework), WHO plan. With regard to HIV treatment, these interventions have proven to be&#xD;
      effective and cost-effective in many SSA countries, both in terms of disease control and&#xD;
      adherence. These data on communicable and infectious diseases seem to be transferable to&#xD;
      non-communicable diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These projects were born from the observation that the model of care of the rich countries&#xD;
      (individual approach of the patient, centered on the hospital and the specialist with a&#xD;
      regular clinical and paraclinical follow-up) could not be transposed to the developing&#xD;
      countries, because the limitation of human, technical and financial resources. But also that&#xD;
      this model was becoming more and more difficult to maintain in developed countries or&#xD;
      resources become limited. New approaches need to be developed to increase the effectiveness&#xD;
      of health systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A paradigm shift is needed to improve the control of CVD with greater cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SPICES project incorporates the most up-to-date knowledge to improve the prevention and&#xD;
      control of CVD in high-, middle- and low-income countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rich countries and developing countries are therefore involved in the study. The selected&#xD;
      sites are France, United Kingdom, Belgium, South Africa and Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some main axes of the ICCC Framework will be developed in SPICES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improve the efficiency of health professionals through the delegation of skills and&#xD;
           appropriate training,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  center care around the patient and his family and more generally his caregivers,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  simplify the monitoring and treatment protocols,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  support patients in their community and emphasize prevention, information and patient&#xD;
           education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A first step of observation in the various countries made it possible to make an inventory of&#xD;
      fixtures and to target the most adapted interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following steps are the implementation of these interventions (delegation of skills,&#xD;
      information campaign and screening, improve the availability of treatments, measure of&#xD;
      strengthening of compliance, etc. ..) and their evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study, carried out in France and integrated into the SPICES project, will test the best&#xD;
      non-pharmacological interventions selected in the community and by the community.&#xD;
