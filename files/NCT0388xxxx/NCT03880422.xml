    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well nutrition and exercise interventions work in reducing androgen&#xD;
      deprivation therapy-induced obese frailty in prostate cancer survivors. Individualized&#xD;
      nutrition and exercise advice for prostate cancer patients on androgen deprivation therapy&#xD;
      may help to reduce obese frailty and change the levels of myokines in blood.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the effect of individualized nutrition and exercise counseling interventions on&#xD;
      myokine expression and body composition in prostate cancer (PrCa) patients being treated with&#xD;
      androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine any changes in muscle strength, respiratory muscle strength and functional&#xD;
      capacity resulting from the nutrition and exercise counseling interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine any changes in myokines, circulating inflammatory and frailty-associated&#xD;
      cytokines resulting from the nutrition and exercise counseling interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the effect of the study interventions on dietary intake, physical activity,&#xD;
      fatigue, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Correlate changes in secondary objectives with prostate specific antigen (PSA) and&#xD;
      testosterone levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate adherence to nutrition and exercise advice. III. Evaluate assessment tools and&#xD;
      recruiting strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive an individualized diet plan for 6 months. Patients complete an&#xD;
      individualized home-based exercise program aerobic and resistance exercise over 10-30 minutes&#xD;
      per day, at minimum 3 days per week for 6 months, and a progressive resistance exercise&#xD;
      program including an individually tailored prescription targeting the chest, shoulders, arms,&#xD;
      and leg musculature for 1-4 sets of 10-15 repetitions, 5 days per week over 6 months.&#xD;
      Patients also attend monthly educational meetings for 6 months.&#xD;

As exploratory analyses, the association between the change in each outcome and demographic/clinical factors may be evaluated using general linear models. The change in outcome will be modeled as a function of baseline levels and each demographic/clinical factor in a one-at-a-time manner.</description>
