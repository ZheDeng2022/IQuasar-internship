      Background &amp; Objective: Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) is known to improve strength and&#xD;
      endurance of inspiratory muscles. However, clinical beneficial effects of IMT for patients&#xD;
      with chronic respiratory disease remain inconclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of the study are to investigate in patients with chronic respiratory disease:&#xD;
      (Year 1) main (diaphragm) and accessory inspiratory muscle (sternocleidomastoid muscle)&#xD;
      activation pattern during various IMT loading using group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM);&#xD;
      and (Year 2) effectiveness of individualized IMT program (based on results of Year 1) on&#xD;
      clinical outcomes. Methods: (Year 1) Patients with chronic respiratory disease with&#xD;
      inspiratory muscle weakness will be recruited for the study. Patients will perform 3&#xD;
      inspiratory loading tests (15%, 30%, and 50% of maximum inspiratory pressures) on 3 separate&#xD;
      days with the sequence will be randomized. Surface electromyography (EMG) of diaphragm and&#xD;
      sternocleidomastoid muscle will be used to use inspiratory muscle activation during various&#xD;
      conditions. Other outcomes include maximum inspiratory pressure, and functional exercise&#xD;
      capacity will be measured. Inspiratory muscle activation will be used for GBTM analysis.&#xD;
      Patient will then be trained with individualized IMT program based on the GBTM analysis input&#xD;
      form results of Year 1.&#xD;
