  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adequate brain blood flow is essential for brain survival and function. Brain blood flow is&#xD;
      kept relatively constant by a process called cerebral autoregulation (CA). CA is impaired in&#xD;
      various diseases including head injury, diabetes, Alzheimer's, pre-eclampsia and stroke. In&#xD;
      stroke, impaired CA is associated with poor outcomes. A transient ischaemic attack (TIA) is&#xD;
      the same as a stroke, except the symptoms only last for a short amount of time and resolve&#xD;
      spontaneously. TIAs are sometimes called mini-strokes and are a major warning sign of&#xD;
      strokes. There have been lots of studies of CA in stroke, but very few studies of CA in TIA.&#xD;
      Brain blood flow and CA can be studied non-invasively with Transcranial Doppler ultrasound&#xD;
      (TCD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aim: To investigate whether CA is impaired in patients with TIA&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 patients with acute TIA (within 7 days), and 20 healthy controls will be recruited from&#xD;
      the specialist TIA clinic at University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust. Participants will&#xD;
      be eligible if they are aged over 18 and can consent to participate. They won't be able to&#xD;
      participate if they have severe heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, blocked neck blood&#xD;
      vessels, severe breathing problems, or if they are pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo an assessment of brain blood flow using TCD, during which their&#xD;
      heart rate, breathing and blood pressure will also be monitored. During the assessment&#xD;
      participants will sit quietly before being asked to stand and then complete a squat-stand&#xD;
      manoeuvre in time with a computer sequence. The research visit will take approximately 90&#xD;
      minutes, the assessment itself will take approximately 1 hour and participants only need to&#xD;
      attend once.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Adequate brain blood flow is essential for brain survival and function. Brain blood flow is&#xD;
      kept relatively constant by a process called cerebral autoregulation (CA). CA is impaired in&#xD;
      various diseases including head injury, diabetes, Alzheimer's dementia, pre-eclampsia and&#xD;
      stroke. In stroke, impaired CA is associated with early deterioration and the need for&#xD;
      emergency surgery to relieve brain swelling. Impaired CA in stroke has also been shown to be&#xD;
      related to stroke severity and functional outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A transient ischaemic attack (TIA), also known as a mini-stroke, is the same as a stroke,&#xD;
      except that the symptoms only last for a short amount of time and resolve spontaneously.&#xD;
      Every year at least 46,000 people in the United Kingdom have a TIA for the first time. TIA is&#xD;
      strongly predictive of future stroke, and the risk is heavily front loaded; one in 12 people&#xD;
      will have a full stroke within a week of having a TIA. Prompt assessment following a TIA&#xD;
      helps to reduce this risk. Indeed, urgently investigating and treating people who have a TIA&#xD;
      in a specialist clinic reduces their risk of another stroke by 80%. However, some people will&#xD;
      unfortunately go on to have a stroke despite this, and the reasons for this are not always&#xD;
      clear. Furthermore, although TIAs fully resolve, around 70% of people report long term&#xD;
      effects after a TIA including memory loss, tiredness and low mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain blood flow and CA can be studied using ultrasound which is passed through the skull,&#xD;
      known as Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (or TCD). Ultrasound has been tried and tested&#xD;
      over many years and unlike CT or MRI scans, does not use any radiation. It is also&#xD;
      inexpensive, and can be used in patients with pacemakers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to study CA, it is necessary to see what happens to brain blood flow when there are&#xD;
      changes in blood pressure. Although some people have natural ups and downs in their blood&#xD;
      pressure at rest, these are not always big enough to study brain blood flow effectively.&#xD;
      Larger changes in blood pressure can be induced with challenges such as placing hands in ice&#xD;
      cold water, or inflating large blood pressure cuffs on the tops of the legs before suddenly&#xD;
      releasing them. These can be uncomfortable for participants. More recently, squat-stand&#xD;
      manoeuvres (SSMs) have also been shown to produce large changes in blood pressure. They have&#xD;
      been shown to be safe and well tolerated in various populations including heart transplant&#xD;
      recipients, young and old healthy controls, and patients with Alzheimer's dementia. It has&#xD;
      recently been shown that reliable CA data can be obtained from as few as three SSMs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been lots of studies of CA in stroke, but very few studies of CA in TIA. The small&#xD;
      studies that are available are conflicting about whether brain blood flow and CA are altered&#xD;
      in TIA. The aim of this study is therefore to investigate whether CA is impaired in patients&#xD;
      with TIA. If CA is impaired in patients with TIA, then it may be possible to identify&#xD;
      abnormalities in brain blood flow that can help predict who might go on to suffer a stroke,&#xD;
      or suffer other complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-centre, case-control study being undertaken at the University Hospitals of&#xD;
      Leicester NHS Trust.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once ethical approvals, and all relevant sponsorship and regulatory approvals, are in place&#xD;
      20 patients with acute TIA (within 7 days of event), and 20 healthy controls will be&#xD;
      recruited from the specialist TIA clinic at University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust.&#xD;
      Medical records will be reviewed by the direct care team to ensure participants meet the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. Participants will be eligible if they are aged over 18 and&#xD;
      can consent to participate. They won't be able to participate if they have severe heart&#xD;
      failure, an irregular heartbeat, blocked neck blood vessels, severe breathing problems, or if&#xD;
      they are pregnant. Eligibility screening will only be undertaken by the direct clinical care&#xD;
      team for potential participants. Participants will be approached at their clinical&#xD;
      consultation in the specialist TIA clinic by consultants, registrars or specialist nurses to&#xD;
      determine study interest prior to referral to the researcher and provision of study specific&#xD;
      information. A poster advertising the study will be displayed in the TIA clinic waiting room.&#xD;
      Both participants with TIA, and healthy controls (those without a diagnosis of TIA) will be&#xD;
      recruited from the clinic. Healthy spouses, friends or partners of patients with TIA will be&#xD;
      asked if they would like to participate in the study as a healthy control subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who meet the inclusion criteria will attend the Leicester Cerebral Haemodynamics&#xD;
      in Ageing and Stroke Medicine (CHiASM) research laboratory. Formal, written consent will be&#xD;
      obtained, followed by an ultrasound check of their brain blood flow. In approximately 5-37%&#xD;
      of patients we are not able to perform the ultrasound procedure as the blood vessels cannot&#xD;
      be seen through the skull, which would prevent them from enrolling into the study. Following&#xD;
      this, background information on age, sex, medical conditions, and medication use will be&#xD;
      collected. The Edinburgh handedness inventory will be completed to determine left or right&#xD;
      hand dominance, and the office of National Statistics questionnaire to determine ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then undergo an assessment of brain blood flow using TCD, with two small&#xD;
      ultrasound probes held in place on the temples with a customised headframe. During the&#xD;
      assessment, heart rate, breathing and blood pressure will also be monitored. Heart rate will&#xD;
      be monitored using a 3 lead ECG, blood pressure will be monitored using a cuff on the finger&#xD;
      with the arm supported in a sling, and breathing will be monitored using nasal tubes. The&#xD;
      assessment will consist of three recordings. Firstly, participants will sit quietly for 5&#xD;
      minutes. Next, they will be asked to sit quietly for one minute before standing and remaining&#xD;
      standing for 5 minutes. Lastly, they will be asked to stand and then complete a squat-stand&#xD;
      manoeuvre in time with a computer sequence. A tilt sensor will be attached to the thigh to&#xD;
      measure the efficiency and angle of the squatting motion. The squat-stand manoeuvre will&#xD;
      consist of 15 squats and participants will be informed that they should try and complete all&#xD;
      15 squats if possible. However, if they wish to stop before this, they should make the&#xD;
      investigator aware during a standing period and remain standing for 90 seconds before the&#xD;
      equipment is disconnected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research visit will take approximately 90 minutes, the assessment itself will take&#xD;
      approximately 1 hour and participants only need to attend once.&#xD;
