  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventilation limitation has a significant adverse effects on cardiovascular function and&#xD;
      cerebral oxygenation during exercise in patients with COPD. High flow nasal cannula (HFNC)&#xD;
      has been shown to improve ventilation by washing out the anatomical dead space and permitting&#xD;
      a better gas exchanges. Moreover, it is able to ensure the desired inspired oxygen fraction&#xD;
      (FiO2) even at high level of patient's minute ventilation by minimizing the room air&#xD;
      entrainment. The effects of HFNC on exercise performance in terms of hemodynamic changes and&#xD;
      exercise endurance in COPD patients remain unclear. The primary purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      examine the effects of HFNC on the exercise endurance in COPD patients. The investigator's&#xD;
      secondary purpose is to investigate whether HFNC could improve efficiency of ventilation,&#xD;
      leading to an improvement of hemodynamic and cerebral oxygenation response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized crossover study. Patients who have been diagnosed as COPD will be&#xD;
      recruited from outpatient department. After signing informed consent form, patients undertake&#xD;
      an incremental exercise test and two constant load exercise at the 70% of maximum workload&#xD;
      achieved at a previous incremental exercise test on arm ergometer in two separate days. The&#xD;
      constant load tests will be performed with HFNC and with nasal cannula at the same inhaled&#xD;
      oxygen fraction in random order. The hemodynamics CO, SV, EF of all subjects during exercises&#xD;
      will be measured by a bioelectrical impedance device (Physioflow), and cerebral oxygenation&#xD;
      status (oxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb), deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb), total hemoglobin (tHb)&#xD;
      was measured by a near infrared spectrophotometer (NIRS).&#xD;
