      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), fat accumulates in the liver and can cause&#xD;
      damage. Researchers want to learn what causes the damage NAFLD, and to see if a medication&#xD;
      can help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find out how the liver in people with NAFLD responds to feeding, and how this relates to&#xD;
      their response to the drug semaglutide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with NAFLD and healthy volunteers ages 18 and older&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging: A machine will take pictures of the participant s body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 2-8 weeks of enrollment, participants will stay in the clinic for several days. This&#xD;
      includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, urine, heart, and imaging tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      For NAFLD participants only: A needle-like device will remove a small biopsy of the liver and&#xD;
      fatty tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be alone in a special room for 5 hours. They will breathe through a tube&#xD;
      under the nostrils. They will have blood drawn several times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline visit concludes participation for healthy volunteers but NAFLD participants will&#xD;
      contine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 6 weeks after discharge, participants will stay in the clinic again and repeat the&#xD;
      tests. They will get their first semaglutide dose by injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have visits weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 of treatment. Visits&#xD;
      include blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will inject semaglutide once a week at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At week 30, participants will stay in the clinic again and repeat the tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a final visit 12 weeks after stopping treatment. This includes blood&#xD;
      and urine tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progressive form, non-alcoholic&#xD;
      steatohepatitis (NASH), are leading causes of liver injury and are tightly associated with&#xD;
      obesity, diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. Despite recent advances, there is still a&#xD;
      considerable knowledge gap regarding the fundamental pathogenic mechanisms, and especially&#xD;
      regarding the transition from benign steatosis to steatohepatitis. Although NAFLD reflects&#xD;
      disordered energy metabolism in the liver, little information exists on the response of the&#xD;
      human liver to the acute caloric load of a meal. We hypothesize, based on preliminary&#xD;
      non-invasive results, that in patients with NAFLD, an oral carbohydrate load results in&#xD;
      preferential de novo lipogenesis (due to selective insulin resistance) and generation of&#xD;
      fatty acids (FA). We further hypothesize a spillover effect, wherein NASH patients have an&#xD;
      impairment of the hepatic ability to esterify the load of FA to triglycerides (TG) compared&#xD;
      to patients with steatosis, resulting in accumulation of lipotoxic intermediary metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) have demonstrated significant benefit in the treatment of&#xD;
      diabetes and obesity. Liraglutide was shown in a prospective trial to improve NASH histology&#xD;
      and other GLP-1RA have shown benefit in secondary analyses, consistent with a class effect.&#xD;
      However, response rates to GLP-1RA, as well as to other pharmacological interventions in&#xD;
      NAFLD, have not exceeded 50%, and there are no adequate baseline predictors of response that&#xD;
      could allow for selection of subjects for personalized treatment. Given that GLP-1RAs exert&#xD;
      their main activity in the post-prandial state, it is plausible that post-prandial parameters&#xD;
      may be more effective in predicting treatment response and can shed light on its mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aims in this study are (1) to assess the hepatic response to an acute oral carbohydrate&#xD;
      load; (2) to identify which baseline parameters can predict the clinical response of NAFLD&#xD;
      patients to a course of semaglutide, a novel GLP-1RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a non-randomized, single-center, pilot exploratory study in which up to 32&#xD;
      subjects with NAFLD (16) or NASH (16) will initially undergo two liver biopsies, one in the&#xD;
      fasting state and one performed 2 hours after an oral 75g glucose load (OGTT biopsy). Tissue&#xD;
      samples obtained will be subjected to a comparative, paired analysis of gene expression,&#xD;
      protein phosphorylation in key signaling pathways, composition of tissue lipid species and&#xD;
      oxidative stress. Subjects will be treated with semaglutide (escalated to 1 mg/week) for 30&#xD;
      weeks in all subjects, and their clinical response will be assessed by ALT and 1H-Magnetic&#xD;
      resonance spectroscopy and a final (3rd) liver biopsy. Clinical responders will be compared&#xD;
      to non-responders with regards to their baseline fasting and post-prandial parameters, to&#xD;
      identify predictors of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human hepatic response to a meal has never been studied at the tissue level and the&#xD;
      findings of this study are likely to generate important data and clarify some of the&#xD;
      fundamental questions regarding mechanisms of injury and insulin resistance. Furthermore, our&#xD;
      study aims at identifying predictors of response to GLP-1RA and allow for appropriate&#xD;
      selection of subjects for this class of medications, as well as to shed light on mechanism of&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
