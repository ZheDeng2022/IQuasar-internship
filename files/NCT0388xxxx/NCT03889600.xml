  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 27 million Americans are diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), and their&#xD;
      health outcomes, including hospitalization, emergency department use, and hospital&#xD;
      readmission, are largely driven by social determinants; diabetes complications are largely&#xD;
      attributable to unmet health-related social needs. Investigators will conduct a pilot&#xD;
      feasibility trial of the Re-Engineered Discharge for Diabetes-Computer Adaptive Testing&#xD;
      (REDD-CAT) system to inform the design of a future, fully-powered randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial. REDD-CAT will allow clinical staff to preemptively link patients with community-based&#xD;
      social services tailored to meet their unique needs in order to reduce avoidable&#xD;
      hospitalization and emergency department visits.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will conduct a pilot study with 30 patients to evaluate the feasibility and&#xD;
      limited efficacy of the REDD-CAT social service screening and referral intervention to inform&#xD;
      the design of a fully-powered trial. The study will determine the feasibility of delivering&#xD;
      the REDD-CAT intervention in a clinical, point-of-care context to inform the design and&#xD;
      implementation strategy for a fully powered clinical trial. It is not the purpose of this&#xD;
      pilot clinical trial to determine sample size for a larger, fully-powered trial, as&#xD;
      investigators already have data from prior readmissions research supporting sample size and&#xD;
      power estimates using readmission rates as a primary outcome measure. After obtaining&#xD;
      informed consent from a participant and gathering baseline data, the study research assistant&#xD;
      (RA) will send a flag in the electronic medical record (EMR) to notify the nurse care manager&#xD;
      that a patient has enrolled in the REDD-CAT pilot. The nurse care manager will then&#xD;
      incorporate the administration of the REDD-CAT to the patient as part of standard care&#xD;
      discharge planning. He or she will utilize the REDD-CAT results report as a guideline for&#xD;
      generating appropriate referrals to address unmet social needs identified. To inform&#xD;
      secondary measure selection for a future larger study, the RA will administer to enrolled&#xD;
      patients a number of standardized measures, including the PHQ-9, GAD-7, Ways of Coping&#xD;
      Questionnaire, and Diabetes Distress Scale. All baseline measures will be re-administered at&#xD;
      30-day follow-up to patients via the telephone. Data on hospitalizations and ED visits during&#xD;
      the 30-day period post-discharge will be obtained from patients' medical records, and all&#xD;
      data gathered will be stored in a REDCap electronic database.&#xD;
