    <description>Regimen for treatment consists of irinotecan (180 mg/m2 as a 120-min IV infusion for UGT1A1 genotyping (TA6/TA6) and UGT1A1 genotyping (TA6/TA7); 120 mg/m2 as a 120-min IV infusion for UGT1A1 genotyping (TA7/TA7)), followed by Leucovorin (400 mg/m2 IV infusion over 2 hours), and fluorouracil (5-FU) (2800 mg/m2 IV infusion over a 46-hour period), repeated every 2 weeks.&#xD;
After every 2 cycles of each different dose of irinotecan, if adverse events (AEs) are under the grade 2, we will escalate the dose of 30 mg/m2. The estimated maximal dose of irinotecan is 260 mg/m2 for UGT1A1 genotyping (TA6/TA6); 240 mg/m2 for UGT1A1 genotyping (TA6/TA7); 180 mg/m2 for UGT1A1 genotyping (TA7/TA7).&#xD;
Regorafenib is administered at adjusted dosage of 120 mg daily for 3 weeks in a 4-week cycle.</description>
