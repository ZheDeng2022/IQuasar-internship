    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended&#xD;
      phase 2 dose (RP2D), safety and toxicity, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ixazomib administered&#xD;
      intravenously in combination with multiagent reinduction chemotherapy in pediatric&#xD;
      participants with relapsed/refractory ALL or LLy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      29-Apr-2020 Enrollment of new patients into this study has been paused due to the COVID-19&#xD;
      situation. The duration of this pause is dependent on the leveling and control of the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug being tested in this study is called Ixazomib. Ixazomib is being tested to determine&#xD;
      the MTD or RP2D of intravenous ixazomib when administered in combination with multiagent&#xD;
      chemotherapy (reinduction therapy) in pediatric participants with relapsed or refractory ALL&#xD;
      or relapsed/refractory LLy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 18 participants. Doses of ixazomib will be escalated&#xD;
      according to a standard 3+3 dose escalation schema. Participants aged &gt;= 1 year will receive&#xD;
      the starting dose of 1.0 mg/m^2 and participants aged &lt;1 year will receive the starting dose&#xD;
      of 0.03 mg/kg. Ixazomib will be administered in combination with multiagent reinduction&#xD;
      therapy. The dose escalation phase will determine the MTD and/or RP2D of ixazomib. Dose&#xD;
      escalation will be based on the observed safety and tolerability data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants aged &lt;1 year will be assessed separately and will not contribute to the dose&#xD;
      escalation assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States and Spain. The overall time to&#xD;
      participate in this study is approximately 30 months. Participants will be followed up to Day&#xD;
      60 after the first dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.&#xD;

    <description>DLT: Grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity after first dose of ixazomib and is probably/definitely attributable to the ixazomib treatment regimen, with exceptions, example fever/infection with/without hospitalization, fatigue and gastrointestinal symptoms, hypofibrinogenemia, metabolic/laboratory abnormalities that resolve to less than or equal to(&lt;=)Grade 2 within 7 days. Any Grade 3/4 nonhematologic toxicity after first dose of ixazomib that is possibly/probably/definitely attributable to the ixazomib treatment regimen and results in omission of subsequent dose of chemotherapy, with exception of fever/infection. Hematologic toxicities: Failure to recover a peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥0.5*10^9 per liter (/L) and a platelet count ≥50*10^9/L due to documented bone marrow hypoplasia (cellularity &lt;10 20%) within 42 days after the beginning of systemic chemotherapy without evidence of active disease by bone marrow evaluation or active infection.</description>
