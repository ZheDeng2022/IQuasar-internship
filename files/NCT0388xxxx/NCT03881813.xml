  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates effectiveness of two types of fixed retainers in post orthodontic&#xD;
      patients. Half of the subjects are randomly allocated Group 1 retainer (FRC) and other half&#xD;
      is given Group 2 retainer (MSW) and followed for a period of one year.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      54 subjects were recruited and divided into two groups by random allocation. Consents were&#xD;
      obtained . Group 1 received fiber reinforced composite retainer and group 2 received&#xD;
      multistranded stainless steel wire retainer. The patients were recalled at every three months&#xD;
      interval for a period of 12 months. They were evaluated for number of fractures, failure&#xD;
      pattern based on adhesive remnant index and relapse tendency by measuring little's&#xD;
      irregularity index.&#xD;
