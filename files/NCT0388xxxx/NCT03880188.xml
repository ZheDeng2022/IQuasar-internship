  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the use of free autologous dermal fat grafting (also called free&#xD;
      dermal fat autografting) to treat complex craniofacial wounds that have failed standard&#xD;
      treatment and to understand how well these grafts work to repair wounds long term. Patients&#xD;
      who have undergone free autologous dermal fat grafting to treat complex craniofacial wounds&#xD;
      2-30 years ago will have photographs and small biopsies taken of the area that was grafted.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Complex craniofacial wounds (CCW) are those considered to be refractory to initial&#xD;
      reconstructive and antibiotic treatment and may involve chronic infection, exposed hardware,&#xD;
      irradiated local tissue, and soft tissue volume loss. They are a functional, aesthetic,&#xD;
      quality-of-life, and economic burden and have many aetiologies and impact patients of all&#xD;
      ages from diverse socio-economic and geographical backgrounds. The present study will&#xD;
      evaluate if free dermal fat autografts (DFA) can serve as a less involved, more dynamic&#xD;
      approach than the standard of microvascular flaps to facilitate healing and reconstruction&#xD;
      for CCW. A previous 33-year retrospective study of free DFA for CCW indicated recipient graft&#xD;
      sites healed and remained volume-stable in most patients. To evaluate the long-term viability&#xD;
      of this modality, clinical and histological assessments of free DFA recipient and undisturbed&#xD;
      tissue at donor sites will be carried out in patients from the original cohort. In the&#xD;
      present study, it will be first determined if free DFA continues to provide stable long-term&#xD;
      outcomes for prevention of infection and hardware exposure and stable volume and contour&#xD;
      results. Then, it will be determined if free DFA recipient sites retain normal, expected&#xD;
      histology and immune cells (dermal lymphocytes, macrophages, and mast cells). Finally, it&#xD;
      will be evaluated if the long-term free DFA recipient site tissues are significantly&#xD;
      different from undisturbed tissue at donor sites with respect to the presence of adipose&#xD;
      tissue and populations of immune cells. The present study will be the first to (1) evaluate&#xD;
      the long-term fate of free DFA recipient sites in this complex craniofacial wounds, (2)&#xD;
      determine the presence of immune cells within free DFA recipient sites, and (3) compare the&#xD;
      long-term differences of free DFA recipient and undisturbed tissue at donor sites. Outcomes&#xD;
      from this project will serve as the basis of understanding of free DFA survival and function&#xD;
      in treating CCW and provide an investigative framework for more rigorous follow-up studies to&#xD;
      define indications and refine techniques for free DFA use in this context and more generally.&#xD;
