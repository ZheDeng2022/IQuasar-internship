  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed studies will assess 1) the mechanisms for the age-related increase in&#xD;
      fatigability during dynamic exercise (Aims 1 and 2) and 2) the effectiveness of high-velocity&#xD;
      resistance training coupled with blood flow restriction (BFR) in improving muscle power&#xD;
      output and fatigability in older adults (Aim 3). The first two aims are cross-sectional&#xD;
      studies comparing young (18-35 years old) and older adults (≥65 yrs old) to test our central&#xD;
      hypothesis that the greater accumulation of metabolites and increase in fatigability in older&#xD;
      adults is due to either age-related impairments in skeletal muscle bioenergetics (Aim 1)&#xD;
      and/or vascular dysfunction (Aim 2). These two aims will integrate techniques to assess&#xD;
      whole-muscle bioenergetics (31P-MRS) and in vivo vascular function (near infrared&#xD;
      spectroscopy; NIRS and doppler ultrasonography) with in vitro assessment of single fiber&#xD;
      bioenergetics (epifluorescence microscopy) and vasoreactivity of isolated skeletal muscle&#xD;
      arterioles (video microscopy). We will then determine whether bioenergetics, vascular&#xD;
      function and fatigability are altered in older men and women in response to 8 weeks of&#xD;
      resistance exercise training of the lower limb both with and without blood flow restriction&#xD;
      (Aim 3).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Exercise Training Intervention: The older adult subjects that were recruited for the cross-sectional studies will then be asked to return to perform 8 weeks of resistance exercise training on each leg. The exercise will involve low-load, high-velocity power training of the knee extensor muscles. One of the legs will be counterbalanced based on strength to either exercise with blood flow restriction (BFR), while the other leg will exercise without BFR. Before and after the 8 weeks of training subjects will undergo the same measurements in the cross-sectional studies to assess fatigability, skeletal muscle bioenergetics and vascular function of each leg.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Muscle Biopsies: An area of vastus lateralis will numbed by injection with local anesthetic. A small 1/4 inch incision will be made in the skin and a needle inserted briefly into the muscle to remove a piece of muscle about the size of a pencil eraser. The incision is pulled closed with a bandage and the area over the incision will be covered with an elastic pressure bandage. The whole muscle biopsy procedure will take a total of approximately 15 minutes, with the actual biopsy lasting only a few seconds. The biopsy samples will be stored for analyses and used to examine various aspects of skeletal muscle health.</description>
