      This is a single-center trial in subjects with pancreatic cancer and other advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors. It is an open-label, single arm dose escalation Phase IB trial with subjects accrued&#xD;
      in a 3 subject dose escalation cohort. Subjects with treated advanced solid tumors, and&#xD;
      showing disease progression on established standard therapy, will be enrolled in this trial.&#xD;

      additional subjects will be treated at the presumptive maximum effective cohort dose/schedule&#xD;

    <description>C3 (Metformin, Simvastatin and Digoxin) will be dosed each day of a 28 calendar day cycle. The starting dose level will be increased with each cohort. There are 3 cohorts. Upon reaching maximum tolerated dose, an expansion cohort will be opened. Cohort 1 - Metformin 850mg po/day, Simvastatin 5mg po/day, Digoxin 0.0625 mg po/day. Cohort 2 - Metformin 850 mg po/day for two weeks and 1,700 mg po/day for next two weeks, Simvastatin 20 mg po/day, Digoxin 0.25 mg po/day. Cohort 3 - Metformin 850 mg po/day for two weeks and 1,700 mg po/day for next two weeks, Simvastatin 40 mg po/day, Digoxin 0.25 mg po/day for two weeks, 0.375 mg po/day for the next two weeks for cycle 1. Subjects will receive 0.50 mg po/day in Cohort 3, Cycle 2 and beyond. Metformin to be taken at Breakfast and Dinner time (as applicable), Simvastatin at Bed time and Digoxin in the Morning.</description>
