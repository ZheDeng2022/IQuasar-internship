      Thyroid nodules are a common presentation in the clinic, with an increasing incidence,&#xD;
      especially in women. Their clinical significance is mainly related to excluding malignancy&#xD;
      (4.0 to 6.5% of all thyroid nodules).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid nodule is a discrete lesion in the thyroid gland that is radiologically distinct from&#xD;
      the surrounding thyroid parenchyma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thyroid nodules are a common presentation in the clinic, with an increasing incidence,&#xD;
      especially in women. The detection rate among healthy individuals is as high as 50%-60%, but&#xD;
      the reported incidence of malignant nodules in all thyroid nodules has ranged from only&#xD;
      1.6%-12%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They are discovered either clinically on self-palpation by a patient, or during a physical&#xD;
      examination by the clinician or incidentally during a radiologic procedure such as&#xD;
      ultrasonography (US) imaging, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of&#xD;
      the neck; with the increased use of sensitive imaging techniques, thyroid nodules are being&#xD;
      diagnosed incidentally with increasing frequency in the recent years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though thyroid nodules are common, their clinical significance is mainly related to excluding&#xD;
      malignancy (4.0 to 6.5% of all thyroid nodules), evaluating their functional status and if&#xD;
      they cause pressure symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thyroid nodules can be caused by many disorders:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benign (colloid nodule, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, simple or hemorrhagic cyst, follicular&#xD;
      adenoma and subacute thyroiditis) and malignant (Papillary Cancer, Follicular Cancer, Hurthle&#xD;
      Cell Cancer, Anaplastic Cancer, Medullary Cancer, Thyroid Lymphoma and metastases).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial assessment of a patient found to have a thyroid nodule either clinically or&#xD;
      incidentally should include a detailed and relevant history plus physical examination.&#xD;
      Laboratory tests should begin with measurement of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).&#xD;
      Thyroid scintigraphy/radionuclide thyroid scan should be performed in patients presenting&#xD;
      with a low serum TSH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thyroid ultrasound should be performed in all those suspected or known to have a nodule to&#xD;
      confirm the presence of a nodule, evaluate for additional nodules and cervical lymph nodes&#xD;
      and assess for suspicious sonographic features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The next step in the evaluation of a thyroid nodule is a fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy,&#xD;
      which is the gold standard diagnostic test.&#xD;
