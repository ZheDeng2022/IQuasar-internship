  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized open-label Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety and toxicity of gene&#xD;
      therapy using a recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) containing the human&#xD;
      lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 isoform B (LAMP2B) transgene (investigational product&#xD;
      (IP), RP-A501) in male patients with Danon Disease (DD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a non-randomized open-label Phase I clinical trial to characterize the safety&#xD;
      and toxicity associated with infusion of a recombinant adeno-associated serotype 9 (rAAV9)&#xD;
      capsid containing the human lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 isoform B (LAMP2B)&#xD;
      transgene (investigational product (IP), RP-A501) in male patients with Danon Disease (DD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of the study, approximately 7-10 male subjects age 8 and over will receive&#xD;
      a single intravenous (IV) infusion of the IP. Prior to infusion of IP, rituximab and&#xD;
      sirolimus will be administered prophylactically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are planned to be followed for 36 months after investigational product&#xD;
      administration. After the end of the follow-up period, patients will enter a Long-Term&#xD;
      Follow-Up (LTFU) study enabling follow-up for an additional 2 to 5 years post-IP&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also enable an initial evaluation of whether or not the IP results in&#xD;
      cardiomyocyte and skeletal muscle transduction and gene expression and preliminary assessment&#xD;
      of the extent of cardiomyocyte and histologic correction. Additionally, a preliminary&#xD;
      evaluation of clinical stabilization following infusion will also be made.&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Any concomitant medical or psychiatric condition that in the opinion of the&#xD;

             acceptable risk for study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Active hematologic or solid organ malignancy, not including non-melanoma skin cancer&#xD;
             or other carcinoma in situ. Patients with previously resected solid organ malignancies&#xD;
