  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn the long term efficacy and side effects associated with&#xD;
      utilizing Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) radiation for prostate cancer utilizing&#xD;
      the Elekta Versa or Agility System. SBRT uses advanced imaging techniques to deliver targeted&#xD;
      radiation to a tumor. The Elekta Versa and Agility Systems are approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Association (FDA) for SBRT treatment of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for prostate carcinoma is typically done&#xD;
      over the course of approximately 42-45 daily treatments SBRT is a way to condense this&#xD;
      treatment into a course of 5 treatments, delivering more dose per day.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in men, and ranks second in estimated&#xD;
      deaths. The current standard of care for localized prostate cancer consists of observation,&#xD;
      surgery or radiation therapy. From a radiation perspective, accepted options include external&#xD;
      beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, or a combination of those. Acceptable external beam&#xD;
      radiation options are further defined as conventionally fractionated (over approximately 8-9&#xD;
      weeks), or moderately hypo-fractionated (over approximately 4-6 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a newer technique, allowing treatment to be&#xD;
      delivered in an extremely hypo-fractionated regimen (i.e. in 5 fractions). Current consensus&#xD;
      guidelines describe SBRT as &quot;a cautious alternative to conventionally fractionated regimens&#xD;
      at clinics with appropriate technology, physics, and clinical expertise.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of any therapy is to maximize the effect of that treatment on cancer cells and&#xD;
      minimize any effect on normal tissue. In radiation therapy, this is mainly done through dose&#xD;
      targeting (i.e. limiting the radiation dose to the targets and minimizing dose to normal&#xD;
      surrounding organs). Advancements in radiation therapy have allowed for better targeting,&#xD;
      resulting in shrinking margins of treatment around cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapeutic window can also be optimized through the use of fractionation (i.e. amount of&#xD;
      dose delivered per day) in radiation therapy. Since cancerous and normal tissue cells respond&#xD;
      differently to changes in fractionation, the therapeutic window could theoretically be&#xD;
      improved by choosing a fractionation pattern to which cancer cells are more sensitive.&#xD;
      Historical generalizations put cancer cells into the category of early responding tissues,&#xD;
      which would make them more sensitive to cell death when radiation is delivered in a&#xD;
      protracted fractionation pattern, such as over 8-9 weeks of radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, studies have emerged which suggest that prostate cancer is unlike other cancers and&#xD;
      reactive more like late responding tissues. With that in mind, prostate cancer cells could be&#xD;
      more sensitive to high doses per fraction, which could provide a radiobiological advantage&#xD;
      and a greater therapeutic window with the use of SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very promising early results utilizing SBRT for prostate cancer treatment have been described&#xD;
      in the literature, and multiple ongoing phase 3 trials are underway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aside from a potential therapeutic advantage, SBRT also offers a more cost effective solution&#xD;
      to patients with prostate cancer, with less impact on their daily lives (only needing to come&#xD;
      in for 5 treatments instead of 40-45 treatments).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much of the literature on SBRT has been done utilizing the CyberKnife system. But the Elekta&#xD;
      Versa HD and Agility Systems available at Hoag provides a unique opportunity for faster&#xD;
      treatment delivery and 4D imaging during treatment. The Elekta Versa HD and Agility systems&#xD;
      are approved by the FDA for SBRT treatment of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to investigate biochemical failure rates for patients treated with SBRT&#xD;
      utilizing Elekta machines, as well as obtain quality of life data and assess the&#xD;
      intrafraction motion in approximately 15 patients for 5 years following SBRT.&#xD;
