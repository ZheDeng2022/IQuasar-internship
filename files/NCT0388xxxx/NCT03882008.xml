  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate if baseline levels of T cell associated&#xD;
      biomarkers predict efficacy of abatacept during 24 weeks of treatment in patients with&#xD;
      moderate to severe active Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) who have had an inadequate response to&#xD;
      conventional disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (cDMARDs)&#xD;
