  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was being conducted in order to assess the pharmacokinetics and the safety of&#xD;
      elafibranor following once daily administration of two dose levels of elafibranor (80&#xD;
      milligrams [mg] and 120mg) during 3 months in children and adolescent population (8 to 17&#xD;
      years of age) with non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Due to lack of efficacy (but not due to safety) in a Phase 3 trial of elafibranor in adult&#xD;
    participants with NASH and fibrosis, this study in pediatric NASH was prematurely terminated&#xD;

    <description>The BMI for a given age (in years) and gender (male) was converted to an exact z-score. Given a participant's age, sex, BMI, and an appropriate reference standard, a BMI Z-score was determined. BMI Z-score &gt;=85th percentile was considered as overweight. Z-score was a statistical measure to describe whether a mean was above or below the standard. A Z-score of 0 was equal to the mean and is considered normal. Negative numbers indicate values lower than the mean and positive numbers indicate values higher than the mean. Negative values are indicative of decrease in BMI (weight loss) and positive values are indicative of increase in BMI.

    <description>The child, adolescent and parent/legal guardian PedsQL™ (Version 4.0) generic core scales was used to measure health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The response information was completed by the participant and by a parent/legal guardian individually. It consisted of 23 item questionnaire encompassing 4 core scale domains: Physical Functioning (8 items); Emotional Functioning (5 items); Social Functioning (5 items); and School Functioning (5 items). Items were scored on a 5 point Likert-type response scale: 0=never a problem to 1=almost never a problem; 2=sometimes a problem; 3=often a problem; and 4=almost always a problem). Once scored, items were reverse scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale (0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0), where higher scores indicated better HRQOL. Total Scale Score was the sum of all the items over the number of items answered on all the Scales.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 2 centers in the United Sates from 25 June 2019 and 16 June 2020. A total of 27 participants were screened, of which 10 participants were enrolled and randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive elafibranor 80 milligrams (mg)/120 mg sequentially. A total of 17 participants failed screening mainly due to not meeting eligibility criteria.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Screening was performed up to 4 weeks before study drug administered. Randomization was stratified by age (Cohort 1: greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 12 to less than or equal to [&lt;=] 17 years of age and Cohort 2: &gt;=8 to &lt;=11 years of age) and participant's historical fibrosis severity stage (stratum 1: fibrosis stage 0 to 1 and stratum 2: fibrosis stage 2 to 3). Due to lack of efficacy study was prematurely terminated, only Cohort 1 participants were involved in this study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Pharmacodynamics - Glucose Homeostasis Markers: Change From Baseline in Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) at Days 15, 29, 57, 85, and 113</title>
        <description>HOMA IR measures insulin resistance based on fasting glucose and insulin measurements: HOMA IR = fasting plasma insulin (micro international units per milliliter [mcIU/mL]) * fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) / 22.5. A higher value indicates a greater insulin resistance. Blood samples were taken after minimum 10 hours of fasting. Baseline was defined as the last measurement before first intake of study treatment on Day 1.</description>

        <title>Pharmacodynamics - Change From Baseline in Body Mass Index (BMI) Z-Score at Days 15, 29, 57, 85, and 113</title>
        <description>The BMI for a given age (in years) and gender (male) was converted to an exact z-score. Given a participant's age, sex, BMI, and an appropriate reference standard, a BMI Z-score was determined. BMI Z-score &gt;=85th percentile was considered as overweight. Z-score was a statistical measure to describe whether a mean was above or below the standard. A Z-score of 0 was equal to the mean and is considered normal. Negative numbers indicate values lower than the mean and positive numbers indicate values higher than the mean. Negative values are indicative of decrease in BMI (weight loss) and positive values are indicative of increase in BMI. Baseline was defined as the last measurement before first intake of study treatment on Day 1.</description>

        <title>Pharmacodynamics - Change From Baseline in Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL™) (Version 4.0) Generic Core Scales at Day 85</title>
        <description>The child, adolescent and parent/legal guardian PedsQL™ (Version 4.0) generic core scales was used to measure health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The response information was completed by the participant and by a parent/legal guardian individually. It consisted of 23 item questionnaire encompassing 4 core scale domains: Physical Functioning (8 items); Emotional Functioning (5 items); Social Functioning (5 items); and School Functioning (5 items). Items were scored on a 5 point Likert-type response scale: 0=never a problem to 1=almost never a problem; 2=sometimes a problem; 3=often a problem; and 4=almost always a problem). Once scored, items were reverse scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale (0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0), where higher scores indicated better HRQOL. Total Scale Score was the sum of all the items over the number of items answered on all the Scales. Baseline was defined as the last measurement before first intake of study treatment on Day 1.</description>

          <title>Pharmacodynamics - Change From Baseline in Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL™) (Version 4.0) Generic Core Scales at Day 85</title>
          <description>The child, adolescent and parent/legal guardian PedsQL™ (Version 4.0) generic core scales was used to measure health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The response information was completed by the participant and by a parent/legal guardian individually. It consisted of 23 item questionnaire encompassing 4 core scale domains: Physical Functioning (8 items); Emotional Functioning (5 items); Social Functioning (5 items); and School Functioning (5 items). Items were scored on a 5 point Likert-type response scale: 0=never a problem to 1=almost never a problem; 2=sometimes a problem; 3=often a problem; and 4=almost always a problem). Once scored, items were reverse scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale (0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0), where higher scores indicated better HRQOL. Total Scale Score was the sum of all the items over the number of items answered on all the Scales. Baseline was defined as the last measurement before first intake of study treatment on Day 1.</description>
          <population>Analysis was performed on ITT population. Here, 'number analyzed' signifies participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure at the specific categories.</population>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical in a participant or clinical investigation patient administered a pharmaceutical (investigational) product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A Serious adverse event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: resulted in death, was life-threatening, required inpatient hospitalization/prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, was another medically important condition. TEAEs were defined as AEs that started prior to first study drug dose and that worsened after, and the AEs that started on or after first study drug dose. TEAEs: Serious and non-serious AEs.</description>

Additional systems were evaluated as needed. Clinical significance was defined as any variation in assessment results that had medical relevance resulting in an alteration in medical care. Participants with at least one clinically significant abnormality in physical examination were reported and presented in this outcome measure.
