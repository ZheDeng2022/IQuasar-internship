  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the commonest chronic degenerative conditions affecting our&#xD;
      aging population. It limits joint movement and causing disability in elderlies due to&#xD;
      discordant symptoms such as pain and stiffness. The prevalence of radiologic knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis increases in proportion to age, reaching an astounding 64.1% for patients whom&#xD;
      are over 60 years of age. In addition the prevalence of symptomatic knee OA has been shown to&#xD;
      be around 10% in people who are 60 years and older.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with end stage OA often adopt a sedentary lifestyle causing mobility and&#xD;
      functionality decline to avoid joint pain and stiffness. This dysfunctions a series of&#xD;
      antioxidant response cascades which eventually leads to muscle atrophy of the knee. Notably,&#xD;
      muscle atrophy and weakness (i.e. sarcopenia) often accompanies with OA. However the&#xD;
      relationship between these symptoms and OA remains undefined and no strong consensus have&#xD;
      been made thus far. Our ongoing longitudinal study on muscle strength and functionality which&#xD;
      investigates the prevalence of sarcopenia in end stage OA patient's pre and post operation&#xD;
      (Total Knee Replacement) have reflected that 24% with severe knee OA patients also suffered&#xD;
      sarcopenia. In addition, these patients also showed a much slower recovery and longer length&#xD;
      of stay in hospital after undergoing surgical operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of clinical sarcopenia affects our locomotion system in the aging population.&#xD;
      Weakness in patients and decline in muscle strength results in significant functional&#xD;
      impairment are often seen in the cohort, leading to fragility, falls, fractures and&#xD;
      disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many authors have tried to explain the pathophysiology of sarcopenia in an attempt to link&#xD;
      the disorder to a molecular or biochemical level in numerous literature. Satellite cells (a&#xD;
      myogenic stem cell), Insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) (an important mediator of muscle&#xD;
      growth and regeneration affecting muscle function) and fast twitch muscle fibres are three&#xD;
      major molecular composites that have been widely studied. Evidence have suggested the close&#xD;
      relationship between them and muscle atrophy and weakness. However, these studies have either&#xD;
      shown the results from an animal standpoint or they lack specificity and further research is&#xD;
      necessary to confirm their role in patients suffering from sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attempts have also been made to discover the most effective intervention to treat or even&#xD;
      eliminate the chances of sarcopenia. Among these studies resistance exercises have been&#xD;
      documented the most.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence showed that progressive resistance and aerobic exercises are most beneficial for the&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of sarcopenia. Resistant training that such as lifting weights,&#xD;
      strength resistance bands, resistance machines has shown to improve protein synthesis in&#xD;
      skeletal muscle cells leading to better muscle strength and mass, leading to muscle&#xD;
      hypertrophy and promotes muscle power. Our previous knowledge transfer study on developing an&#xD;
      aerobic exercise (i.e. Tai Chi Exercise) for end stage OA patients also showed similar&#xD;
      positive effects in subjects, decreasing their pain and stiffness symptoms and limitations in&#xD;
      physical activity. Though resistance exercise showed promising effects, are safe and strongly&#xD;
      advised interventions based on documented and our previous study, the elderly populations&#xD;
      often accompanies with other physical symptoms (such as back pain) and diminished fine motor&#xD;
      skills that may limit their range of movement in these exercise regimes. In addition,&#xD;
      resistive exercises are extremely technical and is essential to execute with proper form to&#xD;
      avoid further injury; hence these exercises are unable to perform safely alone at home,&#xD;
      making the intervention less autonomous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vibration therapy is a noninvasive biophysical modality and has been demonstrated in a number&#xD;
      of studies showing multiple positive effects in terms of postural control, balancing ability,&#xD;
      circulation and most importantly muscle strength. Two of our previous studies investigated&#xD;
      the long term effects on muscle performance and bone quality in using low-magnitude high&#xD;
      frequency vibration. Though the results showed that the treatment is an effective method in&#xD;
      fall prevention by improving on both frontiers, these two studies' main subject focuses were&#xD;
      on the elderly population as a whole. A study pivoting on subjects with co-existing diagnosis&#xD;
      of sarcopenia and OA is crucial to investigate the effectiveness of this therapy method.&#xD;
      Limited studies have shown positive effects of vibration therapy on osteoarthritis, however,&#xD;
      these studies were limited to a single gender (i.e. females) or contained subject recruitment&#xD;
      bias or assessment period of less than 6 months. A randomized control trial with a longer&#xD;
      assessment period is essential to investigate the true effects of vibration therapy on knee&#xD;
      OA patients.&#xD;
