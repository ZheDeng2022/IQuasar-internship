  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The influence of periodontal thickness has been documented in outcome of various periodontal&#xD;
      interventions like non surgical periodontal therapy, mucogingival therapy, guided tissue&#xD;
      regeneration (GTR), crown lengthening and implant dentistry. There is lack of study showing&#xD;
      the influence of gingival biotype on outcome of surgical procedure. The present study is&#xD;
      therefore undertaken to evaluate the influence of gingival biotype on the outcome of open&#xD;
      flap debridement for treatment of chronic periodontitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is inflammation of the periodontal tissues resulting in clinical attachment&#xD;
      loss, alveolar bone loss, and periodontal pocketing. Chronic periodontal disease can be&#xD;
      successfully treated by non-surgical or surgical mechanical therapy provided adequate plaque&#xD;
      control is maintained during the supportive phase of treatment. Elimination of these pockets&#xD;
      by the therapist is necessary to allow the patient better access for plaque control. The goal&#xD;
      of periodontal therapy, therefore, should include the creation of an oral environment in&#xD;
      which the patient can cleanse every surface of every tooth. Ideally, this would be best&#xD;
      accomplished by complete regeneration of the lost attachment apparatus and reestablishment of&#xD;
      a minimal depth of sulcus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is seen that in pockets with shallow probing depths(1-3mm), there is reduction of pocket&#xD;
      depth and loss of attachment by all the treatment modalities and more following surgical&#xD;
      treatment. Lindhe et al. (1982) defined a critical probing depth below which the nonsurgical&#xD;
      therapy is most likely to lead to loss of probing attachment In sites with moderate probing&#xD;
      depth (4-6mm), there is more pocket reduction following MWF than subgingival curettage and&#xD;
      SRP. Attachment gain is seen following all techniques and more following modified widman flap&#xD;
      (MWF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deep pockets(&gt;7mm) have shown reduction in probing depth following all the treatment&#xD;
      modalities but more reduction is seen following MWF. More gain in attachment is seen&#xD;
      following MWF than subgingival curettage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ramfjord observed an increase in pocket depth following periodontal treatment in shallow&#xD;
      pockets. He also found loss of attachment with surgical therapy in moderate probing depth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histological findings in humans have revealed that there is loss of crestal bone as a&#xD;
      consequence of periodontal surgical treatment. The resorption pattern varied with thickness&#xD;
      of connective tissue covering the bone and was modified by injury to bone due to contact or&#xD;
      near contact during instrumentation. Measurement indicated resorption occurs if retained&#xD;
      tissue is 0.45 mm or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The influence of periodontal thickness has been documented in outcome of various periodontal&#xD;
      interventions like non surgical periodontal therapy, mucogingival therapy, GTR, crown&#xD;
      lengthening and implant dentistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that sites with thin gingiva lost attachment while no attachment loss is&#xD;
      seen in sites with thick gingiva following non surgical therapy. Gingival thickness ≥0.8mm is&#xD;
      associated with better root coverage with coronally advanced flap. Less recession is seen&#xD;
      after GTR in sites with gingival thickness &gt;1mm than the sites with &lt;1mm. Thick biotype is&#xD;
      also correlated with greater tissue rebound following surgical crown lengthening. Greater&#xD;
      tissue recession is seen around implant with thin biotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predictability of outcome following surgical procedures is of fundamental importance. Perusal&#xD;
      of the available literature hints towards the need to further explore factors influencing the&#xD;
      outcome of surgical procedures for the management of periodontitis. Periodontal biotype is&#xD;
      one among such important factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is therefore undertaken to evaluate the influence of gingival biotype on&#xD;
      the outcome of open flap debridement for treatment of chronic periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHOD This study will be conducted in Department of Periodontics and Oral&#xD;
      Implantology, Post Graduate Institute of Dental Sciences(PGIDS), Rohtak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION Patients will be screened from outpatient department of Periodontics and&#xD;
      Oral Implantology. The study will be conducted in 36 chronic periodontitis patients who had&#xD;
      undergone phase 1 periodontal therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gingival biotype will be assessed by visibility of the periodontal probe through the gingival&#xD;
      margin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Patient with thin biotype (periodontal probe is visible) Group 2: Patient with thick&#xD;
      biotype (periodontal probe is not visible)&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY Periodontal examination Parameters recorded at baseline (on the day of surgery),&#xD;
      at 3 months and 6 months follow up visit will be Plaque index (Silness and Loe) (PI) ;&#xD;
      Gingival index (Loe and Silness) (GI); Bleeding on probing (BOP); Probing pocket depth (PPD);&#xD;
      Clinical attachment level (CAL) and Gingival recession (REC). Probing pocket depth (PPD),&#xD;
      Clinical attachment level (CAL). BOP will be assessed as a dichotomous measure (bleeding&#xD;
      present or absent) within 15 seconds of probing. PPD will be recorded from gingival margin to&#xD;
      base of pocket, and CAL from cementoenamel junction (CEJ) to base of pocket with university&#xD;
      of North Carolina (UNC) 15 probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Patients meeting eligibility criteria will receive phase1 periodontal therapy&#xD;
      consisting of scaling and root planing (SRP). SRP will be completed with ultrasonic scaler&#xD;
      (EMS Piezon 250 ,Switzerland), hand scaler and curettes (Hu-Friedy) within two visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PERIODONTAL SURGICAL PROCEDURE After healing period of 8 weeks, clinical evaluation will be&#xD;
      repeated and patients presenting atleast 4 residual periodontal pockets measuring ≥4 mm in&#xD;
      maxillary or mandibular anterior segment will be subjected to surgical intervention. The&#xD;
      study procedure will be explained to the patient in their own language. Written informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained from each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modified Widman flap surgery will be performed in both groups as described by Ramfjord and&#xD;
      Nissle.37,38 After meticulous debridement, root planning and thorough irrigation with normal&#xD;
      sterile saline solution, mucoperiosteal flaps will be repositioned and secured by using 3-0&#xD;
      black silk suture. Post operative instructions will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POST OPERATIVE CARE Patients will be given both verbal and written instructions about post&#xD;
      operative care including mouthrinse with 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate solution twice daily&#xD;
      for two weeks. All patient will be prescribed Amoxycillin 500mg thrice daily for 5 days and&#xD;
      Ibuprofen 400 mg thrice daily for two days. Sutures will be removed after 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS A minimum sample size of 18 patients in each group was calculated to be&#xD;
      sufficient to detect a clinically important difference of 1mm gain in clinical attachment&#xD;
      level with standard deviation of 1mm, 80% power of study and alpha level=0.05.To compensate&#xD;
      for the expected dropouts in patient pool overtime, 20 patients will be involved in each&#xD;
      group of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data recorded will be processed by standard statistical analysis. All statistical analysis&#xD;
      will be carried out using statistical software (SPSS, Version 25.0 for Windows, SPSS,&#xD;
      Chicago, IL).The normality of distribution of the data will be assessed using the&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wilk test. . If it is in normal distribution, intra group comparison will be done by&#xD;
      paired T test between two time points and inter group comparison will be done by using&#xD;
      Independent T test between two groups. If it is in non normal distribution, intra group&#xD;
      comparison will be done by Wilcoxon signed rank test and inter group comparison will be done&#xD;
      by Mann-Whitney U test.. Statistical analysis of BOP will be done by McNemar test in&#xD;
      intragroup and Chi-square test for intergroup comparison. Correlation and association between&#xD;
      predictors and dependent variables will be analyzed by correlation analysis and regression&#xD;
      analysis. Statistical significance level will be set at P≤0.05.&#xD;
