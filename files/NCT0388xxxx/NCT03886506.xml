  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase III study of PLX-PAD for CLI patients with minor tissue loss who are unsuitable for&#xD;
      revascularization has been initiated (PLX-CLI-03, PACE study). In parallel, this expanded&#xD;
      access program (EAP) will be conducted to allow the treatment of patients who are ineligible&#xD;
      to be enrolled in the PACE study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EAP treatment is administered in addition to standard of care of the subjects.PLX-PAD&#xD;
      300×106 cells in a mixture containing 10% DMSO, 5% human serum albumin and Plasma-Lyte, will&#xD;
      be administered via 30 IM injections (0.5 mL each) delivered into the leg twice,at 8 weeks&#xD;
      interval. The locations of injections of the PLX-PAD are detailed in Appendix 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antihistamine treatment should be given at least 1 hour and no more than 1.5 hours prior to&#xD;
      PLXPAD administration to ensure coverage for 24 hours, and as long as necessary post PLX-PAD&#xD;
      treatment. Consider treatment with second generation H1 inhibitors such as Cetirizine 10 mg&#xD;
      once per day.Subjects will be followed-up until 12 months after the 2nd treatment according&#xD;
      to the schedule of routine medical visits at the medical institutions. In addition to this&#xD;
      routine follow-up, a phone call will be made 12 months after 2nd treatment to inquire on the&#xD;
      occurrence of subsequent intervention, amputation, or death.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Adult male or female subjects between ages 45 to 99 years of age at the time of&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects with a diagnosis of PAD due to atherosclerosis at the stage of CLI, with&#xD;
             minor tissue loss up to the ankle level (ulcer/s and/or necrosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Ankle pressure (AP)≤70 mmHg or toe pressure (TP)≤ 50 mmHg in the index leg or&#xD;
             transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2)≤ 30 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject unsuitable for revascularization (by any method) in the index leg based on&#xD;
             unfavorable risk-benefit assessment of the physician investigator. Unsuitability to&#xD;
             revascularization should be based on any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Anatomic considerations as: inappropriate target artery, diffuse/extensive tibial&#xD;
                  and/or peroneal artery lesions, inadequate distal run-off.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Technical considerations as: inappropriate bypass conduit, failed recent&#xD;
                  revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Medical considerations: subject's comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Signed informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  administration. In case of osteomyelitis, patients must be treated with&#xD;
                  antibiotics during screening and PLX-PAD administration or as long as there is&#xD;
                  evidence of active infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Subject on renal replacement therapy or with eGFR &lt;15 mL/min.&#xD;
