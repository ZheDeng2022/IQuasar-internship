    <textblock>
      The main purpose is to compare overall alignment time (OAT) in days in alleviating mandibular&#xD;
      incisors crowding between control group and MOPs group.Furthermore, to investigate the&#xD;
      presence of volumetric root resorption from CBCT, gingival recession and formation of black&#xD;
      triangle post lower labial segment alignment between micro-osteoperforations group and&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Prolonged treatment time in orthodontics is an undesirable side effect for both the patient&#xD;
      and clinician. Usually, an average course of comprehensive orthodontic treatment with fixed&#xD;
      appliances requires less than 2 years to complete (19.9 months). This prolonged treatment&#xD;
      time may cause adverse effects such as root resorption, gingival recession, caries &amp; enamel&#xD;
      demineralization. Micro-osteoperforations is safe, minimally invasive technique which&#xD;
      perforations are performed through the gum tissues, penetrating the bone without the need to&#xD;
      raise a ﬂap.Control group will not received any MOP and will receive standard orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The start date of lower labial segment alignment (T1) was recorded after insertion of the lower 0.014'' NiTi archwire. Participants were reviewed every 6 weeks and repeated MOPs were performed for the MOP group until the completion of lower labial segment alignment (LLS), which is when the LII scores one, indicating a minimum irregularity of ≤ 2 mm contact point displacement, based on the contact point displacements of the mandibular anterior segment, from canine to canine. At the end of alignment stage, the date for completion of alignment was recorded (T2), from which the overall alignment time (OAT) in days, required to complete LLS alignment, were calculated. Measurements were done clinically using an electric digital caliper. At this point, perforations were stopped. Gingival recession and black triangle were then recorded and measured. Patients were referred for CBCT images to evaluate for root resorption.</intervention_model_description>
