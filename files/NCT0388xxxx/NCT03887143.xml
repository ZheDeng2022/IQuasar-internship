  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate recanalization treatments use, safety and efficacy&#xD;
      at the acute phase of arterial ischemic stroke in pediatric patients&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arterial ischemic stroke outcomes benefited from the implementation of recanalization&#xD;
      treatments (IV thrombolysis, endovascular treatments) and adapted management pathways in&#xD;
      adult patients. Nevertheless randomized trials did not enroll patients under the age of 18&#xD;
      years old and data concerning these treatments in children are scarce. As it is much less&#xD;
      frequent than in adults, recognition of stroke is often delayed in children. Consequently,&#xD;
      acute phase trials are difficult to set up and perform. The phase I multicentric&#xD;
      international prospective trial TIPS (Thrombolysis in Pediatric Stroke) was prematurely&#xD;
      stopped because of poor enrollment. Published retrospective regional (Paris-Ile-de-France&#xD;
      region, France) and national (Switzerland) studies addressed the feasibility of such&#xD;
      treatments but, because of small samples (less than 20 patients in each study), efficiency&#xD;
      and prognostic factors could not be addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exhaustive retrospective studies in a definite geographic area but with a sufficient number&#xD;
      of patients in a limited inclusion period would provide these crucial data and address these&#xD;
      questions with good relevance and limited bias.&#xD;

All scale ranges : Segmental assessment of the MCA vascular territory is made and 1 point is deducted from the initial score of 10 for every region involved (caudate, putamen, internal capsule, nsular cortex, M1(anterior MCA cortex=frontal operculum), M2(MCA cortex lateral to insular ribbon=anterior temporal lobe), M3(posterior MCA cortex=posterior temporal lobe, M4(anterior MCA territory immediately superior to M1), M5(lateral MCA territory immediately superior to M2), M6(posterior MCA territory immediately superior to M3)&#xD;
For each scale, values better or worse :&#xD;
In adults, an ASPECTS score less than or equal to 7 predicts a worse functional outcome at 3 months as well as symptomatic hemorrhage</description>

In the literature, good outcome is usually considered for patients with mRS [0-2]. Very good outcome is considered for patients with mRS [0-1]. We will use the same thresholds</description>

- The Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure - PSOM (Units on a scale) =scale has been designed and published to quantify functional consequences of stroke in children. The PSOM is a detailed neurological examination, with outcome scored in terms of degree of impairment in each of language, cognition, and sensorimotor. We wil use the PSOM-SNE version (PSOM-Short Neuro Exam version).&#xD;
All scale ranges (0-0,5-1 or 2):&#xD;
- Sensorimotor deficit, Language Deficit - Production, Language Deficit - Comprehension, Cognitive or Behavioural Deficit. Total score on 10&#xD;
For each scale range, values better or worse:&#xD;
Total impairment scores (out of a maximum of 10) will be considered as previously published, i.e. total score 0 or 0.5 representing good outcome, and poor outcome ≥1.&#xD;
All subscales ranges (Normal, Anormal, Not Done):&#xD;
