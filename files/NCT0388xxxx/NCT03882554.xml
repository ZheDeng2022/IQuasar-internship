      - Brief Summary: Prospective, cohort, open-label study. The cohort consists of people who&#xD;
      have a chronic balance dysfunction due to a mild to moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI).&#xD;
      All participants will participate in a 14-week PoNS Treatment protocol - a combination of&#xD;
      symptom specific physical exercises and repeated use of the PoNS device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet the initial screening entrance criteria will be scheduled for a baseline&#xD;
      assessment to evaluate balance and gait. Subjects will then begin the PoNS Treatment program&#xD;
      and re-perform some assessments at 2, 5 and 14 weeks evaluating their functional&#xD;
      improvements.&#xD;

        Criteria for Inclusion/Exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must present with a chronic balance deficit due to mild-to-moderate TBI. However,&#xD;
        other potentially related symptoms, such as gait disturbance, mild to moderate recurrent&#xD;
        headaches, sleep, memory, attention, and cognitive deficits, will be noted on the data&#xD;
        collection form at screening and each subsequent evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria: Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be included in the&#xD;
        study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. At least 18 years of age, inclusive, at the time of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Acceptable results (as determined by the investigator) of a full history and physical&#xD;
             performed or supervised by the investigator at each site. This will include a careful&#xD;
             examination of the tongue and oral cavity for any abnormalities. History should&#xD;
             include the nature and duration of any prior physical therapy program the subject may&#xD;
             have participated in to address the balance and/or gait symptoms of their TBI. Prior&#xD;
             participation in therapy is not a prerequisite for enrollment in the program&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Documentation on the history of a qualifying TBI, mild to moderate in severity. For&#xD;
             reference, the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch (AFHSB) definitions of mild and&#xD;
             moderate TBI will be used. The definitions are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Mild TBI: Confused or disoriented state which lasts less than 24 hours; or loss&#xD;
                  of consciousness for up to 30 minutes, or memory loss lasting less than 24 hours.&#xD;
                  Excludes penetrating TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Moderate TBI: Confused or disoriented state which lasts more than 24 hours;&#xD;
                  and/or loss of consciousness for more than 30 minutes but less than 24 hours, or&#xD;
                  memory loss lasting greater than 24 hours but less than seven days; or meets&#xD;
                  criteria for Mild TBI except an abnormal CT scan is present. Excludes penetrating&#xD;
                  TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
             The investigator will ascertain whether the prior medical records and information&#xD;
             collected during the clinical interview are sufficiently detailed to support the&#xD;
             classification of the TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Acceptable results from within the last three (3) months as determined by the site&#xD;
             investigator of basic standard blood work to include CBC, TSH, HbA1C, Liver and Kidney&#xD;
             panels, and a 12-lead ECG with automated reporting capability. Any abnormal result&#xD;
             that is judged clinically significant by the investigator will be communicated to the&#xD;
             subject and if treated by their personal physician and deemed recovered, the subjects&#xD;
             may be reconsidered for inclusion. If the investigator is uncertain he or she will&#xD;
             communicate with the Sponsor's Medical Officer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. If female, the subject is not pregnant, not breastfeeding and has a negative pregnancy&#xD;
             test prior to receipt of the PoNS device&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Note: Pregnancy testing will be repeated at end-of-study (EOS) (i.e., end of at-home&#xD;
             period).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. If female is of childbearing potential, the subject agrees to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception from screening and throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
             A female of non-childbearing potential is defined as a subject who is postmenopausal&#xD;
             (continuous amenorrhea for 12 months) or surgically sterile (defined as bilateral&#xD;
             tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Balance disorder due to a mild-to-moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI), as indicated&#xD;
             by the Berg Balance Scale with a score no greater than 50.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. At least three (3) months post most recent TBI at the time of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Stable neurologic status, as determined from participant's medical records and the&#xD;
             study physician's opinion based on no new or changing symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Qualifying MRI report to be entered into the data collection form. For all&#xD;
             participants who do not have a qualifying MRI, a new MRI will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Ambulatory and able to walk continuously over-ground or on a treadmill for 20 minutes,&#xD;
             level grade (no inclination) and at any speed, with support, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Able to understand the study procedures and give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Willing and able to adhere to the study schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Willing to complete a neuropsychological evaluation if deemed necessary by the&#xD;
             investigator prior to inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria: Subjects meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded from&#xD;
        the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Medical findings from screening history, physical examination or radiological test&#xD;
             that the investigator deems clinically significant or that would otherwise impact&#xD;
             patient safety or data integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Planned use or use of any investigational product (i.e., not approved by the FDA),&#xD;
             pharmaceutical or device, within 30 days preceding receipt of the PoNS device and&#xD;
             during the entire period of subject participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any previous use of the Portable Neuromodulation Stimulator (PoNS)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Balance or gait deficits due to lower extremity injury or neurological condition other&#xD;
             than TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Severe TBI defined as an injury with a confused or disoriented state which lasts more&#xD;
             than 24 hours; and/or loss of consciousness for more than 24 hours, or memory loss for&#xD;
             more than seven days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Penetrating brain injury, refractory subdural hematoma, or craniotomy unrelated to the&#xD;
             resolution of qualifying traumatic brain injury. Investigator discretion may be&#xD;
             exercised on an individual case where surgery was performed that did not remove or&#xD;
             significantly alter brain tissue (e.g., to treat a brain aneurysm). Surgery must have&#xD;
             been performed at least 6 months prior to screening and a CT scan must be provided to&#xD;
             demonstrate no large residual lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Oral health problems active at the time of recruitment. Any history of oral health&#xD;
             problems (e.g., gum disease or cankers) will be noted on the data collection form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Oral surgery within 3 months of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of oral cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Non-removable metal orthodontic devices (e.g., braces) or oral cavity piercings that&#xD;
             could interfere with PoNS use.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Presence of metallic implant or other MRI-incompatible device.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Known allergy to gold, nickel or copper.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Blood pressure abnormalities considered clinically significant by the study physician.&#xD;
             If the subject has a systolic blood pressure of &lt;100 mmHg, they will be evaluated for&#xD;
             orthostatic hypotension and if the investigator deems this a risk for the subject's&#xD;
             health or safety they will be excluded. If systolic blood pressure &gt;160 mm Hg (average&#xD;
             of 3 measurements) at screening and the subject is on medications, the subject will be&#xD;
             re-evaluated once the treating physician deems them to have stable blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Note: BP should be measured seated, legs uncrossed, after resting for 5 minutes,&#xD;
             with measurements taken 2 minutes apart. If the first two readings differ by &gt;5 mm Hg,&#xD;
             additional measurements should be taken and averaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Use of Coumadin or any other anticoagulant other than aspirin in the last six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Untreated or undiagnosed diabetes - the subject will be referred to their family&#xD;
             physician and may be re-evaluated at a later date. Undiagnosed diabetes is defined as&#xD;
             an HbA1C taken during screening above the upper limit of normal at the study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Diabetic neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Active or recent (within 1 year) treatment for any cancer, excluding basal cell&#xD;
             carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Neurological disorders other than those attributed to the primary diagnosis, (e.g.,&#xD;
             neurodegenerative diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD),&#xD;
             Alzheimer's disease (AD) or other dementia, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. History of epileptic or other seizure disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Known ischemic heart disease (angina, stent, history of myocardial infarction, &gt;70%&#xD;
             stenosis or cardiovascular imaging) and/or history or atrial or ventricular&#xD;
             arrhythmias with or without syncope. Any abnormality on the screening ECG will be&#xD;
             referred to the subject's family physician for evaluation and clearance and then the&#xD;
             subject can be re-evaluated for inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Any other untreated or unstable acute or chronic, clinically significant medical&#xD;
             condition for which the subject is currently undergoing treatment (e.g., autoimmune or&#xD;
             immunodeficient disorders) and that the investigator deems unsuitable for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Use of a lower extremity biomechanical prosthetic with the exception of a splint to&#xD;
             address foot drop.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Chronic use of any potentially interfering drug such as a neuroactive (ototoxic,&#xD;
             anti-seizure, anti-convulsive) medication, or chronic/PRN use of any medication that&#xD;
             would, in the opinion of the investigator, compromise the subject's ability to&#xD;
             function or perform the study activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Addition of and/or major change in type or dosage of any prescription medication&#xD;
             within 3 months prior to receipt of the PoNS device at the time of screening, subject&#xD;
             to physician discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Active alcoholism documented by the investigator at the time of screening. The&#xD;
             investigator will have the right to exclude subject participation if, in their&#xD;
             opinion, the subject seems intoxicated at time of screening and/or during any study&#xD;
             appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. History of drug abuse as documented by the investigator at the time of screening. The&#xD;
             investigator will have the right to exclude subject participation if, in their&#xD;
             opinion, the subject seems intoxicated at time of screening or presentation for&#xD;
             treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
         27. Recent (6 months) history of smokeless tobacco use (i.e., chewing tobacco, oral&#xD;
             tobacco, spit or spitting tobacco, dip, chew, snuff*) (*NCI definition)&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Note: Cigarette, cigar, pipe, and/or e-cigarette use is not exclusionary&#xD;
&#xD;
         28. Any reason, considered by the principal investigator or designee to preclude subject&#xD;
             enrollment in the study that might represent a threat to health, safety, or an&#xD;
             inability to comply with the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         29. Subject is incompatible with the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
         30. Subject is currently in a focused physical rehabilitation program for balance or gait&#xD;
             symptoms resulting from their TBI and has not been deemed by their treating clinician&#xD;
             to have reached a plateau.&#xD;
