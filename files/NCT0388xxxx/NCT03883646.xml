  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over half of state and federal prisoners meet clinical criteria for alcohol abuse or&#xD;
      dependence, and after release from prison, over three-quarters of offenders are re-arrested&#xD;
      within five years. Thus, there is a critical need for more effective interventions that could&#xD;
      help disrupt this insidious cycle of alcohol abuse, criminal behavior, and incarceration.&#xD;
      This project will support the development and evaluation of a mindfulness intervention for&#xD;
      female prison inmates that will target key neuropsychological vulnerabilities that are&#xD;
      associated with relapse and recidivism.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pernicious link between substance abuse and criminal behavior imposes major costs to&#xD;
      society, totaling billions of dollars in the U.S. annually. There is a critical need for more&#xD;
      effective interventions to counteract the high rates of relapse and recidivism in alcohol and&#xD;
      substance abusing criminal offenders. Periods of offender incarceration provide a unique&#xD;
      opportunity to develop and deploy such interventions. Progress in intervention development&#xD;
      could be achieved by targeting specific cognitive and affective vulnerabilities that are&#xD;
      common among substance abusing criminal offenders. Preliminary studies suggest that&#xD;
      meditative or mindfulness interventions may confer significant psychological and behavioral&#xD;
      benefits to inmates. However, the mechanisms and extent of intervention efficacy are unclear,&#xD;
      as these previous studies have been beset by a number of methodological limitations.&#xD;
      Moreover, to date no study has examined the neurobiological mechanisms that relate to&#xD;
      treatment success in this population. NIAAA has recently made a program call to address these&#xD;
      issues (PA-15-299). Here we answer this program call and propose to undertake a rigorous and&#xD;
      comprehensive longitudinal study of mindfulness treatment of alcohol and substance use&#xD;
      disorders among female inmates. This project will randomly assign over 400 female inmates to&#xD;
      a mindfulness or relapse prevention training course, and both will be compared against a no&#xD;
      treatment control. The mindfulness intervention will be tailored to address two key&#xD;
      neuropsychological deficits in alcohol abusing criminal offenders: impulsivity and craving.&#xD;
      We will test hypotheses about the neural changes over time with treatment to elucidate&#xD;
      mechanisms of change. We will obtain estimates of &quot;real-world&quot; efficacy of the intervention&#xD;
      by collecting outcome measures in prison (conduct reports) and following release (alcohol use&#xD;
      relapse and antisocial behavior). This project takes advantage of a unique, longstanding&#xD;
      partnership between the research team and the states of New Mexico and Wisconsin Correction&#xD;
      Departments that allows collection of comprehensive assessment data from inmates during&#xD;
      incarceration, including brain imaging data with a mobile MRI scanner, as well as access to&#xD;
      post-release outcomes and relapse data. Completion of these aims is a critical step for&#xD;
      implementing and evaluating a promising mindfulness intervention for this high-risk&#xD;
      population. The proposed research will also begin to elucidate the psychological and&#xD;
      neurobiological mechanisms of the treatment. These results will thus significantly advance a&#xD;
      program of research seeking to translate the growing knowledge of neuropsychological deficits&#xD;
      into more targeted and effective treatments for alcohol and substance abuse problems in&#xD;
      criminal offenders.&#xD;
