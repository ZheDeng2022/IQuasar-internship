  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CBSM is a program combining cognitive and behavioral therapies, relaxation provided in&#xD;
      groups of 8 to 10 patients. This program has demonstrated benefits in stress management&#xD;
      skills, adaptive strategies, anxiety, quality of life, social inclusion, medication&#xD;
      adherence, depression, therapeutic alliance, and general well-being. It would also improve&#xD;
      breast cancer survival after adjuvant therapy. This program has been put in place at the&#xD;
      center of pain for patients with cancer pain in any stage. This study aims to evaluate the&#xD;
      benefits of this technique on a patient population suffering from chronic pain related to&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      Methodology: Observational study, prospective, open, mono-centric, comparative, evaluating a&#xD;
      psychosocial intervention type CBSM versus no intervention (group &quot;waiting list&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Objective: To evaluate the impact of the implementation of a &quot;CBSM&quot; program on the&#xD;
      stress management capacities of a pilot group of 30 patients followed at the pain center of&#xD;
      Grenoble-Alpes University Hospital for chronic pain related to cancer or its treatment,&#xD;
      compared to a control group &quot;waiting list&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome: Measurement of emotional stress (PSS14)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine patients' interest in this program and the feasibility of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine patient satisfaction with this program To evaluate the impact of the program on the&#xD;
      quality of life of patients. To evaluate the impact of the program on the handicap perceived&#xD;
      by the patients in connection with their pains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the impact of the program on the pain of the patients (on the daily behavior).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the impact of the program on depression and anxiety. Determine the impact of&#xD;
      the 3-month program of the 9th session on the different dimensions described above&#xD;
