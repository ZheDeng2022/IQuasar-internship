      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For people who have Niemann-Pick disease, type C1 (NPC1), cholesterol and other fats have&#xD;
      trouble moving out of liver and other tissue cells. This makes the cells sick. Researchers&#xD;
      want to find out if a drug called VTS-270 can help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if VTS-270 is safe and effective in treating chronic liver disease associated with&#xD;
      NPC1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 3-60 with NPC1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be screened by phone or under another protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have visits once a month for 12 months. If they have intrathecal&#xD;
      injections, the study may last 15 months or more. The first visit will last about 5 days.&#xD;
      Others will last 2-3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get VTS-270 injected into a vein at each visit. They can also choose to&#xD;
      have intrathecal injections. These are like spinal taps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some visits will also include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests. A small tube or needle will be inserted into the participants vein to collect&#xD;
      blood. The small tube will also be used to give the VTS-270.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hearing tests: For one test, participants will have electrodes taped to their head. These&#xD;
      will record brain waves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breathing tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound of abdomen: Sounds waves will take pictures of the participant s body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest x-ray: This is a picture of the lungs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a lethal, autosomal recessive, lysosomal storage&#xD;
      disorder characterized by neurodegeneration in early childhood and death in adolescence. NPC&#xD;
      results from mutation of either the NPC1 (approximately 95% of cases) or NPC2 genes.&#xD;
      Biochemically, NPC is characterized by the endolysosomal storage of unesterified cholesterol&#xD;
      and lipids in both the central nervous system and peripheral tissues such as the liver.&#xD;
      Individuals with NPC demonstrate progressive cerebellar ataxia and dementia. Acute&#xD;
      cholestatic liver disease is frequently observed in the neonatal/infantile period but&#xD;
      subsequently resolves. However, chronic, sub-clinical liver disease persists. Intrathecal&#xD;
      2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPbetaCD, VTS-270) has proven effective in reducing signs&#xD;
      and prolonging life in NPC1 animal models, and Phase 1/2a data support efficacy in NPC1&#xD;
      patients. Parenteral administration of VTS-270 has also been shown to be effective in&#xD;
      treating liver disease in the NPC1 cat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this Phase 1/2a, open-label, randomized, parallel dose, single-center study, we will&#xD;
      examine whether VTS-270 can be used to treat chronic subacute liver disease in NPC1 patients.&#xD;
      Our primary objective is to determine the safety and tolerability of intravenous VTS-270 in&#xD;
      NPC1 disease. Secondary objectives will be to evaluate the efficacy of VTS-270 to reduce&#xD;
      plasma cholestane-3beta,5alpha,6beta-triol, an NPC1-specific pharmacodynamic biomarker, and&#xD;
      to normalize the degree of liver injury. Exploratory testing will include lipid and protein&#xD;
      biomarkers. This study will evaluate three dose levels (500, 1000 and 1500 mg/kg)&#xD;
      administered monthly for twelve months. Safety will be assessed by adverse event recording,&#xD;
      clinical laboratory testing and physical examination. Clinical efficacy will be evaluated by&#xD;
      assessment of liver chemistries, determination of liver size; and liver STIFFNESS.&#xD;
      Biochemical efficacy will be assessed by measurement of plasma&#xD;
      cholestane-3beta,5alpha,6beta-triol and other biomarkers.&#xD;

          1. Age greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 60 years old at time of&#xD;
             enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosis of NPC1 based upon one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             A. Two NPC1 mutations&#xD;
&#xD;
             B. Biochemical Positive for NPC (oxysterol/bile acid and sphingomyelinase levels&#xD;
             consistent with a diagnosis of NPC) and one NPC1 mutation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NPC1 mutations will be interpreted using standards established for the&#xD;
                  interpretation of sequence variants [33].&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Oxysterol/Bile Acid testing refers to cholestane-3beta,5 ,6beta-triol [7, 8] or&#xD;
                  3beta,5alpha,6beta-trihydroxycholanic acid and its glycine conjugate [34].&#xD;

        age-appropriate upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
        ii. Plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST) greater than or equal to 1.25-times&#xD;
        age-appropriate upper limit of normal and plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;&#xD;
