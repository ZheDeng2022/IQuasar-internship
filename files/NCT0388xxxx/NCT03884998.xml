    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies best dose and how well copanlisib when given together with&#xD;
      nivolumab works in treating participants with Richter's transformation or transformed&#xD;
      indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Copanlisib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking&#xD;
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may&#xD;
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving copanlisib and nivolumab&#xD;
      may work better in treating participants with Richter's transformation or transformed&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of copanlisib administered in combination&#xD;
      with nivolumab in patients with transformed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/non-Hodgkin's&#xD;
      lymphoma (NHL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of copanlisib administered in combination with&#xD;
      nivolumab in patients with transformed CLL/NHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the T-cell repertoire and activation patterns following dual targeting of PI3K&#xD;
      and PD-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To establish if PD-1/PD-L 1 expression correlates with response to the combination of&#xD;
      copanlisib and nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of copanlisib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive copanlisib intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and&#xD;
      nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days for 12 courses in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 3 months for 1 year&#xD;
      and then every 4-6 months thereafter.&#xD;

          -  Females who are pregnant or nursing. Pregnant individuals are excluded from this study&#xD;
             because copanlisib and nivolumab have the potential to cause fetal harm based on&#xD;
             relevant animal studies (Refer to the appropriate prescribing information). Because&#xD;
             there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants,&#xD;
             breast-/chest-feeding should be discontinued prior to treatment with copanlisib and&#xD;
             nivolumab.&#xD;
