      Evaluate the disease activity guided tapering and discontinuation strategies of etanercept&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), a subset of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), is a chronic&#xD;
      inflammatory disorder characterized by inflammatory back pain and predominant involvement of&#xD;
      sacroiliac joints and spine, leading to bony fusion of vertebrae and eventually disability in&#xD;
      some patients. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recognized as a first-line&#xD;
      therapy for AS, but the overall response rates to NSAIDs are considerably unsatisfactory.&#xD;
      With the advent of biologics, the outcomes of AS patients have been greatly improved.&#xD;
      Biologics including tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) inhibitors (TNFi) have been included in&#xD;
      many recommendations for the treatment of AS. Etanercept, a recombinant human TNFα receptor,&#xD;
      is capable of binding to TNFα and blocking its biological activities. It is effective in&#xD;
      relieving symptoms, improving physical function, and reducing disease activity in patients&#xD;
      with AS, and generally no severe adverse effects have been reported. However, the high&#xD;
      expense of biologics restricts their long-term use, which urges a viable strategy to reduce&#xD;
      the dosage of biologics while maintaining an optimal therapeutic efficacy. To investigate the&#xD;
      stepwise tapering and discontinuation of TNFi based on disease activity in patients with AS,&#xD;
      a 48-week, prospective, randomized, multicentric study was conducted. An etanercept&#xD;
      biosimilar, rhTNFR:Fc (recombinant TNF receptor: Fc fusion protein, Yisaipu), which is one of&#xD;
      the most widely used biosimilars in China, was used in this study.&#xD;
